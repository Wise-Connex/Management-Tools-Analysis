      "abstract": "<p>This is a multidisciplinary study on operationalizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in humanitarian operations through supply chain management methods. It is motivated by the belief that for SDGs to be pursued in humanitarian operations, they need to be contextualized in the idiosyncratic settings and approached systematically. Towards this end, this paper develops and operationalizes a strategic sustainable humanitarian supply chain framework using the design science approach. The study starts with analyzing the humanitarian operations characteristics and identifying the critical supply chain capabilities required for sustainable operations. It then re-conceptualizes sustainability in the humanitarian context and proposes a formula of sustainability performance in humanitarian operations. After that, the humanitarian supply chain structural components are delineated and decomposed into operational elements in order to identify the configurations that lead to optimal sustainability performance. The findings then converge into a framework to enable the identification of context-contingent sustainable supply chain strategies in humanitarian operations. This paper makes three contributions to SDG research: 1) it contextualizes sustainability in the humanitarian setting through postulating the concept and formula of net sustainability value as the single bottom line in humanitarian operations; 2) it increases operationality of SDGs in the humanitarian sector through the design of a strategic framework for sustainable humanitarian supply chains; and 3) it increases the interdisciplinarity of SDG research by using a generic supply chain framework that can be applied to integrate multilevel multidisciplinary sustainability studies.</p>"

The study findings also revealed that 33.9% of critical risks were mainly (equally) related to economic and technical aspects of supply chain sustainability in telecommunication networks. Moreover, as a newly-introduced sixth dimension, IT represented 10.17% of critical risks threatening supply chain sustainability in such networks. Critical risks are mainly related to the economic and technical aspects (equally) with the sustainability of the telecommunication networks supply chain. Also, as a new finding and the sixth dimension, 10.17% of the critical risks that threaten the sustainability of the telecommunication networks supply chain have the information technology dimension.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The internet and fixed and mobile data services are provided by several private companies in Iran, which are relatively similar in terms of their supply chains. In order to manage the sustainability of Iran's telecommunication supply chain, telecommunication networks affiliated to Iran Telecommunication Company (ITC), operating in the field of data and internet services and fixed telephone were selected in 31 provinces. The intended networks were also providing an important part of the country's needs including Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, a subsidiary of Iran's telecommunication networks, as one of the top companies in this industry. Accordingly, all the networks studied in this study needed to be identified with regard to communication sustainability risks, since they provide management solutions to each other by segregating risks. In this study, 68 managers and 72 experts participated in different work teams of telecommunication networks.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The trending outsourcing of product support to contracted logistics support and its potential long-term consequences to the USAF government-owned, government-operated, organic supply chain and the reconstitution capabilities it enables in the USAF’s organic industrial base, suggests the need to assess its risks. Although there is an existing body of research into the risks of outsourcing the USAF’s industrial repair, and federal legislation such as Core 50/50 laws enacted to institutionalize its risk management, there is comparatively little research into the outsourcing risks to the long-term viability of the supply chain on which that repair capability is dependent.

Despite widely publicized factory safety failures, reactionary regulatory efforts remain inadequate. This situation is commonly attributed to unyielding downward price pressure imposed on factories by Western brands. To address this problem, this research develops a comprehensive cost model for low‐cost apparel production following a total cost of ownership approach. Comprehensive production data for cotton T‐shirts from nine Bangladeshi factories provide the basis for model construction. The model reveals that materials generate the bulk of production costs (77%) for a T‐shirt, in contrast to worker wages which generate only 2 percent of the total production cost per unit (e.g., 16 cents out of a $8USD retail price). The TCO provides fundamental insights, grounded in real data, to guide policy and regulation among stakeholders in high‐risk, low‐cost supply chains. Based on the research context, results are considered through the lens of agency theory to provide managerial implications for relevant stakeholders.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>From an interdisciplinary theoretical perspective, this study uncovers how and to what extent building supply chain relations impacts supply chain transparency in an industrial context characterized by mistrust, complexity and privacy. By conducting a case study involving a multinational fashion group and an influential NGO, this study investigates how a fashion group forms supply chain relations that eventually influence their transparency performance. The fashion group under investigation initially started disclosing information about their supply chain actions in order to ensure legitimacy and protect the brand image. Nevertheless, the group started sharing more information about their supply chains, changing the perspective from a legitimacy driven reactive approach toward an ethics driven proactive approach. Particularly, supplier engagement, commitment and leadership appear to be antecedents to supply chain transparency. The study also reveals the novel influence of NGOs on supply chain transparency. Fashion Revolution has been substantial to drive fashion companies to obtain and disclose information about their supply chains. Supply chain visibility and stronger partnerships are required to overcome problems relating to supply chain complexity on the way toward transparency. Results suggest that supply chain engagement is fundamental for supply chain transparency, and that NGOs play a pivotal role to enhance transparency through knowledge sharing and awareness increasing. The results provide numerous implications that can help industrial practice and research improve the status quo.</jats:p>"

In this context, the decentralized and cooperative decision models for HWC supply chain under the benchmark scenario without WSS, and the decentralized, hybrid and cooperative decision models for the three-tier WSS supply chain under the scenario with WSS are developed and analyzed, the corresponding numerical and sensitivity analyses for all models are conducted and compared, and finally, the managerial insights are summarized. The research results indicate that: (1) introducing WSS could effectively increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus for the HWC supply chain; (2) a cooperative strategy could effectively increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus and is the best strategy for the three-tier WSS supply chain; (3) the hybrid strategy (partial cooperative strategy) could effectively increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus and is the second-best strategy for the three-tier WSS supply chain; (4) reducing the costs of water saving could effectively enhance water consumption reduction, increase the profits, social welfare and consumer surplus for the three-tier WSS supply chain.</jats:p>",

The use of bibliometric methodology and the focus given to relationships among topics categorized into thematic clusters within the field are the features which differ the study from other reviews in the research field. The operational objectives of the study are as follows: (1) to profile the development of the SSCM research field and its scientific output, (2) to identify leading thematic areas in the field and explore their composition and relationships among them, (3) to identify ‘hot’, emerging topics in the field. The analysis of change in the number of publications and citations related to the SSCM concept supports the study of research productivity in the field. General publication profiling focuses on the identification of subject areas and leading contributors to the research field, i.e., countries, research institutions, source titles and authors. Keywords co-occurrence analysis is employed to identify and explore leading and emerging topics. The study points out that the main thematic areas in the SSCM research field are: (1) economy and management in the context of the environment, (2) supply chain in the context of sustainability, (3) sustainable supply chains—process approach, (4) decision making for SSCM, (5) the practice context of supply-chain management, and (6) competition and social responsibility (SR) issues. The most up-to-date topics of scientific inquiry in the field focus around the following issues: (1) human aspects, (2) sustainable supplier selection, (3) manufacturing, (4) circular economy, (5) efficiency, (6) sustainable practices, (7) commerce, (8) costs, (9) environmental impact, and (10) the textile industry.</jats:p>"

Research has provided many predictive models for the formation of DBPs based on various water quality parameters and following different methodologies. The present study aims at developing predictive models for the formation of DBPs in two drinking water supply systems in Greece. Data from the water supply systems are used. A statistical analysis took place to identify the predictive models for the formation of Total trihalomethanes (TTHMs). The results showed that some of the developed models are more reliable than others. However, further study is necessary in order to obtain more data on variables that are affecting trihalomethanes (THMs) formation. Such models can be used mainly locally.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the present study aimed to synthesize and summarize research trends in the supply chain resilience domain using network analysis. The Scopus database and Google Scholar were used to search for research articles on supply chain resilience. We conducted an analysis by visually representing coauthorship, cocitation, PageRank, and keyword networks for 825 research articles and 1725 authors.

The concept of financial inclusion emerged globally in the times of millennium and is defined as the availability and usage of formal financial services. It essentially facilitates economic growth; the financially included individuals can invest in business, education, and entrepreneurship, which can pave way to poverty alleviation and economic development. In the context of Pakistan, a developing economy of South Asia, the financial landscape presents a grim picture of financial inclusion where only 16 percent of the population is financially included. Despite the current focus of policies and regulations devoted to enhancing access to finance in Pakistan from the supply side, the current state of financial inclusion is limited. Therefore, this study investigates the financial inclusion process for Pakistan from the supply side. We analyze the supply-side dimension of access by employing econometric technique of autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) and using time series data of banking sector of Pakistan. Our empirical findings suggest that the greater the size, geographic outreach, and demographic outreach of the banks, the greater the contribution to the financial inclusion. Additionally, improvement in soft consumer loans and increase in small-sized advances reinforces the financial inclusion process.</jats:p>"

The modelled system is a combination of three treatment stages: filtration by geotextile fabric followed by filtration and disinfection by silver-coated ceramic granular media (SCCGM) then granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. The presented models accounted for removal mechanisms by each treatment stage. E.coli was modelled as a microbial particle. E.coli inactivation by SCCGM was modelled using the Chick's, Chick-Watson, Collins-Selleck and complete mix system bacterial inactivation kinetic models, which were considered adequately representative for describing the removal. Geotextile removal was modelled using colloidal filtration theory (CFT) for hydrosol deposition in fibrous media. The filtration removal contributions by the SCCGM and GAC were modelled using CFT for removal of colloidal particles by granular media. The model results showed that inactivation by silver in the SCCGM was the main bacterial removal mechanism. Geotextile and GAC also depicted appreciable removals. The theoretical modelling approach used is important for design and optimization of the multi-barrier system and can support future research in terms of material combinations, system costs, etc. Collector diameter, particle size, filtration velocity and contact time were identified as critical parameters for E.coli removal efficiency.</jats:p>"

However, the actual amount of wastewater that may be reused depends on many factors such as water demand, availability, cost and social acceptability, etc. In this study, a linear programming model has been developed to identify the amount of treated wastewater that may be used for various applications subject to water availability and demand constraints, taking Delhi city as a case study. The results suggest that wastewater reuse has the maximum potential in agriculture and landscape irrigation use followed by domestic and industrial applications. The framework developed in the study provides useful information for integrated planning and management of the reuse of wastewater in order to augment the existing water supply. It may be modified and used for the estimation of wastewater reuse potential in other areas with similar conditions.</jats:p>",

A systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted to assess vegetable consumption and supply in adult populations and to compare these data to the existing recommendations (≥240 g/day according to World Health Organization). For vegetable intake data online, websites of government institutions and health authorities, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) and Pubmed/Medline databases were searched from March 2018 to June 2019. Vegetable supply data was extracted from Food Balance Sheets, Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT), 2013. Vegetable intake was expressed as means and 95% confidence intervals. Data were summarized for each region by calculating weighted means. Vegetable intake and supply data were available for 162 and 136 countries, respectively. Weighted mean vegetable intake was 186 g/day (56–349 g/day). Weighted mean vegetable supply was 431 g/day (71–882 g/day). For 88% of the countries vegetable intake was below the recommendations. Public health campaigns are required to encourage vegetable consumption worldwide. In the 61% of the countries where vegetable supply is currently insufficient to meet the recommendations, innovative food system approaches to improve yields and decrease post-harvest losses are imperative.</jats:p>"

This process is carried out to speed up the evaporation process of water. The evaporation process carried out on freshwater aims to separate the minerals and solids dissolved in water to increase its purity. In this study, the flashing process was carried out through a rotating nozzle that was proven to increase the rate of pure water production. The flashing process experiment is carried out following an experimental design based on the non-dimensional analysis of Buckingham's pi. The rate of pure water production () as the output variable in the flashing process is affected by the nozzle rotational speed (n), nozzle hole diameter (d), feedwater pressure (Pw), vacuum pressure (Pv) and feedwater temperature (T). The feedwater temperature itself can influence the behavior of the feedwater flow in the nozzle, in this case, is density (ρ) and viscosity (μ). Based on these variables, the non-dimensional analysis of Buckingham pi has produced four dimensionless numbers. The generated empirical equations from the flashing process experiments are in the form of quadratic equations. The empirical equation applies to feedwater pressure of 7.6 bar-g, the vacuum pressure of 0.4–0.6 bar-a and nozzle rotational speed of 0–134 rpm. The optimum condensation rate in the flashing experiment was successfully obtained, especially at the nozzle rotation of 27 rpm in all vacuum pressures tested. This success is inseparable from the use of mist-nozzles that convert the feedwater flow into the mist.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain traceability is one of the most important problems faced by all organizations globally. Tracking any commodity is a tedious job and requires a lot of manual attention. The existing system uses a centralised database system to track a commodity. Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger managed by a cluster of computers. The very nature of blockchain makes it suitable technology for traceability in a supply chain. Blockchain creates immutable records. Once a transaction is stored in the blockchain, it is impossible to tamper it illegally. This immutability of blockchain builds trust among the participants that conduct business in a lack of trust environment. Using consensus protocols, blockchain builds trust between the various participants. Blockchain provides traceability since immutable records are added in blockchain; it is easy to track the source of the product. This paper illustrates the Application of Blockchain in Agri-Food Supply Chain. It unfolds how blockchain technology can be integrated to an Agri Supply Chain and improves the traceability. This integration enables companies to quickly track unsafe products back to their source and see where else they have been distributed. This integration can result to prevent illness and save lives, as well as reduce the cost of product recalls.</jats:p>"

An exploratory and descriptive method technique was adopted. The empirical study comprised of email surveys administered to 398 supply chain managers employed by South African 3PLs. The findings reveal that respondents place greater importance on risk identification than on the other SCRM strategies. Risk assessment attained the lowest rating, implying that 3PL providers placed the least importance on this risk assessment strategy. Risk response and risk monitoring, reporting and control are all adopted to a significantly lesser extent. The findings also revealed that 3PL providers derive significant benefits from all SCRM strategies. A limitation of this study is that not all 3PL providers affiliated with SAAFF participated. In addition, because only members of senior management were included in the study, the opinions of operational and tactical staff were not obtained. The study contributes to the current body of knowledge on SCRM by exploring how 3PL providers in a developing country, such as South Africa, assess supply chain risks, the strategies they have in place to respond to these risks, and the mechanisms in place to monitor and control SCM risks. </jats:p>"

Water from Lake Bolmen, in southern Sweden, had in 2017 an annual average NOM and color content of 8.6 mg/L total organic carbon (TOC) and 57 mg Pt/L respectively, and values ranging from 7.8 to 9.6 mg/L TOC and 50–70 mg Pt/L. Since water from Lake Bolmen will be used at Vomb Water Works, an artificial groundwater recharge plant, the high NOM-content of Lake Bolmen must be reduced prior to aquifer recharge. From experiences of full-scale operations of chemical flocculation, lamella sedimentation and rapid sand filtration using ferric chloride, three different pre-treatment methods were proposed; conventional precipitation, stand-alone direct precipitation before ultrafiltration (UF), and conventional precipitation with ultrafiltration after lamella sedimentation. In this study, a hollow fiber membrane (MWCO of 150 kDa) was used in different configurations during a 15 months pilot trial. The results showed the possibility to reduce NOM equal to conventional precipitation when a stable net-flux of 40 and 70 L/(m2· h) was used for direct precipitation before UF and conventional precipitation with UF, respectively. This paper presents these treatment methods and evaluates their viability as full-scale treatment steps.</jats:p>",

The research methods employed in this study include model establishment, numerical analysis and comparison under three entrustment modes based on retailers’ negotiation strength. In addition, sensitivity analysis was used to test the influence of parameter variations on the results. The research results show that: (i) the direct OEM mode is the best choice for retailers when the retailer is in a weak position, but it is not the best choice for the manufacturer. With the increase of the retailers’ negotiation strength, the profits of both sides will decline, causing the problem of double marginal profit decreasing; (ii) the retailer’s full participation mode is the best choice for the manufacturer when the retailer is in a strong position, but not the best choice for the retailer. It is not the best choice for both sides when the retailer is in a weak position; (iii) the greenness and total profit of the supply chain are no relative with the negotiation strength of the retailer under the partial participation mode, and the greenness and total profit of the supply chain are the same as the condition under the integrated control to achieve the best coordination effect.</jats:p>"

Eleven variables including nutrients, salts and total parameters were selected as index components. Threshold values were assigned to seven water-quality classes as defined by the legislation and were used to develop mathematical equations to convert observed values to index scores. Depending on the ecological importance of the parameters, weights were assigned to each variable and then a weighted sum method was performed to aggregate sub-indices. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in two basins located in Turkey. Factor analysis was applied to optimize the index component selection process. Several alternatives were tested to comprise at least one variable from each defined factor class (e.g. salinity content) to calculate an index score representing ecological status. Results showed that there were slight differences between index scores of the various tested alternatives. These differences did not cause misclassification of surface waters. The study showed that the EWQI method combined with factor analysis could be a practical and efficient way to represent the ecological status of surface waters.</jats:p>",

Although the risk assessment is decisive for expressing economic convenience judgements on these project initiatives, the decision-maker does not have precise references to determine whether the residual investment risk is acceptable. Thus, the purpose of the paper is to overcome the limit set by characterizing a model for the acceptability of project risk, also considering the plurality of environmental effects that the water projects generate on the community. The idea is to integrate the logic ‘As Low As Reasonably Practicable’ (ALARP) into the procedural schemes of Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA). In accordance with this principle, widely applied in high-risk sectors such as those of industrial engineering, a risk is ALARP when the costs to further reduce it are disproportionate to the obtainable benefits. The application of the model to an irrigation reconversion intervention in a Municipality in the Province of Salerno (Italy) shows that the ALARP logic defines a general way of thinking and can contribute to the definition of effective forecasting protocols. In this sense, the proposed methodology becomes a useful support for environmental decision-making. (The paper is to be attributed in equal parts to the three authors.)</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Medical tourism service requires involvement of multiple parties from the service network, however medical tourism is not well studied from a supply chain management perspective. This study suggests a conceptual model of medical tourism service supply chain (MTSSC) to provide a clearer understanding of its nature, and defines its business processes.Design/methodology/approach: Triangulation which makes use of literature review, in-depth interviews, and expert evaluations was applied to develop and validate the suggested model. The proposed model is initialized based on the relevant literature. In-depth interviews were used to refine and finalize the model. Expert evaluations ensure the trustworthiness of the model and the business process definitions.Findings: The proposed model uses a nested process structure rather than a one-dimensional supply chain model, where the assistance company maintains an intermediary role between the patient and all the service providers (e.g. medical institutions, transportation, accommodation). Additionally, the conceptual model identifies seven business processes: service design, service recovery management, customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, demand management, capacity and resource management, and service delivery management.Practical implications: The results provide a better understanding of the MTSSC structure and processes, and a recognition of the MTSSC members. The process definitions give the members an idea about their roles in the service design and delivery in practice. Additionally, a better understanding of the system as a whole leads to better process development and control. MTSSC members may shape their organizations internally and supply chain-wide by considering this conceptual model. Moreover, the model acts as a basis for supply chain collaboration decisions.Originality/value: The conceptual model is built upon the theories and practice of medical tourism services, supply chain management, and service operations management. This study contributes to the theory of medical tourism services management by explaining the MTSSC concepts and business processes, and extends existing knowledge.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the study was to examine the extent to which monetary policy affect private sector funding in Nigeria. Time series data was sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin from 1985-2018. Credit to private sector, credit to core private sector and credit to small and medium scale enterprises sector was used as dependent variables while narrow money supply, broad money supply, large money supply, private sector demand deposit was used as independent variables. Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Augmented Dickey Fuller Test, Johansen Co-integration test, normalized co-integrating equations, parsimonious vector error correction model and pair-wise causality tests were used to conduct the investigations and analysis. The empirical findings revealed that money supply explains 82.1 percent variation on credit to core private sector, 85.2 percent and 23.4 percent of the variation in credit to private sector and credit to small and medium scale enterprises sector. The study conclude that money supply has significant relationship with credit to private sector, credit to core private sector and credit to small and medium scale enterprises sector. From the findings, the study recommends that Central Bank of Nigeria should induce the variations of the amount of money changes through the nominal interest rates. That the monetary authorities should ensure adequate quantity of money supply that positively affect private sector funding in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

In such technology-intensive supply chains, the technology invented by an upstream firm must be embedded in a subsystem that is then integrated into a full system. The technology providers’ prevalent royalty-driven business model has gotten complicated in this multilateral supply chain, prompting formal research attention. Moreover, providers also consider forward integration into manufacturing to monetize their intellectual property. We characterize the appropriateness of different business model decisions for markets, which may have varying levels of consumer diversity and competitive intensity at intermediate layers. For the technology provider, our key results show that a subsystem base royalty approach is the optimal business model when dealing with monopolistic intermediaries or having a low degree of consumer diversity. However, a full-system base royalty business model becomes increasingly optimal when the intermediate supply chains face competition and consumer diversity increases. We present conditions under which the technology provider may want to forward integrate. Our formulation and results are relevant to technology providers, policy makers, and industry groups engaged in the prevailing heated global discussion on royalty base. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

Hence, to alleviate power shortages caused by power transmission failures while the uninterruptible power supplies installed in the railway stations are not available, this paper suggests an innovative traction drive topology which is equipped by an onboard hybrid energy storage system for railway vehicles. Besides, to limit currents magnitudes and voltages variations of the feeder during train acceleration and to recuperate braking energy during train deceleration, an energy management strategy is presented. Moreover, a new optimal model predictive method is developed to control the currents of converters and storages as well as the speeds of the two open-end-windings permanent-magnet-synchronous-machines in the intended modular drive, under their constraints. Although to improve control dynamic performance, the control laws are designed as a set of piecewise affine functions from the control signals based on an offline procedure, the controller can still withstand real-time non-measurable disturbances. The effectiveness of proposed multifunctional propulsion topology and the feasibility of the designed controller are demonstrated by simulation and experimental results.</jats:p>"

Applying a novel nexus approach, an interactive multi-period planning model is developed to highlight synergies and to identify conflicts of planning both energy and water sectors at the same time as endogenous subsystems of one overall system. For studying these synergies in this study, the pace of technology deployment and the path of decline in overall costs are assumed to be a function of experience and knowledge as two-factor learning curves. Using data from 81 projects, the levelized cost and capacity factor of utility-scale photovoltaic and wind supplies in the Middle East were calculated. The results indicate that a scenario with a decentralized water sector and renewable-powered multiple-effect distillation technology has the best overall performance among the proposed scenarios.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this research is to identify risks and identify the causes of risk and determine the right strategy to deal with the causes of risk in supply chain activities at PT. MBA. The method used is the House of Risk (HOR) by using five indicators in the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) model, that is plan, source, manufacture, distribution and return. Risk events are identified and considered priorities, that is delays in receiving raw materials from suppliers, implementation of production not on schedule, no production process activities, unable to meet all requests, decreasing product quality during the process, product quality not in accordance with existing standards and delays product delivery (finished fertilizer) to PT. PKG. The priority risk agent is a risk agent to check inaccurate raw materials. Meanwhile, the handling strategy that is a priority to be implemented, with the hope of being able to prevent the causes of risk is coordination, stock strategy and flexible supply base.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasingly dynamic and volatile market environment has elevated the importance of handling operational risks in supply chain networks. Also, black swan risks are constantly evolving and can strike from almost anywhere, including natural disaster, cyber risk, or viruses. As more companies are outsourcing their logistics to third-party logistics (3PL), at the same time, supply chain risks and uncertainties are also shifted to 3PLs. A 3PL’s supply chain network capability to assure continuity can be expressed in terms of resilience, i.e., the ability of sensing and responding to disturbances or threats. Operations research/management science (OR/MS) methods have been widely applied in supply chain management. The objective of this paper is to look into research regarding the development of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs through the utilization of OR/MS methods. After extensive literature review, a so called pro-silience framework is developed aiming at improving resilience from a 3PL perspective maintaining or increasing its competitive advantage during and after major disruptions, yet also maintain competitiveness under normal operating conditions. Additionally, the framework offers insights into topics for future research.</jats:p>"

Based on dimensional analysis, dimensionless geometric parameters – ratio of width of consecutive steps (Wi/Wi+1) and ratio of perforation diameter to bottom-most radius (d/Rb) and dimensionless dynamic parameters – Froude (Fr) and Reynolds (Re) number were proposed. Initially, aeration experiments were conducted to optimize the geometric parameters, keeping the dynamic parameters constant. Keeping the optimized values of Wi/Wi+1 = 1.05 and d/Rb = 0.0027 as constants, aeration experiments were further conducted at different discharges (Q) and different bottommost radius (Rb) to study the characteristics of oxygen transfer and power consumption of PPCSC aerator at different dynamic conditions. Based on the optimized results, four prototype PPCSC aerators with Rb = 0.75 m, 0.90 m, 1.05 m and 1.20 m were fabricated for their aeration performances. The results showed that the standard aeration efficiency (SAE) values of the prototype PPCSC aerators based on brake power ranged between 3.36 and 4.98 kg O2/kWh, with the average being 4.45 ± 0.741 kg O2/kWh. This shows that the SAE of the PPCSC aerator is many more folds higher than that of the other available cascade aerators, viz., PCSC (SAE: 2.873 ± 0.342 kg O2/kWh) and CSC (2.470 ± 0.256 kg O2/kWh) aerators. The study clearly indicates that this PPCSC aerator may very well be used as pre-aeration or post-aeration units in water or wastewater treatment plants and small-scale intensive aquacultural ponds, replacing the other existing aerators.</jats:p>",

In order to evaluate the NRW ratio, the variables influencing this parameter should be determined. Therefore, the first aim of the paper is to define the variables which are influential on the estimation of the NRW ratio and then analyze these variables by using artificial neural networks (ANNs) methodology by means of 50 models with one, two, three, and four-variable input. Secondly, in this study, the NRW ratios have been predicted for the first time by using the Kriging methodology through only two variables. By using the data measured in 12 district meter areas (DMA) in Kocaeli, 60 models in total have been established for NRW ratio prediction through the ANN and Kriging methodologies. The ANN models are closed-box models and therefore the interpretation of the ANN model results requires higher expert opinion. As a consequence, the results show that Kriging model graphs produce much more useful information than ANN models in terms of application and interpretation.</jats:p>",

In this article, the implications of current and potential US trade actions and responses by China on the US and global economy are estimated. We employ a dynamic supply chain model based on the widely used Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base and model. Our analysis finds that US gross domestic product (GDP) would be reduced by a projected –0.86 per cent in 2030 (or US$227.8 billion in 2017 dollars), as the role of the USA in global supply chains declines significantly. China’s GDP would also decline considerably by 2.84 per cent as a result of the actions imposed against it, while the rest of the world gain, as they fill the gaps left by US and Chinese producers. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL: F16, C68 </jats:p>",

The reservoirs ranking is a vital problem which involves multi-criteria decision-making. The framework proposed in this paper involves the fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS method for the ranking of reservoirs in Pakistan. Potential feasible locations are identified from the Water and Power Development Authority, Pakistan. Weight calculation for the criteria is done by the fuzzy AHP method, which is a multi-criteria decision-making method. In order to model the fuzziness, equivocacy, incomplete knowledge and ambiguity, the fuzzy AHP is used. Furthermore, in order to rank the selected reservoirs based on their performance, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied, which is a multicriteria decision making method. We demonstrate the application of the above-mentioned methods to the case study of the Indus Reservoir system in Pakistan. A decision support tool is provided for the decision makers in this paper to manage, evaluate and rank the planned reservoirs in the Indus River.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given that the quality of water supplied to hot water supply systems must meet drinking water requirements, it is also important that the water preparation process is of great importance. The quality of that water is also important in terms of preventing the formation of heat in hot water systems. It is known that the main cause of the formation of water is the presence of calcium and magnesium cations and bicarbonate and sulfate anions in water. The traditional methods for preventing the limescale include the combination of calcium and magnesium cations from the water and replacing them with cations that are not easy to resolve at high temperatures. The quality of water treated by these methods does not meet drinking water requirements. Taking these into account, the Cl-anionizationprocess of drinking water has been developed in high-tech anionite technology. According to this technology, the first water from the city water gridis processed through anionite and activated carbon filters, which are mechanically charged with high anionite. The treated water is then cleaned out of microbes and bacteria through the ultraviolet disinfection equipment and delivered to the operator according to the quality requirements for drinking water. In the chlorine-anionization process, most of the sulfate and bicarbonate anions in water change to chlorine anions and their solidity remains constant. Thus, the density of the limescale-forming anions in the water decreases sharply and it meets the quality indicators of drinking water. High-grade anionite in the filter (8÷12) is regenerated by NaCl solution. The filtration rate of the solution from the anionite is determined depending on the concentration of calcium cations contained in the salt given for regeneration. Regeneration mode is such that the CaCO3 combination does not crumble when the anionite layer is formed. It is known that the temperature of the heated water in the hot water supply system does not exceed (60÷70)°C. In this case, the decomposition of limescale at Hc&lt;2 mg-eq/l (carbonate hardness) is not observed. As carbonate hardness increases to 4 mg/l, the thin layer in the system shows a collapse. The basic element of the proposed technological schemeCl-anionite filter was applied at ADA University in Baku and positive results were obtained. Early observed collapse of pipes has been prevented and the working regime of hot water heaters has improved. A high-performance anionite such as A200EMBCl, which is a major ingredient of the UK's Purelite, and then the Russian-made AB-17-8 high-anionite anions have been used on the device.</jats:p>"

We also investigate the extent to which these two standards improve SSCM for the textile industry within a block of European countries consisting of Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. In this empirical study, we use several measures to help identify the extent of impacts of examined standardized management systems on improvements in different processes of SSCM. Our contributions to the field include finding that quality management systems support environmental processes, relationships with stakeholders, processes within the supply chain, and SSCM. Other findings include implementing environmental management system standards impact the rationalization of other processes. Finally, we find more significant supply chain impacts with the implementation of both standards than by either standard alone.

This paper focuses on planning these needs in an aggregated way, providing a big picture for the long term investment plan. A methodology for this purpose was developed and applied to a large-scale irrigation utility in Portugal. For such, the following steps were taken: (i) system breakdown by functional areas; (ii) infrastructure components disaggregation; (iii) diagnosis of the reference situation; (iv) evaluation of long-term alternatives for rehabilitation investment planning. The methodology is in line with the IAM approach recommended by IWA and the ISO55000 standards. In this paper, the specificities of this particular application, namely a proposal of irrigation component classes, and the studied alternatives, are presented. As an overall result, it was possible to indicate a path for economic sustainability without committing the infrastructure sustainability: it is based on gradual replacement of the assets reaching their useful life, combined with a constant rehabilitation rate. This paper is a contribution to an AM system for irrigation utilities, so alignment with IAM and the contribution to a broader IAM system is highlighted.</jats:p>",

More precisely, we evaluate the strength of local supply–push effects with those of local demand–pull over the course of the evolution of an industry and its main product evolution. By using Bayesian survival models with time-dependent data of wind turbine deployment and firm foundation for 402 German regions between the years 1970 and 2015, we show that the spatial evolution of the German wind energy industry was more strongly influenced by local demand–pull than local supply–push processes. New producers are found to emerge in proximity to existing local demand for wind turbines. No evidence was found for producers being able to create local demand for their products by pushing the adoption of the technology in their regions.</jats:p>",

We consider two subsidy modes: financing subsidy to the carbon sink forests and financing subsidy to the manufacturer’s emission reductions. We apply a Stackelberg model and mainly consider the impact of subsidies on the profits and the strategies of the supply chain members. The results show that when the government gives a financing subsidy to the carbon sink forests, it is conducive to promoting the expansion of carbon sink forests, as well as the enhancement of the forest company’s profit. However, a larger supply of carbon sinks generates a lower price, which leads to the manufacturer reducing the technical emission reduction level and purchasing more carbon emission rights instead. On the other hand, when the manufacturer receives a financing subsidy for the technical emission reduction costs, its production becomes cleaner than before, and the profits of the forest company and the manufacturer increase.</jats:p>"

It is obvious that the green roof has better rainfall runoff reduction effect. It can be seen from the single rainfall control effect that the variation range of green roof rainfall runoff control rate is 36.0% to 99.0%, and the total rainfall control rate is 57.6%, which reflects that the green roof has the better rainfall control effect.

These dwellings are, therefore, in need of extensive renovation, which provides an excellent opportunity to install renewable energy supply systems to reduce the total energy consumption. The high investment costs of the renewable energy supply systems were previously distinguished as the main barrier in the installation of these systems in Sweden. House-owners should, therefore, compare the profitability of the energy supply systems and select the one, which will allow them to reduce their operational costs. This study analyses the profitability of a ground source heat pump, photovoltaic solar panels and an integrated ground source heat pump with a photovoltaic system, as three energy supply systems for a single-family house in Sweden. The profitability of the supply systems was analysed by calculating the payback period (PBP) and internal rate of return (IRR) for these systems. Three different energy prices, three different interest rates, and two different lifespans were considered when calculating the IRR and PBP. In addition, the profitability of the supply systems was analysed for four Swedish climate zones. The analyses of results show that the ground source heat pump system was the most profitable energy supply system since it provided a short PBP and high IRR in all climate zones when compared with the other energy supply systems. Additionally, results show that increasing the energy price improved the profitability of the supply systems in all climate zones.</jats:p>"

The results indicated that the flow regime plays an important role in scour-hole dimensions such that the minimum scouring depth happens in the nappe flow regime. Moreover, step size and tailwater depth are essential parameters for maximum scouring depth. Increasing tailwater depth from 6.31 cm to 8.54 cm and then to 11.82 cm decreases the scouring depth by 18.56% and 11.42%, respectively. These alterations also decrease the scouring length by 31.43% and 16.55%, respectively. By increasing the flow rate, the particle Froude number will increase, and the increased momentum of the flow promotes scouring. In addition, the results show that scouring at the sidewalls is higher than in the middle of the cross-section. Finally, an empirical formula with root mean square error = 0.107 and R2 = 0.974 is proposed to predict the maximum scouring depth downstream from the stepped spillways. Comparisons were made between the proposed formula and experimental results. This comparison demonstrated that the formula can predict souring depth to within 3.86% and 9.31% relative and maximum errors, respectively.</jats:p>",

In engineering works, the calculation of the Peak section of a flood hydrograph is crucially important. In the present study, using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, instead of using a single basic flood, the parameters of the linear Muskingum method (X, K, Δt) are calculated by computed arithmetic and geometric means relevant to two basic floods in the form of eight different models for calculating the downstream hydrograph. The results indicate that if the numerical values of the calculated flood inflow are placed in the interval of the inflow and the basic flood which the parameters X, K, Δt are from, the computation accuracy in approximating the outflow flood related to the peak section of the inflow hydrograph increases for all the mentioned models. In other words, if the arithmetic mean of X, K and the geometric mean of Δt, relevant to the two basic floods, are used instead of using values of X, K, Δt of a single basic flood, the computational accuracy in estimating the flood peak section of the hydrograph in downstream has the highest increase among all the eight models. Thus, the Mean Relative Error (MRE) relevant to the peak section of the inflow hydrograph of the third flood (observational flood) obtained by the first and second basic floods was equal to 4.89% and 2.91%, respectively, while in case of using the arithmetic mean of X and K and the geometric mean of Δt, related to the first and second basic floods (the best models presented in this study), this value is equal to 1.66%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve the operation efficiency and reduce the emission of a solar power integrated hybrid ferry with shore-to-ship (S2S) power supply, a two-stage multi-objective optimal operation scheduling method is proposed. It aims to optimize the two conflicting objectives, operation cost (fuel cost of diesel generators (DGs), carbon dioxide (CO2) emission tax and S2S power exchange) and energy storage (ES/ESS) degradation cost, based on the preference of the vessel operator and solar photovoltaic (PV) power output. For the day-ahead optimization, interval forecast data of the PV is used to map the solution space of the objectives with different sets of weight assignment. The solution space from the day-ahead optimization is used as a guide to determine the operating point of the hour-ahead optimization. As for the hour-ahead scheduling, more accurate short-lead time forecast data is used for the optimal operation scheduling. A detailed case study is carried out and the result indicates the operation flexibility improvement of the hybrid vessel. The case study also provides more in-depth information on the dispatching scheme and it is especially important if there are conflicting objectives in the optimization model.</jats:p>"

Some isolated strains of bacteria can degrade 2-MIB effectively. In this study, a strain of bacteria which can remove 2-MIB from drinking water efficiently was obtained from activated carbon in a filter, and was identified to be Pseudomonas mandelii based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Pseudomonas mandelii was not sensitive to the initial concentration of 2-MIB, and could tolerate a rather high concentration of 2-MIB. The best growth conditions for this degrader were 25–35 °C and initial pH of 7. The concentration of 2-MIB in mineral salt medium was reduced from 2 mg/L to 471.9 μg/L by Pseudomonas mandelii in 20 d after incubation. Nineteen bands of degrading enzyme were isolated from Pseudomonas mandelii, one of which was identified as a NAD-dependent dehydratase. It was found that 2-methyl-2-bornene was the metabolite in the presence of both the Pseudomonas mandelii and the isolated enzymes, indicating that NAD-dependent dehydratase might be involved in the biodegradation process or cooperate with other enzymes in the metabolic process to complete the dehydration process of 2-MIB.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Trade is an integral part of the Canadian economy. The main institutional drivers governing trade are bilateral and multilateral agreements outlining permissible trade distorting measures. Since its inception in 1972, Canada's supply management system has remained protected throughout trade negotiations. The system appears, by any economic measure, to be having an increasingly disproportional influence in recent trade negotiations. However, trade agreements serve not only to maximize social surplus, but also to maximize some measure of political welfare. Canada has recently negotiated three prominent trade agreements: the Canada‐European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) came into effect in the latter part of 2017; the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‐Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) came into effect at the end of 2018; and the Canada‐United States‐Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) could come into effect in 2020. Collectively, these agreements have guaranteed increased market access for fresh and processed dairy products. We build a spatial partial equilibrium model of the Canadian dairy industry consisting of three regions and 10 commodities to assess the individual and cumulative effect of these trade agreements. We pay particular attention to the institutional drivers within today's dairy sector: milk protein isolates; component pricing, including Class 7; and differential demand growth. We find that the aggregate impacts are: (a) a 1.4% decrease in the marginal retail price; (b) a 4.8% decrease in the blended producer price; and (c) an overall increase in social welfare of 7.8%. Worth noting, the decrease in producer surplus varies from 0.7% in the western region to 1.5% in Ontario. Our results may be relevant to future negotiations as well as the publicly promised compensation package for dairy producers.</jats:p>",

The models were trained and tested with data from ten monitoring stations on the Danube River, located in its course through Serbia, for the period from 2011 to 2016. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), standard three-layer network is used to develop models and two input variable selection techniques are used to reduce the number of input variables. The obtained results have shown the ability of ANN to predict the nitrate concentration in both developed models with a value of mean absolute error of 0.53 and 0.42 mg/L for the test data. Also, the application of IVS has contributed to reduce the number of input variables and to increase the performance of the model, especially in the case of variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis where the estimation of multicollinearity among variables and the elimination of excessive variables significantly influenced the prediction abilities of the ANN model, r – 0.91.</jats:p>",

In our investigated transportation problem, we are modeling a distribution network in a two-stage supply chain. The considered two-stage supply chain includes manufacturers, distribution centers, and customers, and its principal feature is that in addition to the variable transportation costs, we have fixed costs for the opening of the distribution centers, as well as associated with the routes. In this paper, we describe a different approach for solving the problem, which is an effective hybrid genetic algorithm. Our proposed hybrid genetic algorithm is constructed to fit the challenges of the investigated supply chain network design problem, and it is achieved by incorporating a linear programming optimization problem within the framework of a genetic algorithm. Our achieved computational results are compared with the existing solution approaches on a set of 150 benchmark instances from the literature and on a set of 50 new randomly generated instances of larger sizes. The outputs proved that we have developed a very competitive approach as compared to the methods that one can find in the literature.</jats:p>"

It is known as a dry area where water is difficult to obtain, and therefore, it is necessary to prepare a supply scheme to meet the island's demand. Hence, this study aims to obtain supply protocol from various available sources, in order to meet all water demands, especially for tourism sector development. The several methods used in this research include demand calculation for domestic, industry, irrigation, livestock, and tourism; rainfall-runoff simulation using Wflow model and estimation of groundwater availability using the baseflow recession method. Furthermore, surface balance shows the water availability in each sub-districts is not able to meet the demands. To overcome this problem, a supply scheme has been prepared, e.g. surface water utilization by constructing free intake in North Morotai, groundwater use by constructing dug and drilled wells in many locations, especially coastal areas, spring water utilization by creating a collection system (broncaptering) in Jaya, East and South Morotai. Furthermore, small islands can utilize springs and shallow dug wells, to prevent seawater intrusion from affecting the quality. The scheme suggests an appropriate infrastructural support to supply local communities, as well as develop the Island to be the new primary tourism center in Indonesia. </jats:p>"

The implementation of efficiency projects, such as non-revenue water (NRW) reduction projects are fundamental both from an economic and an environmental perspective. However, decisions on the implementation of these projects are often reduced to short-term economic criteria or to a cost-benefit analysis at best, not considering an adequate timeframe that would potentially allow the accommodation of the adopted NRW reduction measures (capital and operational expenditures). Infrastructure asset management requires a strategic view on water systems based on the long-term balance of performance, cost and risk aiming at the adequate management of utilities' physical, human, technological and intangible assets. Water managers should take these principles into consideration when deciding whether to implement efficiency projects, since the long-term effect of current water systems' inefficiencies can translate into significant capital expenditures in the future. This paper presents an evaluation of tangible and intangible gains that result from NRW reduction projects and why intangible gains should be part of decision-making processes on whether to implement them or not.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews the literature on sustainability, Big Data, Industry 4.0 and supply chain management published since 2009 and provides a thorough insight into the field by using bibliometric and network analysis techniques. A total of 87 articles published in the past 10 years were evaluated and the top contributing authors, countries, and key research topics were identified. Furthermore, the most influential works based on citations and PageRank were obtained and compared. Finally, six research categories were proposed in which scholars could be encouraged to expand Big Data and Industry 4.0 research on SCS. This paper contributes to the literature on SCS in the age of Industry 4.0 by discussing the challenges facing current research but also, more importantly, by identifying and proposing these six research categories and future research directions.</jats:p>"

Like any complex network, a supply chain is subject to a wide variety of risks that can result in significant economic losses and negative impacts in terms of image and prestige for companies. In circumstances of aggressive competition among companies, effective management of supply chain risks (SCRs) is crucial, and is currently a very active field of research. Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) has been recently extended to SCR identification and prioritization, aiming at reducing potential losses caused by lack of risk control. This article has a twofold objective. First, SCR assessment is investigated, and a comprehensive list of specific risks related to the automotive industry is compiled to extend the set of most commonly considered risks. Second, an alternative way of calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is proposed within the FMECA framework by means of an integrated Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach. We give a new calculation procedure by making use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to derive factors weights, and then the fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to evaluate the new factor of “dependence” among the risks. The developed joint analysis constitutes a risk analysis support tool for criticality in systems engineering. The approach also deals with uncertainty and vagueness associated with input data through the use of fuzzy numbers. The results obtained from a relevant case study in the automotive industry showcase the effectiveness of this approach, which brings important value to those companies: When planning interventions of prevention/mitigation, primary importance should be given to (1) supply chain disruptions due to natural disasters; (2) manufacturing facilities, human resources, policies and breakdown processes; and (3) inefficient transport.</jats:p>"

Stage 2 identifies human activities in the last ten years in the environs of the water source. Stage 3 analyzes impacts and environmental degradation risks, with special focus on vegetation around the lake. Results show that urban expansion reduced riparian vegetation and triggered sewerage flow into the lake, compromising self-cleaning capacity in the medium and long term, with an increase of pollution/contamination. The administration should develop and intensify activities to avoid irregular land occupation, establish a sewerage system and restitute the riparian vegetation lost. Lake Bolonha is highly relevant for the water supply system of approximate one million people of Belém and Ananindeua within the metropolitan region of Belém, Brazil.</jats:p>"

Using qualitative data from two organisational case studies operating within the same supply chain, it highlights that supply chains can constrain or enhance trade unions’ capacity to organise and mobilise. Supply chain rationalisation is found to be a key determinant in the reconfiguration of labour and labour process with significant consequences for working conditions. However, trade unions can also use supply chain structures to effectively mobilise and defend the interests of their constituents. The article finds that trade union effectiveness develops against the articulation of an agenda that goes beyond the workplace and transcends organisational boundaries. In particular, strategies that rely on building coalitions and lobbying different actors across the supply chain are found to be effective and contribute to better working conditions. </jats:p>",

Using a sample of U.S. union elections, our regression discontinuity tests show that passing a union election leads to a 6.9 percentage‐point decline in supplier operating margin in the following year. Such negative effects are more pronounced for customers with stronger bargaining power vis‐à‐vis dependent suppliers. Additional tests show that the reduced supplier operating margins are due to weakened top lines and, more specifically, to squeezed selling prices. Finally, consistent with increased labor costs, unionization is shown to significantly increase cost of goods sold and slow labor‐force downsizing among customer firms. Overall, our evidence suggests that increased labor costs and financial inflexibility due to unionization induce customers to price‐squeeze their dependent suppliers. </jats:p>",

Based on a detailed process analysis and dimensioning of the utilities and the accumulator a comprehensive simulation study is conducted for a pet food processing company having an average steam demand of 18,000 MWh at around 9 bar and 3 t/h. The results show that the highest     C  O  2 , e      -emissions reduction of up to 63% is achieved by the transition to a solid biomass-fuelled boiler system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Growing economies need green and renewable energy. Their financial development can reduce energy consumption (through energy-efficient technologies) and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones. Gas turbine engines are widely used in transport and industry. To improve their economic attractiveness and to reduce harmful emissions, including greenhouse gases, alternative fuels and waste heat recovery technologies can be used. A promising direction is the use of alcohol and thermo-chemical recuperation. The purpose of this study is to estimate the economic efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions of an alcohol-fueled regenerative gas turbine engine with thermo-chemical recuperation. The carbon dioxide emissions have been determined using engine efficiency, fuel properties, as well as life cycle analysis. The engine efficiency was maximized by varying the water/alcohol ratio. To evaluate steam fuel reforming for a certain engine, a conversion performance factor has been suggested. At the optimal water/methanol ratio of 3.075 this technology can increase efficiency by 4% and reduce tank-to-wake emission by 80%. In the last 6 months of 2019, methanol prices were promising for power and cogeneration plants in remote locations. The policy recommendation is that local authorities should pay attention to alcohol fuel and advanced turbines to curb the adverse effects of burning petroleum fuel on economic growth and the environment.</jats:p>"

Human behavior can mitigate the impacts of climate change. The present study aimed to evaluate rural people's readiness for sustainable management of water resources. To achieve this goal, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Belief Model (HBM) were used as the research framework. The research instrument was a closed-end questionnaire developed on the basis of TPB and HBM. The face and content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts in sustainable agriculture. Its reliability was also checked in a pilot study by calculating Cronbach's alpha, the average variance extracted (AVE), R2, and composite reliability (CR). The research sample was composed of 480 villagers from Hamadan province, Iran, who were familiar with sustainable water resources management in the context of the rooftop rainwater harvesting project. The results showed that in TPB, the variables of moral norms, attitude, and self-identity could account for 61 percent of the variance in rural people's intention to adopt the practices of sustainable water resources management. Based on HBM, the variables of perceived benefits, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity could capture 49 percent of this variance. The results revealed that both theories had the potential to predict rural people's intention to engage in the sustainable management of water resources, but TPB proved to provide a more robust prediction than HBM.</jats:p>",

However, the issue of unaffordability and construction costs remains to haunt the progress of property development in Malaysia. Second, from supply-side perspectives, there are several main reasons why the residential prices in Malaysia are uncontrollable: (1) costs of construction, (2) taxes, (3) existing units, (4) location and (5) urbanization. The third theme is the government support in catering to the needs and wants of middle- and lower-income earners. Most respondents agreed that the government has been providing low-cost houses supported by various incentives. Finally, on price control strategies for residential units, recommended suggestions are as follow: embracing different methods of construction styles, promote the uses of local materials instead of relying on imported materials, continuously review rules and regulations, provide more incentives and to build partnerships between the government and private companies on affordable housing projects.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research is expected to present solid findings and claimsseveral significant contributions, especially policy-wise.

For this reason, drinking water in 33 villages and 5 cities of the Khaf County were collected during March to September 2018. Fluoride contents in drinking water samples were assayed by using a HACH-DR6000 spectrophotometer. Fluoride content in drinking water from urban area and rural area ranged from 0.50 to 0.91 mg L−1 and 0.24 to 2.31 mg L−1. Among the population of the 33 villages, about 17 villages, corresponding to 51%, receive ﬂuoride concentrations less than 0.5 mg L−1 (minimum allowable concentration recommended by WHO), while the population of 4 villages, corresponding to 12%, receive ﬂuoride concentrations higher than 1.5 mg L−1 (the maximum allowable concentration of fluoride in drinking water recommended by the WHO). Moreover, our findings showed that the drinking water ingestion rate, ﬂuoride concentration in water, and the fraction of skin in contact with water were the most important variable in calculating the Hazard quotient (HQ).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes the use of multicriteria risk prevention tools that consider the socioeconomic and institutional conditions of food exporters. We propose the use of three decision-making methods—Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE), and Cross-Efficiency (CE)—to establish a ranking of countries that export cereals to the European Union, based on structural criteria related to the detection of potential associated risks (notifications, food quality, corruption, environmental sustainability in agriculture, and logistics). In addition, the analysis examines whether the wealth and institutional capacity of supplier countries influence their position in the ranking. The research was carried out biannually over the period from 2012–2016, allowing an assessment to be made of the possible stability of the markets. The results reveal that suppliers’ rankings based exclusively on aspects related to food risk differ from importers’ actual choices determined by micro/macroeconomic features (price, production volume, and economic growth). The rankings obtained by the three proposed methods are not the same, but present certain similarities, with the ability to discern countries according to their level of food risk. The proposed methodology can be applied to support sourcing strategies. In the future, food safety considerations could have increased influence in importing decisions, which would involve further difficulties for low-income countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Recently, centrifugal multiphase pump–dissolved air flotation (CMP-DAF) has become an increasingly popular alternative to DAF that can achieve more stable performance and higher removal efficiency, and this method is widely used in sewage treatment. However, the nonuniformity of the bubble size and low adherence of the floc particles and bubbles, as well as the complicated raw water quality, pose great challenges to CMP-DAF, which does not meet the standards of water supply and drainage in practical use. In the present study, the surfactant dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) was utilized as a flotation agent to further improve the flotation efficiency of the CMP-DAF process. DDBAC at a dosage of 0.2 mg/L was introduced to the air flotation of raw water to construct a flotation enhanced CMP air flotation system. The results showed that the average turbidity decreased to 0.433 ± 0.017 NTU, and effluent floc particles were present at 1,053 cnt/mL with an acceptable removal rate of 96.20%. In addition, 34.0% and 30.1% of UV254 and CODMn were removed, respectively. These results imply that DDBAC can increase the collision efficiency of bubble particles by reducing the diameter of the bubbles, which is conducive to forming larger flocs, and enhancing the shear resistance of the bubble–floc particles, thus improving the air flotation efficiency.</jats:p>",

This study consists of evaluating the impact of human activity on the water quality of Aïnzeda lake (NE Algeria), a typical case study of the difficulties posed by the problem of surface water quality in semi-arid regions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and the trend method were applied to interpret the physico-chemical data of monthly analyzed samples, over a 25-year period (1988–2012). The trend method results show that most chemical elements have a direct relationship with urbanization and agricultural practices in the area. The change in the watershed climatic conditions (increase of 9% in air temperature, 7% in the lake water temperature, and decrease of 8% in precipitation) is also responsible for the degradation of the water quality. The PCA shows that salinization (51.73%), and anthropogenic and agricultural pollution (13.49%) are the most significant degradation factors. These two approaches have enabled us to prove that aridity and anthropogenic or agricultural activities have a negative impact on the lake's surface water quality.</jats:p>",

To test this claim, we build the largest data set of public political activity for and against climate action in the United States, revealing that the majority of corporate opposition to climate action comes from outside the highest‐emitting industries. We construct new measures of the carbon intensity of firms and show that policy exposure via carbon‐intensive inputs and sales to downstream emitters explains this large volume of opposition from non‐emitting industries. Sixty‐six percent of U.S. lobbying on climate policy has been conducted by an extended coalition of firms, associations, and other groups that have publicly opposed reducing carbon emissions. Public opposition to climate action by carbon‐connected industries is therefore broad‐based, highly organized, and matched with extensive lobbying.</jats:p>",

To reduce the resulting interest rate risk, FHLBs shortened the repricing of their loans to banks. Focusing on small banks for which the reform was exogenous, we use a novel instrumental variable strategy to show that shadow banks create safe assets at the expense of banks' deposits. </jats:p>",

Potential supply‐side disruptions to food supply chains are assessed, including labor shortages, disruptions to transportation networks, and “thickening” of the Canada–U.S. border with respect to the movement of goods. Finally, the paper considers whether the COVID‐19 pandemic will have longer‐lasting effects on the nature of food supply chains, including the growth of the online grocery delivery sector, and the extent to which consumers will prioritize “local” food supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urbanization is a global trend: Since 2007 more than 50% of the world’s population have been living in urban areas, and rates of urbanization are continuing to rise everywhere. This growth in urbanization has led to an increased demand for natural resources, in particular non-metallic minerals such as stones, sand and clay, which account for one third of the entire flow of materials. Generally, these materials are traded within regional markets. This close geographical link between the demand for building materials in urban areas and the material supply in the hinterland leads to massive interventions in the natural environment and landscape. These urban–rural linkages can be revealed by applying Material Flow Analysis (MFA) to the built environment in order to trace the flows of building materials. The objective of this paper is to present a method for quantifying regional material flows by considering the supply and demand of building materials. This will be applied to the Vietnamese case study area of Hanoi and its hinterland province Hoa Binh. The results indicate a consumption of almost 60% of the construction mineral reserves in total secured by planning in the hinterland province considering a period of 15 years. However, this does not allow for the general conclusion that raw materials are sufficiently available. The sand reservoirs are only sufficient for eight years and clay reserves are used up after four years. This increases the need to exploit further raw material reserves, which are becoming increasingly scarce and results in stronger interventions in nature In order to safeguard the hinterland from the negative impacts of urbanization, a new understanding of resource efficiency is needed—one that acknowledges both resource efficiency in the construction of urban structures and appropriate resource conservation in the provision of the raw materials from the hinterland. This will require the creation of new integrated planning approaches between urban and regional planning authorities. Regional MFA is one way of realising such an approach.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to identify the cyanobacteria cells and associated organic compounds in the filter backwash water and to subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the RWWP in removing these organic impurities during the following periods; autumn-winter and spring-summer. Results showed that at least six major phytoplankton groups were present in the filter backwash water with turbidity levels (59 and 46 NTU; autumn-winter and spring-summer, respectively) being much higher than the drinking water productions standard of ≤5 NTU. Cyanobacteria were a dominant group (mean of 80% and above) in the total phytoplankton composition of the raw water and consisted of three genera (Anabaena sp., Microcystis sp. and Oscillatoria sp.), which were effectively removed by the RWWP (up to 99%). However, associated organic compounds such as geosmin, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microcystin were not effectively removed during the different seasonal periods but were of such low concentrations that they posed no major risk to the drinking water quality, meeting the RWWP water quality standard.</jats:p>",

Supply-side reform is a new normal for economic development. It is an important decision made by the Party Central Committee in the face of weak demand and a downward trend in the economy. It has defined the strategic focus of a new round of comprehensive reform. At present, the macro-economic problems facing our country have both cyclical characteristics, but they are mainly the trend problems brought about by structural contradictions. Promoting the structural reform on the supply side is a theoretical sublimation of our country’s macro-economic environment and is also an adverse force of the current economic situation. Based on the computer simulation analysis of the connotation of supply-side reform, this paper sorts out the relevant researches on supply-side reform at home and abroad. Explains the necessity of supply-side reform in our country, and puts forward the path choice for our city to promote economic growth by supply-side reform.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to find out the impact of Green Supply Chain managerial practices on environmental sustainability in the garment factories of Bangladesh. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods has been used to gather data through a survey. The survey respondents were mid-level SCM managers of 60 garment factories located in Gazipur. Descriptive data analysis, regression model and ANOVA have been used to show the impact of the independent variables on &amp;lsquo;Environmental Sustainability&amp;rsquo;. This paper has revealed that 4 variables have a statistically significant relation with the dependent variable and that lack of knowledge and government initiatives are the main reasons for low environmental sustainability. The research identifies the government initiatives that need to be taken and it also claims that there should be awareness about the significance of environmental sustainability among managers and the workforce to achieve environmental sustainability. This is important for Bangladesh, because environmental sustainability has a positive impact on the economy of the country. Previous literature has shown the benefits of GSCM and its impact on environmental sustainability in other countries. Whereas, this paper shows the current GSCM practices of the readymade garment factories of Bangladesh and shows the impact of the practices on Environmental Sustainability. The paper shows the practices that have positive and negative impact on the sustainability of the environment and it also comes up with the reasons why certain practices have a negative impact. Thus, this will help the government of Bangladesh to know about the practices that need to be continued and those that need to be improved. </jats:p>"

During the study, various schemes for integrating heat accumulators in heat supply systems were considered. Water was used as a battery, which also acts as a coolant. Mathematical modeling of processes in combined heat supply systems using intermittent heating is carried out. The characteristic operating modes of the elements of heat supply systems that take into account the operating modes of heat consumers are determined. Mathematical modeling was carried out using a software package that allows to obtain the distribution of heat power of the heat supply system by its main elements and its characteristic operation modes. According to the research results, a coefficient of thermal power reduction and a coefficient of efficiency of using the heat accumulator volume were proposed. These coefficients allow to evaluate the efficiency of heat sources and the efficiency of using the volume of the heat storage tank. Based on the obtained data, the task was set to optimize the daily load of the heat source, taking into account the installation of the storage tank.\n\nThe research results can be used for the reconstruction of heat supply systems of buildings with a two-period operation mode (operation duty) using both traditional and renewable heat sources. This will significantly increase the efficiency of the use of elements of the heat supply system, even out the daily heat generation schedule and increase the service life of the main equipment</jats:p>",

It is a powerful way to improve the efficiency and quality of supply chain operation by evaluating the level of supply chain flexibility effectively. The traditional method is used to decompose the supply chain flexibility evaluation indicators from the perspective of system structure or cost saving, but these indicators cannot truly describe the dynamics of the supply chain operation. Otherwise, supply chain flexibility evaluation is a typical multiobjective evaluation; there are some incompatibilities between these flexible evaluation indicators, and the common evaluation methods are difficult to deal with such contradictions. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of supply chain operation are considered, and the evaluation system of supply chain flexibility is designed from the perspective of operation efficiency. The matter-element analysis theory is used to create the comprehensive appraisal model of supply chain flexibility. The matter-element matrix solves the uncertainty and incompatibility of the evaluated factors used to assess supply chain flexibility. The paper evaluates the performance of four autoservice companies and concludes that the evaluation grades of the four companies are in line with the reality, indicating that the evaluation system and the method are effective and credible.</jats:p>",

However, for most small and medium-sized firms, the high cost of green innovation makes it difficult to achieve green goals, causing the need for a growing number of firms to cooperate with their supply chain partners on green innovations. Thus, this study explores, from a value co-creation perspective, how supply chain partners share the investment in, and benefits of, green innovation, assuring their long-term cooperation. Based on a three-level manufacturing supply chain, this paper proposes three different types of green co-creation strategies (i.e., the manufacturer and its supplier, the manufacturer and its competitor, the manufacturer and its retailer). We set the mechanism of co-creation to share the cost of green investment and consider the impact of co-creation on the sales of supply chain partners. Then, by constructing the value functions of three co-creation strategies and proving the concavity of these functions, the findings indicate that different co-creation strategies can indeed improve the firm’s profit in a certain range and achieve a different maximum value in a certain green investment sharing point. This study enriches the literature on green co-creation in supply chains by combing green investment sharing strategies among supply chain partners with value co-creation. In addition, this study provides manufacturers with guidelines on how to share green costs and choose a green co-creation strategy in different operational environments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hydrogen economy refers to an economic and industrial structure that uses hydrogen as its main energy source, replacing traditional fossil-fuel-based energy systems. In particular, the widespread adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) is one of the key factors enabling a hydrogen economy, and aggressive investment in hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is essential to make large-scale adoption of HFCVs possible. In this study, we address the problem of effectively designing a hydrogen supply network for refuelling HFCVs in urban areas relatively far from a large hydrogen production site, such as a petrochemical complex. In these urban areas where mass supply of hydrogen is not possible, hydrogen can be supplied by reforming city gas. In this case, building distributed hydrogen production bases that extract large amounts of hydrogen from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) and then supply hydrogen to nearby hydrogen stations may be a cost-effective option for establishing a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in the early stage of the hydrogen economy. Therefore, an optimization model is proposed for effectively deciding when and where to build hydrogen production bases and hydrogen refuelling stations in an urban area. Then, a case study of the southeastern area of Seoul, known as a commercial and residential center, is discussed. A variety of scenarios for the design parameters of the hydrogen supply network are analyzed based on the target of the adoption of HFCVs in Seoul by 2030. The proposed optimization model can be effectively used for determining the time and sites for building hydrogen production bases and hydrogen refuelling stations.</jats:p>"

In Germany, maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) is the main biogas substrate source, despite being associated with problems such as erosion, biodiversity losses, an increase in wild boar populations and lowered landscape diversity. The cultivation of perennial wild plant mixtures (WPM) addresses many of these problems. Despite being less developed than maize, WPM cultivation has received notable attention among scientists in Germany over the past decade. This is mainly because WPMs clearly outperform maize in social–ecological measures, despite their methane yield performance. This review summarizes and discusses the results of 12 years of research and practice with WPMs as a social‐ecologically more benign bioenergy cropping system.</jats:p>",

However, the treatment effect of evofosfamide monotherapy on tumor hypoxia has not been fully understood, partly due to the lack of quantitative methods to assess tumor pO2 in vivo. Here, we use quantitative pO2 imaging by EPR to evaluate the change in tumor hypoxia in response to evofosfamide treatment using two pancreatic ductal adenocarcinom a xenograft models; MIA Paca-2 tumors responding to evofosfamide and Su.86.86 tumors which do not respond. EPR imaging showed oxygenation improved globally after evofosfamide treatment in hypoxic MIA Paca-2 tumors, in agreement with the ex vivo results obtained from hypoxia staining by pimonidazole and in apparent contrast to the decrease in K<jats:sup>trans</jats:sup>observed in DCE MRI. This suggests reoxygenation after treatment is due to decreased oxygen demand rather than improved prefusion. Following the change in pO2 after treatment may therefore yield a way of monitoring treatment response. The observation that evofosfamide not only kills the hypoxic region of the tumor but also improves oxygenation in the residual tumor regions provides a rationale for combination therapies using radiation and anti-proliferatives post evofosfamide for improved outcomes.</jats:p>"

The study included examining the quality of the water supply network components such as taps, underground storage tanks and feeding pipes of the network. Filtration influence on the tap water was investigated by testing different water samples before and after the filtration process at different locations. The experiments also examined various bottled water brands sold in Al-Madinah. In addition, the impact of using the dispenser on the water quality of large bottled waters was studied. The water quality of two types of waters was compared by estimating water quality index (WQI). Results of this study revealed that the overall quality of the tap water is within standard values; however, deterioration occurs for the water through its journey in the water supply system. Results revealed that hardness and fluoride concentrations in bottled waters exhibited high values close to or more than allowable values of the standards. Furthermore, results confirmed that using the filter and dispenser decreased the water quality degree in the long run. Bottled waters showed a higher grade of WQI than tap water.</jats:p>",

New econometric estimates of the impact of different types of NTMs are used in a global supply chain model to separately model the effects on intermediate products and those sold to final consumers. We also distinguish between whether the NTM cost burden is directed at exporters or importers. This paper makes important advances in modelling the heterogeneity of NTMs, offering much richer policy analysis of the impact of NTMs on supply chains in the Asia‐Pacific region than has previously been possible. We illustrate the benefits, both to the major ASEAN countries and to their trading partners, from the partial liberalisation by ASEAN countries of their most trade distorting types of NTMs. Such liberalisation increases the GDP and welfare of all countries, with the effect particularly pronounced for the major ASEAN countries themselves, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. As trade in plant products and animal products is particularly affected by NTMs, these sectors show the largest expansion of trade.</jats:p>",

All these constituents have been considered more specifically. The main constituents’ results values of the power supply restoration time were analyzed for the electrical networks of regional power supply company “Oreolenergo”, a branch of Interregional Distribution Grid Company (IDGC) of Center. The Delphi method was used for determining the time for obtaining information on failures as well as the time for information recognition. The method of mathematical statistics was used to determine the repair time. The determined power supply restoration time (5.28 h) is similar to statistical values of the examined power supply company (the deviation was equal to 9.9%). The technical means of electrical network automation capable of the reduction of the power supply restoration time have also been found. These means were classified according to the time intervals they shorten.</jats:p>"

The cause of the final positioning fault is that the software of the program-controlled power supply processor has not set up a signal verification process, which causes the program-controlled power supply to mistakenly consider the changes generated by the RS232 signal when the power is turned on and off as voltage control signals, resulting in voltage jumps. Modify the software of the program-controlled power processor to increase the signal verification when the program-controlled power processor receives the RS232 signal of the main board, which can effectively solve the fault phenomenon.</jats:p>",

Investigation was done to see how retail customers react to the role of HTSCP; that later influence their overall grocery experience. Halalan Toyyiban is a process associated with religious belief and as such it would be difficult to control and guarantee. From the consumer point of view, the process is difficult to evaluate and verify even after consuming the product. Therefore, consumers have to largely rely on the retailer on the reliable information to guide their purchase. In the traditional context of supermarket retailing, excellent customer service management could be interpreted as just meeting the expectations of the supermarket customers, not any sort of exceeding or falling short of their expectations. It is only recently that several of the supermarkets try to achieve competitive advantage by taking the responses of their customers beyond the level of just service satisfaction. These supermarket retailers are now towards exceeding their service expectations. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining the relationship between the roles of HTSCP as significant predictors towards excellent customer service management. Structured questionnaires were distributed to 489 supermarket customers using purposive sampling technique in the urban area. The instruments used for data collection for all variables in the study include halal inputs, halal processes, controls for halal, halal outputs and excellent customer service management were adapted from Halalan- Toyyiban Assurance Pipeline (Management System Requirements for Retailing) of Department of Standards Malaysia as well as from various studies using a five-point Likert scale. The results suggest that all determinants of HTSCP had a good relationship with excellent customer service management. This study identifies additional management efforts that can be implemented in enhancing good retail supermarket practice.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we theorize a new notion—the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply–demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current growth of energy consumption, which is directly related to the use of a large number of fossil fuels, and, as a result, causes environmental pollution, requires the search for ways to conserve energy and use traditional energy resources economically, as well as to preserve environmental well-being. In such a situation, a good solution to this problem can be the use of energy production technologies based on the use of non-traditional and renewable energy sources, and, in particular, the use of wind energy. In heat supply systems, wind energy can be involved in heat production technologies and then used for heating cities and towns. The method of heat supply of buildings through the use of a combined system of energy sources, consisting of a boiler house and wind power plants, is considered. The methodical basis of a very specific heat supplying system has been developed. The specificity of this system is that the boiler comes into operation, complementing the wind turbine operation, only if the wind is weak or absent at all. In other cases, the heat supply is provided by wind turbines, and the boiler house is waiting for the heating load. An assessment of the possible use of wind power facilities together with a boiler house in providing a heating load schedule for consumers located in an area with an increased potential of the wind which average annual speed is at the level of ~7 m/s is presented. The duration of the heating season in this area is 9–10 months a year. It is shown that the joint use of the boiler house and wind power plants for heat supply purposes during the year can reduce the share of the boiler house in the heat supply of consumers by 50–70 % or more.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present paper explored the influence of breeding native pigs on livelihood conditions and the contribution of native pigs to the rural development and rural poverty reduction in the rural areas of Lao PDR. Pig production plays an important role in meat supply for both urban and rural areas of Laos. It is clear that most of the pig products in the country come from smallholder pig farms, and more than 90 percent of those products are the native pigs mostly raised by farmers in remote areas. In general, livestock production distributed between 15–18 percent to GDP, while most of animal production still remains as the traditional methods. Rural development is always the first priority of the Laos government since its independence in 1975, however, the poverty rate in rural areas remained high at 23% in 2018. It might block the development goal of the government which will lead the country out of the least development status by 2020. The food security and malnutrition in the rural or mountainous areas are considered as the majority issue that both government and several international organizations have been thriving hard to overcome, which researchers showed that more than 45% of children under 5 years of age were stunted, and 28% of them were underweight. Inspired of more than 50 % of the households in the rural areas of Laos reported they consumed chicken and pork at least one day a week. While native pigs play an important role on meat supply, it also constituted around 9–14 % of annual income of the households in rural areas. Therefore, the increase the production of pigs and poultry is one option to promote the meat supply to households in the rural areas of Laos. This paper will be a pathway to guide and identify for the final decision to what experiment will be implemented on Lao native pig in Laos (2021–2023) to complete the comparative study on reproductive physiology and reproductive management methods of Hungarian and Lao Indigenous pig breed. Which found it still needs further afford to research and improve more about native pig performance for all areas of productive and quality management.</jats:p>"

This is caused by the fact that controlled vibration machines can significantly increase and stabilize at a given level of technological processes. Automation of EMVV can be solved only by developing automatic stabilization of performance with closed feedback. Rational design of this kind of sustainability needs theoretical justification. This article discusses the analysis of self-oscillations in electromagnetic exciters with a nonlinear power source used in vibration technology. To analyze the equations, the averaging method was used. Using this method allows obtaining periodic solutions for current and mechanical vibrations. The results of the analysis can be used in the development of self-oscillating electromagnetic exciters.</jats:p>",

Often, the extensive fragmentation, traditional procurement structures, destructive competition, lack of collaboration and transparency, low-profit margins, and human resources are shown as the main culprits for this. As blockchain technology makes its presence felt strongly in many other industries like finance and banking, this study investigates the preparation of construction supply chains for blockchain technology through an explorative analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Arginine, a semi-essential functional amino acid, has been found to promote the synthesis of casein in mammary epithelial cells to some extent. Data from mouse indicated that microRNA (miRNA) are important in regulating the development of mammary gland and milk protein synthesis. Whether there are potential links among arginine, miRNA and casein synthesis in bovine mammary gland is uncertain. The objective of the present work was to detect the effects of arginine supplementation on the expression of miRNA associated with casein synthesis in mammary tissue and mammary epithelial cells (BMEC). The first study with bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC) focused on screening for miRNA candidates associated with the regulation of casein production by arginine. The BMEC were cultured with three different media, containing 0, 1.6 and 3.2 mM arginine, for 24 h. The expression of candidate miRNA was evaluated. Subsequently, in an in vivo study, 6 Chinese Holstein dairy cows with similar BW (mean ± SE) (512.0 ± 19.6 kg), parity (3), BCS (4.0) and DIM (190 ± 10.3 d) were randomly assigned to three experimental groups. The experimental cows received an infusion of casein, arginine (casein plus double the concentration of arginine in casein), and alanine (casein plus alanine, i.e., iso-nitrogenous to the arginine group) in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 22 d for each period (7 d for infusion and 15 d for washout). Mammary gland biopsies were obtained from each cow at the end of each infusion period. Results of the in vitro study showed differences between experimental groups and the control group for the expression of nine miRNA: miR-743a, miR-543, miR-101a, miR-760-3p, miR-1954, miR-712, miR-574-5p, miR-468 and miR-875-3p. The in vivo study showed that arginine infusion promoted milk protein content, casein yield and the expression of CSN1S1 and CSN1S2. Furthermore, the expression of miR-743a, miR-543, miR-101a, miR-760-3p, miR-1954, and miR-712 was also greater in response to arginine injection compared with the control or alanine group. Overall, results both in vivo and in vitro revealed that arginine might partly influence casein yield by altering the expression of 6 miRNAs (miR-743a, miR-543, miR-101a, miR-760-3p, miR-1954, and miR-712).</jats:p>"

The effects of influencing parameters upon fluctuations and extreme values of dynamic pressure were investigated. The angles of 0°, 30°, 45°, and 60° were adopted for the mobile bottom wall. The discharges were set as 67, 86, 161, and 184 litre/s and the depths of water cushion on the mobile bottom wall were set as 0, 15, 30, and 45 cm. The method suggested by Castillo for computation of fluctuating coefficient of dynamic pressure (see Castillo (2007) Pressure characterization of undeveloped and developed jets in shallow and deep pool. Proceedings of the Congress-International Association for Hydraulic Research32 (2), 645) was validated via the laboratory data. The results showed that the increase in water cushion depth downstream has led to a decrease in mean pressure and in pressure fluctuations. The analyses showed that the fluctuating pressure coefficient was a function of water cushion depth, and its maximum value was taken when there was a water cushion on the mobile bottom wall. With an increase in discharge and mobile bottom wall angle, the maximum value of the fluctuating coefficient occurred in less water cushion depth. Moreover, with the growth of discharge, the maximum positive and negative fluctuations of the pressure increased first and then decreased.</jats:p>",

All three flood characteristics, i.e. peak flow, flood volume and flood duration, are important when formulating actions and measures to manage flood risk. Therefore, estimating the multivariate designs and their associated return periods is an essential element of making informed risk-based decisions in this river basin. In this paper, the efficacy of a kernel density estimator is tested by assessing the adequacy of kernel functions for capturing flood marginal density of 50 years (from 1961 to 2016) of daily streamflow data collected at Gulliemard Bridge gauge station in the Kelantan River basin. Tests for stationarity or the existence of serial correlation within the flood series is often a pre-requisite before introducing the random samples into a univariate or a multivariate framework. It was found that homogeneity existed within the flood vector series. It was concluded therefore that time series of the flood vectors do not exhibit any significant trend. Based on analytically based fitness measures, it was concluded that it is likely that Triweight kernel function is the best-fitted distribution for defining the marginal distribution of peak flows, flood volumes and flood durations in the Kelantan River basin.</jats:p>",

Therefore, improving the overall investment efficiency of wind power projects is an inevitable direction for the development of wind power companies in the future. This paper first takes wind power projects as research objects, combines the characteristics of wind power projects, and constructs a suitable comprehensive investment efficiency evaluation model based on DEA theory.

A minimum allocation of 10% public resources and 30% private resources would be required to commensurate with demand under that scenario.

The aim of the article is to identity the key enablers of supply chain flexibility (SCF) adoption and to evaluate their fitness in the context of the personal hygiene industry in India. After a systematic literature review, 22 key dimensions of SCF have been extracted. A field investigation through interviews and a brainstorming session with industry experts have resulted in 11 dimensions, finally. Twenty-six experts participated in this interview and brainstorming session. These 11 dimensions have been exposed to interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to assess the hierarchal interaction among them. Fuzzy MICMAC has been employed to identify the driving dimensions of supply chain flexibility for the personal hygiene industry. The findings suggest that seven dimensions, namely process, manufacturing, sourcing, volume, market, new product development and coordination, have high dependence but weak driving power and are thus dependent on the other dimensions to influence the supply chain flexibility. Demand management and product flexibilities were found to have the strongest driving force and act as the key drivers for SCF. The originality of the conducted study lies in the multilevel hierarchical structure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the debates in the literature of contract farming concerns contracting firms’ preferences over large growers and if contract farming is inclusive of smallholders. The empirical evidence was mixed, which may be due to ignoring the stylized fact that modern food supply chain is characterized by large organized retailers who often contract with farmers. The present study aims at addressing this issue by incorporating sales to supermarket and hypermarket chains as one of the determinants of contract farming participation. Based on a nationally-representative farm household data set in Taiwan, this study presents empirical evidence to support the positive effects of selling farm produce to supermarkets and/or hypermarkets on the probability of contract farming participation. However, the increase in the share of chain stores, convenience stores, as well as local grocers was found to lower the probability of contract farming participation. The results suggest the effect of organized retailing on the participation of contract farming varies with different food retailers in the modern supply chain. Moreover, based on the predicted probability from the participation-determining model, contracting firms in Taiwan are found to exhibit preferences towards large-scale growers. A further analysis of the interaction between grower’s scale and membership of farmer organizations indicates participation in the farmer organizations can effectively mitigate contracting firms’ scale bias. The significance of the moderating effect of farmer organizations suggests their important role in the inclusion of smallholders into modern food supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Activism seeking to improve labor conditions in global supply chains has led many transnational corporations to adopt codes of conduct and to monitor suppliers for compliance. Drawing on thousands of audits conducted by a major social auditor, the authors identify structural contingencies in the institutional environment and program design under which codes and monitoring are more likely to be associated with improvements in conditions. At the institutional level, suppliers improve more when they face greater risk that nongovernmental organizations and the press will expose harmful working conditions. They also improve more when their buyers have experienced negative publicity for supply chain labor abuses. At the program design level, suppliers improve more on average when audits are pre-announced, when auditors are highly trained, and especially when both elements are present. Extended analysis of variations across violation types reveals nuances to these findings. For instance, pre-announced audits were followed by greater improvement in occupational safety and health practices but not child labor practices. These findings can inform strategies for improving supply chain working conditions. </jats:p>",

Our main findings are that in a competitive situation, there is a positive stable equilibrium. Furthermore, increasing the rate of influence of offline transmission, online transmission, and cross transmission will improve sales.

It is complicated to measure the fluctuating pressures of hydraulic jumps in real-scale structures. Therefore, little information is available about the pressure fluctuations in the literature. In this paper, minimal and maximal pressures were analyzed on the flat bed of a stilling basin downstream of an Ogee spillway. Attention has been focused on dimensionless pressures related to the low and high cumulative probabilities of occurrence (P*0.1% and P*99.9%), respectively. The results were presented based on the laboratory-scale experiments. These parameters for the relatively high Froude numbers have not been investigated. The total standard uncertainty for the dimensionless mean pressures (P*m) was obtained around 1.87%. Spectral density analysis showed that the dominant frequency in the classical hydraulic jumps was about 4 HZ. Low-frequency of pressure fluctuations indicated the existence of large-scale vortices. In the zone near the spillway toe, P*0.1% reached negative values of around −0.3. The maximum values of pressure coefficients, namely |CP0.1%|max and CP99.9%max, were achieved around 0.19 and 0.24, respectively. New original expressions were proposed for P*0.1% and P*99.9%, which are useful for estimating extreme pressures.</jats:p>",

Too much water (precipitation + irrigation) was disadvantaged for the productivity and yield quality of cherry tomato hybrid because the amount of diseased yield increased while the soluble solids content (°Brix) and lycopene content of tomato fruit decreased. In the mildly wet year, irrigation had positive effect on the marketable yield, the β-carotene and zeaxanthin content of tomato fruit but the ratio of diseased fruit increased.

To achieve the 2030 and 2050 targets, technological and societal changes are needed. This transition will inevitably change the composition of the future EU fleet, with an increasing share of electric vehicles (xEVs). To assess the potential contribution of lithium-ion traction batteries (LIBs) in decreasing the environmental burdens of EU mobility, several aspects should be included. Even though environmental assessments of batteries along their life-cycle have been already conducted using life-cycle assessment, a single tool does not likely provide a complete overview of such a complex system. Complementary information is provided by material flow analysis and criticality assessment, with emphasis on supply risk. Bridging complementary aspects can better support decision-making, especially when different strategies are simultaneously tackled. The results point out that the future life-cycle GWP of traction LIBs will likely improve, mainly due to more environmental-friendly energy mix and improved recycling. Even though second-use will postpone available materials for recycling, both these end-of-life strategies allow keeping the values of materials in the circular economy, with recycling also contributing to mitigate the supply risk of Lithium and Nickel.</jats:p>"

Moreover, natural rubber is a key material to produce important products such as tire, health and sports equipment. For this reason, it is necessary to sustain the supply from natural rubber plantation. To sustain the supply, technical aspects such as cultivation techniques, replanting techniques, latex processing techniques and social aspects such as rubber smallholder behavior, supplier behavior need to maintain. This research conducts a socio-technical analysis of natural rubber plantation in North Sumatera. This research has an objective to investigate the ability of natural rubber plantation in North Sumatera to sustain the natural rubber supplies. A combination of socio-technical framework and SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) is used to analyze the existing condition of natural rubber plantation in North Sumatera. The result indicated that there were social, technical and external factors that reduce the ability to sustain the supply of natural rubber.</jats:p>",

Processes that control the sediment transfer between the subtidal and the supratidal zone are not fully understood, especially in sand flats close to inlets. It is hypothesised that storm surge events induce sediment deposition on sand flats, providing fresh material for aeolian transport and dune growth. The objective of this study is to identify which processes cause deposition on the sand flat during storm surge conditions and discuss the relationship between the supratidal deposition and sediment supply to the dunes. We use the island of Texel (NL) as a case study, of which multiannual topographic and hydrographic datasets are available. Additionally, we use the numerical model XBeach to simulate the most frequent storm surge events for the area. Results show that supratidal shore-parallel deposition of sand occurs in both the numerical model and the topographic data. The amount of sand deposited is directly proportional to surge level and can account for more than a quarter of the volume deposited at the dunes yearly. Furthermore, storm surges are also capable of remobilising the top layer of sediment of the sand flat, making fresh sediment available for aeolian transport. Therefore, in a sand flat setting, storm surges have the potential of reworking significant amounts of sand for aeolian transport in periods after the storm and as such can also play a constructive role in coastal dune development.\n                    </jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to detect and quantify pAmpCs from the aquatic environment. The following pAmpCs were analysed with clinical TaqMan assays from isolated plasmids: ACC, ACT/MIR, BIL/LAT/CMY, DHA, FOX and MOX/CMY. Quantification was conducted using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 3D chip-based digital PCR. The results of qPCR yielded 4,875.27 copies/ng DNA and dPCR, 1,640.58 copies/ng (Mann–Whitney U Test, p= 0.868). Redundancy analysis indicated that land coverage explains 90.49% (ANOVA, p= 0.601) of pAmpC variance. There was a correlation between the frequency and quantities of pAmpCs detected in each river and this could be related to anthropogenic influence. Frequencies of detection for pAmpCs were 25/36 for the Crocodile West River and 13/36 for the Marico River. Quantification resulted in higher copy numbers for the Crocodile West River and high copies in only two sites of the Marico River, thus reflecting degrees of anthropogenic influences on both rivers. The presence of these clinically relevant pAmpCs in aquatic systems are cause for concern, considering their potential impact if these genes are harboured by pathogens and become dispersed to human populations.</jats:p>",

The better the utilization of resources, especially scarce resources, the better the performance of a supply chain. This research focuses on allocating two scarce resources, i.e., berth and quay cranes (QCs), to ships that call at a container terminal in a maritime supply chain. As global container shipments continue to grow, improving the efficiency of container terminals is important. A two-stage approach is used to find the optimal/near-optimal solution, in which the first stage is devoted to generating alternative ship placement sequences as inputs to the second stage that subsequently employs an event-based heuristic to place ships, resolve overlaps of ships, and assign/adjust QCs so as to develop a feasible solution. For identifying a better approach, various heuristics/metaheuristics, including first-come first-served (FCFS), particle swarm optimization (PSO), improved PSO (PSO2), and multiple PSO (MPSO), have been employed in the first stage, respectively. The experimental results show that combining the MPSO with the event-based heuristic leads to a better result.</jats:p>"

This paper highlights the problem from the perspective of targeted defense strategies before being attacked and analyzes the acceptable recovery time against attacks. A topological structure model, with three exclusive features, in contrast with traditional networks, is used to describe the structure of military supply chain networks. In order to provide a platform for evaluating performance, a simulation method based on exploratory analysis is presented. Considering supply capability against disruptions and the acceptable recovery time for an MSCN after disruptions, evaluation metrics including supply capability and disruption recovery are proposed. By applying the model and algorithms to a POL supply network in a theater, we obtain the values of supply capability and disruption recovery against different disruptions. We also identify the key entities which can easily cause catastrophic failure to this network and which need to be protected against carefully. The results show that new evaluation metrics can capture important performance requirements for military supply chain networks.

For the decentralized supply chain, a three-layer model is constructed according to different priorities of the four participants. Both Bertrand game and Stackelberg game are involved. For the centralized supply chain, a two-layer model is given. Decision models of the government under a financial budget are developed for maximizing the green degree of each case. It is shown that the green degree of the product of the centralized supply chain is always higher than that of the decentralized supply chain. Meanwhile, the total profit of the centralized supply is also higher. Finally, a numerical illustration is presented to visualize the discussed models and make some supplements.</jats:p>",

The same thing happens to residential electricity consumers, driven by the advantageous of electricity power generation that can be done on the consumer side, independent operation, reliability and quality of power, many consumers try to install renewable energy based generation such as photovoltaic system for their electricity supply. However, looking at the tariff of utility electricity and considering the investment needed: building a photovoltaic-based supply system is not necessarily the right choice. This paper presents a technical design for electricity supply of a residential load through an off-grid photovoltaic system. The technical basis for designing and the capacity of its constituent components is explained, as well as the analytical techniques carried out to assess the financial aspects of the development and operation of the system. The results of this analysis can be used for deciding whether it is appropriate to divert the source of electrical energy to the photovoltaic system. To show the steps of the analysis, a case study was carried out by designing an off-grid photovoltaic system for a residential load characterized by its daily load curve. The capacity and costs were calculated and financial analysis is carried out by looking at the extent to which the designed system can provide comparable benefits if the power is supplied from the utility at the prevailing price, as well as how long the system must be operated to obtain a breakeven return on investment. Based on the daily load curve in this case study, it is known the total daily energy consumption of the load is 6.885 kWh. This amount of energy must be provided from photovoltaic module with 5 hour effective per day, so the minimum capacity of PV-module is 1463.65 W. For an autonomy time of 1 day, a minimum energy storage capacity of 8.965 kWh is required. Investment costs which include the cost of procurement, system development, and the tax are Rp. 150,008,037. The financial benefits are calculated based on prices of the PLN 2016 non-subsidized tariff. It was assummed that the energy used that should be supplied from PLN, is substituted by photovoltaic generation system. NPV analysis and Payback period shows that the off-grid photovoltaic generation system will be feasible if the electricity price is 2.3 times the current price, and the discount factor (DF) for construction is 2.5%, in such electricity prices and DF factor, the payback period is reached if generation system is operated at least until the end of the 25<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> year. Financial analysis showed the inability of the off-grid electricity supply scheme based on the designed photovoltaic generation for current conditions.</jats:p>",

The Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) is an interbasin project aimed at diverting 510 MLD of water in three phases (170 MLD in each phase). Phase I of the project was expected to complete by 2018. Water demand forecasting is the first and important activity in managing water supply. Using the socio-economic factors of number of connections, water tariff and ratio of population to number of university students and climatic factor of annual rainfall, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the water demand of Kathmandu Valley until the year 2040. The analysis suggests that, even after the completion of Phase I of MWSP, the water scarcity in the valley will be 160 MLD in 2020. Therefore, Phase II of MWSP should be completed within 2025 and Phase III should be completed by 2040. The result of this study aids KUKL for better management of the water system. In addition, this research can help in decision making to construct the second and third phase for MWSP, the construction date of which still has not been decided.</jats:p>",

However, specialists bring with them not only diverse expertise, but also diverse goals and incentive structures. We examine how functional goal misalignment and the distribution of knowledge of who knows what (metaknowledge) affect self‐serving politics and the performance of cross‐functional teams. To test our model, we develop a vignette‐based social team experiment and analyze data from 468 participants grouped in 156 sourcing teams. Our results provide evidence for both catalyst and inverse‐catalyst effects of the distribution of metaknowledge. Specifically, under goal alignment, centralized metaknowledge leads to the catalyzation of cross‐functional expertise, reducing team politics and enhancing team performance. However, under goal misalignment, centralized metaknowledge significantly amplifies team politics and reduces performance via mediation. We contribute to the growing body of research on behavioral OSCM at the team level of analysis by offering theoretical and practical implications for the design of team integration processes from the perspective of organizational politics and group cognition. We also provide management with clear design recommendations regarding how to govern cross‐functional OSCM teams in terms of functional goals and the distribution of metaknowledge.</jats:p>",

In the city of Santiago, Chile, extreme weather that can be associated with a nascent manifestation of climate change has caused high-turbidity events, repeatedly forcing the main water company to interrupt the supply of drinking water, affecting millions of people. This study proposes a transformative response to reduce harm from extreme events due to climate change. The traditional approach of increasing resilience through large infrastructure works can be complemented by one-off reductions in water use during emergencies, in exchange for economic compensation. This alternative seeks to transfer the individual responsibility of water companies to a collective one, where the community is an active agent that reduces damage in the face of extreme events resulting from climate change. In the assessment of this response, we used a choice experiment to estimate the minimum amount users are willing to accept in compensation for water service interruptions. The results show that willingness to accept compensation is significant (close to 0.6 USD/hour) and decreases when users have experienced additional unplanned interruptions. The aggregate cost of the compensation is lower than infrastructure investments required to avoid service interruptions under various future hypothetical hydroclimatic scenarios associated with climate change impacts. Therefore, compensation-based instruments for water service interruptions could be a more flexible and cost-effective alternative to infrastructure-based measures to cope with future climate hazards.</jats:p>"

Every person required 33 to 35-gallon water per day for drinking and demotic purpose. But due to lack of quality, inefficient water supply designs, intermixing of sewage water and unlined sewage water system, quality of water is deteriorated specially in recent decades and affecting a number of people. In present study, it was inevitable to design a water supply system for selected area to provide safe water supply design for a small community. For this purpose, a study area was selected named as chak.no. 253 RB, Samundri Road Faisalabad. The existing water supply system of the village was built 30 years ago with the problems of leaky pipes, mixing of sewerage water with drinking water was causing water-borne diseases like Diarrhea, Cholera, Giardiasis, Typhoid fever, Schistosomiasis. A computer software abbreviated as EPANET (Environment protection agency network) was used to design a water supply system of the area providing input parameters to the software. For this a profiling survey was conducted to determine the length of pipes and the elevation of each junction. The other input parameters such as the diameter of pipes, pipe network map, head losses were provided. Conclusively, EPANET gave a detailed water supply system plan for specific design period. By adopting this design provided by detailed surveys of the area and EPANET will help to control intermixing of sewage water which ultimately improves the quality of water. The new design is based on technology by using modern techniques (Software). It will provide save and continue supply of water to community. It will also reduce the cost of water billing, leakage, decrease the diseases rate and improve the life standard of people’s lives in that area.</jats:p>",

In a two-period CLSC system consisting of one manufacturer, one retailer, and one third-service provider, a game-theoretical approach is adopted to compare the optimal decisions and profits of the three green manufacturing cooperation modes, namely, the manufacturer cooperates with the retailer and third-service provider, respectively, and the noncooperation mode is a benchmark. Moreover, the impact of different cooperation modes on CLSC decision-making is analyzed as well. The results indicate that the influence of difference among cooperation modes on CLSC decision is significant, and cooperation is always better than noncooperation. From the perspective of consumers as well as recycling and profit, although the collection rate of used products is not the highest when the manufacturer cooperates with the retailer, the price of product is the lowest and the green property of product is the most obvious; thus, this is regarded as the suitable cooperation mode after a comprehensive analysis. Besides, a coordination mechanism is designed to solve the inefficiency caused by double marginalization. Finally, numerical examples are presented to intuitively observe the relationships between decisions and profits and the impact of different parameters on them in the three modes, and some management inspirations are proposed ultimately.</jats:p>",

First, throughout most of history, both production and consumption were dramatically influenced by the weather, and activities were undertaken or curtailed according to varying availability of energy. In the future, if we again adjust energy demand to such intermittent supplies wherever and whenever possible, we can nevertheless benefit from many scientific and technological advantages that our ancestors did not have centuries ago. Second, in the pursuit of highly energy‐efficient machines that might become new sources of highly concentrated energy, we have begun to rely on “clean energy” machinery made in significant part from non‐recyclable materials. With our current generation of wind turbines, for example, we have sacrificed sustainability in the pursuit of a supposedly renewable‐energy system. By contrast, if we reduce our need for always‐on energy sources by adjusting energy demand to intermittent energy supply, we can greatly reduce the overall energy infrastructure needed, and we will face less pressure to sacrifice sustainability.</jats:p>",

The use of helium is at present concluded to be unsustainable with respect to long-term supply security, because of lack of significant recycling. There is no risk for significant helium scarcity in the short term (before 2030), but in the long term, the scarcity risk is unavoidable under business as usual. The helium supply runs into limitations by 2090, under business as usual and supply declines after that. The study shows that the present helium recycling rate is far too low, causing helium to be squandered in one-way use and that is driving helium prices up. A scenario analysis with the WORLD7 model suggests that a sustained program for helium recycling and demand management, combined with political efforts to ban unnecessary use, will be able to significantly improve the long-term helium supply situation. The outputs show that such efforts may be sufficient for avoiding any scarcity under the demand assumptions taken.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Latin America is an important contributor to the worldwide beef business, but in general, there are limited studies considering strategies to reduce nitrogen contamination in their production systems. The study’s goal was to assess the effect of two nutritional strategies to balance energy and protein supply in fattening heifers on performance, ruminal metabolism, and carcass characteristics. A total of 24 crossbred heifers (initial body weight ’BW ’of 372 ± 36 kg) were used to create two blocks (based on live weight) of two pens each, that were equipped with individual feeders. Within each block, half of the animals were assigned to a diet based on tabular Crude Protein (CP) requirements denominated Crude Protein Diet ‘CPD’ but without a ruminal degradable protein balance. The other half received a diet denominated Metabolizable Protein Diet ‘MPD’, formulated with the metabolizable protein system, balanced for the ruminal degradable protein. Both diets had the same ingredients and as well as similar synchrony indexes (0.80 and 0.83, respectively). For nitrogen concentration in feces and urine as well as microbial crude protein synthesis, a total of 12 heifers (three per pen) were randomly selected to collect samples. The dataset was analyzed as a randomized complete block design with a 5% significance. No diet × time interaction was observed for Average Daily Gain ’ADG’ (p = 0.89), but there was an effect of the time on ADG (p ≤ 0.001). No differences were observed neither for final weight, dry matter intake ’DMI’, and feed conversion rate (p &gt; 0.05). Heifers fed with CPD showed greater cold carcass weight (p = 0.041), but without differences in ribeye area, backfat thickness, pH, dressing %, and marbling (p &gt; 0.05). Differences between diets were observed for the in vitro parameters as well as for the Total Volatile Fatty Acids ’VFA’ and NH3 (p &lt; 0.05). Total N concentrations (urine + feces) of heifers fed with MDP was lower than in those fed with the CPD (p &lt; 0.01), but no differences were observed in microbial protein, purine derivatives, and creatinine (p &gt; 0.05). We conclude that the combination of synchrony and the metabolizable protein system achieve greater efficiency in the use of nitrogen, without negatively affecting animals’ performance or the quality of the carcass.</jats:p>"

The effects are larger in municipalities near the United States, with multiple cartels and with strong support for PAN (the incumbent party).

The noise level is reduced due to the use of single-phase-three-phase transformers with a rotating magnetic field and universal static converters as part of static converters, which can reduce the number of power electronic devices in the autonomous system - sources of electromagnetic interference. The basic rules of installation of equipment that reduces the electromagnetic interference were analyzed. An effective method for reducing the electromagnetic interference is application of passive reactive filters at the input and output of static converters, as well as protection of equipment from external electromagnetic fields by electrostatic shields. The methods for reducing the electromagnetic interference will increase the level of electromagnetic compatibility of equipment used as part of the autonomous power supply system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Human life depends on clean and healthy environment. However, low environmental standards lead to reduced life expectancy. Most peoples who live in the developing countries are under risk of getting clean water and any form of sanitation services. Because of this, millions of peoples are suffering from diseases associated with water. Nowadays, it needs emphasis on the accessibility of drinking water and factors which determine the supply of safe drinking water for urban households. Objectives: This study aimed to assess socio-demographic, economic and water source types that influences households drinking water supply in Debre Tabor Town, North-West Ethiopia. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study design was conducted among households from February to March 2019. An interview-based pre-tested and structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data collection samples were selected randomly and proportional to each kebeles. Epi info version 7.2.1.0, and SPSS Version 24 were used to enter and analyze the data; respectively and descriptive statistics with frequency counts and simple percentages were performed. Results: 418 households were participated. On average there were about 4.53 persons per each household. The most frequently used water source is pipe water (78.95%). Fetching water was the responsibility of females and children. Majority of the population of the town had no alternative sources, since traditional water sources were polluted by animal and human wastes. Due to high scarcity of water supply, traditional water sources were used by the residents. The time taken from home to traditional water sources was about 55.74% of the population had got their water for a trip of 15-30 minutes and 35.17% of the population 31-45 minutes, was much longer than the country average. 44.50% of the population got their water supply partially per week. 91.15% of the population was under the problem of water scarcity in the town. About 85.65% scarcity was happened due to weak administration of the concerned government bodies. Conclusion: The water supply was inadequate, and the quality was low. The median consumption was found to be 30 liters per household per day and 6.62 l/p/d, lower than the national and WHO minimum water consumption level of 20 l/p/d. Nine out of ten persons was under the problem of water scarcity in the town. The concerned government bodies should provide adequate and quality potable water facilities for the town residents.</jats:p>"

In this study, the distribution and odor producing ability of actinobacteria isolated in the Han River as a source of tap water were investigated. Actinobacteria were detected in low concentration from December to February and this gradually increased in March and April. The number of actinobacteria detected was particularly high in April (63 CFU/mL), July (45 CFU/mL), and October (39 CFU/mL) due to the influence of rainfall. Actinobacteria with geosmin-producing genes were detected mainly in March and July. In contrast, actinobacteria with 2-MIB-producing genes were detected mainly in October. There was a difference in the time when actinobacteria with the geosmin and 2-MIB-producing gene were highly detected in the river. Also, the types of actinobacteria with the geosmin and 2-MIB-producing gene were different. More than 70% of the geosmin inducer gene was isolated in Streptomyces, but the 2-MIB inducer gene was detected in various genera of actinobacteria as well as Streptomyces. The detection of odorous substances in March and October when cyanobacteria were not detected, or the detected number was low, suggested that actinobacteria could be a cause of odor inducers in the Han River.</jats:p>",

Rare earth is in the limelight as a key material for future industries because of their unique chemical, electrical, magnetic, and luminescent properties and excellent radiological shielding effects. The scarcity of REEs cannot be imagined in the successful execution of the fourth industrial revolution and the sustainable economic development, which is now in front of humanity. Therefore, it is very urgent for each country and each enterprise to understand the global rare earth production situation and take measures against the future prospects. Therefore, the paper first addresses the definition and importance of rare earths and attempts to analyze their reserves, countries and global production in detail. Next, based on the analysis of development trends in the electric vehicle industry, renewable energy and the mordern electronic industries where the use of rare earths is essential, this paper suggests a rare earth supply and demand strategy that can be referred to in the rare earth resources scarce developed countries including Europe.</jats:p>",

A promising direction is the development of uninterruptible power systems that rely on renewable energy sources and, above all, photovoltaic arrays and wind power turbines. If energy customers are located near foothill and mountain rivers, it seems economically viable to apply mini or micro-hydro power plants. The paper examines different approaches to UPS topology based on renewable energy sources. Besides renewable energy sources, power supply encompasses some traditional autonomous sources including diesel, gas piston or gas power plants. In addition, the systems provide inputs for connecting an external power system. The paper shows that agrarian production finds it relevant to develop mobile uninterruptible power systems. The authors propose some modes of operation that improve the economic performance of uninterruptible power supply by using rechargeable batteries solely during power conversion from one power source to another. The paper contains proposals developed to improve operational and technical features of uninterruptible power systems through a new topology, modular character of main functional elements and optimization of system structure.</jats:p>",

The basaltic rock suites exposed on the island were sampled to investigate the plumbing system dynamics through the study of chemical stratigraphy and temporal records of olivine crystals. Our petrographic and geochemical observations, together with the compositional variability of olivine, suggest different evolutionary histories for basaltic magmas erupted over two major periods divided by the ∼45 ka Green Tuff (GT) eruption. Core-to-rim compositional traverses across olivine crystals document different types of zoning. We recognized olivine zones affected by Fo oscillations at very fine scales in the inner cores, rims and/or in intermediate portions of crystals and used them to reconstruct the residence and passage of crystals through different magmatic environments, with P–T–ƒO2 and compositional characteristics constrained by thermodynamic modeling. The sequence of magmatic environments evidenced by olivine zoning indicate that the pre-GT volcanic period was dominated by injection at shallow crustal levels (∼300–200 MPa) of primitive melts, initially moving from a deep storage zone at the crust-mantle boundary. Supply of this magma significantly decreased after the GT eruption, while the dynamics of magma transfer within the upper portion of the plumbing system were greatly enhanced. The diffusive relaxation of olivine zoning provided the timing of storage and migration of a crystal through different environments. For magmas feeding the ancient (&amp;gt;45 ka) basaltic activity we retrieved transfer histories that are much longer (up to ∼3 years) if compared with those calculated for the post-GT basalts (1–9 months). The compositional and temporal dataset presented in this study supports the idea that the GT eruption and the subsequent collapse of the volcanic edifice could have caused major changes to the internal structural setting of Pantelleria, creating more favorable conditions for the migration of magmas in the upper portions of the plumbing system.</jats:p>",

The energy supply system can be represented by different types of the drive of the chassis of the machine: hydraulic, electrical and mechanical. Not only types of drives, but also whole systems in terms of an indicator – coefficient of performance (COP) are compared. The COP of the energy supply system takes into account the parameters of the irrigation process: the pressure of irrigation water at the entrance to the sprinkler machine (SM), the remoteness of the reservoir from the fixed support of the SM, the remoteness of the SM from the village. During the analysis, the dependencies of the COP of the hydraulic and electrical (powered from the cable line) systems on the parameters of the irrigation process were established. The conditions for ensuring the action of SM on a hydraulic drive are determined. It was found that the COP of the hydraulic system has a higher efficiency of up to 14.8% at a pressure created by the pump of more than 0.65 <jats:italic>MPa</jats:italic> with a distance of SM from the pumping station of not more than 4 <jats:italic>km</jats:italic>. In other conditions of irrigation, the efficiency of the electrical system is slightly higher – from 1.43% to 40.54%. For a reasonable choice of the energy supply system, other parameters should be taken into account, for example, the cost of the energy supply system, the lifespan of the SM, and others.</jats:p>",

Agility is an organization’s ability to respond rapidly to customers’ dynamic demands and volatile market changes. In a dynamic business environment, manufacturing firms demand agility to be evaluated to support any alarming decision. Sustainability is an aspect to sustain collaboration, value creation, and survival of firms under a dynamic competitive business scenario. Agility is a capability that drives competitiveness to foster sustainability aspects. The purpose of this article is to consider and evaluate the supply chain behavior within the context of Saudi enterprises. The efficacy and relevance of this model were explored through a case study conducted in a Saudi dairy manufacturing corporation. Owing to the complexity and a large number of calculations that are required for evaluating the agility of the supply chain, a decision support system was proposed as a tool to assess the supply chain and identifying barriers to a strategic sustainable solution for a specific organizational target. The decision support system is extensive as it contains six separate agility enablers and ninety-three agility attributes for the supply chain. The assessment was carried out using a fuzzy multi-criteria method. It combines the performance rating and importance weight of each agile supply chain-enabler-attribute. To achieve and sustain local and global success, the case organization strove to become a major local and global manufacturer to satisfy its customers, reduce its time to market, lower its total ownership costs, and boost its overall competitiveness through improving its agility across supply chain activities to foster sustainability for a manufacturing organization located in Saudi Arabia.</jats:p>"

One of them is Small and Medium Enterprise of Passion fruit. Passion fruit (passifloraceae) is one of the strategic commodities because of its usefulness as raw material of passion fruit syrup as an agroindustry product that has rich nutritional value of vitamin C which is beneficial to human health. This research has five elements of supply chainnamely : farmers, suppliers, extract agroindustry, passion fruit syrup agroindustry, and retailers.The objective of this study is to analyze whether there is a significant influence between Supply Chain Management on firm performance. This type of research was a causal research. Data collection used questionnaire. The result of multiple linear regression analysis, it showed that the variable of process integration has the biggest influence to variable of enterprise SCM performance (dependent) with coefficient value equal to (0,289), then variable of satisfaction with value (0,058), variable of trust (0,286), communication variable (0,184), dependency variable (0,021) and having the least was the variable of influence and commitment (0,080). This means that the five independent variables have a positive and significant influence on the dependent variable.</jats:p>",

The development of carbon regulations (CRs) beside carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems is part of carbon mitigation policies (CMPs), which are following in recent years to control and manage carbon liberation. Along with environemtal policies, the utilization of renewable energy resources have been promoted significantly. However, the economic opportunities for renewable energy development considering CMPs have not addressed extensively. In this study, a stochastic mathematical programming model has been presented to minimize cost and downside risk (DSR) of the bioelectricity generation supply chain considering the pre‐ and postdisaster conditions. The role of several CMPs on the economic behavior of the system has been analyzed by investigating the potential uncertainties on material availability, material quality, and consumer demand. To consider disruption effects, the postdisaster stage has been classified into several substages including damage, recovery, and back to the sustainability stages. Mississippi State after the Katrina Hurricane is addressed as a case study to examine the performance of the proposed model. The results demonstrated that the occurrence of disruptive uncertainties creates 8,978,502 $, 8,864,335 $ and 8,884,055 $ as the DSR, under carbon tax policy (CTP), carbon offset policy (COP), and CCS, respectively.

Although the financial analysis showed CTP has the greatest DSR after the occurrence of disaster, this policy has the most investment attractions, as well as COP, with the internal rate of return (IRR) of 9%. While implementing the CCS policy with the IRR of 2% creates 7% missed opportunity costs compared with other CMPs.</jats:p>",

The results showed that there were 19 activities (sub-processes), 28 risk events and 28 risk agents. The selected risk agents based on the five highest ARP values are less cleaned floor after slaughtering (Ag17), the accumulation of blood into clots (Ag20), lack of machine maintenance management (Ag2), too many cattle to be slaughtered (Ag3), and increased consumer demand (Ag1).

Tujuan penelitian ini adalah mengevaluasi penerapan persyaratan jaminan mutu dan keamanan hasil perikanan sepanjang rantai pasok bahan baku udang untuk unit pengolahan ikan (UPI) di Jakarta Utara. Dua UPI telah dipilih menjadi responden untuk dirunut ke hulu mengenai pemenuhan persyaratan dimaksud. Pengumpulan data dilakukan melalui survei, observasi dan wawancara kepada UPI, pengumpul/pemasok, pembudidaya dan pembenih. Analisis kesenjangan dan uji korelasi berganda digunakan untuk menilai kesesuaian penerapan persyaratan jaminan mutu dan keamanan hasil perikanan. Hasil identifikasi menunjukkan masih terdapat kesenjangan penerapan yang dilakukan oleh pembudidaya dan pengumpul/pemasok dengan standar yang ada. Tingkat kesesuaian pada pembudidaya 58% (kurang sesuai) dan pemasok 48% (tidak sesuai). Apresiasi UPI terhadap mutu dan keamanan hasil perikanan masih belum memadai, diduga karena permintaan di pasar global sangat tinggi sedangkan pasokannya tidak sesuai. Penerbitan sertifikat yang terpisah-pisah di antara rantai pasok diduga menjadi salah satu penyebab. Diperlukan perubahan strategi kebijakan dalam pelaksanaan sistem sertifikasi udang budidaya untuk ekspor yang terintegrasi dalam satu sertifikat.Shrimp is Indonesia's leading export commodity that requires quality and safe raw materials. To get appropriate shrimp raw materials, all members of the supply chain must apply the quality assurance and safety requirements of fishery products in accordance with Ministerial Decree KP Number: 52A/KEPMEN-KP/2013. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of quality assurance and safety requirements for fishery products along the supply chain of cultured shrimp raw material suppliers for fish processing units (UPI) in North Jakarta. Two UPIs have been selected as respondents whose suppliers were evaluated regarding the fulfillment of the specified requirements. Data collection was carried out through surveys, observations, and interviews with UPI, collectors/suppliers, farmers, and breeders. Gap analysis and multiple correlation tests were used to assess the appropriateness of the implementation of quality assurance and fishery product safety requirements. The results show that gaps existed between the implementation of the requirement by farmers and suppliers compared with existing standards. The implementation level for farmers is 58% (less according) and the supplier 48% (not according). It was observed that UPI's appreciation of the quality and safety of fishery products was inadequate, allegedly because demand in the global market is very high while the supply does not meet the demand. Issuance of separate quality and safety certificates along the supply chain are believed to be one of the causes. There is a need to change the policy strategy in implementing the shrimp culture certification system for export which can be integrated into one certificate.</jats:p>"

Based on our results using the current supply of all ventilators, demand for ventilators could be prepared for patients with COVID‐19 who would require it and demand for noninvasive ventilators could also be prepared for those with COVID‐19 who would require it. The higher supply over the demand would be achieved by flattening the epidemic curve by implementing public health interventions to delay and suppress the epidemic peak in Okinawa.</jats:p>",

The kinetic data were fitted to the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models, the maximum adsorption capacity was 60 mg/g for Pb (II), and the isotherm data were best adjusted to the Freundlich model, indicating that the adsorbent is heterogeneous. The thermodynamic study shows that the process is physisorption. The service time of columns increases as the height of columns increases, and this behavior was attributed to the active sites available in the columns. The initial concentration of Pb (II) had a significant effect on the breakthrough curves. As the concentration increases, the saturation time decreases. The material was regenerated four times (adsorption–desorption cycles), without a significant change in the removal efficiencies.</jats:p>",

Which propagules are entrained in a vector depends on how, where, and when a vector operates, but the timing and effects of vector operations on species delivery patterns is poorly resolved. Using the live marine baitworm trade, we tested vector selectivity across 3 boreal seasons (summer 2011, fall 2011, and spring 2012). We compared macroinvertebrate assemblages at the source (Maine, US east coast field) and in baitboxes upon delivery (Mid-Atlantic distributors, US east coast) and quantified live and dead biota to test for interactive effects of season and vector stage (i.e. source vs. destination) on per capita abundance, species richness, diversity, functional richness, and community composition. In all, we identified 46262 hitchhiking macro-organisms from 56 distinct taxa. Among live biota, taxonomic richness, functional group richness, and abundance differed by vector stage and season. Community composition showed seasonality for functional groups, but not for taxonomic groups. Vector stage affected dead community composition more than season, implying that vector operations (i.e. handling at source and during shipping) filter species transfers differentially. Dead communities were typically composed of the most abundant live organisms in the same baitboxes, emphasizing how important propagule pressure is to successful transport. Some combinations of 5 key functional traits (body size, feeding mode, growth form, modularity, and motility) were associated with increased survival during vector transfer. Successful species transfers are correlated with specific functional traits and propagule pressure, both of which are influenced by seasonal variation.</jats:p>",

The smart city has always regarded green and low-carbon development as one of the goals, and the carbon emissions of the auto parts industry cannot be ignored, so we should carry out energy conservation and emission reduction. With the rapid development of the domestic auto parts industry, the number of car ownership has increased dramatically, producing more and more CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and waste. Facing the pressure of resources, energy, and environment, the effective and circular operation of the auto parts supply chain under the low-carbon transformation is not only a great challenge, but also a development opportunity. Under the background of carbon emission, this paper establishes a decision-making optimization model of the low-carbon supply chain of auto parts based on carbon emission responsibility sharing and resource sharing. This paper analyzes the optimal decision-making behavior and interaction of suppliers, producers, physical retailers, online retailers, demand markets, and recyclers in the auto parts industry, constructs the economic and environmental objective functions of low-carbon supply chain management, applies variational inequality to analyze the optimal conditions of the whole low-carbon supply chain system, and finally carries out simulation calculation. The research shows that the upstream and downstream auto parts enterprises based on low-carbon competition and cooperation can effectively manage the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain through the sharing of responsibilities and resources among enterprises, so as to reduce the overall carbon emissions of the supply chain system.</jats:p>",

In this study, we have designed and operated a pilot-scale drinking water treatment unit as part of our aim to find an economic and easily operable technology for providing drinking water to people in those areas. Our small-scale treatment unit contains filtration and disinfection (UV–C irradiation) stages to remove pollutants from source water. The water quality index was determined based on various parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and bacteria. Water and media samples after DNA extraction were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq throughput sequencing for the determination of bacterial community composition. After the raw water treatment, the reduction of bacteria concentration ranged from 1 to 2 log10. The average removal of the turbidity, ammonium, nitrite, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon reached up to 95.33%, 85.71%, 100%, 28.57%, and 45%, respectively. In conclusion, multiple biological stages in our designed unit showed an improvement of the drinking water quality. The designed drinking treatment unit produces potable water meeting standards at a lower cost of operation and it can be used in remote areas.</jats:p>",

The paper proposes to improve technical and economic characteristics of APSS through modular aggregation functions and reduced number of power electronic devices constituting SPIs. The paper provides a generalized SPC topology and insights into its performance. It deals with some electric schematic diagrams for a controlled rectifier and a three-phase modular inverter, a three-phase voltage inverter based on two single-phase inverters and a single-phase-three-phase rotating-field transformer, as well as a chain diagram for a universal modular static power inverter. It is shown that modular aggregation functions of APSS static power inverters will improve reliability through back-up operations performed by the main functional units and assemblies, and reduce time intervals for their maintenance and repair. The efficiency of autonomous systems will be advanced due to a decrease in the total number of power electronic devices constituting SPIs. In addition, the level of electromagnetic interference generated by these devices will decrease. A significant technical and economic effect will be achieved by using universal modular static inverters in the APS systems, capable of passing energy flows back and forth in both directions and operating in various modes.</jats:p>",

This analysis is beneficial to support stakeholders in the Indonesian palm oil industry in designing strategic plans for making sustainable supply of palm oil. North Sumatera province has large areas of palm oil plantation and acts as one of important crude palm oil producer for Indonesia. Palm oil industry contributes to the economic and to the life of citizen in this province. To sustain supplies from palm oil plantations, social and technical aspects are necessary to maintain. Social aspects such as the behaviour of palm oil smallholders in cultivating their plantations and technical aspects such as availability of technology to support palm oil cultivation influence the supplies from plantations. Socio-Technical Framework and SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) were used to analyze the existing condition of palm oil plantation in North Sumatera Indonesia. To get supporting information, interviews with farmers, suppliers, palm oil researchers were conducted. The result indicates that there are several weaknesses and threats reducing the chance to sustain the supplies of palm oil.</jats:p>",

A series of experiments was carried out where the length of the 110 kV overhead power line varies, at the end of which a short circuit occurs, as well as the load distribution coefficient of a synchronous machine with higher than normal field-forcing ratio and the influence of these parameters on the level of residual voltage among large industrial consumers. The efficiency of using synchronous machines with a higher than normal field-forcing ratio of the excitation is estimated, and their stability under a sharp increase in loads, which cause voltage changes during the transition process and cause rotor vibrations, accompanied by magnetic losses due to the occurrence of eddy currents in the rotor core, is considered. The results of simulation presented in the Simulink are a MATLAB-based graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multi-domain dynamical systems.</jats:p>",

The results showed that treated water residual aluminum concentration was less than 0.1 mg/L regardless of the seasonal change of raw water aluminum concentration. The addition of secondary flocculation had a negligible influence on treated water residual aluminum concentration due to the efficient removal of particulate aluminum by sand filter. Residual aluminum concentration of treated water was lower (mean 0.037 mg/L) in summer (average water temperature was 29 °C) than that (mean 0.067 mg/L) in winter (average water temperature was 16 °C). Significant positive relationships between particulate aluminum concentration and particle counts, as well as the total aluminum concentration of treated water and turbidity, were found. Those relationships provided the possibility to estimate residual aluminum concentration by monitoring particle counts and turbidity.</jats:p>",

The efficiency and cost of water quality storage tanks, which can prevent and control urban pollution effectively, are significantly affected by their locations. However, few studies have determined the location of decentralized storage tanks with consideration of the characteristics of initial rainwater quality, which has led to unsatisfactory or extravagant design. Therefore, a new design strategy is proposed to optimize the locations of water quality storage tanks using the InfoWorks ICM model in this study. It includes two basic steps. Firstly, the pollution severity of each node in the corresponding subcatchment is evaluated and ranked through the matter element analysis method and analytic hierarchy process. Secondly, all the nodes are precisely sorted by their excessive multiples using the single factor index method. Its application in the design of the decentralized storage tank locations in Fuzhou, China, proved that the proposed strategy can reduce the total volume of decentralized storage tanks to 0.38 times that of a terminal tank. The strategy presented in this study may also be useful in other research on storage tank design in urban pollution prevention and control systems.</jats:p>",

IWS consumers typically adopt a range of strategies to cope with insufficient water supply, poor drinking water quality, and associated inconveniences. In this study, we collected a range of data from small-scale utilities and households in two IWS systems and two continuous water supply (CWS) systems, as well as from comparison groups, in Shandong and Hubei provinces. Data collection included water quality testing, interviews, and surveys on behavioral adaptations, coping strategies, water-related health perceptions, and other metrics of consumer satisfaction. Overall, we found that the IWS coping strategies employed in northern China (Shandong) were associated with generally safe, but inconvenient, water access, whereas adaptation strategies observed in southern China (Hubei) appeared to improve convenience, but not water quality. Compared to the CWS comparison groups, we did not observe significant differences in water- and sanitation-related behaviors in the IWS groups, suggesting interventions to increase adaptive and protective behaviors at the household level might further improve safe water access for households living with IWS. Overall, although the water supply infrastructure in these study areas appeared to be in relatively good condition, in contrast to reported data on IWS systems in other countries, we observed multiple risk factors associated with the water treatment and distribution processes in these IWS systems. Among policy recommendations, our results suggest that the implementation of Water Safety Plans in China would likely improve the management of drinking water treatment and, by extension, safe drinking water supply under conditions of IWS.</jats:p>"

Various literatures aim to solve problems regarding patterns of economic growth as well as about the determinants wherein the analysis volatility models are used. Some indicators of economic growth are money supply, inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates. Economic variables are recorded as time series data with different periods, and hence temporal aggregation is required to analyze. Economic time series data showing the existence of long memory and structural breaks, which leads to the difficulty on explaining the data only with a general model. Therefore, both long memory models and structural break are proposed to be taken into account in the model. In this analysis, the residual from a linear combination of economic variables follows a long memory process indicating a cointegration relationship between these variables. This paper models GDP volatility based on money supply, inflation, interest rate and exchange rate volatility in Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore using the Fractional Cointegration model with long memory and structural break. The analysis shows that structural break is only found in the volatility of GDP of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore while the nature of long memory is found in almost all economic variables’ volatility. Furthermore, we found the cointegration model, stationary and persistent noise in all countries.</jats:p>",

These associations were not altered by further adjustments for age, BMI, HbA1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

It is established that the bioenergy potential of agricultural biomass is an efficient and affordable additional source of energy supply for Ukraine. According to the research, the potential of the bioenergy market was attributed to the great potential of biomass, the large stock of unused land that could be used for growing energy crops from the marketing side, it is also important to note the low competition in the industry. However, imperfect state policy on bioenergy development, outdated equipment, uncoordinated rules for selling electricity from biomass in the electricity market – all this suggests that the industry needs increased investment, borrowing experience from European countries for further development. It is proved that the political and economic situation in the country remains very difficult and unpredictable not only for the bioenergy industry, but for the country as a whole.</jats:p>",

In June and September 2012, we measured the concentrations of cyanobacteria and actinomycetes, and geosmin, to identify the source of geosmin in the Paldang reservoir. A total of 68 water samples were collected from two sampling sites (Sambong, Paldang), and used to analyze the correlation between cyanobacteria, actinomycetes, and geosmin. The cell density attained a maximum of 24,722 cells/mL on August 11, 2012 and geosmin occurred at a high concentration of 3,934 ng/L on August 13 in Sambong. After July 31, 2012 a rapid increase in growth and cell density occurred with a peak value of 11,568 cells/mL on August 6, 2012. At the same time, the geosmin concentration increased to 3,157 ng/L in Paldang. The number of cyanobacteria positively correlated with geosmin concentration (R2 = 0.84, P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while actinomycetes were not significantly correlated with geosmin (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.709). In addition, the number of actinomycetes was associated with increased turbidity (R = 0.507). Among the various water quality constituents, temperature affected cyanobacteria in the Paldang reservoir (R = 0.803). These results suggest that cyanobacteria are the main source of geosmin in the Paldang reservoir, which might be providing useful information for managing the unpleasant taste of its drinking water.</jats:p>",

The challenge of export distribution of palm oil refining products to generate maximum profit with minimum distribution costs, among others, is high transportation costs, distant transportation / logistics destinations, variations in product types and allocation of the number of products that must be distributed to consumers (foreign markets). The purpose of this study is to maximize profits and minimize distribution costs from the export distribution network of Indonesian palm oil refining products. Multiple goal optimization model (multi objective optimization) with the completion of soft-computing techniques is needed to solve this problem in order to get optimum results with a short solution search time. The NSGA-II algorithm (non dominated sorting algorithm II) was chosen in the completion of the existing optimization model because of the characteristics of the distribution network of export products resulting from complex refining of palm oil. The scenario used for testing the optimization model is by using a system entity consisting of three types of Indonesian palm oil refining products (Stearin RBD, Olein and PFAD RBD).</jats:p>",

However, the water quality has seen a deterioration tendency in recent decades, mostly owing to unreasonable human activities such as lake enclosure aquaculture following rapid social and economic development. Based on the water quality index (WQI) method, the water quality of Honghu Lake, by the vast amount of data collected from five observation sites monitored over ten years, was analyzed and evaluated. The results show that: (i) the water quality of Honghu Lake is in the ‘General’ grade as a whole with a WQI value of 43.41 ± 6.66; (ii) the water quality has been improving in the recent two years, reversing its decade-long deterioration; (iii) the water quality sampled at the Lantian site is the worst while that of the Guandun site is the best; (iv) the concentration of Pb and Cd are the key parameters to determine the water quality of Honghu Lake.

Oil palm empty bunches have C and H chemical bonds, where most of the materials with chains C and H store heat energy so that hydrogen can be obtained as fuel. Process to convert a biomass into hydrogen is by gasification and pyrolysis. The purpose in this research is to design the distribution network from the potential fresh fruit empty bunches. The hydrogen produced is only 0.469% of the available potential and is similar to the existing of the used empty bunches potential. Selection of factory location is based on 4 criteria. From the criteria, obtained Labuhan Batu District as the best regencies in North Sumatra. Potential plantations can supply as much as 6,390,423,000 kgs with the ability of oil palm factory distribution of 1,469,797,290 kgs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper focuses on the development of secondary ports in the circular economy model (as a node of circular supply chains) to implement sustainable seaports in the context of the structural changes taking place in the global economy, trade, and maritime transport. The purpose of this article is to identify the opportunities, challenges, and key actions to be taken by secondary ports in circular supply chains. The research method applied was a single case study. The object of the study was the seaport of Szczecin (Poland). Our study showed that the secondary ports lacking technical conditions to serve large vessels, but with available space to develop their transshipment, storage, industrial, distribution, and logistics activities, may become major participants in circular supply chains. Taking advantage of the opportunities associated with participating secondary ports in the circular supply chain requires facing a number of challenges identified in the current literature, such as return-flow uncertainty, transport and infrastructure, the availability of suitable supply chain partners, coordination and information sharing, product traceability, and cultural issues. Our study partially confirms the significance of these challenges for secondary ports. The significance of these challenges depends on the kind of circular supply chain, i.e., whether the supply chain is a producer or a consumer chain. Our study shows that a very important challenge for both types of chains is the problem of internal resistance to change. This still-unsolved issue involves the persistent linear mindset of the port authority, which is manifested mainly as investor evaluation policy based exclusively on the declared annual transshipment volume, which fails to take actions to provide the available land plots with the infrastructure necessary for the terminals and industrial plants that participate in circular supply chains. Simultaneously, for secondary ports, we proved that it is stevedores (who are flexible and fast in adapting to new market conditions, strongly determined to search for new cargo types to replace those that have vanished, and who adapt the scope of their services) who play a key role in stimulating the development of circular supply chains. As a main managerial implication for the authorities of secondary ports, such authorities should create appropriate policies for investor assessments and the utilisation of available areas within the port premises to encourage the enterprises engaged in circular supply chains to invest in and develop their businesses within the port’s premises. It is also necessary to develop appropriate communication between port authorities and their external stakeholders. As a managerial implication for the stevedores in secondary ports, these entities should first develop their service offers to address cargo as part of the circular supply chains (with more comprehensive service offers and added-value services, such as freight forwarding services, stuffing, packing, and mixing of cargo) and develop cooperation with other stakeholders of circular supply chains.</jats:p>"

In this study, we use the water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model to quantitatively analyze the effects of the water resource policies on the balance between the supply and demand of water resources in Beijing and predict the water demand and shortages in Beijing from 2019 to 2035. The simulation results indicate that at the watershed scale, different levels of water shortage can be observed in the five major watersheds under different scenarios. By 2035, the unmet demand in the Beiyunhe river basin will be the most serious, accounting for ⩾45.48% of the total unmet demand. The policy constraints play a crucial role in alleviating the supply-and-demand imbalance of water resources. Different policies can be used to reduce the total water demand; however, the population growth control policies exhibit the greatest effect on the alleviation of water resource shortage in Beijing and can reduce the water demand by 3.42 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> when compared with that in a scenario without any control policy. The results of this study can provide important references to solve the urban water resource supply and demand imbalances and realize rational allocation of the water resources.</jats:p>",

This concept was developed and tested by the situation of Assyrian settlements along the Ḫābūr River with a part of the available archaeology data. Further discussions between experts on water management and archaeology could improve this concept. Displaying water management is an essential contribution to the understanding of the canal system along the Lower Ḫābūr River and its importance for the local population. Extensive research into the processing and incorporation of all available data can further refine the route of the canal.

In this paper, we consider a poverty-alleviation supply chain composed of one supplier in a poor area and one producer helping the supplier reduce poverty by fulfilling Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Our work aims at examining the impacts of government subsidies and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on the poverty-alleviation operations. Four game-theoretic models are constructed and analyzed to investigate the impacts of coefficients of government subsidies and CSR cost sharing on the supplier’s and producer’s profits, social welfare growth, CSR level, wholesale price, output of the supplier, and retail price. Our findings suggest that the most effective poverty-alleviation mechanism in most cases is the combination of government subsidies and market efforts. Contrary to common beliefs that companies have to sacrifice profit for social responsibility, we show that poverty alleviation is reconcilable with profit maximization and social welfare improvement, and companies can achieve a win-win situation of both poverty alleviation and profitability. Our work provides new insights for sustainable poverty alleviation and socially sustainable operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. We present results from an experimental campaign run in a steep flume subject to longitudinal width variations and different sediment feed rates. The experiments were designed to study how sediment supply influences step formation, step location, and step stability. Our results show that steps are more likely to form in narrowing areas (i.e., where the channel width is getting smaller moving downstream) because of particle jamming, and these steps are also more stable. Sediment supply increases particle activity generating a more dynamic channel morphology with more steps forming and collapsing. However, sediment supply does not inhibit step formation, since more steps are generated in experiments with sediment feed than without it. Time-series of step formation, evolution, and destruction show that the maximum number of steps is achieved for average values of sediment supply. We summarize this outcome in a conceptual model where the dependence of step frequency on sediment supply is expressed by a bell curve. Sediment yield measured at the channel outlet followed the sediment feed at the inlet closely, even when we fed 50 % more and 50 % less than the transport capacity. This outcome challenges the applicability of the concept of transport capacity to steep channels and highlights the key role played by sediment supply for channel stability and sediment transport. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between sediment concentration and step destruction, which highlights the key role played by granular jamming for step formation and stability.\n                        </jats:p>"

The equivalent circuit model and mathematical model of each subnet are established with distribution parameters, especially the cable capacitance effect be considered. Then, according to the two‐port network analysis theory, the system equivalent circuit is constructed by considering the electrical connection relationship, system harmonic impedance expression is calculated. Resonance influence factors and harmonic transmission mechanisms are analysed. Finally, theoretical analysis validity is verified in simulation; harmonic transmission characteristics CCTPSS including traction cable and overhead catenary, are studied.

In this paper, we focus on retail service, manufacturer’s direct service and quality effort, and present an analytical framework to examine the optimal decisions in dual-channel supply chain between the manufacturer and the retailer. Considering the efficacy of different supply chain structures, centralized and decentralized models are established. By using the backwards induction and the two-stage optimization technique in Stackelberg game, the corresponding analytical equilibrium solutions are obtained. Our analysis shows that the degree of customer loyalty to the direct channel strongly influences the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s services and quality strategies in the decentralized dual-channel supply chain, but not in the centralized model. Our results also point out that compared to centralized model, for any given selling price, the ratio of profit margins of selling one unit in the direct and retail channels determines the retailer’s service strategy; and the manufacturer will raise the level of direct channel service, but put less effort on quality improvement in the decentralized model. Finally, numerical examples present the contrasting view that disparate interests within a dual-channel supply chain can actually realize improving outcomes.</jats:p>",

The objective is the production of customized products at the cost of a mass-produced product. The widespread entry of cyber-physical systems enables a networking of all entities. The introduction of cyber-physical systems in production and logistic systems dissolves existing rigid structures and as a result versatile cyber-physical production systems occur. To support the flexibility of the cyber-physical production systems, the production supply needs to be adapted. For this reason, this paper proposes a novel universal production supply concept. This concept introduces a decentralized controlled supply. It is executed by several cyber-physical system entities, which are represented by software agents. These agents negotiate autonomously with each other. The novel concept was implemented in a research lab and evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative evaluation, the efficiency of the novel concept is evaluated and compared with a kanban supply. An innovative key performance indicator system called process status indicators evaluates the efficiency. The result of this indicator system states that the novel concept is more efficient than the kanban supply.</jats:p>",

There have been found the specific features of fuel supply and the influence of the alternative fuel on the injection characteristics of standard fuel supply equipment during operation in nominal and partial modes. In evaluating the quality of fuel equipment operation on a water-fuel emulsion there were taken into account the following facts: changing of the fuel supply characteristics; changing injection parameters; type of fuel spraying in the initial and final phases of injection and reduction of fuel proportion supplied during the needle landing period; greater stability of successive injection cycles by increasing the active stroke of the plunger by 25-30%; features of injection processes due to thermal explosion effect. The telegraph equation for the unsteady fuel motion in a high pressure pipeline is obtained. The operation parameters of a marine diesel engine 6CHSPN2A 18/22 (DRA-300) are considered in nominal mode according to the screw characteristic for diesel fuel and water-fuel emulsion: plunger stroke of the high-pressure fuel pump; maximum pressure of the steady state in the connecting pipe; average integral pressure of the steady state in the nozzle, which determines the quality of spraying, the speed of landing of the sprayer needle on the saddle; amount of fuel supplied during the needle landing period; cyclic fuel supply; duration of the main injection; stability criterion of fuel supply processes in successive cycles, etc. It has been inferred that water-fuel emulsions can take a separate place in the list of alternative fuels, which will contribute to improving the quality of traditional fuels, productive burnout of hydrocarbon, nitrogen-hydrogen mixture, spirit mixtures, etc. due to the rational introducing additives into fuel, increasing the reliability indicators of cylinder-piston parts, etc.</jats:p>",

Through comparative analysis and numerical analysis, this research shows that, among four decision-making models, the highest system profit can be achieved when the seller provides the EW service and the e-platform dominates the system. For electronic commerce supply chain enterprises, whether to dominate the system or to provide EW service, it is conducive to the increase of profits. When the e-platform provides the EW service, the conclusion is that who dominates the system is the one who gets more profit. However, when the seller provides the EW service, the conclusion is that who dominates the system is the one who gets less profit. When the EW service is offered by the dominating enterprise, service levels of the e-platform are lower.</jats:p>",

The monthly suspended sediment concentration data of Huayuankou hydrological station from 1960 to 2014 were ‘decomposed-predicted-reconstructed’ and compared with single gated recurrent unit (GRU), support vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results reveal that the CEEMDAN-GRU coupling model has provided a superior alternative to the single model and its determination coefficients (DC) of the training set and testing set are greater than 0.71, qualified rate (QR) reaches up to 81%, average absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean square error (MSE) are 1.2841, 0.9675 and 4.3560 respectively. It is proved that the CEEMDAN-GRU model has a better performance and can be used in the mid- and long-term prediction of non-linear and non-stationary suspended sediment concentration series.</jats:p>",

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency are to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk‐averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID‐19 pandemic by FEMA to different U.S. states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non‐COVID‐19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20 000 ventilators (as of March 23, 2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non‐COVID‐19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top‐most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (until May 31, 2020) is about 232 000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17 200 ventilators on April 19, 2020. Results are also reported for a worst‐case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. An important finding of this study is that a central agency (FEMA) can act as a coordinator for sharing critical resources that are in short supply over time to add efficiency in the system. Moreover, through properly managing risk‐aversion of different entities (states) additional efficiency can be gained. An additional implication is that ramping up production early in the planning cycle allows to reduce shortfall significantly. An optimal timing of this production ramp‐up consideration can be based on a cost‐benefit analysis.</jats:p>",

On the basis of the measurements it is concluded that in the spectral composition of current drawn by the frequency Converter, in addition to currents the main harmonic component is dominated by currents 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17th harmonics, i.e. harmonic components of odd non-multiple of three. Currents 3, 9 and 15 th harmonic components are also present in the spectral composition, but their value is much smaller. Also, based on the data obtained, it can be argued that with a decrease in the frequency of motor speed control and the load value of the frequency Converter, the number of pulsations on the current waveform increases, as a result, there is an increase in the values of the higher harmonic components and an increase in the value of the total harmonic components of the current. The main contribution to the increase in the index of the total harmonic components of the amperage with a decrease in the load of the frequency Converter and the output frequency of the motor speed control is made by odd harmonic components of the amperage multiple of three, at the same time harmonic components of the amperage non-multiple of three, namely the 5th and 7th order, are not subject to change. A brief review of technical solutions aimed at improving the electromagnetic compatibility of asynchronous frequency-controlled drive is given. In particular, such solutions as increasing the number of semiconductor switches used in inverters, improving control modes, the use of special separation transformers, passive (resonant) and active filters are noted.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, in this study, flexibility provision from both generation and demand sides are considered in a day‐ahead scheduling problem. Fast start gas‐fired units, due to their agility in starting‐up and high ramping capabilities are considered as generation side flexibility providers. However, the normal operation of these units strictly depends on a secure gas supply through connected gas pipelines. Thus, gas‐supply uncertainty is considered in the proposed model to mimic the impacts of deviations in gas volume through pipelines. On the other hand, demand response programs (DRPs) with their specific characteristics are among powerful demand side flexibility providers. However, unlike the existing literature that considers a supplementary role for DRPs, this study introduces the main role for DRPs as flexibility providers through comprehensive modelling of versatile DRPs. The proposed day‐ahead scheduling problem is a multi‐resolution robust security constrained unit commitment that the robustness comes from the decision making against sub‐hourly gas‐supply uncertainty and wind power variability. The applicability of the proposed model is tested on both an 8‐bus and IEEE‐118‐bus standard test systems.</jats:p>",

In this study, we developed an experimental system to model the endoderm‐generating gastrulation process using epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). To this end, we established an EpiSC line i22, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein is coexpressed with <jats:italic>Foxa2</jats:italic>. Culturing i22 EpiSCs as aggregates for a few days was sufficient to initiate <jats:italic>Foxa2</jats:italic> expression, and further culturing of the aggregates in Matrigel promoted the sequential activation of transcription factor genes involved in endoderm precursor development, e.g., <jats:italic>Eomes</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Gsc</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Sox17</jats:italic>. In aggregation culture of i22 cells for 3 days, all cells expressed POU5F1, SOX2, and E‐cadherin, a signature of the epiblast, whereas expression of GATA4 and SOX17 was also activated moderately in dispersed cells, suggesting priming of these cells to endodermal development. Embedding the aggregates in Matrigel for further 3 days elicited migration of the cells into the lumen of laminin‐rich matrices covering the aggregates, in which FOXA2 and SOX17 were expressed at a high level with the concomitant loss of E‐cadherin, indicating the migratory phase of endodermal precursors. Prolonged culturing of the aggregates generated three segregating cell populations found in post‐gastrulation stage embryos: (1) definitive endoderm co‐expressing high SOX17, GATA4, and E‐cadherin, (2) mesodermal cells expressing a low level of GATA4 and lacking E‐cadherin, and (3) primed epiblast cells expressing POU5F1, SOX2 without E‐cadherin. Thus, aggregation of EpiSCs followed by embedding of aggregates in the laminin‐rich matrix models the gastrulation‐dependent endoderm precursor development.</jats:p>",

Alternative options explored include extended‐release tacrolimus (ER‐TAC) formulations, cyclosporine, belatacept, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and novel uses of induction therapy for maintenance immunosuppression. Of available alternatives, only ER‐TAC formulations are of non‐inferior efficacy compared to IR‐TAC when used de novo or after conversion in stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). All other alternatives were associated with higher rates of biopsy‐proven rejection, but improved tolerance from classic adverse effects of IR‐TAC including nephrotoxicity and development of diabetes. While most alternative therapies are approved in KTRs, access via third‐party payors is an obstacle in non‐KTRs. In the setting of IR‐TAC shortage, alternate therapeutic options may be plausible depending on the organ population and individual patient situation to ensure appropriate, effective immunosuppression for each patient.</jats:p>",

Successful intercity environmental cooperation relies on the clear identification and definition of the rights and obligations of each city. An Ecosystem services (ES) approach not only budgets the ES supply and demand of a city, but also defines the spatial relationships between Services Provisioning Areas (SPA) and Services Benefiting Areas (SBA). However, to date, quantitative studies integrating ES budgets and spatial relations have been scarce. This study integrates ecosystem services supply–demand budgeting with flow direction analysis to identify intercity environmental cooperation in the highly urbanized Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China for water-related ecosystem services (flood protection, erosion regulation and water purification). The results demonstrated that there were significant spatial mismatches in the supply and demand of three water-related ES among 16 core cities in the YRD region: five to six cities in the southern part of the region had significant service surpluses, while ten to 11 cities in the north–central part had significant service deficits. We then went on to offer definitions for Ecosystem Services Surplus City, Ecosystem Services Deficit City and Ecosystem Services Balance City, as well as Service Provisioning City, Service Benefiting City and Service Connecting City in which to categorize cities in the YRD Region. Furthermore, we identified two intercity cooperation types and two non-cooperation types. This framework can be used to promote ecological integration in highly urbanized regions to advance sustainable development.</jats:p>"

Considering the coexistence of channel cooperation and channel competition after the implementation of BOPS, we investigate the impact of BOPS on equilibrium results. Then we study the optimal cooperative advertising and pricing strategy of the O2O supply chain. We also identify the effectiveness of cooperative advertising on the O2O supply chain and supply chain members. We find that the implementation of BOPS can partially substitute the incentive effect of cooperative advertising. In addition, convenience coefficient and commission rate, the two key factors of BOPS, have opposite impacts on optimal decisions in most conditions. Therefore, the optimal strategy depends on the balance of the above two factors. Furthermore, we find that cooperative advertising does not always benefit the O2O supply chain and its members.</jats:p>",

При этом в данных работах не изучен вопрос влияния подачи сжатого воздуха между тормозными колодками и тормозным барабаном в процессе торможения машины на степень износа фрикционных поверхностей барабанного тормозного механизма.

Объектом экспериментального исследования стали тормозные механизмы барабанного типа. Предметом исследования стал процесс изнашивания фрикционных поверхностей тормозных механизмов. Для проведения экспериментального исследования были определены максимальные и минимальные значения варьируемых факторов: частота повторений (срабатываний) на рабочем органе тормозного механизма в пределах тридцатиминутного интервала соответственно 216 и 156 и давление жидкости в тормозной системе – 7 и 5 МПа.

At the same time these works do not cover the issue of how the compressed air supplied between brake pads and brake drum during vehicle braking would affect the wear rate of drum brake friction surfaces. To do this, one should look into the organization and planning of experimental research tests for friction and wear between brake pads and brake drum during braking with compressed air supply. The object of experimental test was the drum brakes. The subject of research was the process of brake friction surfaces’ wear. For the purposes of experimental tests the max and min limit values for variables were defined, i.e. repeat (recurrence) rate for brake actuator within thirty minute interval to be 216 and 156 correspondingly, and brake system fluid pressure to be 7 and 5 MPa. The output value of experimental research was the wear of brake linings (in grams) on both the experimental and non-experimental brake. The experimental research involved the use of a single-factor experiment method with a test bench. The aim of experimental research test organization and planning is to obtain the data about the observed dependence of brake friction surfaces’ wear rate on the defined variables with compressed air supply between brake pads and brake drum during braking, and to make their qualitative analysis. This methodology of experiment planning will make it possible to conduct the experimental reserach test on the wear of vehicle brake friction couples and to give the competent description of this process.</jats:p>",

The experimental results revealed that the performance of the system was improved by virtue of efficient heat recovery resulting from combining two AGMD membrane modules in series. Under optimal inlet operating parameters of cooling water temperature of 20 °C, salinity of 0.05% and flow rate of 3 l/min, the system productivity (Pp) increased up to 192.9%, 179.3%, 176.5% and 179.2%, and the thermal efficiency (ηth) by 261.5%, 232.6%, 239.4% and 227.3% at feed water temperatures of 45 °C, 55 °C, 65 °C and 75 °C, respectively.

Supplies of N95 respirators can become depleted during pandemics or when otherwise in high demand. In this paper, we offer strategies for optimizing supplies of N95 respirators in health care settings while maximizing the level of protection offered to health care personnel when there is limited supply in the United States during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. The strategies are intended for use by professionals who manage respiratory protection programs, occupational health services, and infection prevention programs in health care facilities to protect health care personnel from job-related risks of exposure to infectious respiratory illnesses. Consultation with federal, state, and local public health officials is also important. We use the framework of surge capacity and the occupational health and safety hierarchy of controls approach to discuss specific engineering control, administrative control, and personal protective equipment measures that may help in optimizing N95 respirator supplies.</jats:p>",

To increase the reliability of feedstocks supply, a government can offer two types of subsidy program: a farmer subsidy program (FSP) and a bioenergy producer subsidy program (PSP). We develop models to analyze the optimal subsidy program by capturing the interactions between the government, the bioenergy producer, and the farmers. The models incorporate the subsidy budget constraint, the environmental benefits from the use of bioenergy, the farmer's risk aversion and land capacity constraint, as well as the yield uncertainty of feedstocks. The findings reveal that both FSP and PSP are effective as long as the farmers' land capacity exceeds a threshold. If both the subsidy budget and the land capacity are sufficiently large, PSP outperforms FSP; if only the subsidy budget is limited, FSP is better; if only the land capacity is limited, FSP and PSP are equivalent. Counter‐intuitively, we find that PSP always favors farmers more, while FSP favors the bioenergy producer more under certain conditions. Also, we find that FSP can better mitigate risk than PSP when yield uncertainty is high. Lastly, insights for policy makers to promote bioenergy development are highlighted.</jats:p>",

The objective of this work was to enhance the empirical understanding of the SNS of dairy grasslands on peat soils, using soil properties and weather variables. Data were collected from studies on herbage N uptake carried out between 1992 and 2017 in the western peat district of the Netherlands. For the period between March to mid October, SNS was estimated from the sum of mean growing season daily temperatures, soil organic matter (SOM) and applied calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) N with a residual standard error of 25–27 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Each °C growing season temperature sum affected SNS by 78–90 g ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and each g SOM per 100 g dry soil affected SNS by 3.6–3.9 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. SNS was equally estimated for conditions with and without CAN fertilisation. Validation with data from independent field trials showed similar impacts of SOM and growing season temperature sum on SNS. The error of prediction of the presented models, however, was still too large for direct on-farm application and led to underestimations for a specific site. Nevertheless, the obtained models allow for an increased understanding of soil and farm N balances. The models can therefore be used for improved temporal and spatial SNS-adapted farming practice advice, which can potentially lead to reduced soil and farm N surpluses.</jats:p>",

This study analyzes the production and coordination decisions of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) by establishing two assumptions of endogenous and exogenous CSR. The results reveal that, for ordinary consumers, CSR is quantified as the parameter of consumer surplus, which has an impact on the patent licensing fee, revenue-sharing ratio, and so on, and which not only increases the sales quantity in CLSC but also creates more value for the manufacturer and the retailer. Considering endogenous CSR, the study found that the manufacturer’s CSR level and the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s profits both increase with the proportion of CSR-sensitive consumers. In the endogenous model, the manufacturer sets a higher wholesale price and lower patent licensing fee than in the exogenous model. Perfect coordination in the two models can be achieved by setting a revenue-sharing ratio related to wholesale price and patent licensing fee. In practice, improving the social responsibility consciousness of consumers and raising enterprises’ CSR level can achieve a win-win situation for revenues and social welfare.</jats:p>",

On average, 1–6 MPs with sizes ranging between 124 μm and 1.53 mm were detected per individual. However, the highest number (34) of MPs was detected in the stomach of <jats:italic>SM</jats:italic>. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) identified ecological variables such as habitat, feeding mode, and trophic levels as critical factors that may determine and influence MP uptake in fish population. The PCA showed stronger association between fish habitat, feeding mode, and trophic level with MP size and number in the benthopelagic species (ON CZ and SM), compared to demersal species (PO CN HO and LN). Given that MPs can act as vectors for the transfer of pathogens and environmental contaminants (both legacy and emerging), in addition to direct health risks to aquatic organisms, our findings raise concerns on the potential human/wildlife health effects of MPs in these economically and ecologically important food fishes.</jats:p>",

To solve this problem, a blind heading face in a plateau metal mine in western China was taken as the physical model, and the computational fluid dynamics was used to analyze the oxygen mass fraction distribution and oxygen-increasing effect in 1 m, 3 m, and 5 m roadway sections from the heading face. The optimal ventilation system was first built to obtain the optimum height and length of the airflow ducts. Then different cases with various oxygen supply duct designs were built in 2 scenarios. The results found that different oxygen supply duct design has significant influence on the oxygen distribution in the heading face. Also, each design has different optimal height of oxygen outlet. The oxygen supply effect is best when some small holes are made in the oxygen supply duct to diffuse oxygen to the working surface. The finding of this paper is helpful for effective and economical oxygen supply in roadway excavation of plateau metal mine and tunnel.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We consider the problem of selling perishable items to a stream of buyers in order to maximize social welfare. A seller starts with a set of identical items, and each arriving buyer wants any one item, and has a valuation drawn i.i.d. from a known distribution. Each item, however, disappears after an a priori unknown amount of time that we term the horizon for that item. The seller knows the (possibly different) distribution of the horizon for each item, but not its realization till the item actually disappears. As with the classic prophet inequalities, the goal is to design an online pricing scheme that competes with the prophet that knows the horizon and extracts full social surplus (or welfare). Our main results are for the setting where items have independent horizon distributions satisfying the monotone-hazard-rate (MHR) condition. Here, for any number of items, we achieve a constant-competitive bound via a conceptually simple policy that balances the rate at which buyers are accepted with the rate at which items are removed from the system. We implement this policy via a novel technique of matching via probabilistically simulating departures of the items at future times. Moreover, for a single item and MHR horizon distribution with mean, we show a tight result: There is a fixed pricing scheme that has competitive ratio at most 2 - 1/μ, and this is the best achievable in this class. We further show that our results are best possible. First, we show that the competitive ratio is unbounded without the MHR assumption even for one item. Further, even when the horizon distributions are i.i.d. MHR and the number of items becomes large, the competitive ratio of any policy is lower bounded by a constant greater than 1, which is in sharp contrast to the setting with identical deterministic horizons.</jats:p>",

Pure NaBH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> or alumina‐supported NaBH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and methanol were used as co‐reactants and 100% fatty alcohol selectivities were achieved.

When alumina‐supported NaBH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> was used, a final fatty alcohol yield of 93% was achieved. The use of methanol and NaBH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> in amounts higher than stoichiometric is important to generate alkoxyborohydride anions which act as better reducing species than NaBH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>. The reaction conditions effect was investigated and the role of short carbon chain alcohol structure was elucidated. The effect of fatty acid methyl ester structure was also studied. Fatty acid methyl esters with shorter carbon chain length and without unsaturation (methyl laurate, methyl myristate) were easily reduced using NaBH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and methanol reaching high conversions and fatty alcohol selectivities. Unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester with longer carbon chain (methyl oleate) introduced steric hindrance which disfavoured interaction between ester and reducing solid surface and fatty acid methyl ester conversion was noticeably lower. A reaction mechanism based on alkoxyborohydride anions as the actual reducing species was proposed. This mechanism fully interprets results obtained during fatty acid methyl ester reduction using short carbon chain alcohols and metal hydride.</jats:p>",

In the past 30 years, the population in China has converged to large-scale cities, which brought a severe housing issue, not least for migrants. In order to relieve the tension between the increasing demand for housing and the scarcity of urban resources, research on housing policy in response to urban growth is a matter of cardinal significance. This paper made an effort to explore the mechanism of public housing policies coordinated with urban growth management. Taking Chongqing City as the study area, the system dynamics model was adopted in exploring the coordination mechanism. The impact of the two policies were simulated, including the urban population control and public housing supply. The results indicated that the combined policy could more effectively cope with the possible urban housing crisis under the long-term trend, and promote urban inclusive growth. Meanwhile, the starting time of intervention also has a significant impact on the policy effect.

The error correction models of rainfall and runoff in these two cases are constructed. The results show that reservoir construction and climate change can cause structure change in the long-run relationship between rainfall and runoff in the source area of the Yellow River. The breakpoints appeared in 1989 and 2002, in which the breakpoint in 1989 is mainly effected by reservoir construction while in 2002 it is effected by rainfall changes. Meanwhile, the error correction model with structural change shows that the impact of rainfall on runoff decreases from 1989 but increases from 2002. Finally, for the prediction of runoff in the next five years, the mean absolute percentage errors of the prediction models without and with breakpoints are 11.04% and 7.08% respectively, and this shows that the error correction model with structural change has the higher runoff prediction accuracy.</jats:p>",

The strain gauges and transmitters on the rotating shaft are driven by a high-frequency induction power system. Their installation, debugging, and maintenance are cumbersome, and their very low power transmission efficiency (PTE) has become a challenging problem for online telemetry systems. In this paper, a magnetic coupling resonant wireless power supply method is utilized to replace the high-frequency induction power supply. Through theoretical and experimental research, it is concluded that the magnetically coupled resonant wireless power supply method can realize long-distance power supply, overcoming many shortcomings of the high-frequency induction power supply system. In the laboratory, a maximum PTE of 83.7% is obtained for a transmission distance of 50 mm. Under the influence of environmental factors common for the transmission shaft of a rolling mill, the PTE decreases by 34%, but normal operation of the system can be achieved by adjusting the compensation capacitance. The proposed system provides a guarantee for a long-term stable power supply on the measured axis of a rolling mill torque online telemetry system.</jats:p>",

The average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), organic nitrogen (Org-N), ammonium nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen in the sediments of the ten estuaries were 1315.5, 1220.1, 82.53 and 6.45 mg/kg, with the organic fraction dominating. Results showed a significant difference for the TN concentration in sediments of different estuaries, which was mainly caused by geographical location, land use type and vegetation restoration measures. An important result was that sediment nitrogen in 80% of the estuaries was mainly originated from autochthonous algae and presettled organic matter, although there has been continuous pollution input from inflow rivers. The source estimation results found that the autochthonous aquaculture excretion, algae and hydrophyte debris and buried biodetritus accounted for 58.9% of the total nitrogen loading, which dominated the nitrogen sources compared with the pollution input. In addition, the PCA method was used to find that phosphorus loading and redox conditions were the major limiting factors affecting the distribution of inorganic and , respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Much focus on managing a supply chain in the event of disruption has been on the financial consequences and the service level impact on the customers. The negative impact caused by the disruption could influence a company’s profit and market share. Nonetheless, the importance of the environmental impact consideration in the supply chain disruption management has not been emphasised in the existing literature despite research findings that highlight the impact of some resilient supply chain practices on its environmental sustainability. This paper aims to assess the relationship between supply chain mitigation and recovery practices and its environmental impact. To achieve this objective, a case study was employed where semi-structured interviews were conducted at selected automotive companies in Malaysia. The results show that most disruption mitigation and recovery practices of a supply chain have a medium impact on its environmental performance. In particular, the production process during supply disruption recovery has the highest influence on environmental performance in the form of waste generation and use of energy. The results of this study can be used by supply chain managers to focus their efforts in the right direction in order to achieve cost objectives, service levels and environmental goals during the management of disruptions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The risk of supply chain disruptions can occur from a variety of events that make disruptions almost inevitable. Previous studies did not consider the quality uncertainty that can be affected by supply shortages. This paper presents a disruption recovery model for a single stage production and inventory system with consideration of disruption and quality uncertainties. The inventory system may experience a variety of disruptions such as supply chain disruptions, transportation disruptions and interruptions in the quality of the product. Therefore, management must make decisions quickly and efficiently to overcome these disruptions with minimum cost possible. The disruption recovery model was developed to help managers in making the right decisions and without affecting the production when the interruptions happen. Numerical examples are used to illustrate and examine the effectiveness and benefits of the mathematical model in solving the problem of supply disruption and quality uncertainty caused by the production process. Next, the model is optimized using LINGO software. This study showed that the optimal recovery schedule obtained is dependent on the percentage of products that have quality problems as well as other cost parameters. If the percentage of damaged goods in the production increases, the overall cost for recovery will also increase dramatically. Thus, the proposed model is seen to be a very useful tool to help managers make the right decisions on the optimal recovery plan during disruption occurences.</jats:p>"

Under the four different scenarios, no government subsidies, government subsidies are given to the manufacturer, government subsidies are given to the green product retailer, and government subsidies are given to green product consumers, the impact of government subsidies on green supply chain member price decisions is analyzed, and the validity of the model is verified by an example. The results show that compared with the no government subsidies, government subsidies to the manufacturer will reduce the wholesale and sales prices of green products, and subsidies to the green product retailer will lead to higher wholesale prices and lower sales prices of green products, and subsidies to green product consumers will increase the wholesale and sales prices of green products. No matter which object is subsidized by the government, the wholesale price of general products will not change and the sales price will decrease. Government subsidies will facilitate the sales of green products, thereby expanding the market share of green products.</jats:p>",

Then, we use a group negotiation model to establish a coordination mechanism. The results reveal that the decision variables and overall profit of the supply chain of suppliers and retailers under centralized decisions are better than those under the decentralized decisions. Besides, the degree of competition and price sensitivity have positive and negative effects on the efforts of suppliers and retailers, respectively. Meanwhile, the degree of cooperation between suppliers and retailers affects the profits of supply chain members and the whole supply chain in different degrees. Finally, the proposed value-added profit distribution mechanism can effectively deal with conflict problem and guarantee supply chain members and supply chain to maximize their profits and adopt the centralized decision.</jats:p>",
