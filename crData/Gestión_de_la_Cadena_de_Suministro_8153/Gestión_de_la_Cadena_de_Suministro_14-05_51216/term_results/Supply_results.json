Descriptive statistics were employed to examine the existences of SCMP, TQMP and FSP in the sample companies.

The automotive companies in Thailand apply TQMP much more extensively than SCMP. Their SCMP still emphasize efficient flows of information and materials at operational level to minimize transaction cost. Overall, Japanese companies, large companies, first-tier suppliers and the companies with ISO/TS 16949 have more intensively applied SCMP and TQMP and achieved a higher level of FSP. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The distribution of paper-based questionnaires was a convenience sample.

As part of this, the authors will identify different approaches in practice implementation in SSCM and supply chain management (SCM). SSCM has become a topic of great interest and is linked to the assumption that a more sustainable performance for businesses would be achieved on its implementation. Such performance has to be achieved with respect to all three dimensions of sustainability. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper is conceptual in nature.

In a second step, the authors describe distinctive practices which allow organizations to follow the goals formulated in the five key categories. Finally, they highlight issues preventing companies that follow a rather “conventional” approach to SCM to reach the level where it can be called SSCM, i.e. how to reach sustainability performance in SCM. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The work presented is conceptual in nature.

Therefore, it is crucial to provide updated and continuous feedback information to water users. This paper describes relevant use cases to improve efficient water use and related energy consumption by water utilities and consumers through the use of smart metering technologies. A systematic approach was established to obtain a comprehensive list of possible functionalities, using the concept of use case. For the consumer domain, six high-level and 18 detailed-level use cases were obtained. For the water utility domain, seven high-level and 20 detailed-level use cases were described. The high-level use cases with higher priority to be implemented in the iWIDGET system were also identified based on the contribution of different target audiences. The list of use cases covers a comprehensive range of possible usages that can be built upon the exploitation of data related to water and energy use in water distribution systems and in households, which may be of further use as a guide for similar studies.</jats:p>",

Existing multiechelon inventory optimization approaches either restrict their scope to multiple supply sources in two-echelon systems or single suppliers in multiechelon systems. We develop an exact mathematical model for static dual supply in a general acyclic N-echelon network structure, which builds on the guaranteed-service framework for safety stock optimization. It is assumed that the suppliers are allocated static fractions of demand. We prove that for normally distributed demand an extreme point property holds. We present a real example from the industrial electronics industry consisting of five echelons and three dual-sourced materials. This example forms the basis for a numerical analysis. Compared with the only previously published approximate solution, our exact approach results in considerable cost savings because the exact model captures inventory pooling in a way that the approximation is unable to do. For a set of test problems, total safety stock cost savings are 9.1%, on average. </jats:p>",

That being the case, we can then look for variation around that norm and both investigate and speculate what that variation means. A methodology is developed which suggests periods of faster and less rapid coin circulation which has implications for consideration of monetisation. The model also enables us to view where denarii entered circulation; unsurprisingly the army looms large in this picture. The methodology is directly transferable to other provinces and other periods where there are long-lived, relatively stable monetary systems.</jats:p>",

Now, supply chain partnership is becoming worse and worse because of the lack of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In order to optimize the supply chain partnership, we study the partner selection from the perspective of corporate social responsibility. We construct a payoff matrix of leading companies and cooperative companies in supply chain, and analyze the game relationship between partner selection of supply chain and fulfilment of corporate social responsibility. Our findings show that partner selection depends on the fulfilment level of corporate social responsibility, and leading companies prefer to cooperate with companies with a high degree of social responsibility in green supply chain. Furthermore, the successful establishment of cooperation can encourage companies to fulfil social responsibility consciously. These findings provide support for green supply chain management in the areas of partner selection, harmonious relationship establishment, and social responsibility fulfillment.</jats:p>"

The results showed that Thai ethanol supply chain is complex because it involves many stakeholders in both public and private agencies. Molasses and cassava are the main feedstocks of ethanol production in Thailand, so the upstream suppliers of ethanol supply chain are sugarcane and cassava farmers, and the collectors. The feedstocks cost of ethanol plants is high due to the fluctuation of sugarcane and cassava price. There is also a trade barrier to control both production and transportation of ethanol because it under the Liquor Act. Moreover, the distribution of ethanol has low efficiency and long distance of truck transport contribute to high transportation cost. Consequently, logistics system of Thai ethanol supply chain should be improved more efficient in order to support demand expansion of ethanol industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Irrigation techniques and technology based on principle of regular accumulation of moisture in active layer (surface irrigation, regular sprinkler irrigation) are most common in science and in practice. More progressive is principle of non-stop water supply of plants and soil in conformity to their water consumption. Drip irrigation and impulse sprinkling are based on this principle. The main advantage of drip irrigation is establishment of optimal water and nutritive regime directly in the plant root system. However, such irrigation is not effective enough under conditions of high air temperatures (over 25–35 °С), as growing process of several agricultural plants is known to slow down at 30–35 °С and photosynthesis, consequently, stops, which, in turn, affects plants yielding capacity. Sprinkling irrigation provides improvement of both microclimate in plant's environment and their water regime. Combination of drip and sprinkling irrigation permits the positive characteristics of each individual technology to be united, and to remove a series of disadvantages of their separate use as well as to use drip-sprinkler irrigation technology to create optimal conditions for plant development. Drip-sprinkler irrigation technology facilitates saving of irrigation water through drip irrigation in the main vegetation period and through improvement of microclimate and water regime of agricultural plants with additional sprinkling irrigation within the period of high temperatures and low air humidity that affects the growing process and increases yielding capacity of grown cultures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a switch mode power supply based on matrix converter is proposed for telecommunication applications. The conventional high power switch mode power supply consists of an AC/DC conversion with boost converter followed by a DC/DC converter to produce dc voltage. These rectifiers draw significant harmonic current from the utility, resulting in poor input power factor with high total harmonic distortion (THD). The proposed AC-AC system is an effective replacement of the conventional system which employs twostep power conversion. In the proposed approach, the matrix converter directly converts the low frequency (50 Hz, three phases) input to a high frequency (10 kHz, single phase) ac output without a dc-link. The output of the matrix converter is then processed via a high frequency isolation transformer to produce dc voltage. Control of the system ensures that output voltage is regulated and input currents are of high quality. The matrix converter forms an attractive topology of power converter for high power applications where factors such as absence of electrolytic capacitors, potentiality of increasing power density, reducing size and weight, good input power quality are fundamental. The proposed method is verified using Simulink toolbox of MATLAB 7.2 version.</jats:p>"

Compounded by urban growth and ageing water and wastewater infrastructure, Australia's urban water arrangements have undergone major reforms to effectively manage the challenges of recent years. This paper is a synthesis of urban water reform in Australia during a decade of unforeseen natural extremes. It summarises the evolution of urban water policy, outcomes from recent government reforms and investment, and presents future challenges facing the sector. As governments at state and federal levels in Australia have moved to diversify supply options away from the traditional reliance on rainfall-dependent catchment storages, they have been confronted by issues relating to climate uncertainty, planning, regulation, pricing, institutional reforms, and community demands for sustainable supply solutions. Increases in water prices to pay for new water infrastructure are illustrative of further reform pressures in the urban water sector. In the past 10 years the Australian urban water sector has weathered new extremes in drought and flood and emerged far different to its predecessor. The provision of safe, secure, efficient and sustainable water and wastewater services remains the primary driver for urban water reform. However the challenges and opportunities to improve nationally significant social, economic and environmental outcomes from urban water have evolved considerably. The focus now is on creating the institutional, regulatory and market conditions favourable for the integration of urban water services with the objectives for productive and liveable cities.</jats:p>",

It notes that pinpointing risk has become a difficult struggle as retailers are often inundated with data, and suppliers, for lack of time, have become reluctant to “waste time” completing check-lists and audits. The paper maintains that there is the urgent need for adequate inspection and a means to incentivise the food industry to police itself much better. It recognises that lack of visibility and a lack of direct influence over suppliers further down the supply chain have led to distinct problems within the food industry. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper contributes to an ongoing discussion that has been of considerable concern to many consumers.

Results corroborate prior findings that quality considerations and needs to protect investments in specialized or durable assets significantly increase usage of more formal coordination mechanisms, such as formal contracts and vertical integration or ownership. Consistent with findings for other industries, such investments are associated with greater contract complexity and inclusion of enforcement provisions, while trade partners' prior experience working together decreases contract complexity. Furthermore, our results suggest that quality considerations extend to greater use of formal contracts further downstream. (JEL Classifications: L1, L2, Q13)</jats:p>",

An innovative solution as presented in this paper has until now not been comprehensively analyzed. This work presents the solution with the application of a (Photovoltaic) PV generator. The main technological features, in addition to the designing methodology and case study are presented in this paper. The critical period approach has been used for the first time for system sizing. The application of this sizing method provides a high reliability of the proposed system. The obtained results confirm the assumption that the PV generator is a promising energy sustainable solution for urban water supply systems. The service reservoir, which acts as water and energy storage for the proposed system, provides the basis for a sustainable solution of water and energy supply. In accordance with the proposed, the reliability of such system is high. This concept of energy supply operation does not generate any atmospheric emission of greenhouse gases, which contributes significantly to the reduction of the impacts of climate changes. The proposed solution and designing methodology are widely applicable and in accordance with the characteristics of the water supply system and climate.</jats:p>"

The graphical results can also be translated into a numerical grade that allows comparing the conditions of various pipes and of individual joints. The applicability of the IJC is demonstrated in the condition assessment of 222 joints inspected in eight different sessions that encapsulate more than 2 km of older (more than 40 years) and newer pipes (less than 2 months). While, for the new pipe, all joints were considered to be in good condition – low replacement priority –, several joints in older pipes were considered to have high replacement priority.</jats:p>",

Optimization of catalyst concentration was also carried out. Reaction rates under different working conditions were compared. The bacterial kill followed a pseudo first-order reaction. Continuous reactor studies were carried out using N-doped TiO2 coated glass plates. Three-log inactivation of bacteria was obtained after a contact time of 40 min. The effects of turbidity, bicarbonate ions and organic matter were studied. It was found that the efficiency of the system decreased due to these components. Comparison of the performance of solar water-disinfection (SODIS) and solar photocatalytic treatment for disinfection of water was also carried out. The results showed that the suspended catalyst achieved complete inactivation in 1 h compared to SODIS which took 6 h. Bacterial regrowth was observed in the case of SODIS treatment whereas no bacterial growth was observed after solar photocatalytic treatment.</jats:p>",

However, both technologies are limited in their ability to remove viruses and at the same time there is a lack of methods to accurately demonstrate virus removal in full-scale settings. In evaluating the efficacy of MF/UF membranes and UV disinfection systems for virus removal, appropriate surrogates are therefore required. In most cases, various surrogates are used to evaluate the removal performances of individual treatment technologies. This henceforth limits its application when multiple treatment systems are evaluated in series. In view of this, fluorescent-conjugated MS2 and F8781 microspheres were evaluated as possible surrogates for virus removal by integrated coagulation-MF/UF filtration-UV disinfection. At 5 mg Al3+/L, the highest removal of MS2-Sypro was observed, followed by MS2-AMCA, and F8781 during the coagulation-flocculation stage. During MF and UF filtration, dye surrogates provided an underestimate of virus removal except for F8781, which had a considerably smaller particle size than other surrogates. Nevertheless, MS2-SR could accurately represent AD5 during low pressure (LP) UV irradiation but MS2-AMCA existed as a more accurate representation of AD5 as compared to F8781 microspheres during medium pressure (MP) UV irradiation. MS2-SR and MS2-AMCA are therefore preferred surrogates for an integrated filtration-UV disinfection system for LP and MP UV, respectively.</jats:p>",

Therefore, they face enormous difficulties in terms of financial and personnel resources. To take advantage of economies of scale, the consolidation of water utilities has been promoted since 1965 by Japanese water authorities. The measure has been successful to some extent; nevertheless, consolidation has not progressed in recent years as was expected. This paper identifies the main barriers that hinder the consolidation of water utilities in Japan and describes the new promotion plan for the consolidation of water utilities developed by the Japan Water Works Association. To assess the economic effects of consolidation, an empirical application is carried out involving four real Japanese cities. The results will be useful to water authorities considering consolidation in the long-term planning of urban water management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water network partitioning represents one of the best methodologies for improving water balance and pressure control of a water distribution system in order to reduce water leakage. These techniques can be applied with greater effectiveness defining a smaller permanent network district, called a District Meter Area (DMA), achieved by the insertion of gate valves and flow meters. If the DMAs are isolated subsystems (sectors), such that each zone is fed by its water source (or water sources) by closing gate valves in the network pipes that link the DMAs, the process can be called water network sectorization (defining an isolated DMA (i-DMA)). The traditional criteria for the design of network DMAs and i-DMAs are based on empirical suggestions (number of properties, length of pipes, etc.) and on approaches such as ‘trial and error’, even if used together with hydraulic simulation software. Nevertheless these indications and procedures are very difficult to apply to large water supply systems because the insertion of gate valves modifies the original network layout and may worsen, also considerably, the hydraulic performance of the water network. Recently some techniques, based on graph theory principles that allow simplification of the network partitioning and sectorization, and to find optimal solutions heuristically, have been proposed in the literature. In this paper the sectorization problem has been examined comparing different techniques, proposed by the authors, using the same water networks and performance indices and testing different possible i-DMA layouts.</jats:p>",

From the resource dependence perspective, this work presents a novel conceptual model to investigate the influence of political and social power on channel power restructuring and induced green supply chain collaboration in brander-retailer bidirectional green supply chains of fashionable consumer electronics products (FCEPs). An FCEP refers to the consumer electronics product (e.g., personal computers, mobile phones, computer notebooks, and game consoles) with the features of a well-known brand associated, a short product lifecycle, timely and fashionable design fit for market trends, and quick responsiveness to the variations of market demands. The proposed model is tested empirically using questionnaire data obtained from retailers in the FCEP brander-retailer distribution channels. Analytical results reveal that as an extension of political and social power, TPPI positively affects the reciprocal interdependence of dyadic members and reduces power asymmetry, thereby enhancing the collaborative relationship of dyadic members and leading to improved green supply chain performance. Therein, reciprocal interdependence underlying collaborative relationship is the key to reducing the external environmental uncertainties in the TPPI context.</jats:p>"

Civilians have been deliberately targeted in recent conflicts, and the international community has paid more attention to their protection. Human security means that individuals’ safety is a priority on the security agenda. Organizational learning is necessary in crisis management in order to evolve and provide tools to ensure human security. Organizational learning in crisis management requires individual learning, but individual learning does not necessarily lead to organizational learning at the level of institutions. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the development of crisis management and peace-building when taking into account crisis management personnel's experiences and their value in organizational learning processes. The results are applied to the context of humanitarian logistics that have special features including pace in comparison to other crisis management contexts.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– The empirical material consists of a Delphi panel process representing 15 experts and interviews of 27 individuals who had served as employees in civilian crisis management and military crisis management duties in Kosovo.

Personnel in crisis management need opportunities to give and receive feedback. At the personal level, work in crisis management is important for an individual. Returning home may be more challenging for an individual than starting to work in a mission. The framework of organizational learning is adequate for developing crisis management and humanitarian logistics.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– Crisis management personnel's feelings and opinions in depth have been rarely studied and the present study provides information about this personal level. Because of using two methods focussing on organizational learning and feedback, partial methodological triangular was carried out, which increased the reliability of the results. In regard to humanitarian logistics, feedback arrangements are also important when intending to develop learning organizations. Return arrangements for personnel in humanitarian logistics are also an important focus of study.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This research was done at Manaus Industrial Pole, which is a model of industrial agglomerations, based in Manaus, State of Amazonas (Brazil), which contemplates different supply chains and strategies sharing same infrastructure of transport, handling and storage and clearance process and uses inbound for suppliers of raw material.  The state of art contemplates supply chain management, uncertainty supply chain model, agile supply chains, Manaus Industrial Center (MIC) and Brazilian legislation, as a business case, and presents concepts and features, of each one. The main goal is to present and discuss how transport is able to support Uncertainty Supply Chain Model, in order to complete management model. The results obtained confirms the hypothesis of integrated logistics processes are able to guarantee attractivity for industrial agglomerations, and open discussions when the suppliers are far from the manufacturer center, in a logistics management.</jats:p>"

Empirical analysis confirms results of the model with respect to lobbying activities of golf promoters. The relative size of the different groups involved plays a significant role in the efforts made for political pressure.

The conversion of microwave (MW) radiation into heat is useful in overcoming the activation energy barriers associated with chemical transformations, but the use of microwaves can be further extended to higher temperatures, thus creating unusual high-energy environments. In devising synthetic methodologies to engineered nanomaterials, hydrothermal synthesis and solution combustion synthesis can be used as reference systems to illustrate effects related to microwave irradiation. In the first case, energy is transferred to the entire reaction volume, causing a homogeneous temperature rise within a closed vessel in a few minutes, hence assuring uniform crystal growth at the nanometer scale. In the second case, strong exothermic combustion syntheses can benefit from the application of microwaves to convey energy to the reaction not only during the ignition step, but also while it is occurring and even after its completion. In both approaches, however, the direct interaction of microwaves with the reaction mixture can lead to practically gradient-less heating profiles, on the basis of which the main observed characteristics and properties of the aforementioned reactions and products can be explained.</jats:p>"

Surveys of public attitudes to water reuse have generally shown lower acceptance of indirect potable reuse compared with other reuse options, such as irrigation. The south-east of England is projected to experience a shortfall in water supply by 2020 and the largest water utility in the region, Thames Water, is investigating indirect potable reuse as a potential new supply option. The indirect potable reuse feasibility studies include evaluation of the technology options and water quality as well as detailed consideration of public perception issues. As part of the work to address the latter, 2,000 Thames Water customers participated in an on-line survey of their attitudes to indirect potable reuse. The survey showed overall support for the idea of indirect potable reuse. The only demographic factor to show any significant difference from the whole sample was belief system, with Muslim respondents showing significantly less support than other groups. The survey results indicate that indirect potable reuse may be socially acceptable in the south-east of England, but that public engagement and participation in future decision making about indirect potable reuse will be important for the success of any particular proposal.</jats:p>",

Concentrations of these soil parameters measured in this study were found as: organic content (0.9- 7.9%), moisture content (8.0-36.7%), pH (6.8-7.7), resistivity (3900-16700 ohm.cm), oxidation-reduction potential (337-461 mV vs SHE), chloride (25-71 ppm) and sulfate (35-464 ppm) contents. These soil parameters gave an indication of “mildly corrosive” to “less corrosive” nature of soils on the galvanized steels and cast iron pipelines buried in the study areas. Based on the findings of the present studies, it can be advised to the related authorities or local people that simple modification of the soils by using cheapest non-conducting materials like gravel or sand around the buried water supply pipelines before undergrounding them in the study areas is very beneficial from the corrosion point of view to increase their life time.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We study a buyer who periodically auctions off short-term supply contracts among her supply base. To mitigate significant cost shocks to procurement, the buyer can diversify her supply base by selecting suppliers from different regions. We find that the buyer's decision to diversify depends on her bid-taker power—that is, her ability to choose the auction mechanism. At one extreme, when the buyer has full bid-taker power and thus can dictatorially implement the optimal mechanism, she always prefers to diversify. At the other extreme, when the buyer uses a reverse English auction with no reserve price due to her lack of bid-taker power, she generally prefers to protect herself against potential price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers by diversifying less. The managerial insight is that the more bid-taker power the buyer has to control price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers the more she prefers a diversified supply base. This insight is shown to be robust to correlation between regional costs, ex ante asymmetry between regions, and intermediate levels of bid-taker power.</jats:p>",

In the light of the drawback of the traditional circuit, a simplified circuit is proposed. The simplified circuit can substantially reduce the number of the protective components and the size of the SPD chassis. In order to compare the protective performances between the traditional and simplified circuits, an impulse experimental arrangement is built to measure their residual voltages. The measured results show that the voltage protection level of the simplified circuit is the same as that of the traditional circuit. Therefore, replacement of the traditional circuit by the simplified circuit is really feasible in lightning overvoltage protection of AC power supplies of electronic systems. </jats:p>",

Because of unilateral conductivity of the main discharge switch, the reverse voltage cannot be released and this would adversely affect service life of the stored energy capacitor and reduce working efficiency of the pulsed power supply. Through detailed deducing the discharging course of stored energy capacitor in pulsed power supply system, this paper analyzed relative factors affecting reverse charging voltage of stored energy capacitor and discussed necessary means that could reduce reverse charging voltage of stored energy capacitor. Based on this, a circuit structure with the main discharge switch in load branch is proposed and release of reverse charging voltage of stored energy capacitor is realized without affecting discharge current characteristics of the load. Simulation and test results show that the load current characteristics of the pulsed power supply after adjusting location of the discharge switch is basically the same as before the adjustment is made and completely meet requirement of electromagnetic emission. As a result, timely release of the reverse voltage extended working life of the stored energy capacitor and also improved efficiency of the electromagnetic emission system.</jats:p>"

Relationships with commercial suppliers have also remained arm's-length and often dormant due to high levels of uncertainty and strict public procurement rules and regulations. However, recent pushes for increased efficiency and effectiveness are driving humanitarian agencies toward cooperative purchasing – a purchasing strategy that is claimed to be highly beneficial for members of the purchasing consortium not least for its ability to increase buyers’ purchasing power. In reality, the effectiveness of the strategy in increasing purchasing power is unclear.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– The authors study a single case of several humanitarian organizations aiming to increase their leverage in buying freight forwarding services by joining forces.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Following several incidents during the process, the cooperative purchasing initiative did not contribute to increased power in the case.

The strength of this approach is that it is built on a robust foundation of mutual support and incentives. The paper describes how franchise partners have been working with schools and municipalities to address operational issues. The Eastern Cape provincial Department of Education now has a proven model which it is rolling out to further school districts, beyond the initial pilot in the Butterworth education district. Municipalities in the area are also employing the franchisee microbusinesses to undertake maintenance services. Further opportunities lie in applying the approach to operation and/or maintenance activities within the water and sanitation services delivery chain, and thereafter extending it to other types of infrastructure (e.g. roads and electricity reticulation).</jats:p>",

The results have been: the creation of a spatial data and cartography infrastructure for the Tunisian ‘qanats’ and related irrigation systems; the identification of drainage tunnels; the typological classification of the water tunnels according to their morphological and structural framework; analysis of conservation status and intended water use; the implementation of a multi-criteria evaluation method with regard to the heritage quality of the ‘qanats’; and finally an analysis of the landscape relationships between ‘qanats’ and oases.</jats:p>",

Every product's supply chain consists of several energy usage processes. Three new approaches (end-userpays; production based; and profit based) regarding the allocation of the cost related to the carbon footprint (CF) produced, among producers and users are being presented. These approaches vary according to the ‘blame’ attached to each stakeholder involved, during the several phases of the ‘product's’ life cycle. According to the first approach, CO2 emissions occur as the need for the product/service exists. The second approach allocates the CF production-related cost in each step of the supply chain according to not only how much of this CF is produced in each step, but considering also the CF produced in the previous steps. The allocation follows the profit rate (profit/selling price) of each step of the supply chain. At the third approach, the profit rate used has to do with the profit of each step compared to the total profit of the entire supply chain. To achieve a socially fair price of a product, all stakeholders involved should pay their fair shares, to guarantee that all costs related to the product's supply chain are being fully recovered.</jats:p>",

Water footprint assessment (WFA) is a holistic methodological framework that allows detailed quantification of direct and indirect water use in different sectors at various spatial and temporal scales. The ultimate aim of this study is to identify water footprint (WF) reduction targets, formulate response strategies to minimize water consumption and pollution and therefore improve the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the mining processes. The assessment will eventually serve as a model for other mines in northern China with water scarcity issues. The paper describes the preliminary WFA of copper cathodes, with particular emphasis on the methodology, approach, degree of details and areas for consideration. It focuses from ore extraction to final discharge to the river. Significant WF contribution is found in the process rather than the supply chain. The explorative approach applied in this real case scenario and the findings contribute to the literature body of the WFA field. This case study can provide helpful guidance for WFA practitioners when applying this methodological framework in addressing particular issues in mining processes.</jats:p>",

OLS and instrumental variables estimates are similar. Furthermore, over 60 percent of those denied benefits by an administrative law judge are subsequently allowed benefits within ten years, showing that most applicants apply, reapply, and appeal until they get benefits.

A new design of APPJ for mass spectrometry has been built in our group. In these plasma sources magnetic transformers (MTs) and inductors are typically used in power supplies but they present several drawbacks that are even more evident when dealing with high-voltage normally used in APPJs. To overcome these disadvantages, high frequency generators with the absence of MT are proposed in the literature. However, in the case of miniaturized APPJs these conventional power converters, built of ferromagnetic cores and inductors or by means of LC resonant tank circuits, are not so useful as piezoelectric transformer (PT) based power converters due to bulky components and small efficiency. We made and examined a novel atmospheric pressure plasma jet with PT supplier served as ionization source for ambient mass spectrometry, and especially mobile spectrometry where miniaturization, integration of components, and clean plasma are required. The objective of this paper is to describe the concept, design, and implementation of this miniaturized piezoelectric transformer-based atmospheric pressure plasma jet.</jats:p>",

The impact of RFID technology on supply chain processes was assessed using an Internal Rate of Return analysis. An extensive, six-month discussion and refinement process with the logistics and supply chain managers of the company under study was conducted to validate the procedure and to collect the necessary data. Such technology enables inventory control, tracking of parts/products and customer satisfaction. The viability of using RFID technology for inventory control and product tracking was confirmed. Among the benefits obtained: the reduction of one worker from the inventory team, reduction in the costs for replacing a component and reduction in the costs incurred with defective components were found. This is one of the few attempts to quantify RFDI technology’s contribution.Keywords: Economic Engineering. RFID. Radio Frequency Identification. Financial Viability Analysis. Internal Rate Of Return.

Water and communities associated were sampled at two sites, one in an area with the predominance of Eichhornia azurea (Sw.) Kunth and the other with the predominance of Salvinia auriculata Aublet. Communities associated with macrophytes were sampled with floating quadrants (0.5 m2); the macrophytes were washed and plankton and macrofauna were fixated with 4% formalin and 1% lugol iodine; the specimens were then identified and counted. Plankton and macrofauna communities associated with S. auriculata and E. azurea had a similar diversity of species but different (p&lt;0.05) in the abundance of associated organisms. Eichhornia azurea had the highest contents in dry and wet weight, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and organic matter. Planktonic algae were directly correlated with biomass of E. azurea. The taxa with highest densities were Rotifera and Zygnematophyceae. Results showed that the environmental variables associated with macrophytes presence in the shallow reservoir is a strong predictor of favourable conditions to maintain great diversity plankton community and macrofauna associated with plants. The role of macrophytes is important for not only stabilising the clear-water state and maintaining high diversity of organisms associated, but also it seems to be a good alternative to maintaining desirable water-supply quality for aquaculture farms.</jats:p>",

This paper analyses the dynamics of residential water consumption in the Netherlands since 1900. During this period, different drivers for change had an influence on residential water use. Results show that different (f)actors and trends had a role in the change of routines, perceptions, expectations, technologies and norms. Drivers of change in residential water consumption were for instance technological developments, the changing perception of comfort and external pressures, such as the oil crisis in the 1970s, and energy labelling of appliances and buildings. These changes led to transitions in the urban system by adjustments in regulative, normative, and cognitive aspects of regimes. In this paper, these transitions are analysed. For instance, full adoption of showers took 60 years, and the maximum annual adoption rate was 6.4% for washing machines. Understanding the links between physical and technological features and society can provide key information about how urban water transitions occur. This knowledge must be used in water infrastructure planning as it impacts demand and typical demand patterns.</jats:p>",

Spatially resolved double Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy measurements show an increase in electron density by one order of magnitude from 1 × 1010 cm−3 to 1 × 1011 cm−3, when the magnetron plasma is exposed to the magnetic mirror field of the ECR ion source.

It is concluded therefore that while the findings lend weight to policy initiatives to utilise the power dynamics in supply chains to protect working conditions, they also suggest that surrounding institutional and industrial contexts exert a potentially crucial influence over their effectiveness.

Similar to power grid economics, optimal metabolic control requires the two pathways, even in normoxic conditions, to match two different types of energy demands. Cells use aerobic metabolism to meet baseline, steady energy demand and glycolytic metabolism to meet short‐timescale energy demands, mainly from membrane transport activities, even in the presence of oxygen. This model provides a mechanism for the origin of the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Here, the Warburg effect emerges during carcinogenesis is a physiological response to an increase in energy demands from membrane transporters, required for cell division, growth, and migration.</jats:p><jats:p>This work is supported by the NIH Physical Sciences in Oncology Center grant 1U54CA143970‐03 and NIH R01 CA077575‐10.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The model is tested with survey data from 195 small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises reporting on their primary supply chain. The results indicate that the supply chain's knowledge management capability manifests itself in both explicit and tacit knowledge, with the latter being influenced more strongly. Moreover, it was found that while both explicit and tacit knowledge influence supply chain performance, the latter exerts a significantly greater impact than the former. Exploratory post hoc analyses add robustness to these findings and investigate mechanisms inherent to the transformation of tacit into explicit knowledge. Overall, this research contributes to academic theory development in logistics and supply chain management by the dichotomization of knowledge types and the demonstration of their differential magnitude of effects, and to managerial practice by providing important guidance for logistics managers structuring their knowledge management efforts across supply chains.</jats:p>",

The variation in labour supply incentives is plausibly exogenous, since eligibility depends on municipal-level rules, but not on family income. Robustness checks indicate that the results are not driven by policy endogeneity or residential sorting.

Flow cytometry is a fast and user-friendly technique enabling bacteria quantification and viability assessment in less than 1 hour. Specific profiles regarding log-reduction of total bacteria were obtained for each treatment plant. Chlorination appeared to be the most effective by causing metabolism inactivation and nucleic acid damages. Ozonation showed a significant impact on cell activity in contrast with ultraviolet treatment which strongly affected bacterial DNA. In addition, the results showed that active bacteria quantified by flow cytometry were significantly correlated with culturable bacteria. This alternative approach appeared as gainful compared to culture methods as it greatly facilitates the diagnosis of treatment plant process for drinking water production monitoring.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With growing demand for internationally traded biomass, the logistic operations required to economically move biomass from the field or forest to end‐ users have become increasingly complex. To design cost effective and sustainable feedstock supply chains, it is important to understand the economics, energy and greenhouse gas (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content>) emissions, their interdependencies, and the related uncertainties of the logistic process operations of international supply chains. This paper presents an approach to assessing lignocellulosic feedstock supply systems at the operational level. For this purpose, the Biomass Logistic Model (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BLM</jats:styled-content>) has been linked with the Geographic Information Systems‐based Biomass Intermodal Transportation Model (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BIT‐UU</jats:styled-content>) and extended with inter‐continental transport routes. Case studies of herbaceous and woody biomass, produced in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> Midwest and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> Southeast, respectively, and shipped to Europe for conversion to Fischer‐Tropsch (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content>) diesel are included to demonstrate how intermodal transportation and, in particular, overseas shipping integrates with the bioenergy supply chains. For the cases demonstrated, biomass can be supplied at 99 € Mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to 117 € Mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (dry) and converted to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> diesel at 19 € <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to 24 € <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> depending on the feedstock type and location, intermediate (chips or pellets) and size of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> diesel production plant. With the flexibility to change the design of supply chains as well as input variables, many alternative supply chain cases can be assessed. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

This ongoing research aims to develop a novel water treatment technology for small communities. By layering structured, functional carbon nanotubes (CNT) onto low pressure membranes (LPMs), composite membranes were prepared to remove different organic and inorganic contaminants from water, including heavy metals, viruses, natural organic matter, and organic micropollutants. The removal efficiencies varied from over 99.9% (for cadmium) to above 60% (for humic substances). A low-cost CNT formed an antifouling layer that removed membrane foulants by depth filtration, thereby extending the membrane filtration cycle over five-fold. When the CNTs were layered inside hollow fiber membranes, superb backwashable properties were observed, allowing the operation of CNT-modified membranes under full-scale treatment conditions. Moreover, a systematic study of CNT rejection by LPMs found that commercially available LPMs efficiently prevented CNT breakthrough, thus ensuring nanosafety of the treated water. By varying the composition and structure of functional CNT layers, energy-efficient composite membranes may be economically produced for designer water treatment systems and applied in small communities.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, they are commonly characterized by their vulnerability to water‐quality impairment. Two karst aquifers, the Edwards aquifer in south‐central Texas and the Upper Floridan aquifer in western Florida, were investigated to assess factors that control the movement of contaminants to public‐supply wells (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSWs</jats:styled-content>). The geochemistry of samples from a selected <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSW</jats:styled-content> or wellfield in each aquifer was compared with that from nearby monitoring wells and regional <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSWs</jats:styled-content>. Geochemistry results were integrated with age tracers, flow modeling, and depth‐dependent data to refine aquifer conceptual models and to identify factors that affect contaminant movement to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSWs</jats:styled-content>. The oxic Edwards aquifer is vertically well mixed at the selected <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSW</jats:styled-content>/wellfield, although regionally the aquifer is geochemically variable downdip. The mostly anoxic Upper Floridan aquifer is affected by denitrification and also is geochemically variable with depth. In spite of considerable differences in geology and hydrogeology, the two aquifers are similarly vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination. Vulnerability in studied <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSWs</jats:styled-content> in both aquifers is strongly influenced by rapid karst flowpaths and the dominance of young (&lt;10 years) groundwater. Vulnerability was demonstrated by the frequent detection of similar constituents of concern in both aquifers (nitrate, atrazine, deethylatrazine, tetrachloroethene, and chloroform). Specific consideration of water‐quality protection efforts, well construction and placement, and aquifer response times to land‐use changes and contaminant loading are discussed, with implications for karst groundwater management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water management systems have been typically designed and operated under the assumption of stationarity. This assumption may no longer be valid under climate change scenarios. Water availability may change dramatically at some locations due mainly to possible impacts of changes in temperature and precipitation over streamflow volume and seasonality, adding pressure to water supply systems. It has been shown that snowmelt-dominated basins are particularly sensitive to such changes. Hence, human settlements and economic activities developed in such areas are particularly vulnerable. The Maipo river basin in Central Chile – where more than 6 million people live – is one of these areas. We used a calibrated water resources model of the Maipo river basin, in order to propose a general framework to evaluate adaptation options at the urban level. When comparing a mid-21st century period to a historic control period, results for three selected performance metrics showed a decrease in water system performance. Adaptation measures were evaluated in their capacity to maintain current water security standards. Two alternatives stand as highly effective options to this end: water rights purchases and improvements in water use efficiency. The political and economic costs of implementing these options, which could deem them unviable, are not considered here but are worthy of further research.</jats:p>",

Our sample contains more than 8 million observations derived from satellite imagery and includes every cultivated field in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. We estimate that aggregate crop acreage responds more to price shocks in the short run than in the long run, and we show theoretically how the benefits of crop rotation generate this response pattern. In essence, farmers who change crops due to a price shock have an incentive to switch back to the previous crop to capture the benefits of crop rotation. Our result contradicts the long‐held belief that agricultural supply responds gradually to price shocks through partial adjustment. We would not have obtained this result had we used county‐level panel data. Standard econometric methods applied to county‐level data produce estimates consistent with partial adjustment. We show that this apparent partial adjustment is illusory, and we demonstrate how it arises from the fact that fields in the same county are more similar to each other than to fields in other counties. This result underscores the importance of using models with appropriate micro‐foundations and cautions against inferring micro‐level rigidities from inertia in aggregate panel data. Our preferred estimate of the own‐price long‐run elasticity of corn acreage is 0.29, and the cross‐price elasticity is −0.22. The corresponding elasticities for soybean acreage are 0.26 and −0.33. Our estimated short‐run elasticities are 37% larger than their long‐run counterparts.</jats:p>",

Food safety incidents and scandals, frequently breaking out around the world, are significantly reducing the confidence of consumers in food safety and quality. It is even more difficult to achieve the full transparency, visibility and traceability of dynamic cross-border and global food supply chains, which is critical to ensure food safety and quality, due to: the personalization and globalization of consumer demands; the diversities of food products, raw materials and ingredients; the loose relationships between food business partners; the technology and resource barriers in aligning business processes, coordinating and sharing information; and the changing government supervision mechanisms and standards. Social networking technologies and social software are promising enablers to facilitate end consumers, food companies and government agencies to participate in open discussion, comments and feedback on the quality and safety of cross-border foods. They are able to connect, interact, communicate and collaborate with each other in loose, open, effective and flexible ways for enhancing the transparency and visibility of cross-border and global food supply chains through collective wisdom and intelligence. In this paper a framework is proposed for developing social networks enabling food traceability systems, which not only leverages enterprise applications, public service platforms for food quality, safety and traceability operated by government or industrial associations, but utilizes such emerging technologies as Internet-of-Things, social analytic and mobile technologies to ease interactive communication and collaboration between various stakeholders of food chains. Guidelines, architectures, use scenarios, and technology alternatives for implementing the traceability systems are also discussed in this work. A prototype, titled<jats:italic>OSCM-FD</jats:italic>, is being implemented and pilots are being conducted to verify the validity of the proposed framework.</jats:p>"

The approach developed allows investigating, through process simulation, the plant areas where the efficiency of the water supply system can be significantly improved by means of some simple interventions. The final objective is to reduce the water consumption of the plant; this represents a relevant issue to the dairy industry. In line with this goal, at first the simulation model was used to reproduce the current (AS IS) system, so as to reach a precise knowledge of the water flows in the plant. In the second part of the work, a series of alternative (TO BE) scenarios was investigated, and the related performance was assessed, thus identifying the best plant configuration. The process simulator was designed under Microsoft Excel, programmed with Visual Basic for Applications. Thanks to the study implemented, an optimal scenario of the water supply system was finally identified, which allows savings up to 7.2% of water compared to the original configuration.</jats:p>",

Quality management systems have been successfully implemented within individual companies, but how has this actually affected suppliers, within SCM? This paper conducted a survey in thirteen companies operating in Brazil to assess the effectiveness of SCQM. The results show that companies are still very concerned about quality within their individual companies and ensuring quality from their suppliers still involves performance indicators and depends on the availability of suppliers for each item required.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Waste management in construction is critical for the sustainable treatment of building-related construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste materials, and recycling of these wastes has been considered as one of the best strategies in minimization of C&amp;D debris. However, recycling of C&amp;D materials may not always be a feasible strategy for every waste type and therefore recycling and other waste treatment strategies should be supported by robust decision-making models. With the aim of assessing the net carbon, energy, and water footprints of C&amp;D recycling and other waste management alternatives, a comprehensive economic input–output-based hybrid life-cycle assessment model is developed by tracing all of the economy-wide supply-chain impacts of three waste management strategies: recycling, landfilling, and incineration. Analysis results showed that only the recycling of construction materials provided positive environmental footprint savings in terms of carbon, energy, and water footprints. Incineration is a better option as a secondary strategy after recycling for water and energy footprint categories, whereas landfilling is found to be as slightly better strategy when carbon footprint is considered as the main focus of comparison. In terms of construction materials’ environmental footprint, nonferrous metals are found to have a significant environmental footprint reduction potential if recycled. </jats:p>",

Although a variety of forecasting methods have been developed, many of them may not be used in practice for various reasons, such as insufficient viable information about sales and oversophisticated methods. In this paper, we provide a new forecasting scheme to evaluate long‐term prediction performances in SCM. Three well‐known forecasting methods for time series data—moving average (MA), autoregressive integrated MA, and smoothing spline—are considered. We also focus on two representative sales patterns, each of which is with and without a growth pattern, respectively. By applying the proposed scheme to various simulated and real datasets, this research aims to provide SCM practitioners with a general guideline for time series sales forecasting, so that they can easily understand what prediction performance measures and which forecasting method can be considered.</jats:p>",

In this case, we concern that in current, in order to bear up under competition, organizations have to manage their supply chains so that they meet the needs of their final customers. With this concept in mind, the research presented in this study focuses on establishing the right strategy for supply chains according to their product segment. Thus, after a Literature Review, the paper explain a methodology based in different authors studies. Finally the article focuses on a pratical case in e-commerce retail that describes its application in this field. The research shows that it is possible to use a methodology for classifying supply chains using chain strategies and product features. The use of the right strategy for supply chains will improve the competitive advantage of businesses. One limitation is that the methodology study focuses on only two e-commerce segment; future studies may go further in refining the proposed framework for other segments. The aim of this research is to offer businesses a model for evaluating supply chains, allowing them to improve the performance of their products and services by using the right strategy for supply chains. The classification proposal of this paper presents an original model for classification of supply chains based on different studies on the theme.</jats:p>"

In collaboration with the Government of the Ningxia province, we examined the impact of two key features of the reform on health care utilisation using panel household data. The first policy change was a redesign of the rural insurance benefit package, with an emphasis on reorientating incentives away from inpatient towards outpatient care. The second policy change involved a shift from a fee‐for‐service payment method to a capitation budget with pay‐for‐performance amongst primary care providers. We find that the insurance intervention, in isolation, led to a 47% increase in the use of outpatient care at village clinics and greater intensity of treatment (e.g. injections). By contrast, the two interventions in combination showed no effect on health care use over and above that generated by the redesign of the insurance benefit package.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>UNICEF, the Government of Mozambique and the Government of the Netherlands co-financed a USD 48 million rural water supply and sanitation intervention termed the One Million Initiative between 2007 and 2013. This paper presents the methods applied and the results obtained from the annual audits carried out in the programme using a Sustainability Check (SC) tool. The SC was applied by external audit company and was designed to ensure ongoing sustainability of investments beyond the programme lifespan. It grades the status of rural water supplies and ‘open defecation free’ (ODF) communities based on a multivariate composite index comprising institutional, social, technical and financial indicators. The SC uses three data collection instruments: a semi-structured focus group with the district authorities, a facility audit of water points, and an audit of ODF villages with a semi-structured household survey. The paper notes a trend towards increased sustainability of both ODF communities and rural water supplies during the course of the five-year period. The study concluded that an 80% sustainability score provides the greatest statistical probability of achieving &amp;gt;90% of functioning water supplies. The paper notes that when the sustainability score is &amp;lt;80%, the probability of the water supply functioning drastically reduces to 50%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Future climate change is a source of growing concerns for the supply of energy and resources, and it may have significant impacts on industry and the economy. Major effects are likely to arise from changes to the freshwater resources system, due to the connection of energy generation to these water systems. Using future climate data downscaled by a stochastic weather generator, this study investigates the potential impacts of climate change on long‐term reservoir operations at the Chungju multipurpose dam in South Korea, specifically considering the reliability of the supply of water and hydropower. A reservoir model, Hydrologic Engineering Center‐Reservoir System Simulation (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HEC</jats:styled-content>‐ResSim), was used to simulate the ability of the dam to supply water and hydropower under different conditions. The hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to determine the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HEC</jats:styled-content>‐ResSim boundary conditions, including daily dam inflow from the 6,642 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> watershed into the 2.75 Gm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> capacity reservoir. Projections of the future climate indicate that temperature and precipitation during 2070‐2099 (2080s) show an increase of +4.1°C and 19.4%, respectively, based on the baseline (1990‐2009). The results from the models suggest that, in the 2080s, the average annual water supply and hydropower production would change by +19.8 to +56.5% and by +33.9 to 92.3%, respectively. Model simulations suggest that under the new climatic conditions, the reliability of water and hydropower supply would be generally improved, as a consequence of increased dam inflow.</jats:p>",
