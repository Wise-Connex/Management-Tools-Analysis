The concept is still evolving. There is no generally accepted definition of supply chain management or general understanding of how supply chain management impacts organizational characteristics and practices. This article presents exploratory findings from a comprehensive survey regarding supply chain management. The objectives of this study were to study the impact of supply chain management on purchasing practices, to further define and develop the supply chain model from various perspectives, and to identify problems associated with supply chain management, particularly from the purchasing perspective.</jats:p>",

Some organizations are using a time‐proven technique, value analysis (VA), to leverage their suppliers' technical expertise. This study reports the benefits and challenges of supplier involvement in VA based on the experiences of four first‐tier automotive suppliers. When suppliers are involved in VA, many ideas can be developed and trust can increase, both of which strengthen buyer‐supplier partnerships. Unfortunately, reluctance to share cost data, lack of engineering resources, and failure to obtain customer approval are barriers to VA implementation. Several practices can be used to overcome these barriers.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study were to ascertain which skills are the most important to the function and to develop a concise set of factors to describe a comprehensive set of skills required of a world‐class purchasing/supply management professional One hundred thirty‐six purchasing professionals rated the importance of 30 purchasing skills. The skills were subsequently analyzed via exploratory factor analysis. Strategy, process management, teaming, decisionmaking, behavioral, negotiation, and quantitative skills were identified as key skill dimensions.</jats:p>",

Third‐party logistics service providers are targeting customizing operations to supplement their transport and warehousing services. Their expansion is driven by strategies for adding value and upgrading customer relations. This article assesses the development of these relations by presenting the results of a survey conducted among service providers. The assessment covers the nature of the purchasing policy and governance structure applied in this particular type of interfirm relations, including the type of services, contracts, frequency, level, and content of coordination and communication among parties in the chain. It was found that the new transactional context does not represent a market environment in which third parties can escape traditional arm's‐length fixed contracts. It was also found that supplementary customizing services are not often applied. Recommendations are made about purchasing these services and about initiatives for third parties to start expanding their competence within the governance structure.</jats:p>",

Excluding retirements, only about one in 20 teachers leaves each year, and the novice teachers who quit mainly cite personal and family reasons, not job dissatisfaction. Each of these findings broadens policy makers' options for teacher supply.</jats:p>"

A blocking mechanism is set in place so that currently owned journal subscription articles cannot be ordered. This service has proved to be a better alternative to the traditional acquisition of journals (both paper and online) and the interlibrary loan service. The CISTI Source/SUMO service has provided more pertinent journals, more quickly and more readily than before and in a much cheaper way than with any journal subscriptions.

Although such practices are yet to be perfected in the real world, it provides a yardstick for measuring logistical excellence. An innovative world class firm will pursue sustainable competitive advantage through wellintegrated global supply chains. As liner operators are vital members of global supply chains, their contemporary strategies need particular scrutiny to identify elements of congruence or non-congruence. The paper discusses generic liner strategies and identifies the ideal strategy congruent with contemporary supply chain management practices.</jats:p>"

As distance education gains popularity in the USA, academic departments in US colleges and universities have seen the opportunity to expand into off‐site programmes. Much attention has been given to the logistics and methodology of teaching such off‐site courses. Less attention has been given to providing information services for the off‐site programme. This paper discusses the collaboration of the University of Virginia Library with the UVa Division of Continuing Education to provide library services for off‐site students.</jats:p>",

The article deals with the problems libraries face in this situation and the opportunities presented under these new conditions. A special focus in the article has been placed on competition. What are the threats and the opportunities for libraries in a future in which monopolistic document and information centres disappear, and what will happen in the area of interlending and document supply?

Symmetries of economic fluctuations across countries are also examined. The different shocks are identified by imposing dynamic restrictions on a structural vector autoregression model. For all countries except Norway, oil price shocks have significant negative effects on output. However, whereas the oil price shock in 1973–74 triggered off a global recession, the recession in the early 1980s was largely caused by other disturbances.</jats:p>",

We report here on purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of cytosolic non-reversible glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (nr-G3PDH, EC1.2.1.9), the apparent key contributor of the NADPH required for mannitol biosynthesis in celery leaves. As determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, purified nr-G3PDH showed a molecular mass of 53 kD. A 1,734-bp full-length cDNA clone (accession no. AF196292) encoding nr-G3PDH was identified using polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. The cDNA clone has an open reading frame of 1,491 bp encoding 496 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 53,172.K  m values for the celery nr-G3PDH were low (6.8 μm for NADP+ and 29 μm ford-glyceraldehyde-3-P). NADPH, 3-phosphoglycerate, and ATP were competitive inhibitors, and cytosolic levels of these three metabolites (as determined by nonaqueous fractionation) were all above the concentrations necessary to inhibit activity in vitro, suggesting that nr-G3PDH may be regulated through feedback inhibition by one or more metabolites. We also determined a tight association between activities of nr-G3PDH and mannose-6-P reductase and mRNA expression levels in response to both leaf development and salt treatment. Collectively, our data clearly show metabolic, developmental, and environmental regulation of nr-G3PDH, and also suggest that the supply of NADPH necessary for mannitol biosynthesis is under tight metabolic control.</jats:p>",

Northern Illinois University's heating plant manager and staff meteorologist, along with a group of meteorology students, worked together to assess different types of available information that could be used in an autumn natural gas purchasing decision. Weather information assessed included the impact of ENSO events on winters in northern Illinois and the Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) long‐range climate outlooks. Non‐weather factors, such as the cost and available supplies of natural gas prior to the heating season, contribute to the complexity of the natural gas purchase decision. A decision tree was developed and it incorporated three parts: (a) natural gas supply levels, (b) the CPC long‐lead climate outlooks for the region, and (c) an ENSO model developed for DeKalb. The results were used to decide in autumn whether to lock in a price or ride the market each winter. The decision tree was tested for the period 1995–99, and returned a cost‐effective decision in three of the four winters. Copyright © 2000 Royal Meteorological Society</jats:p>",

The present analysis employs a normalized, restricted quadratic profit function approach to estimate lumber supply and Marshallian factor demand elasticities for three Canadian regions. Results indicate that the lumber supply elasticity in the British Columbia coast region may be twice as large as that in the interior or eastern regions. Comparison of Hicksian factor demand elasticities with earlier studies suggests that the own price elasticity of labor demand may be two or more times larger than that for wood. Results also indicate differential time trends in Marshallian lumber output and wood demand elasticities across regions, rising in the British Columbia coast and falling elsewhere over the past two decades. Morishima elasticities of substitution from the present and past studies indicate that the wood for labor factor intensity is more sensitive to changes in labor price than is the labor for wood intensity to changes in wood price. </jats:p>",

Root growth is a primary determinant of drought tolerance and water uptake in dry soils, which may interact with P supply and defoliation frequency for grazed white clover in legume‐based pastures. Effects of four levels of P supply (0, 17, 50, and 150 mg P kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> soil), two defoliation frequencies (frequent and infrequent), and two soil water regimes (wet and dry) were determined on various parameters associated with root growth and plant water uptake. A microscopy study was also undertaken to measure the relative size and abundance of xylem vessels in the primary roots of frequently defoliated low (P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>) and high P (P<jats:sub>150</jats:sub>) plants. Increased P supply increased the rate of water loss per pot, which was better related to the coarse root length density compared with the fine root length density in dry soil. Coarse root length density, leaf area, mean number and diameter of xylem vessels, and potential root hydraulic conductance increased 6.2‐, 12.4‐, 2.4‐, 1.5‐, and 12.7‐fold, respectively, for the frequently defoliated plants in dry soil between P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> and P<jats:sub>150</jats:sub> treatments. It also appeared that leaf area and rate of water loss were dependent on the mean xylem diameter and associated hydraulic conductance.

A rat model of tibial lengthening was used with a protocol divided into a latency period of 7 days, a distraction period that lasted 14 days with a daily distraction rate of 0.5 mm on two steps, and a consolidation period of 21 days. Vascular casting was done on the hindlimbs before osteotomy and on postoperative days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42. Scanning electron microscopic findings were correlated with radiological and histological observations. On days 7 and 14, the proliferation of periosteal vessels was pronounced and there was distinct subperiosteal bone formation on the osteotomized surfaces. On day 2, vascular branches from the medullary canal of the host bone formed a vascular network, which gave rise to multiple axial, straight vascular branches, running parallel to the direction of distraction, toward the interzone, in accordance with the progress of mineralization. On day 28, the periosteum provided vascularization to the peripheral side of the interzone whereas the center of the interzone was still relatively avascular. On day 42, the periosteal and medullary vascular channels were completely connected at the distraction site including the interzone, which was occupied by developing and mature bone trabeculae. These results suggest that vascular proliferation occurs actively during the latency and distraction periods and then gradually decreases over time. A close temporal and spatial relationship exists between formation of regenerated bone and vascular proliferation of the periosteum and medullary canal.</jats:p>",

This regime was applied 10 times per day, each bout being of 15 min duration with 60 min recovery, for 2 weeks. Cryostat sections of muscles were stained for alkaline phosphatase to depict capillaries, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to demonstrate oxidative fibres, and periodic acid‐Schiff reagent (PAS) to verify glycogen depletion. Specific activity of hexokinase (HK), 6‐phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were estimated separately in homogenates of the EDL and the predominantly glycolytic cortex and oxidative core of the TA. Stimulation increased the activity of HK but not that of oxidative enzymes in fast muscles. Comparison of changes in oxidative capacity and capillary supply showed a dissociation in the predominantly glycolytic TA cortex. Here, COX was 3.9 ± 0.68 μM min‐1 (g wet wt)‐1 in stimulated muscles compared with 3.7 ± 0.52 μM min‐1 (g wet wt)‐1 in contralateral muscles (difference not significant), while the percentage of oxidative fibres (those positively stained for SDH) was also similar in stimulated (14.0 ± 2.8%) and contralateral (12.2 ± 1.9%) muscles. In contrast, the capillary to fibre ratio was significantly increased (2.01 ± 0.12 vs. 1.55 ± 0.04, P &lt; 0.01). We conclude that capillary supply can be increased independently of oxidative capacity, possibly due to haemodynamic factors, and serves metabolite removal to a greater extent than substrate delivery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cyclicality is a well‐known and accepted fact of life in market‐driven economies. Less well known or understood, however, is the phenomenon of amplification as one looks “upstream” in the industrial supply chain. We examine the amplification phenomenon and its implications through the lens of one upstream industry that is notorious for the intensity of the business cycles it faces: the machine tool industry. Amplification of demand volatility in capital equipment supply chains, e. g., machine tools, is particularly large relative to that seen in distribution and component parts supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> We present a system dynamics simulation model to capture demand volatility amplification in capital supply chains. We explore the lead‐time, inventory, production, productivity, and staffing implications of these dynamic forces. Several results stand out. First, volatility hurts productivity and lowers average worker experience. Second, even though machine tool builders can do little to reduce the volatility in their order streams through choice of forecast rule, a smoother forecasting policy will lead companies to retain more of their skilled work force. This retention of skilled employees is often cited as one of the advantages that European and Japanese companies have had relative to their U. S. competitors. </jats:p><jats:p> Our results suggest some insights for supply chain design and management: downstream customers can do a great deal to reduce the volatility for upstream suppliers through their choice of order forecast rule. In particular, companies that use smoother forecasting policies tend to impose less of their own volatility upon their supply base and may consequently enjoy system‐wide cost reduction. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors examine the effects of organizational learning on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain. To examine the effects of exposure to organizational learning, the authors test the hypotheses in low- versus high-learning groups in two different samples. The user sample consists of 175 users, representing the international strategic business units of one U.S.-based multinational corporation (i.e., strategic business units located outside the home country of the United States). The buyer sample consists of the corporate buyers of 200 multinational corporations, and the focus is on their supply chain activities worldwide. The authors examine the activities and relationships between (1) users and buyers (as perceived by the users) and (2) buyers and suppliers (as perceived by the buyers) in the supply chain. Overall, the results suggest that facets of organizational learning have a positive influence on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain. In addition, attending learning seminars to increase understanding and use of organizational learning concepts appears to have a positive effect on the supply chain relationships. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The physiological and biochemical basis for increased seed protein concentrations (SPC) observed in restriction‐index, recurrent‐selection breeding programs with soybean [<jats:italic>Glycine max</jats:italic> (L.) Merr.] are poorly understood. The hypothesis that soybean SPC is regulated by the supply of nitrogenous substrates available to the seed was evaluated. Effects of supra‐optimal external N on seed storage protein accumulation, amino acid concentration and composition in leaves and seeds at R5, and levels of specific storage protein subunits were measured. Genotypes with different SPC (NC 107, normal; N87‐984‐16, intermediate; and NC 111, high) were grown in controlled‐environment chambers and supplied with 30 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> N as NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> from V5 to maturity or from R5 to maturity. Control plants received 10 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> N throughout the growth cycle. Relative to control, supra‐optimal N increased SPC of NC 107 and N87‐984‐16 by an average of 28%. Greater enhancement of protein accumulation than of dry matter accumulation in the seed resulted in SPCs of 460 to 470 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which are appreciably greater than concentrations observed for these cultivars grown in the field. Supra‐optimal N also increased SPC of the high protein line (NC 111) by 15%, but this increase resulted entirely from a decrease in yield. Supra‐optimal N supplied to NC 107 and N87‐984‐16 from V5 until R5 increased total free amino acid concentrations in seeds and leaves at R5 by an average of 21 and 46%, respectively. Enhanced accumulation of the β subunit of β conglycinin which does not contain methionine and cysteine accounted for the increase in SPC. While enhanced N availability increased the SPC of a normal protein line into the high range, availability of sulfur amino acids in the developing seed determined which storage protein subunits were synthesized from the extra N.</jats:p>",

Blowers were used for C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> enrichment.

The net photosynthesis for the ears was increased by 58% and stomatal conductance (<jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>) was decreased by 26% due to elevated C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> under ample water and N supply when blowers were applied to both C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> treatments. The use of blowers in the C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>‐enriched plots only during the C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub><jats:bold>×</jats:bold> Irr experiment (blower effect) and Low N supply restricted the enhancement of net photosynthesis of the ear due to higher C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>. In the latter case, the increase of net photosynthesis of the ear amounted to 26%. The decrease in <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> caused by higher C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> was not affected by the blower effect and N treatment. The mid‐day enhancement of net photosynthesis due to elevated C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> was higher for ears than for flag leaves and this effect was most pronounced under ample water and N supply. The contribution of ears to grain filling is therefore likely to increase in higher C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> environments in the future. In the comparison between Wet and Dry, the higher C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> did not alter the response of net photosynthesis of the ear and <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> to Irr. However, C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> enrichment increased the drought tolerance of net photosynthesis of the glume and delayed the increase of the awn portion of net photosynthesis of the ear during drought. Therefore, the role of awns for maintaining high net photosynthesis of the ear under drought may decrease when C<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> increases.</jats:p>",
