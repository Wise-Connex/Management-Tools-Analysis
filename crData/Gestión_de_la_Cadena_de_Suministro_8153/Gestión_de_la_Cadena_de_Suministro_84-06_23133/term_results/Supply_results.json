First, the Reichsbank freely issued money in exchange for whatever government or corporate debt the private sector did not wish to hold at the official discount rate. Second, the government persistently ran large deficits. Political instability and the inflation itself prevented taxation adequate to pay for social programs, subsidies to the railroad and businesses, and reparations to the Allies. The third factor was expectations of inflation, which, as they became more pessimistic, led people to hold less and monetize more of the outstanding stock of debt. Thus, the money supply was partly endogenous and partly dependent on government fiscal policy. The monetary policy of the Reichsbank, although essential to the inflation process, was a constant and passive one until stabilization at the end of 1923.</jats:p>",

This method includes deriving a \"nonbudworm\" yield curve for a particular stand type, partitioning the nonbudworm yield curve into periodic growth and mortality, explicitly defining the level of budworm effects on stand growth and mortality, and then recalculating a budworm influenced yield curve based on the periodic growth/mortality data and budworm effects. An example using this approach to explore budworm effects indicated that if protection was withdrawn from two hypothetical spruce-fir forests in New Brunswick, maximum sustainable harvest would be reduced by 23-36% under moderate budworm outbreak conditions, and by 46-64% under severe outbreak conditions. </jats:p>",

In this article we generalize this idea to one in which a capital supply curve replaces the usual discount rate. A capital supply curve is a means to model financial outlook, investment limits, and risk. We show that when such a curve is included in a capacity expansion model, it will, under certain conditions, provide a less capital intensive solution than one which incorporates a discount rate. In this article, we also provide an algorithm that solves capacity expansion models that incorporate a capital supply curve. The attractive feature of this algorithm is that it provides a means to utilize the “discount rate” models efficiently. Throughout, we give applications in power generation planning and computational experience for this application is also presented.</jats:p>",
