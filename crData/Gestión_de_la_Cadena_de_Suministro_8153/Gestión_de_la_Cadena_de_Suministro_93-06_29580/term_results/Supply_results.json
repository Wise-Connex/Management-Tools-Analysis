The process of privatization has greatly increased the need for monitoring supplies, prices and stocks. This paper describes the importance of continued monitoring of the fertilizer supply and demand situation and prices. This must be undertaken on a regular basis because while fertilizer consumption is purely seasonal, yet we continue to depend on imports of phosphatic and potassic fertilizer. Moreover, importation procedures take time. This paper also places emphasis on the correct forecasting of fertilizer demand, to avoid shortages for the farmers, or excess stocks which would yield low profits for the distributors. </jats:p>",

Although HE institutions are the largest and most extensive publicly-funded resource of technical expertise in the UK, their first responsibility is teaching and research; they do not have the resources to assist companies on routine matters or help them to adopt new technology. This article suggests that technology diffusion centres are needed at a regional level to provide technical expertise to small companies. Mechanisms for enhancing the technological performance of smaller companies and non-core technologies of larger companies are discussed and the Faraday proposals are examined. Particular attention is paid to the unique Institute of Product Development in Denmark which seems to offer a successful model of an intermediate institution which can be established relatively cheaply. </jats:p>",

However, the calibre or grain size is also important. The amount, mode of transport and grain size of the sediment load delivered to a delta front have a considerable effect on the facies, formative physical processes, related depositional environments and morphology of the deltaic depositional system. The available grain size influences (1) the gradient and channel pattern of the fluvial system on the delta plain; (2) the mixing behaviour of sediment as it discharges into the ambient basin waters at the river mouth; (3) the type of shoreline, whether reflective or dissipative, and its response to both wave energy and tidal regime; and (4) the deformation and resedimentation processes on the subaqueous delta front. Long term aspects of deltaic sedimentation, including a few generalized relationships between sediment supply and physiographic setting, are briefly introduced. The need for further detailed research on modern and ancient deltaic dispersal systems is emphasized, and specific suggestions are given for future research.</jats:p>",

A retrospective survey was conducted among 42 black and 148 white breast‐feeding mothers participating in the WIC program in a midwestern state.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The influence of population density and food on the social behaviour of the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) was studied in an outdoor enclosure. The year was divided into two periods: the nonbreeding season (October to March) and the breeding season (April to August). During each period, data on social interactions were recorded for groups of 4, 6, 8, and 10 animals, with three different sets of animals for each group size. Agonistic behaviour characterized social encounters between hares year-round. During the nonbreeding season, there was a significant correlation between agonistic behaviour and group size for females only. During the breeding season, the rate of interaction was lower and agonistic behaviour was significantly and negatively correlated with group size for males only. Two-way ANOVA of total agonistic behaviour revealed that group size and sex interacted significantly only during the nonbreeding season. The different categories of agonistic behaviour (aggression, threat, and taking the place of another animal) were also analysed separately. The distribution of aggression within each of the experimental groups indicated that the two top-ranking animals were generally males and that they initiated most of the aggressive encounters. Another experiment with restricted food availability was conducted to study the impact of limited resources on agonistic behaviour. Hares were significantly more aggressive when food was restricted than when food was available ad libitum. It thus appears that food availability has a stronger influence on social behaviour than does hare density. </jats:p>",

Model estimates of this circulation have been substantiated from new year-long high-frequency radar monitoring of flow through the Dover Strait. Model simulations of the saline balance and for the dissolved metals Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni are made for the North Sea Project (NSP) survey period, using river and atmospheric inputs specified from the 1987 Quality Status Report. Computed concentrations are in reasonable agreement with measured values (except for lead where losses by rapid adsorption were not included in the model). The flushing time,\n            <jats:italic>F</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sub>T</jats:sub>\n            , of the southern North Sea (to 56° N) is approximately 240 days. For any conservative tracer and this value of\n            <jats:italic>F</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sub>T</jats:sub>\n            , the observed seasonal amplitude in concentration corresponding to a seasonal inflow\n            <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>\n            cos\n            <jats:italic>wt</jats:italic>\n            is only 0.23 of the steady concentration corresponding to a continuous inflow\n            <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>\n            . By contrast with the above responses for ‘conservative’ tracers entering from rivers or adjacent seas, concentrations of certain ‘non-conservative’ tracers can be almost entirely determined by localized exchange processes. Thus the spatial pattern of seasonal variability in temperature and dissolved oxygen is shown to be closely correlated with the inverse of water depth. For such tracers, the influence of advection is small and generally confined to coastal or stratified waters. For shorter term processes, this influence of advection is further reduced. The transport of suspended sediments is highly dependent on particle size. While the transport of fast-settling sediments is complicated by periodic episodes of settlement and re-suspension, transport of slow-settling sediments (the main agent for adsorbed contaminants) approximates that of a dissolved tracer. Thus, to first order, simple models incorporating residual advection are adequate to relate inputs to concentrations (averaged over appropriate time and length scales) for reasonably conservative dissolved tracers. Likewise point-models are often adequate to study processes fundamentally concerned with vertical exchange rates particularly for shorter-term processes in well-mixed waters away from the coastal zone.\n          </jats:p>",

Subjects perceived greatest likelihood of harm from chemicals and lowest likelihood of harm from bacterial contamination. Relative to other concerns about food such as cost or taste, food safety ranked low. Because the concern was across all ages, education levels, genders, and places of residence, we were unable to define a type of person most likely to be concerned about food safety. Less than half the subjects had changed dietary behaviour in response to food safety concerns. Foods reduced or eliminated from the diet most often were meats, fruits, eggs and vegetables. The findings indicate that consumers need risk assessment education and help in making food choices that do not compromise diet quality.</jats:p>",
