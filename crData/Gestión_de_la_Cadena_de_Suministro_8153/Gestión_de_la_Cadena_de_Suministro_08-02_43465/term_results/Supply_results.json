These projects provided critical decision support for planning various repair and maintenance activities at ARSC. The establishment of an OR cell within ARSC, with several new employees and interns hired for this purpose, demonstrates the sustainability of these OR initiatives. The projects have created a strong emphasis on data-driven planning at ARSC. Their quantifiable benefits include reductions in inventory by 20–70 percent for 41 critical parts; repair-cost savings of 10 percent by using maintenance information for component repair planning; a successful planning of the conversion/upgrade of the H65 aircraft, thus enhancing the safety and capability for Coast Guard missions; and a 50-percent increase in throughput of the H60 Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) line, resulting in a reduction in deferred depot maintenance from a peak of $23.6 M to $6.5 M. OR techniques have clearly been successful in transforming the culture at USCG's ARSC from a “data rich and knowledge poor” decision-support culture to an “OR ingrained” decision-making environment. </jats:p>",

By 1983, delays and cost overruns, along with slowed growth of electricity demand, led to cancellation of two plants and a construction halt on two others. Moreover, the agency defaulted on $2.25 billion of municipal bonds, leading to a monumental court case that took nearly a decade to resolve fully. Daniel Pope sets this in the context of the postwar boom's ending, the energy shocks of the 1970s, a new restraint in forecasting demand, and shifting patterns of municipal finance. Nuclear Implosions also traces the entangling alliance between civilian nuclear energy and nuclear weapons and recounts a telling example of how the law has become a primary method of resolving disputes in a litigious society.</jats:p>",

From 1997 to 2005, South America had a high annual growth rate in the production of industrial roundwood, with Brazil and Chile being the most important countries. In the same period, Asia had the only negative regional production growth rate in the world, and China became the largest round wood importer in the world. This paper summarizes the status of production, consumption, imports, and exports of industrial roundwood and forest products in South America. Produc-tion and exports from South America have continually increased at annual growth rates exceeding the forestry sector in general and the U.S. in particular. Based on timber growing investments to date, a strong timber production and forest products manufacturing sector has developed in the Southern Cone countries of Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, and is increasing in other countries in Latin America. There will be continued opportunities for forest plantations and new manufacturing facilities throughout South America, tempered somewhat by perceived country financial and political risks. These opportunities will allow South America to increase its share of world production and increase imports to North America and to Asia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Multiple interrelated decision-making models are frequently used in supply chain modeling. Model integration is a precondition for efficient development and utilization of these models. This paper discusses use of modern information technology (IT) techniques and methods for integration of supply chain decision-making models. The overall approach to using IT at various stages of model development is presented. Data and process modeling techniques are used to developed semi-formalized representation of integrated models. These models support integration of decision-making components with other parts of supply chain information system. Process modeling is also used to describe interrelationships among multiple decision-making models. This representation is used as the basis for implementation of integrated models. The service-oriented architecture is proposed as an implementation platform. The presented discussion serves as the basis for further developments in developing integrated supply chain decision-making models.</jats:p>",

An integrated view is not in place yet, despite that related studies have existed in disparate pieces and keep on emerging. This paper seeks an essential paradigm shift to design/management for security (DMfSec) within the context of supply chain management. The first part is devoted to defining a new discipline of security centric supply chain management (SecSCM). We identify its fundamental tasks and requirements aided by a metaphor borrowed from information security. The second part is a discussion of a potential technical roadmap. Vital and integral to this initiative, we firstly propose the referential taxonomy that systematically accounts for security constraints, requirements, instruments and management, and investigate its relationship to underlying supply chain constructs. Secondly, with the taxonomy in hand, we present modeling issues based on dependency representation and probabilistic analysis, which are suitable for security management. Lastly we consider key tasks in DMfSec and SecSCM. With an emphasis on elaboration of challenges and requirements and employing a process and system oriented perspective, this paper intends to start rather than conclude an adventure into this vast interdisciplinary field.</jats:p>",

In this book, Michelle Goodwin systematically reviews the general ways in which the United States' current organ-donation and transplantation system negatively affects potential donors and recipients, particularly African Americans. She proposes solving these problems by changing the current system that prohibits payment for organs to one that allows it. However, I argue that the entire discussion of a market-based solution to the problem of a shortage in supply in donor organs suffers from a flaw far greater than the inability to predict how such a market would work, because of a lack of reliable evidence that an offer of compensation would be effective in changing the minds of people who currently decline to donate the organs of their loved ones.</jats:p>",

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been identified as an ideal multi-objective decision support tool to assist firms in completing the supplier selection process as part of strengthening their procurement strategies. This paper involved secondary research methods to gain an understanding of AHP, its various applications, and exploration of how to incorporate non-traditional selection criteria such as environmental criterion into the process. AHP's application for optimal supplier selection to support integrated procurement process is illustrated through an example of a Medical Device Manufacturer (MDM), known for established supplier-customer partnerships and alliances. Major limitation in studying this example included data availability to complete a comprehensive AHP decision management model. However, it was found that AHP is a powerful, structured but flexible method of addressing the multi-criteria supplier selection decision that facilitates building an integrated supply chain.</jats:p>",

To build agile global supply chains, companies first need to have access to a large supply base and secondly need an efficient mechanism for cost-effective and rapid location, evaluation, and selection of suppliers. This work introduces a matchmaking algorithm for connecting buyers and sellers of manufacturing services based on their semantic similarities in terms of manufacturing capabilities. The proposed matchmaking algorithm operates over Manufacturing Service Description Language (MSDL), an ontology for formal representation of manufacturing services. Since MSDL descriptions can be represented as directed labeled trees, a tree matching approach is implemented in this work.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we address this problem from a dynamic optimization of local decisions point of view, to ensure a global optimum for the supply chain performance. This is done under the frameworks of Collective Intelligence (COIN) theory and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). By COIN, we mean a large MAS where there is no centralized control and communication, but also, where there is a global task to complete: the global supply chain network optimization. The proposed model focuses on the interactions at local and global levels between agents in order to improve the overall supply chain business process behavior. Besides, collective learning consists of adapting the local behavior of each agent (micro-learning) to the optimization of the behavior globally (macro-learning). Reinforcement learning algorithms are used at the local level, while generalization of the Q-neural algorithm is proposed to optimize the global behavior. The model is implemented within the multiagent framework for supply chain modeling and optimization over JADE agent platform. Experimental results are discussed.</jats:p>",

Augmented levels of soil fertilisation increased cropping capacity of apple trees, however, the fruit load has not met with cropping capacity in every year. More the def cit came into view in crop load, less the fruit quality resulted in. The deficit in cropping capacity, however, could not have been determined with simple rates as fruit weight per trunk circumference or similar. Better determination was obtained where foliar nutrient contents were correlated to crop per tree figures. In general terms, the N and Ca content in leaves increased with yields when K and P content formulated reciprocally. When storage quality of 'Jonathan' apple fruits were related to crop load (kg/tree), influence of crop deficit became visible. As the crop load and foliar nutrient levels interacted, the fruit quality (number of disordered apples after 6 month of storage) subjected of both physiological phenomena.

Recent events have highlighted the need for planners to consider the risk of disruptions when establishing supply networks. Supply networks disruptions have a number of causes and may take a number of forms, such as quality variance, equipment and machine unreliability, and defects and shortage incurred from imperfect production planning, implementation, and processing. In this paper, we classify the imperfect situations that the unreliability of production processes may create into eight independently recurrent categories. With the property of recurrence of Markov chain, the limiting probability of each imperfect production category can be calculated through the transition probabilities matrix generated from these imperfect production categories. Therefore, an adaptive (s, Q) production system with finite states forms a Markov chain to determine the reproduction point and the quantity of production can be established to smooth supply disruptions incurred from imperfect production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1970s, and especially again since the attacks of September 11, 2001, a considerable body of literature has addressed the nature, causes, and consequences of the relative decline of United States power. Of particular interest is research that suggests the US is guilty of the same kind of imperial overstretch that brought down the Spanish in the 17th century and the British in the first half of the 20th century. Imperial overstretch, or a lack of balance between militarized foreign policy commitments and the resources needed to sustain those interests has, according to some scholars, weakened American power abroad by placing too many demands on the US armed services and scattering them about the globe. I discuss the literature on US foreign policy and hegemonic decline to sort out the various arguments, and to begin to identify the key issues and terms. I argue that one of the reasons why there has been insufficient theoretical progress in this debate is that its terms have been variously and ill-defined. I seek to remedy this problem by developing a model of US foreign policy that provides a clearly defined set of explanatory factors that will allow us to assess the relative impact of demand factors, such as international threats, and supply factors, such as the resource base of the US government. I test the model using time series analysis on US military policy data that span the Cold War and post—Cold War era and find that many of the arguments advanced by the imperial overstretch theorists are not supported. </jats:p>",

The centrality of local ingredients and culinary resources to the culinary tourism experience means that an understanding of the issues and structures associated with accessing those resources can contribute to a deeper understanding of culinary tourism as a product and its linkages to other sectors of the economy. Supply chain theory is introduced and its relevance to culinary tourism discussed. A preliminary description of the supply chains for three culinary tourism products—farmers' markets, festivals, and restaurants—are identified on the basis of semistructured discussions with representatives from the three product sectors in Ontario, Canada. Key issues faced by producers in each sector are also described. The article concludes with recommendations for further research. </jats:p>",

The electrical response of LRC load especially for the small resistance (R) and small inductance (L) load was studied. Plane-shock-wave tests were conducted, and the PZT 95/5 ceramics stacked in parallel were devised to generate high-power electrical pulse. An output current of 7 kA has been obtained, and the corresponding rise time of the front edge is under 500 ns. Theoretical calculations were conducted and a good agreement with the experiment presented.</jats:p>"

This practice motivated Henig et al. (Henig, M., Y. Gerchak, R. Ernst, D. Pyke. 1997. An inventory model embedded in designing a supply contract. Management Sci. 43 184–189) to study a periodic-review inventory-control model where ordering cost is zero if the order quantity does not exceed a given contract volume and is linear in the excess quantity otherwise. This paper addresses the same problem but with a fixed cost if the order quantity is above the contract volume. The fixed cost may represent the cost of disruption for the supplier (finding more trucks, arranging extra processing capacity, persuading other customers to wait, etc.) as well as additional administrative costs. Also, suppliers may impose such costs simply to induce desired behavior by buyers. This order-cost function is neither convex nor concave. The classical inventory models with fixed costs are special cases with contract volume zero. We partially characterize the optimal policy for this system and develop a simple, effective heuristic policy. We also apply the model to a production-control problem in which an incentive is provided for not ordering over a certain quota. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper provides a method to assess the customer value and marketing possibilities of increasing transparency about the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of supply chains. The willingness of small firms, in this study farmers in food supply chains, to make information available about certain CSR issues is measured and compared with CSR issues about which consumers value more information. This will identify the CSR issues about which it would be appropriate for supply chains to increase their transparency. Moreover, farmers in supply chains are grouped based on the information about CSR issues that they are willing to make available and matched with consumer segments that have a need for such information. The method is demonstrated for Dutch dairy supply chains, but it can easily be adapted to other (food) supply chains. Transparency about the CSR issue ‘food safety’ has marketing potential for Dutch dairy supply chains and can be increased relatively simply. Transparency about the CSR issue ‘animal welfare’ also has good marketing potential, but increasing the transparency about animal welfare is considered difficult. Transparency about the CSR issues ‘environment’ and ‘revenues and costs’ has little marketing potential for Dutch dairy supply chains. The existence of market segments that have a need for information about certain CSR issues and that can be matched with groups of farmers willing to provide this information shows that there are marketing opportunities for product differentiation and target marketing in the Dutch dairy supply chain.</jats:p>",

Method: Data on discharges came from the 1999 National Nursing Home Survey ( N = 6,335). County-level bed supply, controls for hospice agency supply, and a nursing facility's percentage of area NH beds came from the Area Resource File. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare deaths with live discharges. Marginal effects were calculated. Results: Discharges due to death increased with increasing NH bed supply and decreased in areas with greater hospital bed supply, areas where hospitalizations were more likely. Hospice supply and a facility's share of area NH beds also affected the probability of discharges due to death. Discussion: Supply factors appear related to discharge decisions in a manner affecting the probability of discharges due to death, although the magnitude of the relationship may be less than expected. </jats:p>",

The cost of selling effort is private information for the retailer. We consider three different types of supply contracts in this article: price‐only contract where the manufacturer sets a wholesale price; fixed‐fee contract where manufacturer sells at marginal cost but charges a fixed (transfer) fee; and, general franchise contract where manufacturer sets a wholesale price and charges a fixed fee as well. The fixed‐fee and general franchise contracts are referred to as two‐part tariff contracts. For each contract type, we study different contract forms including individual, menu, and pooling contracts. In the analysis of the different types and forms of contracts, we show that the price only contract is dominated by the general franchise menu contract. However, the manufacturer may prefer to offer the fixed‐fee individual contract as compared to the general franchise contract when the retailer's reservation utility and degree of information asymmetry in costs are high. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The selection of the most important indicators was based on a literature review and evaluation of the\nresulting indicators for their relevance. Each indicator selected was appointed to relevant stage(s) of the supply chain\nto which it is related and, for each indicator, a suggestion for a potential information source is given. The selected\nindicators cover various influential sectors, amongst others, weather conditions, agronomical practices, trade\nand legislation, as well as a variety of information sources, e.g. on-farm records and statistical organisations. The\nconceptual model developed is aimed at predicting the occurrence of emerging mycotoxins – based on the selected\nindicators – in a particular unit of wheat. The model takes a supply chain approach and can handle various types\nof indicators and various levels of detail of information on origin of the unit of wheat. The proposed model could\nbe useful in the development of an identification system for emerging risks related to mycotoxins in wheat-based\nsupply chains. Ultimately, such a system will help industry and policy makers in their decision-making process with\nregard to prevention and control of upcoming risks.</jats:p>",

However, less is known about how the specific type of innovation may affect the entire supply chain.

By paying special attention to the chain and network perspective on autonomous and systemic innovations this paper intends to present an overview of animal-derived functional foods togehter with a classification scheme to better understand how innovations in this field can be successfully managed. Findings of the case studies lead to the hypotheses that supply chain coordination differs according to the specific type of innovation and that the more systemic the innovation is (i.e. the more linkages in the chain it creates) the more centralized supply chain coordination ought to be.</jats:p>",

This model provides a theoretical basis for the empirical analysis of transparency in German pig and dairy production, which reveals interesting differences between the two sectors as perceived by farmers.

As a preliminary investigation, the Ballard NEXA™ power module performances are experimentally characterized. The power consumptions of ancillaries, such as the air fan, are then evaluated to investigate the system. To achieve an overall system model, components, such as the compressor, the pipes, the valves, the expander, and the humidifier, are then simulated. This simulation is based on the same assumption: Fluidic circuits are described by an electrical analogy. The anodic gas management is finally described according to the delivered output current.</jats:p>",

Interstitial partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) of the stomach in the anastomotic region was measured during oesophagectomy and in the intensive care unit. Interstitial Po2 values were determined after ligation of the short gastric vessels, after ligation of the left gastric artery, after forming the conduit and after gastric transposition. Postoperative measurements were recorded during endotracheal intubation, while breathing oxygen by mask or through the nose, and while breathing air.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Interstitial Po2 levels were significantly higher before ligation of the left gastric artery than after ligation (mean 76·1 (95 per cent confidence interval 54·9 to 103·1) versus 44·9 (24·6 to 77·1) mmHg; P = 0·001).

Therefore first, stakeholders’ goals are generalized via focus groups and individual interviews. Second, stakeholders’ goals are consolidated, based on their specificity and conflicting/divergent nature and as a result, supply chain goals are developed. Third, potential performance indicators are listed, supporting the developed supply chain goals. Fourth, key performance indicators (KPIs) are selected. As a result, five main supply chain goals are formulated (traditionalism, efficiency, responsiveness, quality and chain balance) together with their supporting performance indicators. Future research should focus on validating the instrument in other food and non-food sectors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The increased energy required for acute moderate exercise by skeletal muscle (SkM) is derived equally from enhanced fatty acid (FA) oxidation and glucose oxidation. Availability of FA also influences contracting SkM metabolic responses. Whole body glucose turnover and SkM glucose metabolic responses were determined in paired dog studies during 1) a 30-min moderate exercise (maximal oxygen consumption of ∼60%) test vs. a 60-min low-dose 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) infusion, 2) a 150-min AICAR infusion vs. modest elevation of FA induced by a 150-min combined intralipid-heparin (IL/hep) infusion, and 3) an acute exercise test performed with vs. without IL/hep. The exercise responses differed from those observed with AICAR: plasma FA and glycerol rose sharply with exercise, whereas FA fell and glycerol was unchanged with AICAR; glucose turnover and glycolytic flux doubled with exercise but rose only by 50% with AICAR; SkM glucose-6-phosphate rose and glycogen content decreased with exercise, whereas no changes occurred with AICAR. The metabolic responses to AICAR vs. IL/hep differed: glycolytic flux was stimulated by AICAR but suppressed by IL/hep, and no changes in glucose turnover occurred with IL/hep. Glucose turnover responses to exercise were similar in the IL/hep and non-IL/hep, but SkM lactate and glycogen concentrations rose with IL/hep vs. that shown with exercise alone. In conclusion, the metabolic responses to acute exercise are not mimicked by a single dose of AICAR or altered by short-term enhancement of fatty acid supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> In the dry areas of the world there is an increasing pressure to apply low quality brackish waters for plant irrigation (agriculture, horticulture, landscape greening). Consequently there is a demand to improve salt tolerance of conventional crops and to develop adequate irrigation techniques too. The efforts in the past decades to approach the understanding of salt stress mechanism by focusing on biochemical and physiological research were disappointing with respect to progress for crop growth and yields under saline soil conditions. However, it is generally agreed by all disciplines involved in research for crop salt tolerance that under saline soils conditions the reduced water supply of crops is the most critical growth factor. The paper presents some model calculations and field investigations that demonstrate the effect of root water uptake on the salinity of the root surrounding soil fraction (rhizospheric soil). It is shown that root hair length and rhizospheric soil volumes are factors most relevant for understanding crop salt tolerance, when growing in soils. It is postulated that short root hairs contribute to a lower salt tolerance (onions), whereas long root hairs enhance water uptake from saline soils and crop salt tolerance (rape). As interactions between roots and soil contribute to the salt tolerance of crops under field conditions, it is doubtful that selection for salt tolerant varieties and breeding for salt tolerance under conditions of water and flow culture experiments is very efficient. Breeding for more salt‐tolerant crops and brackish irrigation techniques should consider root morphology and soil/root contact zone.</jats:p>",

We find that medium‐ and large‐sized organizations are more advanced than their smaller‐sized counterparts on most aspects, but not necessarily all, of these GSCM practices. Future research includes possible studies on GSCM practices and promotion, especially targeting small manufacturing organizations.

As only persons in good health should give blood, Services have refined donor selection criteria and aim to base them on evidence; but they also have to balance the number of donations collected with product demand. Applying selection criteria inevitably leads to deferrals, which donors experience very negatively. Compared with successful donors, even temporary deferrals reduce return rates significantly, especially of first attenders. In order to encourage donor return and sustain supplies, selection criteria should be optimal. However, a major tool for managing <jats:italic>patients </jats:italic>– evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) – cannot apply to donor selection, so criteria have to be defined by alternatives, such as clinical studies, epidemiology and even what experts deem to be pathophysiologically feasible. The recommended volume of blood taken from each donor at each attendance (450 mL, which was based on old studies) was increased because of greater processing losses (buffy‐coat derived platelets, leucofiltration etc.). Although faint rates and donation‐induced iron depletion are reduced by lowering bleeding volume and bleeding less frequently, other optimizing strategies including iron supplementation have been trialled and could be enhanced by more RCTs. Better but more complex indicators of donor iron status than one‐off Hb thresholds are possible. Regulators and decision‐makers must encourage more studies. This review does not consider aphaeresis donors of blood components other than red cells in detail, or the prevention of transfusion‐transmitted infections.</jats:p>",

Adult female mice were fed a control diet or a diet relatively high in the long-chain n-3 PUFAs for 4 wk, and ovulated oocytes or zygotes were collected after gonadotropin stimulation. Oocytes were examined for mitochondrial parameters (active mitochondrial distribution, mitochondrial calcium and membrane potential) and oxidative stress, and embryo developmental ability was assessed at the blastocyst stage following 1) in vitro fertilization (IVF) or 2) culture of in vivo-derived zygotes. This study demonstrated that exposure of the oocyte during maturation in the ovary to an environment high in n-3 PUFA resulted in altered mitochondrial distribution and calcium levels and increased production of reactive oxygen species. Despite normal fertilization and development in vitro following IVF, the exposure of oocytes to an environment high in n-3 PUFA during in vivo fertilization adversely affected the morphological appearance of the embryo and decreased developmental ability to the blastocyst stage. This study suggests that high maternal dietary n-3 PUFA exposure periconception reduces normal embryo development in the mouse and is associated with perturbed mitochondrial metabolism, raising questions regarding supplementation with n-3 PUFAs during this period of time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Shell-bed development can be a product of complex sedimentological and biological factors. The Upper Ordovician sediments near Cincinnati, Ohio constitute a succession of thinly interbedded shelly carbonates and mudrocks. Despite years of study, the development of Cincinnatian shell beds and metre-scale cycles has, until recently, been attributed solely to storm reworking. This “storm-winnowing model” treats shells as passive sedimentary clasts, ignoring other factors of shell-bed development. A recently proposed alternative is Brett and Algeo’s idea that these shell beds grew during long periods of normally low sedimentation, while most mud accumulated during brief periods of high sedimentation. Under this “episodic starvation model,” any storms would winnow pre-existing muds and shell beds alike. We tested both models in the Edenian–Maysvillian (early to mid Katian) strata of the Cincinnati region by compiling observations on their petrologic, taphonomic, and paleoecologic characteristics. The storm-winnowing model does not explain several observed features that the episodic starvation model does, including (i) storm-related sedimentary structures in mudrocks and limestones; (ii) lack of a sufficiently fossiliferous precursor deposit to winnow; (iii) deep-water faunas in grainstones; (iv) mixed taphonomic conditions of shell-bed fossils; (v) ubiquitous discontinuity surfaces; (vi) carbonate concretion horizons; (vii) unwinnowed shell beds; and (viii) micrite in packstones. Episodic starvation is a superior explanation because it explains all of these features and allows for the complex interplay of other environmental and biological factors that contribute to shell-bed growth. It may also be applicable to other deposits, previously interpreted as tempestites.</jats:p>",
