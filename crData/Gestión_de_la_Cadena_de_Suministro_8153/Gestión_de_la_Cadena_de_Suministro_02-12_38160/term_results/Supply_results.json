While the basic simulation serves as a useful introduction to the problems, it does not take the next step of helping students or managers plan to surmount those problems and manage an efficient supply chain. This paper suggests a strategy for taking that next step, helping students move toward solutions of supply chain problems. The strategy builds supply chain teaching modules or an executive development program around modified Beer Game simulations. This paper also provides the tools for accomplishing both an introductory and a more advanced simulation. These simulation‐based programs have proved highly effective and popular in undergraduate, graduate and executive development programs.</jats:p>",

Using a survey of senior supply and materials management professionals in the United States, this study investigates the contemporary practices and concerns of supply chain management. This study also relates the practices and concerns to firms' performance by means of bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. A general conclusion is that all of the significant supply chain management practices positively impact performance.</jats:p>",

In this context the development of new, high-tech water treatment methods is often taken into consideration. However, we have been applying riverbank filtration as an inexpensive, natural method in Düsseldorf for over 130 years. Indeed it had been introduced for “hygiene reasons” at the time and, according to our experience, riverbank filtration is well suited to meet these “new” hygiene challenges. We have intensively examined the infiltration of river water into the aquifer. We view this core process as the prerequisite for the sustained function of riverbank filtration. It is closely linked with the retention of turbid matters in the riverbed and the shearing forces on the subsurface. In addition, we have investigated the effectiveness of bank filtration as regards the elimination of microorganisms over recent years. According to these examinations, bacteria are reduced by an average of 3 log orders by bank filtration; individual breakthroughs correlate with high water events. According to our measurements Giardia and Cryptosporidium have been completely eliminated in riverbank passage. The retention of three examined types of viruses was also found to be almost completely accomplished.</jats:p>",

This is mainly due to the significant impact of material costs on profits, increased investments in advanced manufacturing and information technologies, and a growing emphasis on Just‐In‐Time GIT) production. The critical objectives of purchasing departments include obtaining the product at the right cost in the right quantity with the right quality at the right time from the right source. This requires executing effective decisions concerning supplier selection and evaluation. This article addresses the supplier selection process. This model for evaluation and selection of suppliers considers multiple factors that include strategic, operational, tangible, and intangible measures. The model also allows for input from a variety of managerial decisionmaking levels and considers the dynamic aspects of the competitive environment in evaluating suppliers. An empirical case illustration demonstrates the efficacy of the model. The results provide interesting managerial implications.</jats:p>",

Four hypotheses concerning the possible differences were developed based on a review of the relevant literature. These hypotheses were then tested using qualitative focus studies and a quantitative survey involving 82 purchasing managers with an average of 9.8 years' purchasing experience. Also, 14 interviews were conducted with purchasing executives to gain a better understanding of perceived differences. The results indicate that perceived differences exist between the processes of purchasing services and purchasing materials, especially in terms of the complexity of these processes. These perceived differences vary by the number of years of purchasing experience and the type of purchasing experience (services versus materials). Fifteen individual process steps were examined to determine the exact nature of the differences between these two processes.

In recent years, the channels literature has indicated other areas, such as relationship factors, that may affect channel partner performance; yet, no known research has examined either the extent of formal supplier evaluation programs or the factors currently used in channel evaluation. The purpose of this research is to fill that void by determining the number of firms that have systematic evaluation systems and to examine the currently used supplier evaluation instruments — with a focus on whether or not channel relationship factors are considered — from a wide cross‐section of industries. Findings indicate that less than half of the responding firms have a formal supplier evaluation process in place, and that quality, supplier certification, facilities, continuous improvements, physical distribution factors, and channel relationship factors were the factors most commonly included in supplier evaluation programs.</jats:p>",

The K uptake from soil, both from K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>and reserve K, was considerable, often even at the highest level of K fertilizer. During three years, only on the sandy soils with a low level of acid soluble K (K<jats:sub>HNO3</jats:sub>minus K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>) was there a yield response to K fertilization. The K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>values declined rapidly and flattened off at a ‘minimum level’ which differed with soil type. This minimum level for K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>is a useful parameter in fertilizer planning, because the grass usually took up the K in excess of the minimum level over two years. The minimum value of K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>was significantly correlated with the content of clay + silt in soil. The decrease in K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>during the growing season was closely correlated to the K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>value in spring minus the minimum value and, therefore, the amount of K supplied to the grass from the K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>fraction can be calculated. Furthermore, the K<jats:sub>AL</jats:sub>value for the following spring may be estimated. The release from reserve K was partially related to acid soluble K.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The photo-Fenton process is becoming a practical treatment option for waters contaminated with pesticides and other organic compounds that are poorly biodegradable. This process can potentially be integrated into an existing water treatment process to enhance organic compound removal. It can operate at low concentrations of contaminant and can often completely mineralise the compound or convert it into a less toxic form. The process is most efficient at around pH 2.8; however, it has been found that with the addition of suitable complexing agents for Fe(III), the process can be operated at close to neutral pH. This study used citric acid as a complexing agent, 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) as a model contaminant and investigated the extension of the feasible pH range of the process from pH 5 to pH 8. The study involved synthetic solutions and light from a mercury arc lamp, with a bandpass filter used to isolate the emission band at around 360 nm. Low concentrations of DCP (12 μM) and Fe(II) (10 mM) were used to simulate conditions possible in the environment. In this work, no H2O2 was added, however, a relatively high concentration of citrate (100 μM) was used. Citrate is itself degraded in the process, and since it is highly biodegradable any excess could be consumed in a subsequent biological treatment process. The extent of degradation of DCP after 2 hours was found to be 91% at pH 5, 73% at pH 6, 74% at pH 7, and 59% at pH 8.</jats:p>",

They have not been studied as extensively as the trihalomethanes (THMs), but in many waters they are found at concentrations equal to, or greater than, the concentration of THMs. Health effects research suggests that some HAA species are more harmful than THM species. This paper summarizes a number of the author's recent investigations concerning the formation, occurrence, stability, and control of HAAs in chlorinated drinking water. A number of examples linking observations made under controlled laboratory conditions to field-scale observations are presented, and the significance of the findings to water treatment practice is discussed.</jats:p>",

Most of the breakage occurred within a few seconds of increasing the shear rate. After each breakage the stirring rate was reduced to the original value to allow the flocs to re-grow. For alum and polyaluminium chloride, it was found that only limited re-growth of flocs occurred indicating a significant irreversibility of the floc break-up process. Residual turbidity increased after floc breakage and re-growth, indicating a reduction in sedimentation rate of the re-grown flocs, consistent with the continuous monitoring results. For the cationic polyelectrolyte, the re-growth of flocs occurred to a much greater extent and floc breakage was almost fully reversible.</jats:p>",

The amount of data generated was staggering and had to be dealt with in an orderly and structured way to derive the maximum benefit from the survey. Furthermore, the number of significant data points involved if the entire count is to be taken into consideration complicated interpretation of particle counting data. This led to the application of several data reduction techniques to reduce the number of significant parameters that had to be considered during analysis. The most common conventional method is the use of the total particle count larger than a given size, for example total count per ml &amp;gt; 2 μm. This method, however, negates one of the most powerful abilities of the particle counter, namely the ability to indicate particle size distribution. The application of the power law, a common alternative, provides a more detailed description but has its flaws. In this paper the authors illustrate how many particle counts were successfully handled in a purpose-designed database and how the power law concept was improved to provide a better particle counting data-reduction methodology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>South East Water Limited (SEWL) is one of three retail water authorities operating in Melbourne, Australia. It was the first water authority in Australia to obtain HACCP accreditation for the supply of drinking water, in November 1999. This article presents an overview of the first two years' experience in developing and establishing a food safety management plan using Codex Alimentarius Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) to ensure the water reaching customers is safe, aesthetically pleasant and meets operating licence requirements. HACCP has improved the way in which our distribution and reticulation systems are managed, primarily through the refinement and optimisation of standard operating procedures. In addition, more consideration has been given to the development of contingency plans and the appropriate use of system redundancy to ensure quality of supply. Accreditation was only the beginning of a process. Once attained, there was an ongoing need to maintain and refine hazard measurement and reduction procedures. The major challenge for SEWL has been the integration of HACCP company-wide. Spreading of HACCP was directly achieved through the involvement of operators, key personnel and subcontractors in the assessment of hazards and evaluating the appropriateness of critical control points. This not only assisted with improvements to the existing system, and the identification of system strengths and weaknesses, but was also an integral component in awareness training for HACCP. It was through assessment workshops and training that operators were able to see HACCP as primarily a summary of current practices, but with the focus of improving or maintaining water quality. The net benefits of HACCP are difficult to quantify. Overall there is a greater understanding of water quality issues, more streamlined work procedures, and an improved response to customer enquires relating to water quality. This has been most clearly demonstrated by a net decrease in customer complaints over the two years since HACCP was implemented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hepatotoxic microcystins resulting from cyanobacteria blooms occur in drinking water sources worldwide. Their removal in the water treatment process is essential if safe drinking water is to be produced. The presence of microcystins in raw water is problematic to the water treatment plant operator, as they are not removed by conventional water treatment practices (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration). Powdered activated carbon (PAC) has been shown to have the potential to remove microcystin-LR; however, its success is dependent on the application of a sufficient dose for the production of water that is safe to consume. Currently there is no method available for determining PAC doses for the removal of microcystin-LR and little information exists on the removal of other microcystin analogues. In previous work the Homogeneous Surface Diffusion Model (HSDM) was successfully used to predict the adsorption of earthy-musty tastes and odours onto PAC. In this study, adsorption experiments were performed to determine whether the HSDM could be applied to two microcystin analogues: microcystin-LR (mLR) and microcystin-LA (mLA). The HSDM was used to predict the kinetics of mLR and mLA adsorption onto a wood-based PAC from a spiked sample of reservoir water. From this information PAC doses required to remove the toxic compounds were predicted for a range of conditions. These two variants were more difficult to remove than microcystin-RR (mRR) and microcystin-YR (mYR). The ease of removal was found to be in the following order: mRR &amp;gt; mYR &amp;gt; mLR &amp;gt; mLA.</jats:p>",

As a result, it was found that Limnoperna fortunei was spawned in summer and grew up to 20 mm in size by the end of a one-year period when it began to die out and became detached immediately.

The atomized molten slag has magnetic iron oxide in its constituent molecules so that it is magnetized. In this novel coagulation technology, the atomized molten slag acts as nuclei for coagulation process and weighting agent for the resultant floc. In this study, this new coagulation technology was compared with metal hydroxide flocs such as FeCl3 and PAC in treating textile wastewater. A batch settling test was conducted to investigate the settling characteristic of sludge formed with the atomized molten slag. The settling velocity of sludge formed with the atomized molten slag is almost ten times greater than that of sludge formed with FeCl3 or PAC. The coagulation using the atomized molten slag showed a higher removal rate of color, suspended solid, TOC, COD, TKN and T-P. The atomized molten slag is capable of adsorbing organic substance, ammonia and phosphate. This characteristic leads to higher removal rate than FeCl3 or PAC. The gel permeation chromatography of the wastewater treated using the atomized molten slag illustrated that this novel coagulation technology is more efficient in removing the particles with low molecular weight. The removal rates of color, suspended solid, COD, TOC, ammonia and phosphorous increase with increasing amount of atomized molten slag addition.

Treatment studies are reviewed using the extracts of the crushed seed kernel and of the presscake (solids residue remaining after oil extraction). M. oleifera seed was incorporated into a pilot scale treatment system as a primary coagulant to clarify river water of 400 NTU in the wet season. Over 90% turbidity removal was achieved in the sedimentation stage at a dosage of 100 mgL-1. The filtrate turbidity was maintained well below 5 NTU. Subsequent trials were conducted in an adjacent works operating at 60 m3h-1. Treatment performance was comparable to that of using aluminium sulphate. Inlet turbidities of 270-380 NTU were consistently reduced to below 4 NTU. A comprehensive study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of using M. oleifera coagulant within a contact flocculation filtration (CFF) pilot rig. A wide range of operating conditions was evaluated in order to establish the useful “working envelope” for this process combination (filtration rates 5-20 mh-1, initial turbidities 20-50 NTU). Principal results are presented. As a coagulant within chemically enhanced primary sedimentation (CEPS) of a mixed wastewater, M. oleifera dosed at 150 mgL-1 gave additional removals (compared to a plain sedimentation control) of 40% biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and in excess of 80% for suspended solids (SS). Subsequent laboratory work coupled an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) to CEPS. M. oleifera coagulant in the CEPS pre-treatment unit beneficially increased the ratio of soluble COD to volatile SS by a factor of ten compared to plain sedimentation and by a factor of three when dosing ferric chloride.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sydney Water's Woronora Delivery System periodically trialed chloramination over the last three years, with initial trials resulting in nitrification and bacteriological counts. A more planned and structured approach was used in June 2000 to reintroduce chloramination. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of chloramination as the preferred method of disinfection for the Woronora system, considering the impact on issues such as trihalomethane (THM) formation, nitrification, compliance performance and residual chlorine management. The implementation of chloramination and the optimisation of system hydraulics have resulted in significant improvements in water quality performance in terms of chlorine residuals, heterotrophic plate counts (HPC20), total and faecal coliforms and disinfection by-products. Higher chlorine residuals were seen throughout the system, taste and odour complaints were reduced to negligible levels, THM levels declined by two-thirds and nitrification was not evident at any stage throughout the trial. A critical control matrix was developed as a vital management tool to address the issues that could impact on chloramination/nitrification in the system. Managing the nitrification balance in terms of the available ammonia and maintaining the chlorine to ammonia ratio close to 4:1 (as Cl2:NH3) within the total system and the maintenance of a higher residual chlorine level (&amp;gt;1.00 mg/L) were found to be the most critical factors in managing a chloraminated system.</jats:p>",

The study focuses on the identification of possible intermediate products and the determination of inorganic ions formed during the process, using several powerful analytical techniques such as gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and ion chromatography (IC). The primary degradation of propanil and molinate has been a fast process with half-lives varying from 4.3 to 2.9 minutes respectively, and followed pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The stoichiometric transformation of organic chlorine into chloride ion and organic sulfur to sulfate ions was observed for propanil and molinate respectively, whereas oxidation of nitrogen to nitrate ions took place at delayed irradiation times for both herbicides. The mineralization of the organic carbon to CO2 after 240 min of irradiation was found to be ≥ 95% for both herbicides. Various organic intermediates detected during the treatment have been identified by GC/MS techniques. Based on this by-product identification, a possible multi-step degradation scheme was proposed for each herbicide including hydroxylation, dechlorination, dealkylation and oxidation steps that lead to the mineralization of the starting molecule.</jats:p>",

The HWSA has completed a project integrating two aging plants into a new water treatment plant (Amagasaki WTP) with a capacity of 373,000 m3 per day. The Amagasaki WTP has three significant special merits: water treatment, environmental, and information technology. The water treatment system is based on a multiple-barrier concept that estimates the value of water treatment technology not by individual processes, but by the overall performance of the system. The treatment train consists of coagulation/sedimentation, ozonation/activated carbon fluidized-bed adsorption, and coagulation/high-rate filtration, most of which fully utilize upward-flow. The key environmental technology characteristic of the new WTP is its achievement of zero-emissions. This design reduces CO2 discharge from the plant, as well as making it possible to completely recycle the sludge as an alternate material of agricultural and horticultural soils. Improvement of customer relations is a feature of the information technology. The authority provides information on the safety of the finished drinking water, watershed management, and the maintenance of source water quality. A visitors' area and emergency water supply facility for use in disasters have also been set up at the WTP. The Amagasaki WTP started commercial operation in April 2001. The completion of this renovated plant will significantly raise the quality of service to the customers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>South Gippsland Region Water Authority experience manganese problems in most of their surface water reservoirs. Manganese is present in the form of manganese(II) ions and manganic dioxide solids. At low dissolved oxygen levels, the manganic dioxide is reduced to the manganese(II) ion. If not oxidised, the manganese(II) ion escapes through water treatment facilities and enters the supply system. Once in the system, the manganese ions are gradually oxidised to insoluble manganic dioxide causing dirty water problems which can stain clothes and bathing equipment. As part of the water treatment process, manganese(II) can be oxidised to insoluble manganic oxide and then removed by clarification and filtration. Generally, oxidation can be achieved by aeration or chemical oxidation by addition of an oxidising agent such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or chlorine. However, due to fluctuations of manganese levels in raw water, treatment techniques are often very difficult. This paper shares the experiences of South Gippsland Water in using potassium permanganate as part of the water treatment process to remove manganese in its surface water reservoirs. Whilst consideration is given to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative oxidation methods, this paper primarily focuses on the use of KMnO4 to remove manganese and the resulting analytical problems associated with monitoring manganese levels.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the percentage of total organic halogen made up of total trihalomethanes plus total haloacetic acids significantly increases with increasing bromide ion concentrations and pH. These observations suggest that both a higher bromide concentration and pH cause the formation of mainly brominated trihalomethanes with the reduction of haloacetic acids which could be identified and quantified by current USEPA methods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water treatment authorities use activated carbon as the best available technology to remove low molecular weight organic compounds from potable water. In Australia, pollutants of concern include secondary metabolites from bacterial and cyanobacterial blooms which are highly odorous and, in some cases, toxic. Of these compounds, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) is one of the most common and its unpleasant musty earthy odour can be detected at or above approximately 10 ng/L. Difficulties in using activated carbon to target such small organic compounds arise when the water has high concentrations of natural organic matter (NOM), as these compounds also adsorb on activated carbon. The adsorption of NOM on activated carbon increases the cost of using this material in water treatment due to competition with the target organic compounds, reducing the capacity of the activated carbon for the latter. The surface of activated carbon can be tailored during production to provide physical and chemical characteristics that can either aid or hinder the adsorption of particular compounds. One source of activated carbon currently under investigation at RMIT University is brown coal char waste from power stations. This waste, currently disposed of to landfill, is potentially an option for activated carbon production. This material has the advantage that it has already been carbonised at around 500°C in the power generation process. This means that less energy is required to produce activated carbon from power station char compared to coal, making the final product cheaper to produce. Previous work at RMIT has shown that steam activated power station char can remove organic compounds from water. Production of a range of activated carbons from power station char (PSC) was undertaken using different activation methods, including steam activation, steam activation with acid pre-treatment, alkali heat treatment, and Lewis acid heat treatment. The different activation methods produced activated carbons with different pore size distributions, in particular, the acid pre-treatment increased the surface area and porosity significantly compared with steam activation, and the alkali treatment increased the microporosity. Adsorption of MIB on these activated carbons was evaluated to determine the relationship between physical and chemical interactions of the activated carbon and adsorption. Adsorption of MIB on these activated carbons was found to be dependent on the secondary micropore volume. Lewis acid treatment and alkali treatment was not involved in the generation of many of these secondary pores, hence carbons from these treatments did not perform well in adsorption tests. The best adsorption results were achieved with steam activated or acid treated steam activated samples which performed comparably to commercial products. Initial results showed that competition from NOM adsorption was lowest with the PSC activated carbons, allowing greater adsorption of MIB, compared with the commercial activated carbons.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to compare the disinfection effectiveness of UV irradiation and free chlorine for naturally occurring particle-associated coliform (PAC) and non-particle associated coliform (NPAC) in wastewater using a single wastewater source, under identical laboratory protocols. Samples containing NPAC were obtained using three different methods: EGTA extraction, filtration, and blending followed by filtration. Unaltered wastewater was used for samples containing PAC. Wastewater samples were inactivated with UV irradiation at doses between 0-100 mJ/cm2, and with chlorine at CT values between 0-525 mg min/L. The dose-survival relationships and inactivation rates between PAC, NPAC, and chlorine and UV irradiation were then compared. As expected, both UV and chlorine were effective for inactivation of NPAC. However, under prolonged contact times, chlorine appears to be more effective for inactivation of PAC than UV irradiation. Contact time appears to be the most important factor in determining the effectiveness of chlorine disinfection of PAC, and chlorine CT alone was not a good indicator of disinfection effectiveness in wastewater. PAC was found to survive at UV and chlorine disinfection doses typically applied in a wastewater treatment plant.</jats:p>",

It should be also noted that the effectiveness of each method increased, as the amount of coagulant PACl used in the experiment increased. Moreover, in the filtration experiments using these two methods simultaneously, substantially higher removal efficiency of approximately 3 log (99.7%) was realized, resulting that the finished water turbidity was accordingly reduced to 0.004 mg/L.</jats:p>",

The results of this study clearly show that many arguments and doubts are possible about the scientific correctness of G-value, and its current use. This is because the G-value attempts to represent the turbulent and complicated factual velocity field in a jar. Also, the results suggest that it is still a good index for representing some aspects of mixing condition, at least, mixing intensity. However, it cannot represent the distribution of velocity gradients in a jar, which is an important factor for mixing. This study as a result suggests developing another index for representing the distribution to be used with the G-value.</jats:p>",

According to recent theoretical work on DAF, bubble size is one of the most important factors that affect the efficiency of the process, with better removal efficiency when the sizes of both bubbles and particles are similar. In this study, a newly developed particle counter method (PCM) was introduced to measure particle sizes. To confirm its usefulness, the results were compared with those from image analysis. Then, using PCM, the size of bubbles in DAF was measured under various pressure conditions which are known to affect the bubble size the most (from 2 to 6 atmospheres). The bubble size decreased as the pressure increased up to a pressure of 3.5 atmospheres. Above this critical pressure, the bubble size did not decrease with further increases in pressure. According to these experimental results, it is not only costly, but also unnecessary, to maintain a pressure above 3.5 atmospheres if the goal is only to generate smaller bubbles.</jats:p>",

This is because enlarging particle size by coagulation increases shear-induced diffusivity and the back-transport of rejected particles. However, it is known that the enlarged particles are disaggregated by the shear force of the pump while passing through it. This study looks at the disaggregation in relation to cake layer reduction. Kaolin and polysulfon hollow fiber microfilters are used for experiments. The reduction of cake resistance by coagulation is observed in a range of 17% to 53% at the various coagulation conditions. Particle size analysis results of the experiments show that aggregated particles in feed are completely disaggregated by the pump but re-aggregation of particles occurs in the membrane. This suggests that the re-aggregation of particles is critical to cake reduction and flux enhancement, since the aggregated particles are completely broken. The mechanisms for re-aggregation in the membrane are the same as those for coagulation in the feed tank. Charge neutralization is better for CCFMF than sweep flocculation although it has two drawbacks in operation.</jats:p>",

Particles and pathogens such as Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum retained in the filters are then washed by utilizing clean water. This study was conducted, primarily, to evaluate coagulation as a pretreatment for the Spent Filter Backwash Water (SFBW) treatment by ultrafiltration (UF). SFBW Samples were collected from four different water treatment plants and carefully analyzed. Jar-tests and backwash pilot studies were performed in the laboratory. Depending on the water source, protozoan parasites and viruses were found to be prevalent in SFBW. The results show that turbidity cannot serve as a surrogate for the microbial load of the SFBW. Alum flocculation pretreatment of SFBW was found to be effective in reducing turbidity, particle count, viruses and parasites, consequently it may also reduce membrane fouling. Settling the SFBW prior to flocculation did not enhance the removal of turbidity and particle count as compared to the unsettled SFBW samples. This finding might imply that settling would not be required prior to UF. The largest remaining particle fraction after alum flocculation was 3-10 μm in size, both Cryptosporidium and Giardia are found in this size range. Coagulation enhanced the removal of small size particles and may result in extending the filtration cycle by reducing the SFBW fouling potential.</jats:p>",

The EEMs of the water downstream of a lake exhibited a small but strong peak at 225 nm (excitation)/295 nm (emission) and a weak one at 270 nm/295 nm, which seemed to be derived from algae. The EEMs of the water receiving treated sewage had a distinctive, large and broad peak at around 345 nm/430 nm and also a strong fluorescence at 240 nm/330-450 nm. From the comparison with EEMs of human urine, humic acid and a laundry detergent with fluorescent whitening agents, the peak at around 345 nm/430 nm on the EEM of treated sewage was also found on the EEM of the laundry detergent. The fluorescence intensity had a good correlation with T-THMFP for a wide range of excitation/emission wavelengths considered. The fluorescence intensity at 255-295 nm/345-385 nm correlated with T-THMFP better than E260, and the maximum value of the determination coefficient was R2 = 0.90 at 260 nm/355 nm, where no distinctive peak was found on the EEMs of the river water samples. The highest correlation coefficient between the fluorescent intensity and DOC was R2 = 0.77 at 280 nm/335 nm. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the fluorescence emission from a unit concentration of THM precursors was 1,000 times or more higher than that of the overall DOC, particularly in the wavelength range of 250-265 nm/325-480 nm, and that the THM precursors in the river water contributed to a much larger degree to the fluorescence than the other DOMs not forming THM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment of waters and wastewaters by microfiltration (MF) requires the addition of chemical coagulants to enhance the removal of dissolved substances. Under these conditions the feed to the MF contains flocculated particulates which must be retained by the membrane. While an extensive knowledge base on the effect of dispersed particles on membrane cake formation and fouling exists, much less information is available on the impact of aggregates on cake characteristics. Results of impact of the size and structure (as characterized by the fractal dimension) of particulate aggregates on microfiltration membrane fouling are in qualitative agreement with a simple model based on the Carman-Kozeny equation. Larger flocs form a cake with large inter-floc porosity which results in a significantly higher permeate flux than achieved for smaller flocs. Concomitantly, looser flocs (of low fractal dimension) are likely to form a cake that has higher intra-floc voidage thus flux is higher than a cake made of compact flocs of similar size. Analysis of cake compression indicates that compressibility is strongly influenced by trans-membrane pressure (TMP). The placement of highly porous aggregates onto the membrane results in formation of a highly porous cake layer provided a low TMP is maintained. Rapid compression of the cake occurs at higher TMPs as shown by the significantly lower porosity of the cake. Under high TMP conditions, the cake porosity exhibits a strong size dependence with larger floc sizes yielding higher porosities. This result possibly indicates formation of relatively impermeable assemblages (as a result of significant compaction) with flux controlled by inter-aggregate flow, i.e. flow around compressed flocs. In comparison, the marked lack of size dependence of porosity at low TMP suggests that permeate flux is dominated by flow through (rather than around) the highly permeable flocs. These results suggest that it should be possible to control both operating conditions (such as TMP) and floc characteristics such that high permeate flux at a given TMP or low cake resistance at a fixed flux is achievable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A small full-scale ozonation/biofiltration plant was operated for 1.5 years in mid-Norway. A three-media biofilter was used to remove biodegradable organic matter from ozonated water. The biofilter contained granular activated carbon (GAC), phonolith and CaCO3 and was operated at 26-30 min. empty bed contact time. The water temperature varied between 2 and 14°C but the biofilter was operated most of the time at temperatures below 10°C. Total phosphorus concentration in the raw water was also very low (1.1-2.0 μg L-1). Batch tests showed that low phosphorus concentration and low temperature are potential limitations for microbial growth and organic carbon removal. Initially, the GAC adsorbed organic carbon while the microbial activity was building up. Most of the adsorption capacity was used after 1.5 months of operation. After this period, 14-33% of the TOC was removed (average 23%). Although the overall TOC removal in the process was modest, average BDOC removal of 55% was observed even at 3°C. Ozonation was effective in reducing colour with average removal of 80%. The results show that significant biological activity can be achieved and maintained in biofilter treating ozonated water even at low temperatures and phosphorus limited conditions.</jats:p>",

Under the commonly applied treatment conditions in iron removal plants, the floc filtration is commonly believed to be the dominant mechanism and the adsorptive filtration complimentary. Iron removal filters with iron oxide coated sand are expected to perform better in terms of filtrate quality, filter run time and costs, by switching the mode of operation from predominantly floc filtration to predominantly adsorptive filtration. A decision support system (DSS) is being developed to assess the applicability and to quantify the possible benefits associated with adsorptive iron removal for a given groundwater and a specific plant. This paper introduces the different independent and interconnected modules of the DSS and elaborates on one particular sub-module for the analysis of the extent of floc filtration and adsorptive filtration iron removal in a groundwater treatment plant under given conditions. This computer model would be helpful in optimising the plant performance under the existing mode of operation, formulating strategies for switching from floc filtration to adsorptive filtration, and designing new iron removal plants. Sensitivity analysis showed that pH, iron oxidation rate constant and pre-oxidation time (a function of depth of supernatant and filtration rate) are the main parameters determining the extent of floc filtration and adsorptive iron removal under given conditions. Predominantly adsorptive iron removal in filters can be achieved by reducing the depth of supernatant, increasing the rate of filtration and/or controlling the oxygen concentration in the feed water.</jats:p>",

NOM is a problem in drinking water for a number of reasons: aesthetics; it provides an energy source for the growth of microorganisms in the distribution system; and reacts with chlorine to produce potentially harmful disinfection by-products. One promising oxidant for the removal of NOM from drinking water is the hydroxyl radical. The aim of this work was to investigate the kinetics, mechanisms, and feasibility of treatment of a highly coloured natural water by H2O2 enhanced UV (254 nm alone or with 185 nm). Kinetic models were applied to the data as a tool to understand the mechanisms and give a basis for process scale-up. Electrical energy per order criteria were used to determine the most efficient process. Irradiation by 254 plus 185 nm was found to be more efficient than 254 nm alone for low H2O2 doses, although at higher doses the performance of the two systems became similar. Size exclusion chromatography revealed three distinct fragmentation patterns for the different processes.</jats:p>",

It was found that the adsorbed mass of hydrophobic NOM constituent on the membrane surface was higher than that of either the hydrophilic or transphilic NOM constituent. NOM adsorption was seriously affected by the apparent charge of the NOM. As the apparent charge increased, NOM adsorption also significantly increased. Moreover, the molecular mass of the hydrophobic NOM acids was too high to enable them to pass through the IX membrane, and this caused an accumulated adsorption of solutes on the membrane surface, i.e. NOM fouling. In addition, both pH and ionic strength affected NOM adsorption on the surface of the IX membrane. Lower NOM adsorption resulted from a lower pH and a higher ionic strength.</jats:p>",

High molecular (&amp;gt;5,000 Da) organic compounds which were insensitive to E260 were contained with relatively high concentration in Yodo River, whereas they were not detectable as AOC. The AOC concentration in Yodo River was reduced by coagulation because the phosphorus concentration sharply decreased. The AOC concentration rapidly increased with the reduction of E260 and slowly with the depolymerization of high molecular organic compounds during the ozonation. However, 40-50% of AOC increasing with the ozonation was reduced by the coagulation. Furthermore, batch incubations of native bacteria living in the Yodo River were conducted in order to examine the validity of the apparent AOC concentration as an indicator of the regrowth potential. The AOC concentration calculated as acetate carbon equivalent would not exactly represent the concentration of the available carbon for the assimilation. However, maximum cell numbers for the incubation period were generally proportional to apparent AOC concentrations even if phosphorus limitation. In conclusion, it is suggested that coagulation is an effective process in controlling the concentration of AOC and is a useful indicator to evaluate the regrowth potential of heterotrophic bacteria in Yodo River.</jats:p>",

This study, which is part of a larger project on the investigation of hybrid membrane processes for trace hormones removal in water recycling, focuses on binding of hormones to microfiltration membranes in filtration of solutions containing trace hormones. The adsorption capacity of the membrane, kinetics of adsorption and desorption of to/from microfiltration hollow fibre membranes, and the factors affecting adsorption to the membranes have been studied using estrone as model solute. The experiments showed that the adsorption of estrone to the microfiltration membranes could result in high retention of estrone molecules. However, since the mechanism of retention is adsorption rather than sieving, the retention decreases with increase in the amount of estrone accumulated on the membrane, and breakthrough occurs when the accumulated estrone on the membrane reaches an equilibrium concentration corresponding to the feed concentration. For long-term operation, although membranes could be saturated by hormone molecules, the membrane processes could still have a function of buffer for instantaneous high hormone concentration because the saturation surface concentration increases with the increase in the feed concentration. In addition, the experiments also indicated that the adsorption capacity of the membranes for hormones could be affected by membrane types, pH, affinity of hormones to water, as well as the presence of other organics. These results are of relevance to the potential release of trace hormones from water treatment systems where microfiltration membranes are used as a process barrier.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A “plastic” or “chemical” taint, has recently emerged as a problem in drinking water in Perth, Western Australia. The taste occurs intermittently in zones receiving blends of treated groundwaters from several sources, generally only in boiled water. The compound primarily responsible is 2,6-dibromophenol (taste threshold concentration 0.5 ng/L). It was established that the relative ratios of phenol, bromide and chlorine, and pH are important determinants in whether the taste would or would not form and that the primary sources of phenol are plastic appliances, especially kettles and refrigerators (Heitz et al., 2001). However, bromophenol formation varied widely between waters from different sources, even though reaction conditions were ostensibly identical, and it was concluded that another, as yet unknown, factor must influence the reaction rate. This could account for observations that plastic taste only occurred in some groundwaters, but not in others. In the present study the effects of organic and inorganic nitrogen-containing compounds on phenol bromination rates were examined, with the view that this might give some insights into the nature of the unknown factor discussed above. These compounds slowed the rate of bromophenol formation, and results suggested that disinfection using chloramine, rather than chlorine, could prevent plastic taste problems.</jats:p>",

The fall in overall heroin use was accompanied by a significant reduction in the rate of overdose in NSW. However, the health benefits associated with the fall in overdose may have been offset by an increase in the use of other drugs (mainly cocaine) since the onset of the heroin shortage. There does not appear to have been any enduring impact on crime rates as a result of the heroin ‘drought’.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion </jats:bold> Supply control has an important part to play in harm reduction; however, proponents of supply‐side drug law enforcement need to be mindful of the unintended adverse consequences that might flow from successfully disrupting the market for a particular illegal drug.</jats:p>",

Pilot-plant testing was used to compare the performance of recycled glass to a typical sand filter medium in a conventional treatment process. Laboratory analysis was used to determine media characteristics. Pilot-plant testing determined that the filtration performance of the glass medium was similar to that of a typical sand medium of similar effective size and uniformity under all conditions tested. The glass medium had the benefit of taking 10-15% longer than the sand to reach particle breakthrough. The glass also appeared to accumulate headloss in most runs at a slightly lower rate than the sand. Backwashing observed during pilot-plant testing also showed that the glass expanded more than the sand under the same backwash water rates. This was noted to be a potential benefit to installations that have low backwash water flow.</jats:p>",

The results are shown for the NOM derived from the Mt. Zero drinking water reservoir located in the state of Victoria, but they are representative of the other two water reservoirs investigated in the full study. The NOM was concentrated and isolated into four fractions according to hydrophobicity and charge using non-functionalised and anionic resins. Filtration experiments were conducted in a stirred cell using 0.22 μm hydrophobic and surface-modified hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes to examine the fouling effects by the NOM fractions on membranes of different hydrophobicity. The fouling rate and extent of fouling were considerably less for the hydrophilic membrane compared to the hydrophobic membrane, which was due to the reduced organic interactions (i.e., hydrophobic adsorption, charge interaction) between the NOM and the hydrophilic membrane. However, for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, the order of the fouling potential of the four fractions was the same, namely hydrophilic neutral &amp;gt; hydrophobic acids &amp;gt; transphilic acids &amp;gt; hydrophilic charged. The explanation for the high fouling potential of the hydrophilic neutral fraction was attributed to the calcium and carbohydrates (mainly polysaccharides) in the NOM, which were found to concentrate in the hydrophilic neutral fraction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra for the fouled hydrophobic PVDF and polypropylene membranes revealed some visible changes in the regions of Ar-O-Ar, C-C, C-N stretching and C-H rocking vibrations, indicating polysaccharides and aromatics being the important foulants on the hydrophobic membranes. The mechanism by which the hydrophilic neutral fraction caused severe membrane fouling was a combination of adsorption of polysaccharides on the membrane structure due to hydrophobic bonding of the non-polar segments of the polysaccharides, and electrostatic attraction interactions between the polysaccharide-Ca2+ complexes and the negatively charged membrane.</jats:p>",

Bench-scale direct filtration experiments were carried out at various initial concentrations: 500-5,000 oocysts/ml for C. parvum oocysts and 500-10,000 cells/ml for S. quadricauda. From the results, algal cell or Cryptosporidium oocyst counts of the filtrates (C) increased in proportion to their initial concentrations (C0). However, no significant differences in C/C0 profiles were observed over the examined range of the initial concentration, which implied that the removal efficiencies for S. quadricauda cells and C. parvum oocysts were not related to the initial concentrations. Examination of the deposition in the sand filter showed that a large part of S. quadricauda cells or C. parvum oocyst counts were captured in the upper layer of the sand filter, and the deposition rates were gradually reduced along the filter depth. Total cell or oocysts counts deposited in the sand filter increased commensurate with the initial concentration for both microorganisms. The ratio of the deposited cell or oocyst counts to the deposited amounts of flocs showed quite similar values between S. quadricauda and C. parvum, which meant that these two microorganisms were alike in their removal behavior. From these similar characteristics of removal, S. quadricauda was thought to be a reasonable and reliable surrogate of C. parvum oocysts removal in sand filtration.</jats:p>",

Several arsenic removal technologies suitable mainly for centralised treatment are available or under investigation. However, point-of-use arsenic removal systems, suitable for application at household level appear to be the only feasible solution under conditions prevailing in rural areas of developing countries characterised in general by the absence of centralised water supply systems. Several household level arsenic removal units are commercially available and some of them are currently under testing in Bangladesh. Nevertheless there is still need to develop a more efficient and sustainable point-of-use arsenic removal unit. Very promising results were recently obtained in laboratory experiments with a simple “family filter” with iron-coated sand (ICS) or iron-impregnated granular activated carbon. The objective of this study was to establish methodology for assessment and selection of appropriate ICS for arsenic removal with “family filter”. An additional objective was to optimise and test further “family filter” with selected ICS. Batch and filtration laboratory adsorption experiments were conducted with five types of ICS originating from Dutch groundwater treatment plants and model and natural groundwater with high arsenic concentration. All ICSs tested demonstrated arsenic removal potential with removal efficiencies ranging from 50 to 100%. Short adsorption experiments can be applied to screen the suitability of different ICSs. Adsorption isotherm and filter runs are, however, needed to establish arsenic adsorption capacity of a particular ICS. Contact time was found to be the critical parameter for “family filter” design and performance. The “family filter”, very simple point-of-use treatment unit, equipped with an appropriate ICS demonstrated high arsenic removal potential and could be very attractive for arsenic removal in rural areas of developing countries.</jats:p>",

Natural organic matter (NOM) removal efficiencies for the IOP-UF system increased markedly as a substantial amount of IOPs was added into suspension, without any negative effect on permeate flux. During IOP-UF testings, there was no difference in NOM removal regardless of the locations of IOPs whether they were either in suspension or deposited on the UF membrane, but significant initial flux reduction occurred with the formation of a precoat (attached) layer. However, all IOPs in suspension and in the cake were effective in both removing NOM and preventing irreversible fouling as long as they were removed by backwashing. Dissolved matter obtained from filtration through a 0.45 μm filter was more responsible for flux decline in UF than larger colloids. Particularly, IOP-adsorbable dissolved matter accounted for 60% of total flux decline, confirming the attractiveness of IOP addition to UF.</jats:p>",

Comparison of TON values with CLSA indicated a discernible relationship only when the odorant level was relatively high.

The attribute rating test for geosmin is more sensitive than the 2-out-of-5 odor test when the TON value is less than 10. These new methods seem better than current methods for identifying the occurrence of odor compounds in raw and filtered waters.

One of the 700 mm depth filters was amended by covering the surface of the filter bed with a prefilter. The raw water turbidity and pH was in the range of 1.5-2.0 NTU, and 7.0-7.7, respectively. Turbidity in each filter effluent was decreased as the depth of filter medium increased. However, a greater part of influent turbidity was removed within the top layer of the slow sand filters. Turbidity removal in the 700 mm depth filter with prefilter was similar to that without the prefilter, however, the removal of particles smaller than 2 mm was improved with the prefilter. The particles greater than 10 mm could be removed within the upper 50 mm depth in the slow sand filter. A greater fraction of the particles smaller than 2 mm was removed within the upper 50 mm, however, they were also removed in the deeper sand bed. The removal efficiency of DBP precursors represented by DOC and UV-254 absorbance was 9.2-31% and 2-31%, respectively. pH drop in the 50 mm depth filter was 0.12, while that in the 700 mm depth filter was 0.19.

The results indicated that more than 90% of total arsenic was removed by using FeCl3 (40 mg/L) as coagulant. The removal efficiency was 10% lower when polysilicato-iron (PSI, 2.5 mg/L) was used as a flocculant. The results of both the batch and column adsorption studies showed that iron-oxide-coated sand can effectively be used to achieve very high levels of arsenic removal (less than 5 μm/L as As in drinking water). Arsenic was removed up to 78% from the packed polystyrene beads filter with in-line FeCl3 addition at a high loading rate of 30 m3/m2.h. When powder activated carbon (PAC) was used in the membrane hybrid system, 87% removal of arsenic was achieved. A mixing time of 2.7 min with the mixing intensity of 87.8 s-1 were used. A very high filtration (permeate flux of 760 L/m2.h) was observed with a membrane of pore size of 0.2 μm.</jats:p>",

Two prototypes were developed: the first is a faucet-mounted filter which contains a fixed bed of the adsorbent and a hollow fiber bundle, while the second is an under-sink cartridge made of a porous extruded block of carbon and adsorbent. Both are able to treat at least 1,000 litres of any water containing on average 100 to 150 μg Pb.L-1, by lowering the lead concentration below 10 μg.L-1. Once their safety considerations were addressed by an independent laboratory according to the French Ministry of Health recommendations, 20 prototypes were installed at consumers' taps in northeastern France. Their performance in terms of lead removal, HPC control and bad taste and odor reduction was followed for 6 months. This field testing program resulted in the validation of both prototypes which meet the new French Ministry of Health recommendations and assures that the filtered water is fully ED 98-83 compliant.

Among 20 white-rot fungal strains, T. hirsuta IFO4917 was screened as a most effective white-rot fungus for removal/degradation of color and EDs. This strain could effectively decolorize humic acid and degrade a wide range of Eds: bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), 17 beta-estradiol, estrone and estriol, although di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) could not be degraded. A bench scale (10 L), sequencing batch reactor using this fungus was developed and applied to decolorization of a melanoidin containing synthetic wastewater (4,200 color unit). The fungus was immobilized onto polyurethane foam cubes to stably maintain the biomass, and UF was applied to achieve a complete solid/liquid separation. The wastewater was decolorized in a main bioreactor and the resultant biologically treated wastewater was subjected to UF to obtain permeate as the effluent. The concentrate containing the remaining colored components with higher molecular weights was returned to the fungal bioreactor for further decolorization. In this fungal/UF system, 70% of the decolorization was constantly achieved at HRT of 2 days. The fungal/UF system was scaled up to a pilot-scale plant (200 L), and applied to the treatment of the secondary effluent from a night soil treatment process containing color components (1,000 color unit) and some EDs, NP, 4-t-octylphenol (OP), DEHP and benzophenone. 65-70% of decolorization efficiency was achieved at a 1.5 day cycle sequencing batch operation. NP, OP and benzophenone were removed efficiently with removal of 94%, 89% and 81%, respectively. However, the removal of DEHP was not so effective (45%).</jats:p>",

It is composed of non-homogeneous organic compounds such as humic substances, amino acids, sugars, aliphatic and aromatic acids, and other chemical synthetic organic matters. NOM in water is a major concern not only because of its contribution to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) and taste and odor, but also its influence on the demand for coagulants and disinfectants, the removal efficiency of water treatment processes, etc. This research aims at identifying the influence of NOM in coagulation and flocculation processes in order to optimize the coagulation and flocculation conditions. In this study, pretreated pond water was used as the source water. It was observed from the experimental results that:The optimum pH for coagulation to remove NOM is around 7.The optimum alum dose at this pH can vary from 125-1,225 mgl-1 when the TOC is increased from 4 to 25 mgl-1.The presence of secondary compounds such as Ca2+, Mg2+ divalent cations had no significant effect on the removal of organic matter.The presence of clay increased the organic removal by 15%.The organic compound with higher molecular weight has higher removal affinity in coagulation process.Floc size and settling velocity of floc and sludge production all increased with the increase in NOM concentration. From the results of Capillary Suction Time (CST) tests, the floc formed with lower TOC readily released the water to make the dewatering process easier.The organic removal efficiency was significantly different for natural water containing non-homogeneous organic compounds compared to the synthetic water containing humic acid only (homogeneous organic matter).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For example, the NOM removal efficiency was 80% for the synthetic water containing humic acid with TOC of 7 mgl-1 at pH 7; but the NOM removal for the pretreated pond water was 60%.</jats:p>",

A qualitative study was conducted with eight e‐commerce companies in order to construct theoretical relationships with which to develop a grounded theory of the impact of e‐commerce on managing supply chain relationships. The e‐commerce environment was perceived as highly uncertain, stemming from increased information visibility and dynamic market structures. A stronger emphasis on relationship management as part of business strategy enables managers to manage uncertainty better. Interestingly, increased information does not decrease the perception of uncertainty, but creates more uncertainty. As logistics is the function often involved with both information and relationship management within the supply chain, it may prove to be invaluable in helping firms succeed in this dynamic environment.

Filtration experiments were performed at optimum pH and dose conditions for each coagulant found from previous optimisation experiments in the pilot filter plant. The results reveal two main problems in coagulation/filtration of humic waters: short filtration run times for the most commonly used metal salts, and metal residuals in treated water. The best ways to overcome these problems in raw waters high in organic matter, was found to be by the use of a coarse filter bed in combination with chitosan, or a metal salt with the addition of polymer as filter aid.

As the taste- and odor-causing compounds from algae cannot be completely removed by conventional treatment processes, and the hardness is high, there are complaints about water quality. In searching for suitable processes to upgrade the existing facilities, a two-year pilot plant test was conducted. In total 13 processes were tested, which could be divided into three groups. The main feature of the first group was the modification of the existing conventional treatment processes, which included eliminating pre-chlorination and incorporating GAC. The second group incorporated pre- and post-ozonation, GAC bed, with or without pellet softening, into the conventional processes. The third group featured membrane processes, mainly nanofiltration (NF) and its various pretreatment processes, such as microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF). The results show that although the first group has higher removal rates of dissolved organic and disinfection by-product precursors, as measured by NPDOC and THMFP, respectively, than those from the existing full-scale plants, the improvement in taste and odour was not adequate. For the second group, the dissolved organic parameters and biostability of the finished water were further improved, and half of the total hardness could be removed by pellet softening. However, earthy and fishy odours still could be detected occasionally by flavour profile analysis. Generally speaking, the third group with processes involving NF could produce the highest quality finished water: no matter organic, inorganic, organoleptic parameters, or biostability were concerned.</jats:p>",

Thus, long‐term changes in savanna floristic structure seem likely unless fire managers aim to increase the fire‐free intervals. The relative abundance of species able to reproduce vegetatively may increase under frequent fire regimes. Such a change may take a long time to detect given the fire‐resistant and long‐lived nature of overstorey species, and the capacity for vegetative regeneration in many savanna species. The impacts of fire on limiting seedling regeneration will require savanna managers to consider fire‐free intervals of several years for effective recruitment of dominant woody species.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

The laboratory-scale experiments on PAC-MF system were carried out using actual surface water (Tama River, Tokyo), before and after the treatment by a biofilter media. As a result of continuous filtration and backwash experiments, improvement of filtrate water quality and controls of membrane fouling were demonstrated by the addition of PAC. 52% of the PAC fell into a particle size between 22 μm and 45 μm. PAC larger than 125 μm and smaller than 22 mm were 6% and 4% respectively. Due to continuous aeration and Brownian motion of the particles, the size of the PAC inside the reactor was becoming smaller day by day. After 162 days of operation, the particle size from 1-10 μm was higher, which is the suitable size range for the adsorption of bacteria. At the same time, the number of total bacteria was also increasing inside the reactors. The membranes were fouled shortly during end of the operation due to the heavy load of fine particles and high accumulation of bacteria. However, PAC acts as an adsorbent media inside the reactors that causes successive accumulation of total bacteria.</jats:p>",

This has led to the need for research to find microorganisms that will indicate the stability of pathogenic removal in water treatment plants (WTPs). We investigated seven microorganisms as potential indicators: four for bacteria [E. coli, fecal coliform (FC), total coliform (TC) and heterotrophic plate counts (HPC)], two for protozoan [aerobic spore formers (ASF) and Clostridium perfringens (CP) spore], and one for viruses (F-specific RNA coliphage). Source water, treated water from each process, and finished water were analyzed periodically from three WTPs, chosen in view of the source water quality and plant size. This study concludes that HPC and ASF appeared to be good indicators of the stability of pathogenic removal. Although this study supports ASF as the best indicating microorganism, the potential use of HPC as an indicating microorganism was demonstrated in this study. From this study, the regrowth problem of HPC in water plants was shown to be negligible depending on the characteristics of the chlorination practice at the WTPs, and temperate climate conditions. The relative importances of each treatment process, for the removal of suggested indicating microorganisms, were found to be as follows: combined process of coagulation and sedimentation with prechlorination &amp;gt; filtration » disinfection, with emphasis on the necessity for the optimization of whole water treatment processes for effective microbial removal.</jats:p>",

The question posed is whether or not market institutions account for the operation of the law of supply and demand in markets populated by humans with no role required of human rationality. Are institutions responsible for the operations of the law of supply and demand or are behavioral principles also at work? Experiments with humans and simulations with robots both conducted in conditions in which major institutional and structural aids to convergence were removed, produced clear answers. Human markets converge, while robot markets do not. The structural and institutional features certainly facilitate convergence under conditions of substantial irrationality, but they are not necessary for convergence in markets in which agents have the rationality of humans.</jats:p>",

The experience acquired on the site since 1992 has revealed that the use of a crystal formation inhibitor is essential to slow down the clogging of the nanofiltration membranes, essentially on the third stage. Given the complexity of the action of the antiscalants (threshold effect, metal ion sequestration capacity, particle dispersion capacity), it is difficult to theoretically define the type of product to be used and its optimal dosing level. In addition to laboratories or modelling studies, pilot experiments are needed to assess antiscalants and optimise their doses. Nanofiltration cycles being long (1-2 months), it is nevertheless difficult to compare results of cycles, and the objective of the project was to develop a methodology for sequestering agent testing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To carry out strictly comparative studies of commercially available products as well as studies using the same product but at several different dosage levels, a pilot unit comprising three parallel nanofiltration trains was built. The pilot unit is fed with 2nd stage concentrate, produced without sequestering agent, and each trains has its own separate antiscalant injection point. The first cycle aimed to provide answers to the following: (i) choice of the antiscalant best adapted to the treatment of water from the river Oise, (ii) identification of the clogging agents, (iii) the efficiency of the chemical regeneration procedure.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A production cycle using the same antiscalant at three different doses (0, 1 and 3 g.m-3) demonstrated that this product acted through a threshold effect.

The similarity of the water permeability and salt rejection at the beginning of two consecutive cycles tends to demonstrate that the chemical regeneration procedure (caustic soda/citric acid) is efficient.</jats:p>",

The paper takes a contingency approach to explore the factors that impact production planning and control for closed‐loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery. A series of three cases are presented, and a framework developed that shows the common activities required for all remanufacturing operations. To build on the similarities and illustrate and integrate the differences in closed‐loop supply chains, Hayes and Wheelwright’s product–process matrix is used as a foundation to examine the three cases representing Remanufacture‐to‐Stock (RMTS), Reassemble‐to‐Order (RATO), and Remanufacture‐to‐Order (RMTO). These three cases offer end‐points and an intermediate point for closed‐loop supply operations. Since they represent different positions on the matrix, characteristics such as returns volume, timing, quality, product complexity, test and evaluation complexity, and remanufacturing complexity are explored. With a contingency theory for closed‐loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery in place, past cases can now be reexamined and the potential for generalizability of the approach to similar types of other problems and applications can be assessed and determined.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The aims of the study included comparing contamination in bores and surface waters in vulnerable locations, quantifying aquifer removal of microorganisms, trialing novel biochemical pollution indicators such as faecal sterols, assessing Escherichia coli as a measure of groundwater contamination and generating data for risk assessments. Sampling was undertaken of nine production bores, nine monitoring bores and four surface waters for 32 parameters comprising seven microbial indicators, 12 physico-chemical parameters and 13 biomarkers (including 8 faecal sterols and caffeine) at sampling stations potentially impacted by urban development. Concentrations of microbial indicators and biomarkers followed the pattern: basins &amp;gt;&amp;gt; monitoring bores &amp;gt;&amp;gt; production bores. Only one production bore sample contained bacterial indicators (0.1 enterococci.100 mL-1 on 1 occasion). Of the faecal biomarkers, coprostanol was generally at background levels. Cholesterol appeared to be a more sensitive measure of infiltration, but was also effectively removed. E. coli appeared to be a less sensitive indicator than enterococci. None of the physico-chemical parameters were useful surrogates. Overall apparent faecal microbial removal by aquifer filtration averaged &amp;gt;4-5 logs (not accounting for viruses). To maximise warning time and assay sensitivity it is suggested that enterococci be considered as the key bacterial indicator rather than E. coli and that different combinations of indicators and biomarkers be used to identify aquifer locations at risk, the presence of significant faecal material, and the likely presence of pathogens.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To gain an improved understanding of the types of organic compounds that are recalcitrant to water treatment, natural organic matter (NOM) isolates from two drinking water sources (Mt. Zero and Moorabool reservoirs, Victoria, Australia) were separated into fractions of distinct chemical behaviour using resins. Four fractions were obtained from each water source and were organics absorbed to: (1) XAD-8 (very hydrophobic acids, VHA); (2) DAX-4 (slightly hydrophobic acids, SHA); (3) bound to an anion exchange resin (charged organics, CHAR); and (4) not absorbed or bound to resins (neutrals, NEUT). These fractions were then tested to determine the capacity of alum to remove them from water and to correlate this with the character of each isolate. The fractions were characterised by the application of high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), bacterial regrowth potential (BRP), trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and thermochemolysis. The highest removals of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by alum treatment were in waters spiked with the CHAR fractions while the NEUT fractions were the most recalcitrant. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of DOC of the CHAR fractions before treatment were the highest, whilst those of the NEUT fractions were the lowest. After alum treatment, the Mn of the NEUT fractions were only slightly reduced. Results from Py-GC-MS and thermochemolysis indicate that the NEUT fractions had the highest relative proportion of saccharide derived organic material. Nonetheless, the BRP of waters spiked with the NEUT fractions differed markedly, indicating that organics recalcitrant to alum treatment can vary substantially in their chemical composition and capacity to support microbial growth.</jats:p>",

Consequently, awareness of developments in the competitive and market environment is of paramount importance for economic success. The research presented in this paper deals with the conception of Internet-based support systems which supply actors in dynamic supply networks and chains with individualised information about their competitive and market environment. The paper builds on the situation in the agri-food sector but the discussions of the theoretical background and the principal system design generally apply to dynamic network scenarios. The paper presents a conceptual approach for a market monitoring system, which integrates results of research from a variety of scientific fields, utilises focused rule-based expert knowledge, and implements research-supported automation potentials. The design allows for information quality, efficiency and economic feasibility. First empirical results from experimental studies support the concept. The paper concludes with the discussion of a research outline for further validation initiatives in experimental and sector environments. </jats:p>",

Water was enriched with distinct forms of nitrogen, such as nitrate or ammonium and phosphorus. Enrichment with N, P or with both nutrients resulted in a significant increase in the tissue content of these nutrients. N-enrichment was followed by an increase in chlorophyll content after 4 days of treatment, although the difference was only significant when nitrate was added without P. P-enrichment had no significant effect on chlorophyll content. In all the treatments an increase in biomass was obseved after 10 days. This increase was higher in the N+P treatments. In all the treatments the uptake rate was significantly higher when nutrients were added than in control jars. The uptake rate of N, as ammonium, and P were significantly higher when they were added alone while that of N as nitrate was higher in the N+P treatment. In the P-enriched cultures, the final P-content of macroalgal tissues was ten-fold that of the initial tissue concentrations, thereby indicating luxury P-uptake. Moreover, at the end of the incubation the N:P ratio increased to 80, showing that P rather than N was the limiting factor for C. linum in the Tancada lagoon. The relatively high availability of N is related to the N inputs from rice fields that surround the lagoon and to P binding in sediments.</jats:p>"

In such a <jats:italic>Tilia‐Fagus‐Fraxinus‐Acer‐Ulmus</jats:italic> forest and an adjacent mono‐specific beech forest we compared (1) soil nutrient pools and net nitrogen mineralization rates, (2) leaf nutrient levels, and (3) leaf litter production and stem increment rates in order to evaluate the relationship between soil conditions and tree species composition. In the mixed forest only a small quantity of fine earth was present (35 g l<jats:sup>—1</jats:sup>) which was distributed in patches between basalt stones; whereas a significantly higher (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) soil quantity (182 g l<jats:sup>—1</jats:sup>) was found in the beech forest. In the soil patches of the mixed forest C and N concentrations and also concentrations of exchangeable nutrients (K, Ca, Mg) were significantly higher than in the beech forest. Net N mineralization rates on soil dry weight basis in the mixed forest exceeded those in the beech forest by a factor of 2.6. Due to differences in fine earth and stone contents, the volume related soil K pool and the N mineralization rate were lower in the mixed forest (52 kg N ha<jats:sup>—1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>—1</jats:sup>, 0—10 cm depth) than in the beech forest (105 kg N ha<jats:sup>—1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>—1</jats:sup>). The leaf N and K concentrations of the beech trees did not differ significantly between the stands, which suggests that plant nutrition was not impaired. In the mixed forest leaf litter fall (11 %) and the increment rate of stem basal area (52 %) were lower than in the beech forest. Thus, compared with the adjacent beech forest, the mixed forest stand was characterized by a low volume of patchy distributed nutrient‐rich soil, a lower volume related K pool and N mineralization rate, and low rates of stem increment. Together with other factors such as water availability these patterns may contribute to an explanation of the diverse tree species composition on Central European screes.</jats:p>",

STS produced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity in pH 7.4 medium that reached a peak at 6 h. The increase in caspase activity was associated with significant DNA fragmentation. Fluorescent imaging of treated monolayers in pH 7.4 medium with Hoechst-33342-propidium iodide demonstrated a large percentage of apoptotic cells (∼40%) with no evidence of necrosis. Caspase activity, DNA fragmentation, and percentage of apoptotic cells were reduced after STS treatment in acidic media (pH 7.0 and 6.6). The Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-AM inhibited STS-induced apoptosis, whereas the rise in intracellular Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>concentration in STS-treated cells in pH 7.4 medium was reduced in pH 7.0 medium. These results suggest that one mechanism for inhibitory effects of acidosis may be a pH-induced alteration in Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>signaling.

Imaging demonstrated a change in the mode of cell death from apoptosis to necrosis under these conditions. This change was linked to the level of ATP depletion, because STS treatment in the absence of glucose or the presence of oligomycin in media with glucose still leads to apoptosis in the presence of only moderate ATP depletion. These results demonstrate that pH, mitochondrial function, and ATP supply are important variables that regulate STS-induced apoptosis in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) of elements named mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) have previously been identified in 12 minisatellite loci of the<jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>genome. These markers allow reliable high-throughput genotyping of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>and represent a portable approach to global molecular epidemiology of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>. To assess their temporal stability, we genotyped 123 serial isolates, separated by up to 6 years and belonging to a variety of distinct IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) families, from 56 patients who had positive sputum cultures. All 12 MIRU VNTR loci were completely identical within the groups of serial isolates in 55 out of 56 groups (98.2%), although 11 pairs of isolates from the same patients with conserved MIRU VNTRs displayed slightly different IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP profiles. In a single case, serial isolates with an unchanged IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP profile showed a change in 1 out of 12 MIRU VNTR loci. These results indicate that MIRU VNTRs are stable over time and therefore are suitable for reliable follow-up of patients chronically infected with tuberculosis over long periods. Moreover, they support MIRU VNTR genotyping as a powerful first-line method followed by subtyping by IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP to define ongoing transmission clusters.</jats:p>",
