However, most research investigates SCF considering single supply chain (SC) stages or buyer–supplier dyads and focuses on a single SCF solution. It is important to see how different solutions are adopted at different SC stages, by actors with different financing needs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: With a declining purchasing power, ravage by calamities and unfavourable political environment, the electricity sub-sector in Africa has witnessed dwindling fortunes in the recent past. Although average access to electricity in the region has been rising steadily, tariffs have been increasing while government tariffs subsidies have become unsustainable, forcing an introspection, to turn the tides. This article investigated the relationship between integrated logistics systems in supply chain management and business economic benefits in the electricity subsector in Kenya. The resource-based view theory of competitive advantage and the institutional theory of systems and structures were used to address the role of integrated logistics systems as a major driver of competitiveness in supply chain activities.&#x0D;\nMethodology: Descriptive research design and regression analysis were applied to ascertain the association between quality management practices, resource activation, and capability level on one hand and business economic benefits (BEB) in form of customer satisfaction, cost reduction, and cycle time reduction on the other.&#x0D;\nFindings: The results indicate that there is significant statistical relationship between integrated logistics systems and overall performance in the energy sub-sector in Kenya. Specifically; quality management practice, resource activation level and capability levels positively and significantly influence cycle time reduction; quality management practice and resource activation level positively and significantly influence quality of customer satisfaction in a firm's operations. The overall regression model is of the form: P =5065 + 604Q +155R +74C, where P is overall performance; Q is quality management practice; R is resource activation level and C is capability level. Therefore integrated logistics systems are an imperative component of supply chain as it accrues overall business economic benefits in, inventory management, customer satisfaction, and efficacy in business operations. Integrated logistics systems enhances a firm's competitiveness and facilitates the attainment of competitive advantage. Investing in integrated logistics systems should therefore be a top priority for firms keen on growth.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The research expands knowledge in the growing logistics and supply chain integration sphere in the service industry and beyond. It acts as a benchmark for further studies in the electricity subsector and other segments of the economy to inform policy and decision-making. The study calls for firms to embrace integrated logistics systems and invest in training and capacity building for its personnel to catalyze firm and customer value.</jats:p>"

Drawing on the Knowledge-Based View (KBV) and Dynamic Capability View (DCV), this research aims to demonstrate how the adoption of BCT can enhance the environmental supply chain performance (SCP). A total of 603 valid surveys were collected from respondents from manufacturing and service organizations in Egypt. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modelling, and results revealed that BCT adoption alone had a negative direct impact on environmental SCP. However, when this relationship was mediated by SCR and sequentially mediated by customer integration and green customer information sharing, the results were positive. This research presents insights on how organizations can adapt to dynamic business environments, and, in addition, it extends the theories of KBV and DCV in an empirical contribution by filling the gap in understanding regarding how environmental SCP can be enhanced through the adoption of BCT.</jats:p>"

As a guideline in the field of supply chain management, this chapter suggests designing the AM-based supply chain configuration according to the supply chain strategy decided by the focal company of the supply chain. Two questions are not fully resolved in doctrine: the first concerns the measurement of the effects of additive manufacturing implementation in conventional companies and supply chains: the second, the relationship between the total average unit cost and the production volume of additive products. In agreement with some scholars, quantitative approach to the analysis of the impact of additive technologies in companies and supply chains is recommended, and the choice of a simulation method for ex-ante assessment of pros and cons of additive technologies over conventional ones is suggested. The goal of this chapter is twofold: to demonstrate that the superiority of additive manufacturing over conventional one cannot be discussed a priori, because it must be proven quantitatively on a case-by-case basis; to support the thesis according to which additive machines can achieve economies of scale.</jats:p>"

However, these data are not primarily collected for this purpose, which\nmakes interpretation and analysis difficult. Examples of limitations of these data\nsources include: the extent to which they reflect operational priorities rather than\nimpact on drug supply; question marks over the robustness of and consistency in data\ncollection methods; and issues around the timeliness of data availability.\nMaking sense of such data is therefore challenging and extreme care needs to be taken\nwhen using it. Nevertheless, given the considerable resources invested in drug supply\nreduction, understanding the impact of these interventions is essential, so improving the\nquality of the data collected and expanding its scope should be a priority for those\nseeking to understand or monitor drug markets and supply reduction. In addition to\nhighlighting some of the potential pitfalls in using supply indicators for policy\nevaluation, this chapter presents some options for improvements based on the current\nEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction programme of work to\ndevelop their supply-related monitoring and analysis. The conceptual framework\ndeveloped to underpin this work may have wider applications and has the potential to\nprovide a richer picture of drug markets, at both national and international levels, to aid\nefforts to evaluate drug supply reduction policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;</jats:p>",

A global supply chain and cooperation in renewable energy technologies are vital for success. However, the increasing trend towards domestic protectionism in the clean energy sector may result in significant cost increases and hinder efforts to tackle climate change. Our study examined the cost savings, energy savings, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction achieved through a globalised solar PV module supply chain compared to a hypothetical scenario where domestic manufacturers supplied an increasing proportion of installed capacities over ten years from 2004 to 2021. We focused on five representative countries: China, the United States, Germany, Japan, and India. Our analysis revealed substantial cumulative savings in these countries, with cost savings totalling US$181 billion (165-179 billion), energy savings reaching 2.26 EJ-eq (1.99-2.56 EJ-eq), and greenhouse gas emissions avoidance amounting to 105 Mt CO2-eq (73-145 Mt CO2-eq). Future projections from 2022 to 2050 under two IEA scenarios indicate continued savings. This analysis highlights a globalised supply chain's significant cost, energy, and emissions benefits. Coordinated policy reforms are needed to facilitate clean energy trade and technology transfer to achieve global environmental goals.</jats:p>"

We examine the gender gap in labor supply with a focus on education and spousal earnings in explaining the gap using decomposition analysis. Endowment differences in education between married men and women increase the gender gap. However, its adverse effect has decreased over time with Korean women acquiring either equal or higher access to education. We also highlight spousal earnings as an important explanation for the unchanged gender gap in labor supply. Our result implies that intrahousehold equality in earnings may lead to gender equality in labor supply and vice versa. Consistent with other studies focusing on Asian countries, a large portion of South Korea’s gender gap in labor supply remains unexplained.\nJEL classification: J16, J21, J22</jats:p>"

We build on the seminal framework for the transition from a dirty to a clean energy in Golosov et al. (2014) to incorporate the role played by primary minerals and their potential recycling. We characterize the optimal paths of the energy transition under various mineral constraint scenarios. Mineral constraints limit the development of green energy in the long run: low-carbon energy production eventually reaches a plateau. We run our simulations using copper as the limiting mineral and we allow for its full recycling. Even in the limiting case of a 100% recycling rate, after five to six decades green energy production is 50% lower than in the scenario with unlimited primary copper, and after 30 decades, GDP is 3–8% lower. In extension scenarios, we confirm that a longer life duration of green capital delays copper extraction and the green energy peak, whereas reduced recycling caps moves the peak in green energy production forward.</jats:p>"

Optimum alum does apply to reduce turbidity for mountain water samples from Hmong, Karen, Lahu, and Lisu for three seasons. The optimum alum dose is between 20 - 40 mg/l in rainy seasons and 10 – 40 mg/l in summer. The cold season was low optimum alum dose at 10 mg/l for all hill tribe villages.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tools for measuring the resilience of infrastructure systems are necessary for engineering the increase in the resilience of communities to natural hazards. Such tools can also inform early and effective disaster risk mitigation actions that lead to rapid post-disaster recovery of the built environment, providing the foundation for a swift restoration of economic and social activities in the affected communities. We present iRe-CoDeS, a framework that measures the resilience of infrastructure systems by dynamically simulating their post-disaster changes in the ability to supply resources to users as well as the change in users demands during the post-disaster recovery period. The iRe-CoDeS framework builds on top of well-established regional hazard and risk assessment tools and extends them by simulating the post-disaster recovery of the built environment and its interdependent infrastructure systems. The interdependencies among different systems are captured at the component level. Apart from providing resource supply, each component of an infrastructure system can have a demand for resources provided by other systems (e.g., a cellular tower providing communication services requires electric power). The iRe-CoDeS framework simulates the flow of resources among components at every time step of the recovery simulation and constrains the component&amp;#8217;s ability to supply resources based on its demand fulfillment. Lack of Resilience (LoR) of an infrastructure system is used as its resilience metric: it represents the unmet demand of the community for a resource that the considered infrastructure system is providing. Such a resilience metric is particularly suited for assessing the impact of component interdependencies on community resilience and evaluating community resilience goals. The application of the iRe-CoDeS framework will be briefly illustrated in a case study that addresses the recovery of housing in North-East San Francisco after a hypothetical earthquake. Our recent work on applying the iRe-CoDeS framework for measuring and operationalizing seismic resilience in Switzerland will also be presented.</jats:p>"

The implementation of GSCM poses numerous interconnected challenges, as highlighted by research in this field. These challenges were taken into account during the development of the ISM (Interpretive Structural Modeling) model, which aims to address these issues. This model can reduce or eliminate waste levels, leading to improved economic and environmental performance within the industry. Among the identified challenges, two significant hurdles stand out: the need for knowledge about reverse logistics and the requirement for additional workers. These factors contribute to a lack of growth and hinder the industry's ability to reach its full potential. In summary, the study emphasizes the importance of GSCM in combating climate change. It identifies the challenges associated with its implementation, particularly the need for knowledge in reverse logistics and the shortage of workers. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for the industry's advancement and achieving sustainable economic and environmental outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The difficulty in obtaining commercial fertilizers by smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa makes it very important to optimize the use of local organic resources. In VilanKulo, Mozambique, a study was carried out on okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) over two growing seasons in a haplic Lixisol, a loamy-sand textured soil, applying both bat guano and biochar prepared by an artisanal process. Bat guano was applied at two rates (5 and 10 t ha−1), one month and just before sowing. Biochar was also used at two rates (5 and 10 t ha−1) applied close to sowing. Mixtures of biochar and guano at two rates (1 and 4 t ha−1, and 2 and 8 t ha−1, respectively) were also used along with a non-fertilized control. Field trials were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates. The treatments receiving high rates of guano tended to show significantly higher fruit yields (&amp;amp;gt; 10 t ha−1, being the two-year average) in comparison to the control, which showed the lowest average okra fruit yield (6.21 t ha−1). In guano treatments, the apparent recovery by okra of some important nutrients, such as nitrogen (N), was greater than the amount of nutrient contained in the guano itself. This result, together with many others related to tissue nutrient concentration, soil properties and residual fertilizing value in guano plots, indicates a strong mineralization of guano during the growing season, probably due to its low carbon (C)/N ratio and favourable environmental conditions for the mineralization process, such as high temperature and well-aerated soil. The result also suggests some kind of manuring effect, i.e., a fertilizing effect of guano beyond what can be explained by the nutrient supply. The use of biochar increased total organic C in the soil and cation exchange capacity (CEC) compared to the control, but did not affect variables related to plant performance, such as tissue nutrient concentration or plant growth and yield.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mathematical modelling of reverse logistics inventory systems ignores that returned items may arrive out of sequence, i.e. with different number of remanufacturing times. Moreover, such modelling assumes that the retuned items may retain the same quality upon recovery regardless of how many times they have been previously remanufactured. This paper develops a new mathematical expression of the percentage of retuned items that can be remanufactured a finite number of times. The proposed expression is modelled as a function of the expected number of times an item can be remanufactured on its life cycle and the number of times an item can be technologically (or optimally) remanufactured based on its quality upon recovery. The model developed in this paper considers joint production and remanufacturing options. The return rate is a varying demand dependent rate, which is a decision variable with demand, product deterioration, manufacturing and remanufacturing rates being arbitrary functions of time. The model considers the initial inventory of returned items in the mathematical formulation, which enables decision makers to adjust all functions and input parameters for subsequent cycles. Illustrative examples indicate that dependent purchasing price of recovery items and the incorporation of remanufacturing investment cost significantly impact on the optimal remanufacturing policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When modelling possible future renewable electricity systems, a strong focus needs to be directed to the input weather variables driving any such system. Since we cannot know the exact weather in any slightly distant future, a probabilistic approach is usually chosen, modelling the system over many possible scenarios, typically all of the past recorded weather data available. However, this narrows the range of situations considered to about 40 years, placing fundamental limits on the analysis, e.g. of rare, extreme scenarios.In our work, we explore the possibility of using past expired ensemble forecasts from the ECMWF [1] to drastically increase the number of scenarios considered to up to 10 000 years of data. These ensemble forecasts are physical models that are regularly initialized from the same slightly perturbed snapshot, but due to the chaotic nature of weather, their predictions diverge from each other. The later stages of their predictions are thus entirely independent predictions of what the weather could have been, including the correct spatial correlations. We analyze the data from the operational archive of ECMWF to assess their suitability for modelling renewable systems of the future and demonstrate how this wealth of additional weather scenarios can enable the utilization of otherwise heavily data-dependent machine learning techniques in energy modelling.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;[1] European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Model Ensemble extended forecast https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/set-vi</jats:p>"

The former yields Model M3 and its explicit form with constant parameter λ = 0.2 is designated as Model M4. Model M5 couples both the concepts and thus all these models are the advanced versions. The applicability of all the five models is tested using a large number of rainfall-runoff events (25,502) derived from 53 U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service watersheds. Models M3–M5 performed better than Models M1 and M2. Model performance is evaluated by employing six statistical measures, namely, root mean square error, mean absolute error, normalized root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (%), percent bias, RSR, n(t), and several grading criteria. Results show Model M5 to have performed the best of all in both calibration and validation largely due to its incorporating the impact of rain duration and allowing Ia to vary with rainfall, which is close to reality and not accounted for in any other models considered in this study.</jats:p>",

The study found that this medical insurance significantly promoted the labour participation rate of migrant workers and improved the quality of labour supply. Using instrumental variables to solve endogenous and propensity score matching method to solve selective bias, this study’s results are robust. Regarding the stability of labour supply, urban and rural integrated medical insurance has significantly increased the probability of migrant workers obtaining fixed income jobs and reduced the probability of them engaging in non-fixed income jobs. Further analysis shows that it has significantly reduced the working time of migrant workers, and improved the accessibility of their health rights and interests through health records, health education, and family contracted doctor services, which are important factors to improve the labour supply of migrant workers.</jats:p>"

Supply chain drivers have become one of the most critical potential valuable access to a competitive advantage by enhancing and improving organizational performance. This study aims to explore the impact of the drivers of the supply chain on the performance of pharmacies of the Ministry of Health in Jordan. The study used the descriptive analytical approach and simple random sampling. 300 electronic questionnaires were designed via Google Sheets and sent via email and social media to employees in the Jordanian Ministry of Health pharmacies. The study retrieved 252 questionnaires valid for analysis. SPSS was employed to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. The results showed that the Beta-value is 0.849, T-value is 25.370, at a significance value of 0.000, which means that supply chain drivers affected the Ministry of Health pharmacy’s performance. The estimated regression equation means that any one-unit increase in the level of supply chain drivers will lead to an increase in Ministry of Health pharmacies’ performance by 0.789. Furthermore, the performance of the supply chain drivers was moderate, and the general performance was high. The study recommended that pharmacies focus on employing software and modern technology in inventory control.</jats:p>",

For 70 years, Chevron Australia has played an important role in delivering oil, natural gas, and other products to power human progress. As the world’s energy demand continues to grow, we aim to grow our traditional energy business, which will continue to be a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. To help advance a lower carbon future, we are striving to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of our traditional operations and seeking to grow lower carbon businesses; while continuing to deliver the reliable, affordable energy the world needs.

This paper used BP neural network technology to study the green financing of the supply chain under the sustainable ecological environment. The method played an important role in the trial. Due to the more uncertain factors faced and the more complex environment, the risks of green supply chain finance are more hidden, diverse, and complex. The BP neural network is relatively mature in both network theory and performance. Its outstanding advantages are its strong nonlinear mapping ability and flexible network structure. The positive effect of BP neural network on green financial risk management is verified by experiments. Green supply chain finance is an innovative model of green finance. This experiment studies the risk management of green finance in supply chain and the evaluation index of green finance risk management through BP neural network method, and shows that the evaluation results are highly scientific. In addition, based on the green supply chain model, the historical data of different regions provide a scientific basis for the sustainable ecological development of the region. This paper provides guidance for the sustainable development of green finance in the supply chain and makes contributions to promoting the development of green economy. In order to control the risks of supply chain financing business, the risks of supply chain financing business are classified and analyzed, and specific project risk levels and points are determined to propose control measures to ensure effective control of the business risks.</jats:p>"

Currently, there is a crisis of organ shortage and a dire need to adopt ways and means to overcome it to save lives and improve the quality of life of patients with end-stage organ failure. In this regard, on the one hand, efforts should be made to eliminate the barriers to organ donation, such as people’s ignorance about organ donation and ethical and religious concerns. On the other hand, strategies should be implemented to enhance organ donation, which in the case of deceased donors, include accelerating the donation process, instituting a policy of presumed or mandated consent, and utilizing extended criteria for donors. In the case of living donors, these include accepting the paired donation and removing disincentives to donation. Organ donation can also be boosted by allowing restricted compensation or reward. Using social media platforms to educate people, facilitate contacts, and match with unspecified donors is also worthwhile. In the future, xenotransplantation is also showing some promise.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>More than 20% of global liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and almost all of Qatar&amp;#8217;s drinking water production originate from three industrial sites within a few tens of kilometers on the eastern coast of Qatar&amp;#8217;s peninsula. However, with the observed regional increase in maritime transport accidents, the vulnerability of those sites to major oil spills remains largely unquantified, let alone understood, due to complexities in forecasting and containing pollution in such shallow waters and harsh hyper-arid environments. To address this deficiency, we model the oil spill dispersal in the shallow maritime waters surrounding Qatar&amp;#8217;s peninsula to identify which offshore areas and times of the year pose the most significant threat to both LNG export and seawater desalination facilities. By combining the outcome of our oil transport simulations with marine traffic data, we identify two high-risk areas, sizing up to ~15% of Qatar&amp;#8217;s maritime exclusive economic zone, where the elevated oil pollution exposure is concentrated and can cause major disruptions to the above facilities. Our results suggest that the major LNG liquefaction terminal of Ras Laffan has the highest vulnerability to oil spills among all studied sites all year long. Moreover, the desalination plant to the North of Ras Laffan, producing 30% of the national water supply, has a seasonal vulnerability peaking up to an alarming level twice a year during spring and fall. The two other desalination plants located southeast of the peninsula have a lower vulnerability all year long. Furthermore, both LNG export and desalination facilities are found to be highly vulnerable to oil spills occurring outside of Qatar&amp;#8217;s maritime borders, which could land in these vital infrastructures in less than two days. These delays are further reduced when considering the spill's arrival time near coastal waters shallower than 5 m depth, which are inaccessible to several large containment vessels. Therefore, we suggest that those two offshore high-risk areas be closely monitored with airborne and orbital SAR observations, providing early warning for oil spills that can severely disrupt the LNG exports from Ras Laffan, further aggravating the global gas crisis.Reference:Anselain T., E.

Guided by the theory of constraints, this qualitative multiple-case study aimed to explore strategies pharmaceutical managers use to digitalize integrated supply chain systems to increase sustainability and profitability. The participants were senior supply chain managers from various pharmaceutical companies in the US with strategies to digitalize their integrated supply chain systems. Data collection included semistructured interviews and publicly available company documents analysis. Data were analyzed using the six-step thematic process, and three themes emerged: (a) constraints in the current supply chain system, (b) digital technology enablers, and (c) sustainable, resilient, and agile supply chain systems. A system model was developed as an outcome of the research. The primary recommendation for pharmaceutical supply chain managers is to identify constraints in the current supply chain system, follow a digital road map using digital enablers and maintain a sustainable, resilient, and agile supply chain system. Implications for positive social change include the potential to improve the delivery and quality of pharmaceutical products needed for patients by not compromising environmental, social, and economic sustainability.</jats:p>"

The global food system is a key driver of both these anthropogenic pressures, thus the development of sustainable food systems will be critical to halting and reversing biodiversity loss. Previous studies of the biodiversity footprint of food tend to focus on land use alone. We use the multi-regional input-output model EXIOBASE to estimate the impacts of biodiversity embedded within the global food system. We build on prior analyses, calculating the impacts of both agricultural land-use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints for the same two metrics of biodiversity: local species richness and rarity-weighted species richness. Our biodiversity models capture regional variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity both to land-use differences and to climate change. We find that the footprint of land area does not capture the biodiversity impact embedded within trade that is provided by our metric of land-driven species richness change, and that our metric of rarity-weighted richness places a greater emphasis on the biodiversity costs in Central and South America. We find that methane emissions are responsible for 70% of the overall GHG-driven biodiversity footprint and that, in several regions, emissions from a single year’s food production cause biodiversity loss equivalent to 2% or more of that region’s total historic land use. The measures we present are simple to calculate and could be incorporated into decision making and environmental impact assessments by governments and businesses.</jats:p>"

The proposed APS system consists of five parallel-connected dc-ac inverter modules (modules 1-5). The inverter modules 1 and 2 are three-phase dc-ac inverters for compressor motors of the cooling system, and the inverter modules 3 and 4 are three-phase dc-ac inverters for air pump motors of the braking system. The inverter module 5 is single-phase dc-ac inverter for 220VAC power supply for onboard electric loads. Simulations and experiments were carried out under variable load torque and output frequency for modules 1 – 4; and under full and no resistive loads for the inverter module 5. The measured total input current and total input power of the proposed APS system under full load condition are 118.76A and 71.25kW. Essentially, the proposed APS system is operationally applicable to the 600VDC low-floor RLV. Besides, the novelty of this research lies in the use of five parallel-connected inverter modules, unlike in the conventional APS systems which require three-phase output transformer or isolated dc-dc converter. Specifically, the proposed APS system requires neither three-phase output transformer nor isolated dc-dc converter.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Groundwater resources are essential for human water supply and ecosystem functioning. Against the background of climate change, groundwater use becomes increasingly important, as it serves as a buffer during dry periods and is often less polluted than surface water. However, changing socio-economic factors influence groundwater use patterns (e.g. demographic transition, economic development and efficiency gains) and can lead to high demands during (dry summer) periods of low availability. In addition, there are climate change-related changes in groundwater recharge due to altered precipitation patterns and increased potential evapotranspiration. Therefore, it is necessary to consider scenarios of future groundwater availability and use to support sustainable groundwater management in Europe. We combine groundwater recharge and societal water demand in Europe to identify spatial patterns of groundwater availability and demand mismatches. For the current situation, we use data from the global hydrological model WaterGAP to quantify, with a spatial resolution of 0.5&amp;#176;, groundwater stress across Europe as the ratio of total groundwater abstractions to groundwater recharge. For future recharge estimation, we compile a multi-model ensemble with data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) that includes four global climate and eight global hydrological models to assess the uncertainties that are inevitable in analyzing the future impacts of climate change. We quantify scenarios of future domestic water demand using water use data, population scenarios and climate variables on a national and sub-national scale. By combining current groundwater stress with trends in future groundwater recharge and domestic water demand, we identify hotspots of future stress on domestic water supply. Our approach contributes to the understanding of human-water interactions and highlights the importance of combining physical conditions and human influences. The methodology can be easily adapted to other regions of the world (if data on water use and population are available) to support sustainable groundwater management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Distributed Manufacturing (DM) is becoming increasingly important in operations management due to its potential to support sustainability goals, reduce risks in global supply chains, and boost local economies. However, previous analyses of the advantages and disadvantages of DM have mainly focused on operations, overlooking additional benefits across the supply chain. For example, DM can enable local sourcing, better serve end-users, and tackle reverse supply chain challenges. While economies of scale are essential for reducing costs and improving productivity, highly centralised manufacturing can increase transportation costs, vulnerability, and supply chain disruptions, particularly during pandemics or other times of restricted transportation. To address these challenges, this study introduces a Multi-attribute Decision Support System (MADSS) and assessment process that considers impacts across the supply chain and guides stakeholders, academics, and decision-makers. The MADSS handles quantitative and qualitative information, missing data, and uncertainty, and a team of experts from academia and industry in New Zealand has developed the evaluation. The MADSS was used to analyse DM and traditional construction alternatives from economic, social, environmental, and resilience perspectives in New Zealand. The research contributes to a better understanding of the impacts of DM across the entire supply chain. Also, it proposes a flexible decision-making framework to engage with stakeholders and support decision-making in other industries and regions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To obtain uniform and high-resolution jetting, the drop-on-demand inkjet can be operated with various physical properties of inks. To determine how supply pressure control affects the stability of the jetting, an experimental study was conducted on eight model inks in a range of Z number (1 &amp;lt; Z &amp;lt; 17). The velocity and volume of drop were measured by a visualization method to analyze the performance of piezoelectric inkjet head. Increasing negative supply pressure reduced both velocity and volume. The decline of volume was uniform regardless of driving voltage, whereas the decline of velocity increased with decreasing driving voltage. The printability diagram of Z–We was derived to analyze the jetting behavior according to the ink properties, such as viscosity and surface tension, and operating conditions, such as driving voltage and supply pressure. For dimensionless numbers, Z and We, the surface tension term can be compensated by the supplementary Laplace pressure force generated by the supply pressure. In the printability diagram of the modified Z* and We*, the suppression of the satellite drop formation by negative supply pressure can be identified as a shift from the outer to the inner stable region. The critical aspect ratio at the pinch-off was estimated from the Taylor–Culick analysis of the liquid filament breakup. The damping time of residual vibration was measured according to the supply pressure within the printable range. We conclude that control of the supply pressure with slight droplet velocity and volume reduction can improve the printing stability and frequency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Observations suggest that the oceanic lithosphere is shaped by dike intrusions and faulting in proportions that depend on the spreading rate (Carbotte et al., 2016). Yet it remains unclear how the interplay between magmatism and faulting during seafloor spreading affects mid-ocean ridge (MOR) axial morphology, fault spacing, and the pattern of abyssal hills (Buck et al., 2005, Huybers et al., 2022). Here we present two-phase flow numerical models of oceanic lithosphere extension that reconcile the nonlinear brittle behaviour of the lithosphere with mantle melting and magma transport through the lithosphere.&amp;#160;Fast-spreading ridges show symmetric normal faulting and axial highs, while slow-spreading ridges show an asymmetric fault pattern and axial valleys. Previous work has focused on explaining the MOR fault pattern by tectonic or magmatic-induced deformation. In the first scenario, faults result from tectonic stretching of the thin axial lithosphere during amagmatic periods (Forsyth 1992), while in the second scenario, dike-injection may create stresses that activate extensional faults (Carbotte et al., 2016). Current state-of-the-art models (i.e., Buck et al., 2005) use a single-phase formulation for the deformation of oceanic lithosphere in which a prescribed axial dike may accommodate both magmatic and tectonic extension. In these models, the fault pattern depends on M &amp;#8211; the fraction of plate separation rate that is accommodated by magmatic dike opening. While M-models are able to explain a number of observations, M represents a simple parameterization of complex fracture dynamics of sills, dikes, and faults. In particular, M-value models neglect fault&amp;#8211;dike interaction and other modes of melt transport and emplacement in the lithosphere (Keller et al., 2013).&amp;#160;Here we build a 2-D oceanic lithosphere extension model that incorporates a new poro- viscoelastic&amp;#8211;viscoplastic theory with a free surface (Li et al., in review) to robustly simulate plastic representations of dikes and faults in a two-phase magma/rock system. We hypothesise that magma supply controls the pattern of dike&amp;#8211;fault interaction in oceanic extension settings. We present simplified model problems to compare results with those from M-value models. These enable us to address the significance of M in terms of fundamental magma and lithospheric processes. We then focus on development of fault patterns, magma pathways and crustal production at fast-/slow-spreading ridges.&amp;#160;ReferencesBuck et al., 2005, Nature, doi:10.1038/nature03358.Carbotte et al., 2016, Geol.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Glacial and proglacial zones of high-mountain regions are among the areas most affected by the ongoing climate warming. Rising temperatures accelerate glacial retreat and the degradation of permafrost, with a consequent increase of instability of steep rock walls, moraines, and slopes. This may increase sediment production that could either contribute to the debris cover of the retreating glaciers, or to an increase in the amount of sediment being transported through the proglacial zone and the more distant fluvial system. The contribution of a proglacial area to the total amount of sediment that exits a basin, however, depends on many factors and it is not yet clear, if sediment supply from such areas will continue to increase or decrease in future. Filling this knowledge-gap is crucial to be able to predict the transport capacity of glacial-fed fluvial systems, especially in relation to possible related hydrogeological hazards.By analyzing aerial photographs and high-resolution digital surface models from a proglacial area in the Eastern Italian Alps, we demonstrate that these sources of sediment are intimately coupled with the position of the glacier through time; this also applies to the newly formed channel reaches that have evolved following glacial retreat. It follows that sediment sources can be &amp;#8220;switched on&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;switched off&amp;#8221; in relative short time periods, which are primarily influenced by climate-driven environmental change. Such a pulsed sediment production thus generates waves of sediment that may be entrained by the fluvial system depending on water availability and transport capacity. As such, a detailed and robust forecast of sediment yield for future scenarios may be possible if the spatial and environmental changes associated with glacier retreat and newly formed channel network are monitored and assessed.</jats:p>"

However, a persistent sustainability challenge plagues the water sector: for over 20 years, the functionality of improved water points has remained between 69% and 77%. A study on borehole forensics conducted by the CJF programme found that 30% of hand-pumps fail within five years of installation.Over the past decade hand pump non-functionality has been attributed to poor community ownership and lack of responsibility to manage the operation and maintenance of the wells. However, in some cases this has been merely hypothetical as the non-functionality of some boreholes has been due to factors that are beyond what communities can manage in terms of operation and maintenance.BASEflow with support from the Scottish Government conducted Borehole Forensics, which is a detailed investigation of a borehole and hand pump performance.&amp;#160; Twenty one (21) boreholes were technically assessed and out of these, 13 were found to have unacceptable low yield as per the required Government constant pumping rate test standard of 0.25 liters per second for not less than 4 hours.

One major policy recommendation at National level is for the need for adherence to water infrastructure construction standards and the need to empower citizens of rights to water and to hold service providers accountable for failed groundwater supply infrastructure.</jats:p>"

The pandemic showed just how quickly demand for housing can change and how prices and rents can rise rapidly as a result. The COVID-19 period, defined as mid-2020 to mid-2022 for the purposes of this study, saw robust price growth within Australian capital cities and even stronger growth in regional areas. In the rental market, vacancy rates fell across the country and rents rose sharply.COVID changed what households want from their dwelling: predominantly it was about having more space, both inside and out, and that was linked with the ability to work more from home. Overall, consumers continue to prefer houses over units in metropolitan areas. COVID-19 also created significant and distinct changes to population dynamics with low or negative growth within inner urban areas; growth in regional towns and cities, particularly those associated with sea and tree changes; and strong growth in traditional first home buyer areas, primarily on the urban periphery.Property sales in high-growth regions came significantly from investors who sold stock from the rental market (generally to first home buyers and second home buyers). This, in turn, reduced rental availability and vacancy rates and displaced private renters. Where investors did buy into the regional areas studied, these were at higher prices which were in turn reflected in higher rents.The research reiterates that increases in housing supply need to be carefully managed by governments, including the supply of social and affordable housing in regional areas.</p>"

This climate change has been documented by climate modelling and geological proxies, however, its effect on fluvial sediment dispersal remains unknown. During this period, there were a southwardly diachronous aridification in North China. We here employ detrital provenance data to track the changes in continental-scale drainage system and fluvial sediment supply in southern North China. Combing detrital zircon U-Pb age and sandstone petrographic data from the early Permian sedimentary successions in southern North China defined three major sources in the Qinling orogenic belt (P1) to the south, the uplifted Paleoproterozoic-Archean basement in the northern North China margin (P2) and in the Inner Mongolia Orogen (P3) to the north. In the high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework established for North China, we use DZ mixing modeling method to quantitatively estimate the relative sediment contributions of source regions to the early Permian southern North China basin. Our modeling results suggest that the relative contribution of northly sourced detritus (from P2 and P3) increased from ~4 % in the late Gzhelian to early Asselian (ca 301&amp;#8722;297 Ma) to ~95 % in the late Asselian to Sakmarian (ca 297&amp;#8722;290 Ma), then declined to ~70 % in the early Artinskian (ca 290&amp;#8722;286 Ma), finally returned to ~95% in late Artinskian (ca 286&amp;#8722;284 Ma), whereas the estimated relative sediment contribution of the these northerly sources remained in high, stable level (~95 %) for the corresponding successions in northern North China .The increase in northerly derived sediment fraction in southern North China through the Asselian-Sakmarian can be interpreted in terms of the enhanced erosion associated with the tectonic evolution of Central Asian Orogenic Belt which caused uplifting in the northern margin of North China. In contrast, the subsequent reduction in the Artinskian is abnormal considering the persistent tectonic activities in the northern margin of North China. It can be linked instead to the climate aridification in the northern North China and resultant decrease in fluvial sediment supply from the northerly sources to the southern North China.

For the two real-world FEED design projects (the Prairie State Generating Company (PSGC) and the 21st Century Power plant (21CPP)), we comprehensively analyze the water demand and supply risks for the two carbon capture facilities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>India plays a significant role in the global agricultural scene. India's agricultural history begins with the Indus Valley Civilization. Despite having a long history, many farmers in this country are going hungry as global corporations profit. The aforementioned issue is probably caused, at least in part, by poor supply chain management. Agricultural equipment, as most people are aware, rapidly ages if not maintained. Although the government offers storage facilities to farmers, the current logistics management system prevents them from knowing where their product is. Businesses find it challenging to track their products throughout transportation without using guessing. Because of this, it's crucial for farmers and decision-makers to monitor the state of their products and carry out routine audits of the manufacturing process. In this study, we suggest adopting blockchain technology to promote complete product transparency and increase communication between producers and consumers. Farmers and government employees that participate in the transit will have access to all the details of the process that are recorded in the blockchain. Additionally, records stored in perpetuity may be accessed for as long as required.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a literature review identifying the issues relating to the supply of battery materials most likely to cause constraints. The efforts to decarbonize the electricity and transport sector cause an increasing demand for batteries. Batteries are deployed as energy storage to facilitate high shares of variable renewable energy and in battery electric vehicles. With this rising deployment, the demand for materials utilized in battery technology follow. Lithium, graphite and cobalt are examples of important battery materials expected to experience immense demand growth. The continued access to these materials is essential to decarbonize the electricity and transport sector, which is crucial to meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement.The increased demand for these materials makes it of importance to consider possible constraints to their availability. This paper investigates issues across disciplines to assess these constraints. Causes to such constraints include: (i) Material scarcity, when a material is utilized to the point where reserves are depleted. (ii) Geopolitical issues, which could cause disruptions in supply of a material if reserves are mainly located in one country or region. (iii) Social issues, such as poor working conditions or the effect of extraction on the local environment and population. The literature review is performed to identify these key issues for the supply of critical materials for battery technology, and identify how each of these might constrain the deployment of batteries in the energy system. The key constraining factor of each battery material is identified, and the degree to which this might constrain the deployment of batteries is assessed.Energy system models are often used to assess how to transition to future net-zero energy systems. &amp;#160;To better address sustainability as well as to account for the feasibility of the transition, material constraints should be implemented in the energy system model. This could also lead to optimized energy system developments showing greater resilience against the risks associated with these constraints. The work will provide a comprehensive overview of the main limiting factor to the supply of materials critical to batteries, and with that form a basis for the implementation of these constraints in energy system models.</jats:p>"

As the heart of the circular induction accelerator, the SPS has recently been developed up to a fourth generation system that uses newly developed 3.3 kV high-speed SiC metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors(MOSFETs). The updates involved in this new SPS include the use of two parallel MOSFETs in each arm to shunt heat dissipation at high frequencies, optimization of the bus pattern, with low parasitic capacitance among the arms to improve the drain–source voltage (VDS) balance, and addition of current sampling circuits to provide an economical method to monitor the operating status in large-scale application scenarios. The heat power and temperature characteristics of the MOSFETs were studied specifically in both individual tests and SPS tests. To date, the new SPS has achieved 2.5 kV-17.4 A bipolar output at 350 kHz in continuous mode operation. The highest junction temperature of the MOSFETs was estimated to be 98 °C.</jats:p>",

Aiming at individual heterogeneity, a partial mapping double-layer hypernetwork model is constructed to study the supply chain risk diffusion under uncertain information. Here, we explore the risk diffusion dynamics, drawing on epidemiology, and establish an SPIR (Susceptible–Potential–Infected–Recovered) model to simulate the risk diffusion process. The node represents the enterprise, and hyperedge represents the cooperation among enterprises. The microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) is used to prove the theory. Network dynamic evolution includes two removal strategies: (i) removing aging nodes; (ii) removing key nodes. Using Matlab to simulate the model, we found that it is more conducive to market stability to eliminate outdated enterprises than to control key enterprises during risk diffusion. The risk diffusion scale is related to interlayer mapping. Increasing the upper layer mapping rate to strengthen the efforts of official media to issue authoritative information will reduce the infected enterprise number. Reducing the lower layer mapping rate will reduce the misled enterprise number, thereby weakening the efficiency of risk infection. The model is helpful for understanding the risk diffusion characteristics and the importance of online information, and it has guiding significance for supply chain management.</jats:p>"

For instance, lack of access to water resources can trigger political conflicts, be used as a tool for political negotiation or attacks on water infrastructure can be used as a source of intimidation. The potential political risks associated with water availability take particular relevance at the scale of international and transboundary hydrological basins and under conditions of water-food scarcity or political instability. To date, although water risks occurring within the boundaries of the hydrological basin have been studied across several case studies in the literature, the issue of risks arising from water upwind-downwind dependency has been overlooked. For instance, precipitation in a hydrological basin or agricultural centre regions with a high dependency on terrestrial moisture recycling may originate in upwind terrestrial areas outside of the basin boundaries. Here we study geopolitical risk related to this water dependency by analizing terrestrial moisture recycling. Our analysis shows that some hydrological basins in Africa, Asia and South America present a high risk of experiencing geopolitical conflicts when there is a large extension of croplands, high moisture recycling dependency and their precipitationsheds extend over warmongering countries. Hence, our results indicate that addressing transboundary water security from a surface perspective can underlook potential geopolitical conflicts that may threaten regional water-food security and peace. These risks need special international attention to guarantee global peace and agricultural production.</jats:p>"

Procurement of livable houses for the general public in Indonesia is carried out by the Government, developers and Corporate Social Responsibility program and communities. Currently, the community is experiencing a very large shortage (backlog) of livable houses. The existing supply is expected to reduce or clear the backlog. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the needs and procurement in a time series so that the supply-demand balance of livable houses is achieved. The methods used in this calculation are: a. formulate concepts and variables for calculating the need for livable houses and calculating the procurement based on realistic production potential of the livable house, b. search for relevant data available online and valid for these calculations, and c. doing trial and error so that there is a supply-demand balance at a realistic time based on the amount of the backlog value and the existing build capacity. The results obtained from this study are that the balance between supply and demand will occur at the end of 2048 if there is a supply of around 2.7 million livable housing units per year starting in 2023</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Leasing and recycling are important issues to achieve low-carbon sustainable development of construction machinery industry, however there are some dilemmas bothering which is caused by excessive restriction of product service life. Focusing on the problem of pricing and coordination, a two-stage model of leasing closed-loop supply chain based on the Industrial Internet platform practical application was proposed. Under the centralized and decentralized decision-making scenarios, the price of leasing and selling, maintenance effort and recovery rate are calculated respectively. By using the Shapley value method to optimize the selling price, and the two-part pricing contract to calculate the compensation fee, the global profit is reasonably distributed, while the supply chain achieving Pareto optimality. The performance of different contracts on the improvement of supply chain profit was investigated. And the correlation among parameters was also explored through sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation. The findings showed that maintenance and recycling of construction machinery can be improved with the advantage of the Industrial Internet platform, while achieving the supply chain coordination by contracts. The enhancement of maintenance effort can decrease the remanufacturing cost which is positively correlated to the selling price and leasing price of product, furthermore promoting the recovery rate of used products. In the future, reasonable control of platform cost can help improve the recycling of construction machinery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Antimony is a strategic element, widely used in the production of alloys, halogen-bearing flame retardants and semiconductors. As the main antimony supplier is China, new providers in the EU are necessary in order to decrease its criticality.The present study aims to evaluate the antimony enrichment of the Pb-Zn-Au carbonate replacement Stratoni deposit, Chalkidiki, Greece. The mineral assemblage comprises galena, sphalerite, pyrite and arsenopyrite &amp;#177; subordinate phases such as boulangerite, bournonite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and graphite.Boulangerite (Pb5Sb4S11) is the most abundant Sb phase, and occurs as long acicular crystals within galena, the matrix or massive pyrite. Crystal size ranges between 10 and &gt;100 &amp;#181;m. Bournonite (PbCuSbS3) is less abundant, and occurs associated with boulangerite, included in pyrite as small crystals (&lt;20 &amp;#181;m).Boulangerite shows Sb contents ranging between 25.64 and 26.45 wt%, whereas bournonite shows Sb contents between 23.37 and 25.23 wt%. Base metal sulfides contain low amounts of Sb: up to 0.44 wt% within pyrite, up to 0.21 wt% within sphalerite and up to 0.28 wt% within galena. Arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite Sb contents are even lower.The enrichment plant works in three consecutive stages, producing galena, sphalerite and pyrite concentrates. Each stage comprises conditioning, roughing, scavenging and cleaning flotation cells.Grain size analyses show similar granulometric curves for the concentrates, with uniformity coefficients lower than 3. D90, D50 and D10 are respectively 400, 110 and 45 &amp;#181;m for galena, 127, 60 and 42 &amp;#181;m for sphalerite and 240, 105 and 49 &amp;#181;m for pyrite concentrates.Whole rock major (XRF) and trace element (ICP-MS) analyses show that most of the antimony, and therefore of boulangerite and bournonite, reports to the galena concentrate. Starting from 1169 ppb in the initial feed Sb is highly enriched in the galena concentrate (20633 ppm), not enriched in the sphalerite concentrate (1170 ppm) and relatively depleted in the pyrite concentrate (334 ppm), making the galena concentrate a suitable candidate for Sb recovery.The presence of Sb mostly in its own phases opens up the potentiality to recover the metal as a by-product of galena production. The crystal size of boulangerite is large enough to allow separation through flotation. Further tests are necessary in order to evaluate the amount of Sb phases in tiny inclusions within base metal sulfides and Sb enrichment in base metal phases, that can negatively affect the metal recovery.</jats:p>"

To this end, it is important to assess the impacts of water scarcity, related to periods of hydrological drought, on the use of the available sources. This is of particular interest in touristic regions, where resource management must necessarily take into account also the significant seasonal fluctuation of urban demand.As part of the European project SIMTWIST (Simulating Tourism Water Consumption with Stakeholders), the study analyses the factors influencing both the demand for drinking-water supply of the city of Rimini and the apportionment of the supply among the different sources available to the water manager (RomagnaAcque-Societ&amp;#224; delle Fonti SpA). In fact, the city is supplied with both surface water, from the Ridracoli reservoir in the Apennines, and groundwater from well fields on the alluvial fans of the Marecchia and Conca rivers.The drivers include socio-economic variables (tourist attendance), climatic variables and hydrological availability. In particular, it is analysed how the exploitation of the groundwater source varies as a function of water availability at the Ridracoli reservoir, characterizing such availability through meteorological and hydrological drought indices computed on the upstream catchments.The analysis, in addition to confirming how the management of the resource cannot, in Mediterranean regions, disregard tourism factors, helps to understand the link between hydrological droughts, governing the availability of river-fed reservoir supply, and the choices made by water managers in the exploitation of the groundwater sources.</jats:p>"

Can supply-chain finance affect corporate investment efficiency? There is still insufficient research in existing studies. In this paper, multiple regression analysis is used on 9757 listed companies in China for the period 2010–2020, to empirically test the impact of supply-chain finance on investment efficiency by integrating financial and supply-chain attributes of supply-chain finance, and we further analyze its mechanism. The results show that supply-chain finance can alleviate corporate under-investment and inhibit over-investment. The relationship is stronger for nonstate-owned corporations and is stronger when corporations operate in a superior information environment. Further, financial constraint plays an intermediary role between supply-chain finance and under-investment, while corporate social responsibility plays an intermediary role between supply-chain finance and over-investment. This study enriches the relevant research on the economic consequences of supply-chain finance, and provides new evidence for how supply-chain finance can promote the high-quality development of the real economy.</jats:p>"

However, the existing fault location methods do\nnot accurately locate the fault point, which in turn makes it difficult\nfor the protection device to act to cut off the fault. To address the\nabove problems, this paper builds a dynamic simulation model of the low\nand medium speed magnetic levitation power supply rails to study the\ndistribution characteristics of the fault traveling waves after a ground\nfault occurs in the power supply rails, and analyses the generation\nmechanism of the traveling wave spectrum through formula calculation.\nThe first step is to determine whether an earth fault has occurred by\nanalysing the difference in current between the positive and negative\nbusbars. Secondly, the direction of the current difference between\nstations is compared to locate the faulty section. Finally, the fault\ndistance is calculated from the frequency difference of the fault\nvoltage at the double-ended station. Through simulation, the method is\nvalidated to be unaffected by fault location, fault transition\nresistance, noise interference, and is applicable to short circuit\nfaults caused by lightning strikes, and the ranging error always remains\nwithin 20m. The method has strong robustness, can effectively solve the\nproblem of protection misoperation and accurately locate the fault\npoint.

The proposed H–H configuration of modular EV powertrain system includes four voltage source inverters that combine the power modules with the open ends of the windings (OEW) of the module machine armature, and provide control of their operation. Based on the developed mode system of the OEW machine module operation for EV traction and braking, a general control algorithm for the proposed configuration of the modular EV powertrain system has been developed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, drought affects different types of regions and countries, making it one of the most devastating natural disasters in terms of impacts on agriculture and food security, ecosystems, human health, and water resources. As the importance of integrated drought management including disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation strategies, and national water policies is emphasized internationally, it is important to develop an effective water management technology for proactive drought response rather than reactive drought management to cope with drought disaster. In this study, we propose an approach to dynamic drought vulnerability assessment that can be used to secure elasticity for water demand and supply during drought event and further respond to a preemptive drought. Drought response and management based on this dynamic drought vulnerability assessment technology has consistency in that it promotes an internationally pursued convergence strategy for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The dynamic drought vulnerability assessment is based on the water demand-supply linkage assessment in various types of droughts. In other words, this is a technology for improving the ability to respond to drought through flexible water supply in the actual drought events. Dynamic drought vulnerability assessment produces various types of drought vulnerability map considering various scenarios of drought occurrence and socio-economic pathways according to climate change. For example, when combining hydrological drought scenarios considering climate change (25 types), water demand scenarios according to social/economic/environmental changes (3 types), water supply scenarios of drought damage/sensitivity by region (4 types), storage ratio scenarios of dam and reservoir (12 types), at least 2100 scenarios are produced as database. In the future, these results can be used as a basis for scientific decision-making in preparing countermeasures to improve resilience to drought.Acknowledgement: This work was supported by the Korea Environment Industry &amp; Technology Institute (KEITI) through Water Management Innovation Program for Drought (No. 2022003610001) funded by Korea Ministry of Environment.</jats:p>"

The epidemic environment also puts forward higher requirements for the stability and resilience of the supply chain, so it is also an urgent need to rely on digital and intelligent technology to build and improve the operation system of the shipping supply chain. Based on the analysis of the current situation, this study will consider how the blockchain technology can be better applied to the supply chain operation system with container shipping as the core, and find the defects and possible challenges in practical application. That is to study the strategies and challenges of shipping supply chain operation system under blockchain technology. The study found that by improving the integration of blockchain technology and the shipping industry, it is entirely possible to fully integrate logistics, capital flow and information flow of the shipping supply chain with blockchain and create an intelligent and reliable ecological network of shipping supply chains. At this time, a more complete shipping supply chain operation system under the blockchain technology will also be constructed. However, there are not enough complete typical cases to support the integrated design of this study. Therefore, the supply chain system may have defects and some challenges. It is not difficult to future research directions from these challenges, and future research prospects will also be pointed out.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to rationalize positive reactions of both output and consumption induced by higher government spending. To explain those patterns, I use a theoretical model including two ingredients: search frictions in the product market and simple supply chains. It is shown that, in isolation, these two elements give rise to the standard prediction found in the theoretical literature: an increase in fiscal expenditures crowds out private consumption. However, the interaction of both elements generates two equilibria and one of them features both a positive fiscal multiplier and an increasing relationship between government spending and private consumption.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Declining oxygen levels in the ocean since the middle of the 20th century have been linked to increasing temperatures, CO2 concentrations, and nutrient inputs. In the geological past, numerous oceanic anoxic events have occurred under similar conditions. These events, during which dissolved oxygen in the ocean drop to potentially harmful levels, can have serious consequences for marine life and can also alter the geochemistry of the ocean.Specifically, we focus here on the Devonian (419 and 359 Ma), a warmer-than-present geological period. The sixty million years Devonian stage was the theatre of at least 29 identified anoxic events (Becker et al., 2020), marked most of the time by the deposition of black shales, associated with carbon isotopic excursion. It is understood that concurrent trends in CO2 and silicate weathering during the Devonian period have generated a context prone to ocean anoxia. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that their periodic recurrences in sedimentary records may have been influenced by astronomical forcing, such as changes in Earth's axis rotation and orbit geometry (De Vleeschouwer et al., 2017; Da Silva et al. 2020)In the umbrella project WarmAnoxia, we combine climate models and geological observations to explore and test proposals linking astronomical forcing to Devonian anoxia. Through this presentation, we focus specifically on the hypothesis that astronomical forcing influenced precipitation and temperature patterns in a way that significantly modified soil weathering dynamics, with enough effects on nutrient fluxes toward the ocean to promote oceanic anoxia.To test this proposal, we performed 81 experiments with the global atmosphere-slab model HadSM3. Experiments have been designed to span the range of astronomical forcing and CO2 concentrations experienced during the Devonian. The output was used to calibrate an emulator. With the latter, we estimate the transient evolutions of temperature and precipitation over 5 million-year periods, for which we assumed both simplified and realistic astronomical forcing scenarios. In turn, these transient evolutions force the GEOCLIM model (Maffre et al. 2022), which simulates soil dynamics, estimates nutrient fluxes from the continents to the oceans, and the response on the oceanic chemistry and atmospheric oxygen levels.References:Da Silva A. et al., (2020), Scientific Reports, 10 (12940) doi:10.1038/s41598-020-69097-6; Maffre P. et al., (2022) American Journal of Science, (322) 461&amp;#8211;492, doi:10.2475/03.2022.02; Becker R.T. et al.

Drawing on interviews with RMI staff, corporate representatives, and independent members of the RMI’s governance committees, we analyze the RMI’s risk assessment tools that facilitate corporate compliance with global mineral supply chain regulations. We demonstrate that these technocratic tools mask the underlying corporate interests that control how human rights due diligence is being interpreted and implemented on the ground. We then argue that global supply chains are being “governed at a distance” through these technical practices whereby companies divest themselves of responsibility to their suppliers. Supply chain governance at a distance is therefore transforming the norm of human rights due diligence from an instrument of corporate accountability to a tool of corporate legitimacy.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the domestic market for palm oil and palm kernel oil remains substantial, despite improvements in export quantities. Various industries, including cooking oil refineries, specialty fats, shortening, margarine, bath soaps, and oleochemicals, present potential markets for palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). The palm oil industry encompasses four related sub-sectors, namely growers, millers, refiners, and oleochemicals, forming an integrated value chain from upstream to downstream. The current focus on environmental, economic, and social sustainability is driving companies to adopt internal green activities and expand their efforts into sustainability supply chain management (SSCM). Implementing SSCM practices is often seen as economically beneficial, as research has demonstrated their positive impact on firm performance from a resource perspective. Within the palm oil industry, a wide range of green management applications are being utilized. This study aims to examine and highlight the existing sustainable management practices across the entire palm oil supply chain, with a particular emphasis on producing high-quality palm oil. To achieve this objective, the paper utilizes a systematic review methodology, The number of papers analyzed were 62 articles published which involves an extensive review of relevant literature to identify research trends, gaps, and issues. The study seeks to contribute to the body of knowledge by expanding the theory of organizational readiness in preparing globally competitive palm oil products.

Incumbent collector 1 provides the manufacturer with used product 1 for remanufacturing product 1. For product 2, the manufacturer has two different collection strategies: in-house collection by the manufacturer or external collection by collector 2. The collectors act as the channel leader, and the manufacturer, who has private demand information, is the follower. Results show that collectors are incentivized to participate in the blockchain. If there is no blockchain, collector 1 prefers external collection. In the case of blockchain, the manufacturer prefers external collection when the demand variance is low. The manufacturer’s decision on the in-house collection and external collection depends on the coefficient of collection investment costs.</jats:p>"

This requires the ability to calculate customers’ demand in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry as various effects exist between multiple products within a product category. The substitution effect is one of the challenging effects at retail stores, as it requires investigating an exponential number of combinations of price changes and the availability of other products. This paper suggests a systematic price decision support tool for demand prediction and price optimise in online and stationary retailers considering the substitution effect. Two procedures reflecting the product price changes and the demand correlation structure are introduced for demand prediction and price optimisation models. First, the developed demand prediction procedure is carried out considering the combination of price changes of all products reflecting the effect of substitution. Time series and different well-known machine learning approaches with hyperparameter tuning and rolling forecasting methods are utilised to select each product’s best demand forecast. Demand forecast results are used as input in the price optimisation model. Second, the developed price optimisation procedure is a constraint programming problem based on a week time frame and a product category level aggregation and is capable of maximising profit out of the many price combinations. The results using real-world transaction data with 12 products and 4 discount rates demonstrate that including some business rules as constraints in the proposed price optimisation model reduces the number of price combinations from 11,274,924 to 19,440 and execution time from 129.59 to 25.831 min. The utilisation of the presented price optimisation support tool enables the supply chain managers to identify the optimal discount rate for individual products in a timely manner, resulting in a net profit increase.</jats:p>"

To utilize this, city administrators need to identify the type and quantity of wastewater generated and its various functional uses. In countries like India, where detailed data about wastewater is not available, any potential reuse proposal is difficult to design and execute. To cover this gap, this research proposes a technique using dasymetric mapping and Voronoi diagrams to estimate the quantity and spatial distribution of wastewater generated in a city, based on population data and water supply information, by mapping and identifying the variation in the supply. The developed research framework is tested in Bhopal city in India. The results suggest that there is higher water consumption in areas of high population density, whereas wastewater generation displays a greater variation based on land use. Among 217 Voronoi polygons created throughout the city, eight have wastewater generation at more than 10 litres/sq. m of area. The total wastewater generated while considering only municipal water supply was 148.32 MLD. On intersecting the Voronoi polygons with ward boundaries, it is found that six wards generate wastewater more than 50 litres/sq. m, whereas seven wards generate less than 1 litre/sq. m of area.</jats:p>",

The performance measurement of plasma farms was carried out by the core company with a number called performance index (IP), where this IP reflects the value of the plasma farmers that will be used by the core company to determine the next cooperative relationship. The IP calculation is done at the end of a maintenance cycle by the field extension officer (FEO) based on the results of daily reports. In determining the IP calculation, the factors seen are The Feed Consumption Rate (FCR), Mortality, and the use of drugs, vitamins, and chemicals. For Plasma farmers, the obtained IP was only a report from the results of work in one maintenance cycle, while management in the core supply chain process was not known, how the farm's performance was. Prior research succeeded in designing an instrument for Assess Supply Chain Performance for Broiler Plasma Farms using five core processes SCOR and Analytical Hierarchy (AHP) for weighting. This research will measure the supply chain performance of several Plasma farms with the designed instrument. From the results of this performance measurement, plasma farmers will get an idea of which core processes need to be improved so that the performance in the next cycle will be better. In addition, this research will also look for the correlation between the performance obtained and the IP that has been assessed by the core company.</jats:p>"

However, as the number of tiers of suppliers and customers increases, monitoring processes and identifying problems becomes more challenging, which can threaten the continuity of the SC. To address this issue, the EU knowlEdge project proposes using artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that are distributed, scalable, and collaborative to enable automatic monitoring and learning in the SC. This approach replaces rigid organization with flexible networks that leverage self-learning algorithms and automatic value creation, thereby facilitating knowledge sharing. The project unifies technologies from various domains, including AI, data analytics, edge, and cloud computing, into a software architecture that offers a systemic solution rather than an incremental improvement. This architecture enhances SC performance, including adaptability and autonomy, and enables industry to adopt adaptive strategies. The platform’s functionality is tested in manufacturing, where it will improve production monitoring and planning and enable human intervention and learning. The AI application is expected to increase performance on various business and production indicators, which will also have an impact beyond the factory floor. With this approach, managers can respond quickly to changing customer requirements, while deviations in planned processes can be addressed more effectively. Additionally, the research conducted by the project will provide insights into future management and learning in SC.</jats:p>"

A small-scale dairy can assist a family in maintaining their livelihoods in Bangladesh. However, it is also associated with various environmental and social impacts, making it crucial for achieving sustainability. The triple bottom line of sustainability intends to achieve sustainability through improving productivity, implementing sustainable practices, and incorporating waste management. The dairy industry can continue to provide nutritious diets, ensuring sustainability practices. This research is a follow-up paper of Nasir et al. to find better sustainable results. It considers the triple bottom line of sustainability theory to improve the farm environment by reducing waste, managing resources efficiently, and promoting environmentally friendly practices. This paper is a case study on a dairy farm of 400 cattle in Bangladesh. The system dynamics method and simulation modeling were employed to draw dairy supply chain networks and examine the existing dataset to find better utilization of the dairy waste produced on the farm. Consequently, the simulation model incorporates waste management and value addition concepts to find better resource exploitation for gaining sustainable outcomes. Finally, this paper summarizes the simulation outcomes and articulates possible extensions for achieving further economic, social, and environmental benefits for the industry and surrounding community.</jats:p>"

It then explores the global supply and demand dynamics, highlighting the structural change expected in the market and the competition between Europe and Asia for limited new LNG supply. The article also focuses on Europe&amp;#039;s increased flexibility and dependence on LNG imports, which have risen by 60% to 121 million tonnes, offsetting lower Russian pipeline imports. Furthermore, the article delves into global supply and demand dynamics, how the market is expected to remain tight, and how record gas and LNG prices have led to demand reductions. Additionally, it analyzes the future outlook and investment needs, highlighting the continued uptake of gas in heavy-duty transport and the need for further investment to avoid a supply-demand gap.

In this paper, we aim to understand (1) the extent of actual groundwater depletion and its impact on rural drinking water supply systems, (2) the primary driver of groundwater depletion and (3) the additional financial burden in finding new sources for water supply and increased O&amp;M costs.We rely on temporal data from two Gram Panchayats (local administrative unit) near Bengaluru, in south India. Our study results confirm that groundwater depletion, in this hard rock aquifer region, is a severe problem, driven largely by agricultural water abstraction. Rural drinking water supply systems have had to catch up continuously with the falling water table, abandoning non-functional wells and drilling new borewells to replace them. This has resulted in a major financial burden to the Gram Panchayats both in terms of increased capital and O&amp;M costs. Increased pumping costs associated with declining groundwater levels impose a major burden on these Gram Panchayats, which are severely in “electricity debt”. Hitherto, state and central government grants have paid for rural well installation in India, but these schemes are time bound, posing a threat to future drinking water security.</jats:p>"

The problem studied is the potential risk that can cause contamination of halal slaughtered chicken products from suppliers to end customers. Therefore, this study aims to identify the risk of contamination in the halal supply chain of slaughtered chicken products and obtain recommendations for corrective actions so that slaughtered chicken products are maintained halal.

This study, therefore, explores factors, impacts and challenges of blockchain adoption in the FSC. The study adopts an exploratory qualitative interview approach. The data consist of Twenty-one interviews which were analyzed using thematic analysis techniques in NVivo (v12), resulting in identifying nine factors classified under three broad categories (Technology—complexity, compatibility, cost; Organization—organization size, knowledge; Environment—government support, competitive pressure, standardization, and compliance) as the most significant factors driving blockchain adoption in the FSC. In addition, five impacts were identified (visibility, performance, efficiency, trust, and value creation) to blockchain technology adoption. This study also identifies significant challenges of blockchain technology (interoperability, privacy, infrastructure conditions, and lack of knowledge). Based on the findings, the study developed a conceptual framework for blockchain adoption in food supply chains. The study adds to the corpus of knowledge by illuminating the adoption of blockchain technology and its effects on food supply chains and by giving the industry evidence-based guidance for developing its blockchain plans. The study provides full insights and awareness of blockchain adoption challenges among executives, supply chain organizations, and governmental agencies.</jats:p>"

While they are detectable given enough time, due to the huge cost of water loss resulting from an undetected leak, the main challenge is to find them as soon as possible, when the deviation from the zone pattern is small. Using our collected observational data, we investigate the appearance of leaks and discuss the performance of several machine learning (ML) anomaly detectors in detecting them. We test a diverse set of six anomaly detectors, each based on a different ML algorithm, on nine scenarios containing leaks and anomalies of various kinds. The proposed approach is very effective at quickly (within hours) identifying the presence of a leak, with a limited number of false positives.</jats:p>",

Five General Circulation Models (GCM) are used to evaluate future water resources availability under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios). The projected crop water demand and irrigation water demand were analysed using Aquacrop software, taking into account the impact of climate change on both reference evapotranspiration and crop cycle lengths. The future water balance is simulated by means of Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) Tool, including several socioeconomic and land use scenarios under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The results reveal an important decrease in net precipitation with an average of -36.2% and -50.5% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In terms of water balance, the &amp;#8220;business as usual&amp;#8221; scenario would lead to an increasing of unmet water demand of about +22% in the 2050 horizon and to an increased depletion of the water table that could reach 2m/year.

The streamflow stations were grouped into two categories: naturalized streamflow (four stations) and regulated streamflow (six stations). In both the dry and wet seasons, decreasing trends were observed in the naturalized inflows to the Srinagarind and Vajiralongkorn Dams. On an annual basis, all the naturalized streamflow stations showed decreasing trends. For the regulated streamflow stations, in the dry season, four out of six stations showed increasing trends, while in the wet season, five out of six stations indicated decreasing trends. On an annual basis, five stations showed decreasing trends by both the MK and SR tests, while the ITA method indicated decreasing trends for four regulated streamflow stations.

This review summarizes the historical evolution of the concept of e-flows and recaps its assessment methods; analyzes the impacts of river flow alterations; indicates the challenges e-flows have been facing and identifies the gaps in the focus of e-flows research. A total of 303 articles published since 2010 were collected and systematically assessed. Most of the publications are focused on describing the effects and management of river flow alterations. According to the findings of this meta-analysis, less attention is given to basin-scale, social and policy aspects of e-flows. Furthermore, little consideration is given to the part played by groundwater in e-flows along with the roles of e-flows in maintaining the health of floodplains and e-flows of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams.</jats:p>",

The decrease in the efficiency of the heat supply industry, caused by a high degree of deterioration of the main production assets, creates the necessity to modernize the sphere, which requires the involvement of a significant amount of investment resources. One of the effective tools contributing to this process is public-private partnership (PPP), which includes positive aspects both for state and municipal authorities as well as for business representatives.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. Theoretical and methodological basis of the study was provided by the works of domestic researchers on the implementation of capital investments in the development of heat supply. Methods of theoretical research were used to analyze the practice of implementation of projects to modernize the heat supply using PPP, modeling stages of the concession agreements, as well as methods of empirical research in terms of comparing the forms of interaction between government and business in the joint implementation of projects for the development and modernization of the heat supply.&#x0D;\nResults. The study of professional opinions of Russian researchers on the issue of insufficient effectiveness ofthe implementation of the public-private partnership instrument in the field of housing and communal services and energy, including heat supply, has enabled the formation of a list of problem areas in order to identify areas for their solutions.&#x0D;\nConclusions. The presented successfully implemented cases of modernization of heat supply systems in the Russian regions, which have been implemented through concession agreements between the authorities and business representatives, allowed to confirm the thesis that the concession is one of the best forms of PPP implementation in the field of heat supply. According to the prospective estimates of the National PPP Centre, about 130 PPP projects in the housing and utilities sector may be launched already by 2024, and the value of investments may exceed RUR 230 billion.</jats:p>",

The electron density 〖(n〗_e), the electron temperature 〖(T〗_e) and the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) are measured by the single Langmuir probe in this experiment. Experimental results show that the ne increases with gas pressure rising, while the ne decreases with the oxygen concentrations rising. And, a plasma density peak is also observed with the AC power supply increase. A comparison between this work and the previous results by RF source suggests that the low-frequency AC power supply may be very fruitful exploration to generate the low-pressure plasma.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Appreciation for the influence of plant metabolism on the hydrogen isotope composition (&amp;#948;2H) of plant compounds has increased in recent years, adding new opportunities to understand how plants respond to environmental change. In general, where carbon supply is limited (e.g. at the beginning of the growth season, in darkness, under low CO2), the resulting &amp;#948;2H of newly produced plant compounds tends to be 2H-enriched. The source of the 2H-enrichment has yet to be identified but hypotheses include: 1) a direct effect of reduced photosynthesis; 2) change in the partitioning of photoassimilates to sucrose/transitory starch; 3) use of longer-term starch reserves; and/or, 4) increased isotopic exchange with water suggesting increased metabolite cycling. To test these ideas, we utilised samples collected from a study which grew tree saplings under 100% and 6% of ambient sunlight in the field (Weber et al. 2018, New Phytologist, 222: 171-182). &amp;#160;In general, relative growth rate was attenuated by a species-specific amount that ensured homeostasis of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations; however, not before an initial two-fold reduction in NSC levels &amp;#8211; the time period the current study focussed on. Cellulose was purified and n-alkanes extracted from leaves of six deciduous species (Betula pendula, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Prunus avium, Quercus petraea and Tilia platyphyllos) in July 2016, around one year after the shade treatment began. The isotopic difference of cellulose between shaded and full sunlit grown leaves (&amp;#949;shade-sun) was significantly different from zero, with species-specific offsets ranging between 20 to 70&amp;#8240;. In comparison, the treatment effect was minimal for the C-chain length concentration weighted &amp;#948;2H values of n-alkanes, ranging between -7 to +10&amp;#8240;. To narrow down the source of 2H-enrichment in leaf cellulose, the &amp;#948;2H of sucrose and starch are currently being analysed in samples collected from stem wood (without bark) before bud-break in March 2016, and in leaf and stem material sampled after leaf-out in July 2016. An increase in sucrose &amp;#948;2H values from shade leaves relative to controls would support Hypothesis 1 and 2; 2H-enriched storage starch relative to leaf sucrose would support Hypothesis 3; and an increase in the &amp;#948;2H of sucrose in stem wood relative to storage starch (before bud-break), would support Hypothesis 4. Our study has important implications for interpreting 2H-enrichment of plant compounds with respect to reduced C supply.</jats:p>"

Among them, ASDEX (axially symmetric divertor experiment) upgrade has been operating at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) research center since 1991. To ignite and confine the plasma, several coils must be supplied through controllable high-current pulsed power supplies. The toroidal field magnets are here considered and a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-like system was designed and tested thanks to a small-scale prototype in previous works. The MMC-like topology, consisting of full-bridge submodules (SMs) with IGBTs and supercapacitor and exploitable also for other industrial applications, was chosen because of its modularity, redundancy, fault tolerance, and large amount of stored energy. The prototype, made of four SMs, was necessary to highlight critical key points in the design process. However, its scalability must be further tested before building a full-scale power supply, meant to reach almost 2400 SMs to guarantee the energy required by the load. This paper aims at validating hardware-in-the-loop (a powerful, safe, and relatively inexpensive real-time simulation environment that enables testing with real control boards) as a useful technology for power supply scalability studies and not only for control strategy tests. The results obtained previously from the prototype will allow us to finally increase the number of SMs and test the MMC-like scalability.</jats:p>"

This new form of food chain is emerging as a response to the crisis in conventional agribusiness. This article presents a systematic review of the academic literature on the alternative food network and short supply chain in order to understand the main elements and topics explored in the empirical studies conducted from 2014 to 2021. This review only considers research using a single or multiple case study approaches. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were used for the literature search. The identification and eligibility processes were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) method. Six core topics were identified: motivation of actors; collaborative governance; social relations and trust; sustainability; boundary negotiation; and resilience. Most of the studies were developed in European countries. The results show that motivation to join the AFN and sustainability are the more explored topics, followed by the study of the different models of governance that characterize the AFN. In addition, the connection between different actors emerges, in a transversal manner, as an important pillar of AFNs. AFN features may change depending on social-economical, cultural, and geographical factors. There is therefore a need to explore other forms of AFNs; future research should conduct cross-analysis on AFNs in different countries and socio-economic contexts.</jats:p>"

However, there is a clear absence of actionable guidelines for companies to follow, in order to assess and address risks of modern slavery within their value chain. Ambiguous legislative requirements have resulted in poor monitoring that, ultimately, does not effectively help eradicate modern slavery from Australian supply chains. In order to address this gap and provide a practical tool for organisations to combat modern slavery, this article employs a case study to demonstrate how to conduct effective on-site audits to mitigate modern slavery risks through the supply chain.

Results show that: (1) Retailers' ordering strategies are influenced by a variety of factors, such as the risk of supply disruption, the selling price of goods, the retailer's out-of-stock costs, option contract prices, and execution prices. That is, retailers are more inclined to adopt a dual-source sourcing strategy when option prices and strike prices decrease or when selling prices and out-of-stock costs increase. (2) Retailers would choose to single source from risk suppliers rather than option suppliers in order to maximize profits. (3) When the risk of supply interruption increases, the expected profit of retailers would decrease. Although the use of option contracts can withstand certain interruption risks, adding option suppliers is not always better than purchasing from risk suppliers alone.</jats:p>"

In the wake of the pandemic, this sector must be prepared to make bold, innovative moves to prepare for the future. Over the past few years, the use of drones and robotics has expanded with many commercial uses, including in the construction industry. Drone-driven automation has an enormous impact in improving productivity and reducing cost and schedule overruns. The use of drones, along with the application of Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics, can make a significant impact on the supply chain and improve inventory accuracy, leading to faster and more cost-effective building projects. This paper will propose and statistically substantiate an optimization model for supply chain management through the accelerated use of drones and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the post-pandemic era. The use of smart devices and IoT will allow warehouse managers to have real-time visibility of the location and inventory tracking, as well as enabling warehouse workers to access information without being physically present. Cutting-edge drone technology can quickly perform inspections to make inventory control more economical and efficient. While they are certainly not a perfect fit for every building surveillance task, drones have many advantages for probing buildings in search of leaks, performing aerial surveys, and dealing with security issues more cost-effectively than manual procedures, thereby leading to improved communication and collaboration between different stakeholders. This paper includes a real-life case study and dynamic mathematical model to demonstrate how this approach results in a project’s materials becoming visible, traceable, and easily tracked from end to end.</jats:p>"

Food market chains are, with a few exceptions, driven by retailers who determine sales strategies, price structure, production standards etc. Price is one of the key factors determining customer decisions. Pressure for lower prices can contribute, together with decreasing labor force in agriculture and many other factors, to increased pressure on farm intensification which have negative feedback to environment, society but also to stability of food market supply chain as explained above. &amp;#160;However, an increasing number of food retailers and food and beverage companies view environmental impacts of intensification, including soil degradation, as a risk to stability of their supply chains. They seek options to ensure more sustainable food production. Businesses employ standards and other interventions to steer their suppliers towards preferred practices either as part of their direct contact with suppliers or by using various certification and monitoring schemes operated by third party.

The reliance of humans on minerals has led to wide-scale mining and depletion of resources. In this study, we analyse how consumer demand in the European Union drives environmental and social impacts in mining sectors worldwide. We employ multi-regional input-output analysis to quantify positive (i.e., income, female and male employment) and negative (greenhouse gas emissions, accidents at work, and modern slavery) impacts of mining in raw material sectors, as indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We trace these environmen&amp;#173;tal and social impacts across the EU&amp;#8217;s trading partners to identify sectors and regions as hotspots of international spillovers embodied in the EU&amp;#8217;s consumer demand and find that these hotspots are wide-ranging in all continents. We estimate that across all sectors, EU&amp;#8217;s consumption is associated with about 4200 cases of fatal accidents at work and 1.2 million cases of modern slavery annually. Raw material supply chains are respectively responsible for 5% and 3% of these totals, but also 14% of imported GHG emissions. These impacts take place primarily in Central Asia and the Asia Pacific as well as Africa. Our results underline the need for further reforms in mining industries and trade policies to eradicate modern slavery and other adverse social and environmental impacts and to implement safe workplaces for workers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Local climate change risk assessments and climate resilient adaptation are best supported by a quantitative integration of physical hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities that includes the characterization of uncertainties. However, it is challenging to take into account the complex information of climate change projections and uncertainties in participatory risk assessments with decision-makers. We propose to use Bayesian Networks (BNs) for this task. Bayesian Networks are a cutting-edge integrated modelling approach for combining qualitative and quantitative knowledge in uncertain and complex domains, such as climate change impacts on water. To quantify potential future hazards of climate change on water, it is state-of-the-art to rely on multi-model ensembles to integrate the uncertainties of both climate and impact modelling. At the same time, local expert knowledge needs to be integrated in local climate change risk assessments. We show how to integrate freely-available output of multiple global hydrological models into BNs, in order to probabilistically assess risks for water supply. To this end, a roadmap to set up BNs and apply probability distributions of risk levels under historic and future climate and water use in a participatory manner was co-developed with water experts from Spain and the Maghreb. Multi-model information on hydrological variables was computed by three global hydrological models driven by the output of four global climate models for four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The output of projected relative changes of hydrological hazards was pre-processed using MATLAB, taking into account local information on water availability and use, to set up the BN. Results show that the method is useful for probabilistically computing climate change impacts on water stress and to assess potential adaptation measures in a participative process with stakeholders and decision-makers. Local water experts positively evaluated the BN application for local climate change risk assessments. While requiring certain training, the presented approach is suitable for application in the many local risk assessments necessary to deliver efficient and successful climate resilient adaptation.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, the coupling and uncertainty of various heterogeneous energy resources will significantly change the characteristics and dynamic balance mechanism of the power system. Power generated from renewable energy sources such as wind and light is uncertain and uncontrollable, and such renewable energy enjoys complementary characteristics across time and space. In this paper, we investigate the uncertainty of renewable energy and its complementary space-time characteristics among various power sources and propose to take advantage of the synergistic effects of different forms of energy to realize optimal allocation of resources in a multi-energy power system on a larger scale. Taking the newly built energy base in northwest China as an example, the power distribution of multi-energy power system is optimized through production simulation. Through simulation, it is verified that the method proposed in this paper can improve the efficiency of renewable energy power generation to a certain extent, and has a certain significance for promoting the transformation of energy production and consumption.</jats:p>",

In a command-and-control administration, a collaborative approach to managing RWS is atypical. The study addresses this gap by analyzing the relational behavior as a monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure community compliance with government-produced institutions for managing RWS. Four focus group interviews were conducted with the CBO members and the survey of households from the same villages. Using the partial-least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM), the mediating influence of frequent communication, commitment of users, and shared meaning on community compliance with institutions was analyzed. The integrated results from the two methods imply that trained CBOs better self-organize, as they communicate frequently with the community members. It is recommended that for the sustainability of the RWS system, regular government support for CBOs underscores the success of collaborative collective action, though trained CBOs better manage RWS in weak monitoring by the government.</jats:p>",

Too many trading links and complicated trading channels make the trading information asymmetric, opaque and disorderly, which will inevitably lead to the loss of efficiency and benefit in the circulation process. In this paper, the application of blockchain technology in the design of analgesic drug supply chain is studied. The analgesic drug data management center is maintained by the pharmaceutical enterprises themselves or the third party, which is mainly responsible for distributing the unique identification code of drugs, backing up all records of the whole cycle of drug production, storage, circulation and sales, and realizing the two-way traceability function of drugs. In the production process, pharmaceutical enterprises attach electronic labels from single products and outer packaging boxes to realize the traceability and anti-counterfeiting of drugs throughout their life cycle. Correspondingly, it also integrates the advantages and disadvantages of self-management and outsourcing. At this stage, enterprises can choose to subcontract non-core logistics business first, so that enterprises can focus on their core business and avoid wasting too much money and energy in logistics.</jats:p>"

Venerina and Vena-Presa) for a whole of 140 measurement sites. It is widely demonstrated that anomalous emissions of CO2 in these areas are linked to magma supply dynamics. Herein we report the data of soil CO2 flux periodically recorded in these areas from 2015 to 2022. We processed and analyzed the data to reconstruct the magma supply dynamics over the considered period and showed as variations are related to the most significant eruptive phases which occurred through the investigated period.One of the hallmarks eruptive episode occurred on 24th December 2018, from an eruptive fissure which opened on the New Southeast Crater (NCSE) flank. During this event both ash-rich plumes from the summit craters and intense strombolian activity along the fissure were observed. This episode was associated with intense seismic swarms. Mild strombolian activity, ash emission at summit craters, and constant inflation of the volcano edifice during autumn 2018 preceded the eruptive episode. The soil CO2 flux measured in the more distal peripheral areas reveal that, at least three episodes of magmatic supply into the deep system (7-13 km b.s.l.) occur in the Etna feeding system, since 2016. After November 2018, a remarkable increase in the soil CO2 emissions was recorded at Vena-Presa area, along the Pernicana fault, suggesting magma transfer into the shallower portions of the feeding system. The volcanic origin of this degassing event was confirmed also by isotopic signature of carbon of CO2.Another notably eruptive phase occurred on 2021 at the NSEC, with a sequence of seventeen lava fountains from 16 February to 1 April 2021. Some of these events were the most intense among those which occurred at Mt. Etna in the last ten years. A few months earlier (July-December 2020) we detected a huge increase of CO2 emissions in the Patern&amp;#242; area, with the highest value ever recorded over the last 15 years.&amp;#160;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nutrient density in manure and fermentation residues is too low to economically justify transporting them to regions with phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) demands. However, they present a valuable feedstock for the production of commercial P fertilizers via pyrolysis. Phosphorus availability in the resulting chars for plant uptake can be further improved by adding potassium (K) salts to the feedstock prior to pyrolysis, while vinasse can be added for N enrichment. Such recycling-derived N-P(-K doped) fertilizers are expected to release nutrients slowly to the plants and to have positive environmental effects like nitrate retention, reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and carbon (C) sequestration. We conducted a greenhouse pot experiment with celery and spinach cultures to investigate the P fertilization performance and environmental effects of newly developed recycling-derived N-P(-K) char fertilizers. Four novel pyrolysis products were tested: three different N-enriched (vinasse) dry flowable products (pyrolyzed material: dried pelletized chicken manure, digestate, and the dried solid fraction of pig slurry, respectively), and a char from dried pig manure, which had been enriched with potassium acetate prior to pyrolysis. The pot experiment demonstrated that P-char fertilizers, combined with a liquid organic N fertilizer commonly used in organic farming (vinasse), can provide the same P-fertilization as triple super phosphate (TSP), with yields similar to or higher than those obtained with mineral N fertilizers. Furthermore, the char fertilizers, and in particular the K-doped char, reduced nitrate leaching significantly compared to treatments with TSP + calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) or TSP + vinasse. Liquid vinasse application drastically enhanced N2O emissions compared to pots where less or no liquid vinasse was applied without char. P-char fertilizers may thus provide a promising building block for a circular economy-based P supply chain while simultaneously reducing environmental costs in the form of less nitrate leaching and lower N2O emissions and contributing to soil C sequestration in the plough layer.The project was funded by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) on the basis of a resolution of the German Bundestag. The project was carried out by the Federal Agency for Agriculture and Food (BLE) within the framework of the Innovation Promotion Program.

The import of petroleum is increasing at an alarming rate (15.2% annually) which is creating not only a burden on the national economy but also raising the issue of energy supply security and environmental degradation. In this study, eleven distinct significant indicators have been used to evaluate the energy security status of the country. Since there is no such detailed quantification of indicators carried out in previous research, this study can be a significant input to policymakers and planners. It also explores the policy intervention measures to improve energy security status in the context of a developing country that is increasingly dependent on imported commercial fuels. Five different scenarios have been developed considering 2017 as a base year and 2040 as an end year with different economic growth rates 4.5%, 7.2% and 9.2% as main driving parameter. Two additional policy intervention scenarios (Policy-I and Policy-II), prioritizing electrification to enhance energy security, have been analyzed. The energy demands have been projected using the Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED), while the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) tool has been used to analyze the supply, the energy supply requirement, fuel import dependence, cost, as well as the size of power plant requirement under different scenarios. The results manifest that there would be a reduction in Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) requirement by 1.14% and 8.7% under policy-I and Policy-II scenarios respectively in the year 2040, compared to the reference scenario (7.2%) resulting in improved energy security, economic vulnerability, and GHG mitigation. It indicates that the use of indigenous renewable energy resources mainly hydro is indispensable for ensuring the energy security of Nepal.</jats:p>"

It used linear programming to minimize land area required for cropping while producing enough food to achieve dietary energy and protein requirements for the whole population. The potential agricultural impacts of three nuclear winter scenarios on NZ, were sourced from the literature. The optimized combinations of frost resistant crops that were found to feed the entire population were, in descending order: wheat and carrots; sugar beet; oats; onions and carrots; cabbage and barley; canola and cabbage; linseed and parsnip; rye and lupins; swede and field beans; and cauliflower. But in terms of current production levels of these frost resistant crops in NZ, there would be a 26% shortfall for the “war without a nuclear winter” scenario and a 71% shortfall for the severe nuclear winter scenario (150 Tg of soot in the stratosphere with a 61% decline in crop yields). In conclusion, at current production levels, frost resistant food crops could not feed all NZ citizens following a nuclear war. There is a need for the NZ Government to conduct a detailed pre-war analysis on how these shortfalls are best addressed. For example, by: increased pre-war production of these crops and/or post-war scalability; growing enough <jats:italic>frost sensitive</jats:italic> crops (i.e., in greenhouses or the warmest parts of the country); and/or ensuring continuing production of food derived from livestock fed on frost resistant grasses.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a new body of knowledge and contribution to the literature by relating the triple bottom line (TBL) context to the building of sustainable supply chain resilience using structural equation modelling. The research were used to understand that individual sustainability factors matter and play a role in the context of supply chain resilience. A survey questionnaire was designed to collect this data from the research respondents. To statistical analysis was first Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) conducted and used, then for the analysis and interpretation structural equation model. The findings indicate that individual sustainability factors matter and play a role in the context of supply chain resilience. A number of previous studies have developed broad catalogues of sustainability factors influencing supply chains, however, to date no convincing evidence has been presented as to which of the range of elements identified, and how they influence supply chain resilience building. Despite the large number of publications on sustainable supply chain and resilience building, there is still a gap and lack of proper consideration of TBL-related criteria as elements that can determine mechanisms for building supply chain resilience in the context of sustainable development. This paper operationalizes a using the structural research model to using a structural research model to investigate how and in which relationships the different elements of the triple bottom line influence the resilience of supply chains.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the model is considered in two modes, in which initially the members of the supply chain under a Stakelberg game are competing with each other for pricing on new products, product redemption and wholesale prices. In this (decentralized) scenario, members of the supply chain (retailer and manufacturer) are a percentage increase in their profit function. In this scenario, the producer, after determining the wholesale price as the leader of the game, maximizes the profit from the sale of its products, and then the retailer, as the leader in the game, determines the price of the products and the redemption price. In another (centralized) scenario, the main goal is to increase the profitability of the entire supply chain. This article also examines a contract related to the rate of purchase of returned products and the sale of new products, which encourages supply chain members to work together to increase their profits over a decentralized scenario. The stated materials lead to the design of models in a focused and decentralized scenario. The results of implementing the model on the sample problem show the high efficiency of this type of contract in increasing the profit of supply chain members compared to the decentralized scenario. </jats:p>"

Because at the port various logistics activities occur such as transportation activities, loading, and unloading of goods, inspection, storage, and so on. So the performance of the port plays an important role in the speed of delivery of logistics goods. Furthermore, for the transportation of logistics goods, trucking is one of the options that can be chosen to deliver goods from the port to the customer. The process of shipping logistics goods by trucking begins with the pick-up of goods at the port by a predetermined truck. After that, the truck will take the goods to the destination address specified by the customer.

Economic and social crises, pandemics, natural and technological threats and local armed conflicts add more layers of complexity and force governments to seek ways to ensure the continuous supply of these services. Therefore, researchers indicate that a supply chain management approach could increase the efficiency and quality of public service implementation processes. However, the scattered research that exists on this topic occurs in limited areas of public governance. Therefore, this paper aims to understand the importance of supply chain management in public service delivery processes, develop the public service supply chain model, analyse the evolution of the research and identify research streams in this exploratory area. A systematic literature review based on the PRISMA methodology serves to achieve this purpose. The paper defines public service supply chain management as a synchronised process of co-creating value in public networks with its basis in relationship management, in which each actor can be both a supplier and an end-user. This paper also presents a bibliographic visualisation of research issues in public service supply chain management (PSSCM) and identifies eight major research streams in this area.</jats:p>",

The influence of considering operating synchronous and asynchronous electric motors on transient processes and levels of residual voltages of sections was studied. It was found that to ensure the stability of the drives, to avoid shutdowns in case of various types of short circuits, it is desirable to use an automatic reserve input with a response time of less than 12 ms. A device for the instantaneous activation of a reserve is proposed, providing a response time of 9 ms and a total switching time to a reserve input within 17 ÷ 65 ms. The results of experiments and calculations according to the author’s developed programs are presented, confirming the possibility of the uninterrupted operation of technical electric systems consumers.

This place stands out for the predominance of the water element in several structures of the villa, highlighting the balneum and the large natatio, one of the largest known in Roman Hispania. The records of the initial excavations that took place since 1967 do not allow the establishment of clear functionalities of the villa. The University of &amp;#201;vora, owner of the site, conceived an action plan for the requalification and enhancement of the archaeological site. One of the tasks aims to investigate using Applied Geophysics. This work analyses the landscape directly related to the villa, given that it is in the flooded area of a river, with a Roman containment dam. It is uncertain whether the water supply comes from this structure or other nearby springs. The use of ground-penetrating radar, combined with unnamed aerial vehicles, all integrated in a geographic information system, allows us to know the location of underground water connections and create a topographic model with high resolution. Considering all the information, we propose a model for the water transport inside the villa and estimate the location of the water supply.Acknowledgment: The work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) project UIDB/04683/2020 - ICT (Institute of Earth Sciences).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Miocene sequence in the Roer Valley Rift System consists of alternating shallow marine, coastal and fluvio-deltaic deposits. In this study seismostratigraphy and biostratigraphy are used to determine major unconformities and sediment dispersal patterns. This research is important for future studies related to the geothermal energy potential, and for the improvement of cross-border correlations with the German and Belgian stratigraphic framework. Results show that a depocenter developed in the south-eastern part of the Roer Valley Graben above the Early Miocene Unconformity (EMU) during the Early- and Middle Miocene. Clinoforms are present in a limited area here, but show sediment dispersal from the south-east towards the north-west during periods of progradation. From the late Middle Miocene onwards, larger displacement rates occurred along the major bounding fault zones, i.e. the Peel Boundary Fault Zone, the Feldbiss Fault Zone and the Veldhoven Fault. As a result, the depocenter narrowed and shifted to the central part of the Roer Valley Graben, where accumulation rates increased and larger-scale clinoforms start prograding both towards the west-north-west. This phase coincides with the development of a regional hiatus on the structural highs and forced regression in the south-eastern Roer Valley Graben, caused by a major sea-level fall related to the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition. The effects of tectonics, eustacy and climate resulted in the formation of the Mid-Miocene Unconformity (MMU), which represents a series of events related both to tectonics and sea-level fluctuations, and is therefore expressed differently throughout the Roer Valley Rift System. Sedimentation continued through this period in the deeper parts of the Roer Valley Graben and on the Venlo Block, while an erosional hiatus is evident on the Campine Block and Peel Block. During the latest Miocene, the depocenter migrated to the south-western rim of the Roer Valley Graben, where the youngest Miocene sediments are deposited during a latest Tortonian-Messinian sea level fall that led to the formation of the Late Miocene Unconformity (LMU).</jats:p>"

A total of 189 samples were selected and analysed for the quality and quantity of microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs). The results found MNPs in all water samples, with an average abundance ranging from 204 ± 54 to 336 ± 87 particles/L in raw water, from 22 ± 7 to 33 ± 12 particles/L in tap water, and from 25 ± 15 to 73 ± 30 particles/L in drinking water. MNPs were divided into three categories according to their shape. Fragments and fibres clearly dominated in all samples. The majority of particles with sizes greater than 125 μm are found in raw water, while those with ranging sizes from 20 nm to 125 μm are mostly found in treated water. The MNPs were domains of fibres and fragments. The majority of the MNPs were composed of polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polyethylene (PE). This study contributes to filling the knowledge gap in the field of emerging MNPs pollution of raw and treated water, which is of concern due to the potential human exposure to MNPs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sebesar 85% rumput laut basah dunia berasal dari Indonesia, terutama dari Indonesia Timur. Bulukumba merupakan salah satu daerah penghasil rumput laut terbesar di Indonesia. Ada 80% warga yang berprofesi sebagai petani rumput laut di Dusun Babana, Kabupaten Bulukumba. Koordinasi dan kolaborasi diantara keseluruhan pelaku supply chain pada komoditas rumput laut di Kabupaten Bulukumba diperlukan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan pasar. Kualitas rumput laut yang buruk mengakibatkan kerugian bagi para petani. Jika ini terjadi mengakibatkan terganggunya jaringan supply chain dan mengurangi profitabilitas para pelakunya. Macroergonomics Analysis of  Structure (MAS) terdiri dari  tiga elemen utama sistem sosioteknik, yaitu subsistem teknologi, subsistem personil, dan lingkungan eksternal. Subsistem yang digunakan hanyalah subsistem personel dan subsistem lingkungan eksternal. Risiko dengan bobot tertinggi yang didapatkan adalah pada subsistem personal di faktor profesionalisme dengan bobot 0,32 (motivasi berkurang saat musim hujan). Untuk faktor lingkungan eksternal adalah dengan bobot 0,33 (musim hujan)  berkaitan dengan musim hujan. Hal ini dikarenakan musim penghujan yang memberikan dampak paling buruk. Kemudian untuk proses pengeringannya juga akan terganggu. Hasil produksi  petani rumput laut sangat berpengaruh pada proses supply chain. Jika risiko pada petani rumput laut terjadi, maka pedagang pengumpul dalam melakukan supply memerlukan waktu lebih lama serta kapasitas yang diangkut juga semakin sedikit. Solusi yang didapatkan untuk perbaikan adalah melakukan seleksi bibit, pengadaan kebun bibit, pengadaan laboratorium, dan pembuatan landbase untuk mengantisipasi cuaca ekstrim.</jats:p>"

While several academic studies point to this linkage, there has been no response from the international legal community on how this problem should be tackled. At the global level, current frameworks are in the form of ad hoc voluntary declarations and initiatives with no binding legal obligations, either on governments or industry. While these acknowledge the problem of drug-resistant bacteria, they do not provide necessary steps or recommendations to rectify the problem at its source. To add to this, the systems within the national borders of the countries housing these manufacturing hubs have also not been effective in regulating this sector. The chapter advocates for a supply chain-based regulatory framework that could potentially mitigate the problem since current national regulatory systems are not the most effective. Addressing supply chains could be more effective than domestic regulations to reduce regulatory gaps between jurisdictions (EU and India) as well as to increase accountability of buyers as well as manufacturers so that pharmaceutical emissions offsets are minimized.</jats:p>",

This study aims to contribute to this effort by investigating current trends and developments in the area of food industry supply chain resilience and identifying potential areas for improvement. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 122 articles published between 2008 and 2023, utilizing multiple quantitative measures such as bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Findings: Our study identifies five distinct clusters of research on food industry supply chain resilience. We found that food systems resilience and public health is the most extensively studied aspect, indicating the importance of ensuring that our food supply chains are capable of withstanding disruptions to maintain public health. The other four clusters–seafood supply chain resilience and risk management; digital and sustainable food systems; agri-food Industry 4.0 and sustainability; and meat production and the food industry–each represent important areas for future research and development. Originality: To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a bibliometric approach to analyze the resilience of food supply chain systems. By doing so, we provide a unique and original contribution to the existing literature on food supply chain systems, as prior bibliometric analyses have not specifically focused on the resilience aspect. Practical implications: Our findings highlight the need for continued research and development in the area of food industry supply chain resilience. By identifying the most pressing areas for improvement and future research, our study can help inform policy decisions and guide industry efforts to create more resilient food supply chains that can adapt to changing conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Riverbank filtered drinking water supply systems are strongly dependent on the river stage. Climate change-induced extremely low or high river stage may cause water quantity and quality problems. In this study, a riverbank-filtered drinking water supply system along the Danube River was investigated from a radioactivity point of view: we aimed to understand the origin of elevated (&gt;100 mBq L&amp;#8211;1) gross alpha activity measured in some wells and the variation in water quality with river level fluctuation.\n10 producing, 2 monitoring wells, and the Danube were sampled at lower and higher river stages. The water samples were analyzed for major ions and trace components. Total U (234U+235U+238U) and 226Ra activity concentration were determined by alpha spectrometry using Nucfilm discs, and 222Rn activity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.\nTotal uranium activity was measured in the highest concentration (up to 334 mBq L&amp;#8211;1). Radium and radon activities were barely above the detection limit. Based on our results the previously measured elevated gross alpha activity is most likely caused by dissolved uranium in the groundwater. Uranium activity concentrations show increasing values from N to S which corresponds well to the occurrence of organic matter-rich, clayey floodplain deposits underlying the aquifer.\nBesides spatial variation, a temporal change can also be observed: lower uranium activity was measured at a lower river stage (32&amp;#8211;248 mBq L&amp;#8211;1) compared to a higher river stage (26&amp;#8211;334 mBq L&amp;#8211;1). This phenomenon could be explained by the dynamic relationship between the groundwater and the river. At the low river stage, oxygen-rich (ground)water flows from the river toward the inland and may cause the remobilization of uranium from the clayey basement layers. This process will be more and more dominant by extremely low river stages during long-lasting drought periods in the future causing water quality problems.\nThe research was funded by the National Multidisciplinary Laboratory for Climate Change, RRF-2.3.1-21-2022-00014 project.</jats:p>"

Flooding can affect the quality of groundwater and surface water resources and can cause supply service interruption due to damaged infrastructures. A complete approach to address flood impact on WSS is required but is not yet available, while only specific aspects were investigated in details.In this context, the MUHA project, funded by the European INTERREG V-B Adriatic-Ionian ADRION Programme 2014-2020, developed a comprehensive tool named WAter Safety Planning Procedures Decision Support System (WASPP&amp;#8211;DSS). The tool is mainly addressed to small water utilities (WU) for supporting WSP development and is based on two main premises: 1) a correct approach for WSS risk analysis requires a multi-hazard perspective encompassing all the system components and different hazards; 2) other institutions in addition to WUs have to be involved in WSS risk analyses to harmonize monitoring and response procedures.The tool was tested on six pilot areas of the ADRION region considering four hazards: drought, flooding, accidental pollution and damage to infrastructure due to earthquakes. In this work, the tool is demonstrated for flooding impact analysis in three pilot areas: the Ridracoli reservoir in Italy and two municipalities, Larissa in Greece and Zadar in Croatia. The WASPP&amp;#8211;DSS, tested by eight WUs, was found a potentially valid support for small WUs that must start drafting the WSP in a comprehensive way and can provide a common shared scheme.Improvements are desirable, as including a specific section to consider the issue of loss of water resources from reservoirs due to overflow.</jats:p>"

However, limited studies have investigated housing supply restrictions in informal housing markets. To address this knowledge‐gap, this article analyzes a range of indicators of livelihood among residents of informal settlements and informal housing supply restrictions in Maputo, Mozambique and Nairobi, Kenya. The findings underscore that informal urban development is restricted to a far higher extent and livelihood in informal settlements is considerably more compromised in Nairobi compared to Maputo, despite that wages are higher in Nairobi and geographic factors likely curtail urban development to a higher extent in Maputo. The empirical evidence and economic theory reviewed in this article consistently indicate that antagonistic approaches to informal urban development in cities with large segments of the population financially excluded from the formal housing markets have comparable consequences to land use restrictions guiding formal urban development. Namely, that informal land users pay a price premium for basic shelter in such contexts due to the increased pressure on the housing markets and risk of loss of investments through forced evictions. On this basis, the article argues that unless viable legal housing alternatives are available, repressive approaches to informal urban development should be abolished while less restrictive standards for building and planning regulation should be adopted to expand provision of affordable legal accommodation and thereby enhance sustainable development.</jats:p>",

The article analyzed existing methods for calculating a supplier's rating and identified their shortcomings. An algorithm for calculating supplier ratings based on both expert data and statistical data has been described. The study highlights the key criteria that are relevant for evaluating suppliers, grouping them into those related to the general condition and capabilities of the supplier, those related to the reliability of the supplier's business, and those related to operational risks. The proposed algorithm for evaluating supplier rating criteria involves collecting statistical data in the form of disincentive factors. The algorithm calculates the supplier rating by considering the ratio of the value of the disincentive factor that describes a particular supplier's condition to the average market value of such a disincentive factor. The algorithm also takes into account changes in the values of supplier evaluation criteria over time. The study suggests comparing the results of the supplier rating with the classification of suppliers according to the ABC analysis method. Based on this comparison, the study proposes a business logic approach: if the supplier is promising based on the rating but does not fall into group A according to the ABC analysis, an action plan should be developed to improve cooperation with the supplier. If the supplier is unpromising based on the rating and falls into group A according to the ABC analysis, urgent measures should be taken to remove the supplier from the company's partner list. Finally, if the supplier belongs to group A according to the ABC analysis and is promising according to the rating, a strategy should be developed for negotiating their price policy in relation to the company. The conclusion has been formulated that the algorithm proposed in the study for rating criteria evaluation will enable companies to make an effective choice of suppliers.</jats:p>"

However, the effective management of the supply chain in mushroom cultivation presents numerous challenges. This research paper aims to identify the constraints associated with the supply chain of mushroom cultivation and provide suggestions for their improvement.The study was conducted in 2023 (February – March) in the Raipur block of Dehradun. The data were collected via questionnaire and direct interview from 60 growers and 20 traders. Region was specifically chosen due to the significant presence of growers and traders. The reason behind this selection was the growers' shift towards mushroom cultivation as a result of untimely rains and crop damage. Mushroom cultivation offered a controlled indoor environment, mitigating the risks associated with unpredictable weather conditions. However, over time, both the growers and traders encountered challenges in the management aspects of cultivation, as well as post-harvesting. Grower perceived major constraints were Inadequate supply of spawn at appropriate time, Unfavourable climatic conditions, no cold storage facilities, poor marketing avenues and people regard mushroom as a non-veg food were ranked first. It is therefore recommended that constraints should be checked to maximize the production. To do that, extension agencies should take up skill-oriented training programmes and awareness programmes, cold storage facilities should be provided to accelerate the self-life.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus in the relevant literature on the specific stage for inter-relationship collaboration in a supply chain in transformative technologies. For example, the inter-relationship collaboration in a supply chain becomes significant at a later stage of disruptive innovation when the most cutting-edge product or technology must be marketed. On the other hand, inter-relationship collaboration in a supply chain should be included in the innovation process at a much earlier stage to ensure a more comprehensive supplier engagement. Several researchers have examined suppliers' role in product innovations; nevertheless, none of the published supplier integration models are directly connected to the issue of at what point suppliers need to be integrated into the product innovation process. Therefore, this article aims to propose a blueprint for inter-relationship collaboration in a supply chain during product innovation phases, with an emphasis on the stage of involvement applicable to both incremental and disruptive innovation. In addition, various aspects concerning inter-relationship collaboration in a supply chain in the different phases of product invention are subjected to an in-depth investigation.</jats:p>"

Oil and gas management activities carried out by PT Pertamina must be able to run according to the target. For this reason, in carrying out its business processes, PT Pertamina requires good planning for crude oil. This study focuses on the type of Super Heavy (SH) crude oil including Duri, Cinta, Escalante, Ostra, etc., and Heavy (H) including Banyu Urip, GG Condensate, Minas/SLC, Cabinda, Etame, etc. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the discrepancy between plans and the realization of crude oil orders as well as forecasting for the next 12 periods of crude oil at PT KPI - RU VI Balongan. The results show that several forecasting methods match the demand data pattern, namely the cyclical method, cyclical trend, and multiplicative decomposition (seasonal) methods. In finding the error value forecasting is done by calculating the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) method. The selected forecasting method that has the highest accuracy is the cyclical trend forecasting method with a MAPE value of 0.22 for heavy crude oil and 0.13 for super heavy crude oil. The cyclical trend forecasting method has succeeded in reducing the error in the crude supply accuracy level compared to the existing Master Program (MP) crude method.</jats:p>"

Drainage water was diluted to different ratios with river water to decrease its salinity and increase its potential for agricultural uses. The diluted samples contained between 0 and 100% drainage water, and between 100 and 0% river water, in 10% steps – i.e., 0:10, 1:9, 2:8, 3:7, 4:6, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 5:5. After dilution of water, chemical properties, ion activities, electrical conductivity (EC), soil reaction (pH), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), and total dissolved solid (TDS)) were measured in the laboratory of the University of Wasit/College of Agriculture, for computing the drainage water quality index (DWQI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and soluble magnesium percentage (Mg%). Mathematical models were generated to predict the DWQI using DataFit software, depending on the water's chemical properties, and to find the best dilution ratio, which was 9:1.

As a result of the 2018 Kerala floods, this disaster-prone region experienced drought conditions. In order to lessen the effects of future disasters, it is also necessary to identify and evaluate the district's groundwater potential (GWP). This work used three machine-learning (ML) algorithms – Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Gradient Boosting (GB) – to model and produce GWP zonation maps for the Idukki district. Fourteen conditioning factors including elevation, slope, curvature, Topographic Roughness Index, lineament density, soil, geology, geomorphology, Topographic Wetness Index, Sediment Transport Index, drainage density, rainfall, land-use/land-cover (LULC), and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index were adopted as input parameters in the modelling. All showed prominence when they were examined for feature importance using the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. The RF model outperformed the other two ML models in terms of fit, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.92, while the GB and AdaBoost models displayed less fit, with AUC values of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. GWP maps produced by each model were reclassified into five zones – very high to very low – it was discovered that the zones were evenly spread throughout the Idukki region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main problem of choosing an adequate method of managing the reliability of supply chains is that for both participants and consumers all the main properties of an effective supply chain (failure, economy and security of supply) are equally relevant. Therefore, it is necessary to jointly use the tools of reliability theory, planning methods built on the basis of operation research and risk management methods. The work considers mathematical models and methods for assessing and improving the reliability of supply chains and proposes an algorithm for calculating the reliability of supplies that corresponds to the exponential and normal laws of the distribution of failure intensity. According to the algorithm, on the example of the supply chain of spare parts of the “Sfera-Auto” enterprise, the reliability indicators of the supply chain were calculated, namely: failure time, failure intensity, average recovery time, recovery intensity and probability of failure-free delivery, and changes in the probability of failure-free operation P(t) chain. The results of the study showed that: the increase in the probability of failure-free operation P for the period (t) characterizes the higher reliability of the supply chain for any type of supply probability distribution; – the point values of the coefficient of failure of supply Kg and the value of supply reliability in supply P do not give a complete picture of the reliability of the supply chain, it is necessary to study the dynamics of these indicators; – it is necessary to choose a theoretical distribution for the failure intensity λ(t), because the exponential distribution, which is widely used for modeling the reliability of non-renewable systems, is not well suited for modeling the reliability of renewable systems.</jats:p>",

To address the issue, some of the governments have adopted Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with the hope of improving housing delivery. However, identifying the most suitable PPP arrangement for providing houses is often problematic. This paper reports on a study of the different PPP arrangements that can be applied in housing delivery, critical success factors and challenges associated with the arrangements. It also reports lessons that Papua New Guinea (PNG) can draw from other countries that have applied PPP extensively in housing delivery. The study is based on a historical narrative literature review that was analysed using manifest qualitative content analysis. The findings revealed that there are several PPP arrangements that can be used in providing houses such as the direct relationship ownership housing which is similar to the build-lease-operate-transfer. Another type of arrangement is the direct relationship rental housing which is similar to the build-own-operate. Critical success factors for a PPP project include the need for transparency at all stages of the PPP, risks must be allocated properly between the public sector and the private sector, the PPP should have adequate political and community support. The performance of a PPP arrangement can be restricted by high transaction costs, poor contracting and procurement procedures, the dominance of the public sector in the arrangement, poor communication between the partners and inadequate legal frameworks. The lessons that PNG can draw from other countries include the identification of PPP arrangements that are most suitable for the country and how to implement the arrangements in an effective manner. The findings provide more understanding on the application of PPP arrangements in housing delivery by considering the challenges and success factors associated with the arrangements. </jats:p>"

The musculoskeletal structures in the forefoot are well described in the literature, but information about vascularization is limited. The novel aim of this work is to provide anatomical guidance to structures found in the forefoot, focusing on the arterial system. Initially, native CT and MRI sequences were taken of the left forefoot of a deceased 6-year-old female Asian elephant; the foot was then filled with an iodine-containing contrast medium through the a. mediana and the CT scans were repeated in the same position. The images obtained were processed with 3D Slicer software for the 3D reconstruction of the bones and arteries. The results clearly showed the palmar blood supply of the forefoot. A so far undescribed vessel was revealed, stemming from the a. metacarpea, supplying the first digit and the digital cushion. The course of the deep palmar arch’s terminal section was also established. This paper provides the first description of the exact disposition of the arteries in the palmar aspect of an elephant’s forefoot and may be used in planning surgeries in clinically affected animals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Real-time monitoring networks are increasingly prevalent in supporting the management of environmental systems as the technology for live data collection becomes more accessible. Additionally, ecosystem and water resource pressures have persisted and intensified under climate pressures and an expanding anthropogenic footprint. The way in which models and data are fused in the day-to-day management of water resources operations, as well as for long-term planning and investment, has been a critical field of research. An adaptive real-time monitoring-integrated learning modelling approach was developed and applied to improve the understanding of the mixing dynamics in a water supply reservoir in Queensland, Australia. This was accomplished through the combination of sequentially linked catchment and reservoir models with in situ real-time measurements of temperature and flow along with meteorological forecasts from an Australian numerical weather model, to produce short-term water quality forecasts. An adaptive learning catchment model was developed and linked for each inflow arm of the reservoir using the Australian Water Balance Model. This framework enabled automated online communication to researchers and managers around the current performance of the inflow predictions and the confidence expected in the current forecasts. Moreover, this live learning catchment model was coupled with a real-time adaptive three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the reservoir iteratively training using data from the deployed real-time temperature monitoring system. A prototype internet-connected remotely operable autonomous surface vessel was deployed with a winching system for conducting dynamic water quality profiling operations under the guidance of waypoints guidance generated from the real-time adaptive modelling forecasts. Data collected by ASV was subsequently provided back to the modelling system in real-time. The complete system facilitated the online adaptive forecasting of mixing dynamics in the reservoir and the automated identification of features of interest for water quality profiling, as well as dynamically monitoring the areas potentially most valuable for model learning development to improve system-wide understanding and forecast certainty through addition into the live dataset for ongoing training and evaluation. Evidence was found in support of a rolling iterative calibration procedure for increasing model skill sensitivity to different processes occurring over temporal and spatial scales across both catchment and receiving water models. Dynamically guided spatial monitoring generated from maximum predicted areas of variation and parameter sensitivity in the real-time adaptive receiving water model demonstrated that monitoring of the receiving water inflow arms during inflow events was necessary during inflow events to train the model on the strongest signal of the driving force of changes in the receiving water environment. Overall, the uncertainty in rainfall events from both forecasted and observed sources cascading with the uncertainty in catchment simulations with only static indirect monitoring of flow (ungauged at any of the inflow arms to the reservoir) was found to be the most significant hindrance to the utility of the applied real-time adaptive modelling framework. The application of an adaptive computer vision-based stream gauging approach was then trialled on one of the ungauged inflow arms in order to supplement this gap.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A critical review of agriculture policies during different plan periods, aligned with political changes, has been conducted out to understand the shift in priorities, technology transfer ,support products, and private sector engagement. Firstly, in the 1950s, the policies were influenced by the first five-year plan and focused on the import and dissemination of technology. During the three decades of the Panchayat era, there was an emphasis on state mechanisms for technology transfer, agribusiness, and research, with limited incentives for the private sector. After 1990, agricultural policy products followed a path of liberalization and focused on defining the state’s role and promoting pluralism. This period witnessed the establishment of a wide range of private and cooperative-led agribusinesses, although their growth was hindered by political conflict. Subsequently, policies began to incorporate priorities such as nutrition security, comparative advantage, competitiveness, climate change adaptation, agrobiodiversity conservation, and sustainability. However, with the federalization of the state and establishment of a three-tier governance system in 2015, agriculture policies, priorities and strategies a became fragmented, diversified, and localized, and lack harmonization. This review demonstrates that agriculture policies were largely influenced by domestic political developments and structural changes at the international level. Nonetheless, a consistent focus on increasing production and productivity, as well as achieving food security and self-sufficiency, can be observed.. Throughout all policy periods, supply chain development, a crucial component of agribusiness, received limited prioritization, which remains a major impediment to agricultural transformation. Despite seven decades of policy evolution, Nepal has been unable to create an enabling policy environment to attract significant private and cooperative sector investments that could drive substantial growth in agribusiness. This situation calls for further research in the field of policy formulation capacity among the three tiers of government to foster agribusiness and promote supply chain development for agricultural transformation.</jats:p>"

This paper considers the role of housing supply in shaping the growth of cities and neighborhoods. Housing supply constraints have meant that demand growth has increasingly manifested as price growth rather than as increases in housing units or population in larger and denser metropolitan areas and neighborhoods. New housing is provided at increasingly higher cost in areas that have higher intensity of existing development and more restrictive regulatory environments. Both forces have strengthened over time, making quantity supplied less responsive to growing demand, driving housing price growth in many areas, and pushing housing quantity growth further out into urban fringes. As a result of such pressures on the cost of new construction, the US has recently experienced more rapid price growth and a declining influence of new construction on the housing stock. </jats:p>",

Aeration in the water flow is one of the best ways to prevent cavitation. To design an aerator, estimation of aeration coefficient (β), jet length (L/h0), and jet impact angle on chute (tanγ) are important in this study. The potential of a hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) with metaheuristic algorithms was investigated to estimate the required parameters to design an aerator. The ANFIS was combined with four metaheuristic algorithms, including differential evolution (DE), ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Experimental data and dimensionless parameters were used to develop the proposed hybrid ANFIS models. Three statistical indicators, including root mean square error (RMSE), mean average error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2), were employed to compare the proposed methods with empirical relations. According to the statistical indicators, among the data-driven methods, the ANFIS–DE method had the best prediction in estimating β (RMSE = 0.018, R2 = 0.984, MAE = 0.013), L/h0 (RMSE = 1.293, R2 = 0.963, MAE = 1.082), and tanγ (RMSE = 0.009, R2 = 0.939, MAE = 0.007).</jats:p>",

The report begins by introducing the history of watershed runoff and the study area. The differences between various land use types and land use efficiency are examined using the watershed hydrology model from previous literature. The novelty of the paper is to compare the evapotranspiration of the model in different periods with the depth data of surface runoff. The results show that the simulation analysis and collaborative response strategy proposed here can adapt to the meteorological changes in the basin. The evapotranspiration of a watershed that was converted from woodland to grassland in 1970 was 34 mm, while that of a watershed that was converted from grassland to woodland was 32 mm, according to the results of the model test. The evapotranspiration of a watershed that gone from woodland to grassland in 2010 is 45 mm, compared to 39 mm for a watershed that has gone from grassland to woodland. The second Songhua River basin's surface water yield data can therefore be used to model and study the basin's runoff in real time.</jats:p>",

Konut fazlası veya konut stoku gibi anahtar kelimeler kullanılarak internette bir arama yapıldığında sadece birkaç saniye içinde konuya ilişkin çok sayıda bilgi ve yoruma ulaşılabilmektedir. Üretilen konutların önemli bir bölümünün planlanan takvime uygun şekilde satılamadığına, dolayısıyla da konut stoklarının arttığına ilişkin tespit ve değerlendirmeler ile bu durumun ortaya çıkardığı başarısızlık hikâyeleri bu bilgi ve yorumlardan bazılarıdır. Söz konusu başarısızlığın ortadan kaldırılabilmesi için konut kredisi faizlerinde indirim, peşinat düşürme, taksitleri uzun vadelere yayma, ödemeleri erteleme ve maliyetine satış gibi çeşitli yollara başvurulmuş ve bunlara ilaveten daha neler yapılabileceği konuşulmaya başlanmıştır. Böyle bir ortamda gerçekleştirilen bu çalışmada; sorunun kaynağını oluşturabilecek nedenler tartışılarak gelecekteki geliştirmelere katkı sağlanabilmesi amaçlanmıştır. Bu amaçla öncelikle Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu (TÜİK)’nun yapı ruhsatı, yapı kullanma izin ve ilk satış konut istatistikleri yardımıyla, bahsi geçen sorunun varlığı değerlendirilmiştir. Elde edilen sonuçlar 2000-2019 döneminde ruhsata bağlanarak yapımına başlanılan toplam 12.543.047 bağımsız bölümün %16,96’sına karşılık gelen 2.127.086 adedin tamamlanamadığını, 2012-2020 döneminde yapı kullanma izni almış olan toplam 6.614.059 konutun %23,57’sini oluşturan 1.558.808 adedin ise 2021 yılı sonu itibariyle satılamamış olduğunu göstermiştir. Sonrasında, konut geliştirmenin tamamlanamama ve pazarlanamama başarısızlıkları olarak da nitelendirilebilecek bu durumun neden ve sonuçları üzerine odaklanılmıştır. Genelde gayrimenkul geliştirmenin, özelde konut geliştirmenin temel özellikleri, riskleri ve süreçlerine ilişkin literatür bilgileri temel alınarak, geliştirmede başarı için anahtar olabilecek unsurlar ile bu unsurların gerektiği gibi dikkate alınmamasından doğabilecek sonuçların vurgulanmasına çalışılmıştır. Yapılan değerlendirmeler, konut sektöründe üretim-arz-talep dengesinin kurulabilmesi için proje geliştirme yaklaşımlarının yeniden gözden geçirilmesi gerektiğini göstermiştir. Gelecekteki konut geliştirmelerde; risklerin en önemli kaynağını oluşturan geliştirmenin temel özelliklerine ve risk yönetimi yapılanmasına daha fazla dikkat edilmesi zorunluluğu vurgulanmıştır. Karar vermede en önemli noktayı teşkil eden uygulanabilirlik analizlerine ve bu analizler içerisinde programlamaya, geçmişte olduğundan çok daha fazla önem verilmesi ve bu yönde hareket edilmesi gerektiği sonucuna ulaşılmıştır.</jats:p>"

According to the attributes of planning factors, the planning scheme of the spatial layout is divided into multiple subsystems and the goodness value of the factors in the scheme is calculated by using the single factor modular root method. Taking each subsystem as a factor, the comprehensive goodness value of each decision scheme is obtained respectively, so as to complete the creation of the spatial layout model of public service facilities. Based on this model, the fractal dimension, shape, and discrete index of a land patch are calculated for the public service facilities of the intelligent community, and the calculated results are used to optimize the public service supply in intelligent communities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a significant source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and plays a crucial role in climate change and global warming. This study aims to explain the effects of primary and renewable energy supplies and environmental taxation and to analyse how taxation can alter their direct effects on carbon intensity. The research was conducted using a generalized method of moments model that uses instrumental variables with two-stage (2SGMM) estimators to calculate the direct and moderating effects of environmental taxes on carbon intensity. This study confirms the EKC theorem, and results have shown that primary energy supply and environmental-related taxation positively contribute to carbon intensity. The second finding indicates that a major increase in the proportion of renewable energy will greatly slow the rate of carbon dioxide emissions. The study provides additional evidence concerning the moderating role of taxation in amplifying the impacts of primary and renewable energy supply. The empirical findings suggest that the taxation impact is more fiscal than an incentive. In addition to the current energy and economic crisis, considerable funding and fiscal policies are needed to achieve more sustainable development paths towards carbon neutrality and energy security.</jats:p>",

This paper constructs a differential game model of the secondary pharmaceutical supply chain consisting of pharmaceutical enterprises and medical institutions in the context of centralized drug procurement policy, considering the effects of health insurance reimbursement and consumers’ low-carbon preferences, and compares and analyzes the feedback equilibrium strategies of low-carbon inputs and marketing efforts, supply chain profits, and social welfare levels under four government subsidy models and further discusses them with arithmetic examples. The results illustrated that government subsidies have a significant impact on the low-carbon investment of pharmaceutical enterprises and the low-carbon marketing of medical institutions; subsidies for pharmaceutical enterprises can significantly increase the low-carbon investment and profit level of pharmaceutical enterprises; subsidies for medical institutions can effectively promote the implementation of the “zero-rate” policy and the realization of the emission reduction target under the centralization policy of medical institutions, increase the market demand for low-carbon drugs, and thus gain higher profits; the dual-subsidy model of the government brings higher social welfare than the single-subsidy model, and under a reasonable subsidy ratio, the profit and social welfare of the whole supply chain can be maximized.</jats:p>"

The extraction and parts of the transport and processing of these minerals take place in the Global South and often bear high human rights and environmental risks. A lack of traceability in mineral supply chains makes it particularly difficult to hold companies accountable for negative environmental and social impacts of their operations and those of their suppliers. This paper analyses three mineral supply chains (copper, platinum, and gold) in order to develop propositions about how supply chain‐specific characteristics affect traceability and foreign corporate accountability (FCA) in mineral supply chains. The analytical framework focuses on three dimensions: geopolitical dynamics, industry characteristics, and private governance mechanisms. The authors argue that chain‐specific characteristics may foster or thwart traceability and FCA in mineral supply chains and thus provides a novel contribution to the debate on traceability and accountability in mineral supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the 2008 Wenchuan (Ms. 8.0) earthquake, the Shi&amp;#8209;ting River in Sichuan Province, China has suffered massive bed incision, with the largest incision depth being more than 20 m in 7 years. Potential reasons include: breaks in sediment connectivity due to widespread in-channel weirs; the supply of fine sediment after the earthquake; intensive sand mining, etc. In this study, we simulate the combined role of in-channel weirs and fine sediment supply in determining the massive bed incision in the Shi-ting River. A one-dimensional river morphodynamic model is implemented. The simulated results show that the in-channel weirs can lead to bed incision and bed coarsening in the downstream channel. For a weir with a height of 5 m, the maximum incision depth is about 5 m, and the extent of downstream incision is no more than 20 km within 20 years. The supply of fine sediment can enhance the downstream channel incision, as the weir preferentially traps coarse sediment but passes the fine sediment downstream. However, a combination of in-channel weirs and the fine sediment supply cannot explain the dramatic incision (20 m in 7 years) as observed in the Shi-ting River. This suggests that the mining of gravel and sand had a significant role in driving channel degradation.</jats:p>"

Water supply and sanitation challenges are linked to climate change effects and the quest for climate-resilient development. This paper evaluates the current challenges in water supply and sanitation development in developing countries and infrastructure resilience. The research is based on the data collected throughout the practical development task. Some of the findings were the climate change effect and temporary adaptation mechanisms, such as intermittent supply causing further pressure variation and water loss in the system. Resilient water supply and sanitation development require an integrated approach based on practical experiences, the latest technological development in water supply and sanitation system operation and management tools, and climate change adaptation. A seamless understanding of engineering, management, and technology is required for the development and management of water supply and sanitation systems. Dispersed skills may be available that were not effective at this time, which calls for a different approach to training provision and skill development as a package on design, management, and recent technological support.</jats:p>",

There has been an increase in demand and, at the same time, a shortage of supplies. This has shown that supply chain management in the health care industry cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, the health care industry is also facing other major challenges, such as the current labor market shortage. In the literature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is highlighted as an effective tool to build a more resilient and efficient supply chain that can manage these challenges. Although using IoT in supply chain management has been extensively examined in other types of supply chains, its use in the health care supply chain has largely been overlooked. Given that the health care supply chain, compared to others, is more complex and is under growing pressure, a more in-depth understanding of the opportunities brought by IoT is necessary.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>This study aims to address this research gap by identifying and ranking the drivers of and barriers to implementing IoT in the health care supply chain.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>We conducted a 2-stage study.

The low-carbon level, streamer promotion effort and selling price in two livestreaming marketing modes will increase when the streamer promotion sensitivity coefficient and consumer low-carbon preference increase and will decrease when consumer price sensitivity increases under two power structures.

Sustainable land management deals with the demands for land in terms of not only human society but also the nature conservation and biodiversity. To persue and realize sustainable land management, the indicators and evaluation system are necessary, and ecosystem services has emerged as the proper indicator for sustainable land management. This study focused on the balance between the demand and supply of ecosystem services. If the balance between them was maintained or supply exceeded demand, the land can be assessed to be managed sustainably. In this study, CO2 sequestration, Heat mitigation, and water provision were assessed as ecosystem service in South Korea. The supply of each ecosystem service was evaluated by using related models which had been developed and used widely in previous studies. The demand of each ecosystem service was defined based on specific figures which had already suggested as policy goals in South Kroea in purpose of drawing social consensus. Afterwards, the ecosystem services supply and demand ratio (ESDR) were calculated to show the balance between supply and demand quantified by region. As a result, the exessive demand for CO2 sequestration service was found compared to supply. The supply of heat mitigation service was found to be sufficient for the demand nationwide. However, in specific areas such as cities, the demand was higher than the supply. In the case of water provision service, the national demand was being met by some regional suppliers. Through these results, it is possible to find out the ecosystem services that need to be supplemented spatially and regionally, and ultimately, it is expected to support the establishment of urban space, green space, and environmental planning at the regional and national levels.</jats:p>"

The second part is a theoretical proposition. Concepts of the network theory and of the inter-organisational proximity framework and their relevance are explained, followed by a proposition of a combination of the two views to conceptualise cross-industrial collaborations. The objective of this concept paper is to provide a thematic and theoretical background for future studies to understand how to connect non-traditional actors within a supply network, how companies from different industries manage to collaborate, and to assess the opportunities and pitfalls of these collaborations for the scale-up of the circular economy.</jats:p>"

On a sample of 350 organizations, this study analyzes data using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (SEM-PLS). According to the findings, the circular economy has a positive impact on firm performance, which is mediated in part by environmental supply chain collaboration. The findings of this study contribute to the current literature on the circular economy and corporate success by providing empirical evidence of the mediating effect of environmental supply chain collaboration. Because they underscore the necessity of developing and maintaining environmentally friendly supply chain partnerships, the findings have practical value for organizations striving to apply circular economy ideas.</jats:p>"

One target region is Syria, which is facing water insecurity regarding water availability, water supply, and agricultural water needs. In addition, the region is severely affected by war which results in extreme destruction of infrastructure and other resources.\nThe project's objective is to provide a model-based framework for integrated water resources management (IWRM) to identify suitable sites for MAR and to predict their impact on the regional water balance and the local situation. The proposed framework incorporates different methods and model techniques with applications ranging from global to local scales. The model workflow is completely based on open-source tools to ensure sustainable use of the project efforts.\nModeling on the global scale is mainly done by data-driven methods like GIS Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) to answer questions like where are suitable and feasible areas for MAR. Regional scale models aim to describe the hydrological cycle by distributed numerical methods (e.g., MODFLOW-OWHM) to predict and manage MAR under consideration of the regional groundwater situation. Local-scale numerical models can provide detailed and site-specific insights into the flow and transport processes of the unsaturated zone and the underlying aquifer. Specific activities in Syria include e.g., evaluation of wastewater reuse for irrigation. Finally, the current process understanding with regard to MAR methods is critically evaluated and expanded.</jats:p>"

Digital health tools are used to promote public health interventions. This study evaluated the impact of LoMIS Stock, a digital health tool, on vaccine stock management in Kano State. We deployed the quasi-experimental design using a mixed method to generate data for impact. We interviewed 109 stakeholders (66 in Kano; the state exposed to LoMIS; 43 in Bauchi; the comparison state). We measured LoMIS Stock usage rate, timeliness of reporting, facility stock-outs, and data-driven decision-making. The Analysis of Variance and T-tests were used to determine effect and compare difference of means. Using time series analysis (expert modeler), we forecasted the trend of stock-outs in Kano State if LoMIS Stock had not been introduced. All qualitative data was analyzed with Atlas Ti software.\n<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>\nWe found that 62% of participants reported using the tool for stock reports three years after its deployment. Twenty-four (24) hour response to stock-out alerts and Cold Chain Equipment breakdown improved by 67% and 49% respectively. Significantly, stock-out alerts reduced by 88% as compared to only 29% in Bauchi State within the same period. It was found that stock-out events would have increased if LoMIS Stock had not been introduced in Kano State.All partners interviewed affirmed the impulse of LoMIS on improved vaccine visibility that led to timely response.\n<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>\nLoMIS stock has significantly reduced stock-out experiences and improved vaccine visibility and accountability in health facilities. There are more opportunities for LoMIS Stock optimization.</jats:p>"

The interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) method is used to find the relationship between these indicators. The ISM stages begin with identifying indicators, compiling contextual relationships, compiling reachability matrices, compiling level partitions, compiling digraphs, and compiling ISM models. Then MICMAC analysis is used to group each of these indicators into four categories based on their driving power and dependence power. In this study, 16 hands of agile supply chain management in the palm oil industry were obtained, of which the four-level ISM  model could be constructed. Two indicators are at level 4, six hands are at level 3, three indicators are at level 2, and five indicators are at level 1. Meanwhile, through MICMAC analysis, five indicators are found in the independent indicators category, six hands are in the linkage indicator category, four indicators are included in the dependent indicator category, and one indicator is in the autonomous indicator category. This research can be used by managers in the palm oil industry who want to increase agility in their supply chain. In general, indicators at level 4 can affect indicators at level 3, and so on. So that management can start fixing the indicators at level 4 first. In addition, indicators that have a driving power value in MICMAC analysis can be prioritized to improve their performance.</jats:p>"

Refining mixed-stream LIBs into battery-grade materials reduces these environmental intensities by at least 55%. Electricity consumption is identified as the principal contributor to all LIB recycling environmental intensities, and different electricity sources can change greenhouse gas emissions up to eight times. Supply chain steps that precede refinement (material extraction and transport) contribute marginally to the environmental intensities of circular LIB supply chains (&lt;5%), but are more significant in conventional supply chains (31%).

And with the goal of minimizing the sum of fixed costs, transportation costs, purchasing costs, packaging costs, storage costs, processing cost and disposal costs in the supply chain network, the model is validated through two scenarios: fuzzy demand and deterministic demand. The model calculation results indicate that under certain other conditions, the return rate is positively correlated with the total cost; The relationship between utilization rate and total cost may be either positive or negative, influenced by the combined effects of transportation costs and disposal costs in reverse logistics activities; The cost increase and facility selection corresponding to adjacent demand proportion nodes are different.

This study aims to understand the impacts of climate change on water supply systems and to facilitate adaptive actions. A premium database maintained by the Cleveland Water Division, Cleveland, Ohio, USA is analyzed. It contains 29,621 pipe failure records of 51,832 pipes over the past 30 years, representing one of the largest dataset in current literature. From the database, pipe failure rate models have been developed for water pipes made of different types of materials at different ages. The influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on fragility of water pipes are obtained. Based on the developed climate-fragility failure rate models, the impacts of climate change on the water systems located in different geographic regions are evaluated by predicting the failure rate and number of failures in the water systems in the next 80 years (2020 to 2100). Climate models are used to predict weather under different climate change scenarios. The results demonstrate that the impacts of climate change on water supply system are likely complicated and are dependent upon factors such as the geographic location, pipe material, pipe age, and maintenance strategies. Water pipes in the cold regions may experience fewer number breaks due to the warmer weather and less severe winter, whereas those located in the hot regions may experience more failures associated with more corrosion. Different pipe replacement strategies are compared, which demonstrate the importance of considering the aging of water supply system in future maintenance decisions. This study enriches current understandings on the impacts of climate change on the water systems. The results will help water utilities to design climate change adaptation strategies.</jats:p>"

However, it is mainly produced from first‐generation feedstock and there are various inconsistencies in the literature in terms of its production and recycling processes, carbon footprint, and prices. The aim of this study is to compile and contrast these aspects and investigate second‐generation PLA production from technical, economic, and ecological perspectives simultaneously. The comprehensive analyses also show the chances and challenges of originating a PLA supply chain in a specific region. Herein, the German Federal State of North Rhine‐Westphalia (NRW) has been chosen as a region of interest. In addition to highlighting the industrial capabilities and synergies, the study quantifies and illustrates the locations of different suitable second‐generation feedstocks in the region. However, the identified potentials can be challenged by various obstacles such as the high demand of bioresources, feedstock quality, spatial aspects, and logistics. Furthermore, the substantial price gap between PLA and fossil‐based plastics can also discourage the investors to include PLA on their portfolios. Thus, the study also provides recommendations to overcome these obstacles and promote the regional value chains of bioplastics which may serve as prototype for other regions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the western United States, snow accumulation, storage, and ablation affect seasonal runoff. Thus, the prediction of snowmelt is essential to improve the reliability of water supply forecasts to guide water allocation and operational decisions. The current method used at the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC) couples the SNOW-17 temperature-index snow model and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) runoff model in a lumped approach. Limitations in parameter transferability and calibration requirements for changing conditions with the temperature-index model motivated this research, in which new avenues were investigated to assess and prototype the application of an energy-balance snow model in a distributed modeling approach. The Utah Energy Balance (UEB) model was chosen to compare with the SNOW-17 model because it is simple and parsimonious, making it suitable for distributed application with the potential to improve water supply forecasts. Each model was coupled with the SAC-SMA model and the Rutpix7 routing model to simulate basin snowmelt and discharge. All the models were applied on grids over watersheds using the Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) framework. Case studies were implemented for two study sites in the Colorado River basin over a period of two decades. The model performance was evaluated by comparing the model output with observed daily discharge and snow-covered area data obtained from remote sensing sources. Simulated evaporative components of sublimation and evapotranspiration were also evaluated. The results showed that the UEB model, requiring calibration of only a snow drift factor, achieves a comparable performance to the calibrated SNOW-17 model, and both provided reasonable basin snow and discharge simulations in the two study sites. The UEB model had the additional advantage of being able to explicitly simulate sublimation for different land types and thus better quantify evaporative water balance components and their sensitivity to land cover change. UEB also has a better transferability potential because it requires calibration of fewer parameters than SNOW-17. The majority of the parameters for UEB are physically based and regarded as constants characterizing spatially invariant properties of snow processes. Thus, the model remains valid for different climate and terrain conditions for multiple watersheds.</jats:p>"

The experimental area is an excellent site for field crop production, with suitable agrotechnical biological and soil conditions. The trial was established in 1983 by Prof. Dr. J&amp;#225;nos Nagy and has been continued for 39 years with the same parameters, nutrient replenishment system, site, tillage and agrotechnology. The total area of the experiment is more than 1.3 ha, with 1248 plots. The climatic-meteorological conditions of the experimental area are continental and often extreme, with calcareous chernozem soil with a topsoil depth of 80-90 cm and a humus content of 2.71 Hu%. The pH of the soil is 5.76 (slightly acidic). The soil is less susceptible to acidification because the 80-90 cm deep calcareous layer is a good buffer against acidification. In terms of soil acidification, nearly 40 years of high-dosage nitrogen fertilization (300 kg/ha of active ingredient) in the experiment resulted in a pH decrease of only 0.6 units compared to the control.&amp;#160; For this study, nitrogen doses of 0-300 kg/ha were applied at 5 different levels, with a gradual increase in nitrogen and a constant high level of phosphorus and potassium. In a micronutrient uptake effect study of nitrogen fertilisation, it was found that the concentration of zinc, the primary essential micronutrient for maize, was significantly reduced in all crop parts by increasing nitrogen dosage compared to control values. The most significant of these effects was the reduction in stalk zinc concentration in the vegetative parts of the crop, which was at least 39% in all treatments, with the greatest reduction in treatment N4 at 18.61 mg/kg.&amp;#160; In the case of the generative parts of the plant, the zinc content of the grain yield decreased statistically in all treatments, with the greatest negative change in this case also in treatment N4, with a decrease of 39 % (9.14 mg/kg). The iron content responded positively to the increase in nitrogen fertilisation. An increasing trend was measured for all plant parts, which was significant in several cases. Significant increased iron accumulation was observed during the leaf analysis of maize under all fertiliser treatments, with the highest increase of 47 % under the treatment N5. Based on the correlation between copper content and nitrogen supply in plant parts, it was found that increasing nitrogen fertiliser treatments resulted in significant increased concentrations in both maize leaves and cobs, ranging from 5 to 56 % and 8 to 38 %, respectively. The values obtained from stem and grain yield analyses did not show significant changes in effect.</jats:p>"

Moreover, increased transportation costs, labor shortages, and insufficient storage facilities have all led to food loss during the pandemic, and this disruption has affected the logistics in the food value chain. As a result, we examine the food supply chain, which is one of the key industries COVID-19 has detrimentally affected, impacting, indeed, on the entire business process from the supplier all the way to the customer. Retail businesses are thus facing supply issues, which affect consumer behavior by creating stress regarding the availability of food. This has a negative impact on the amount of food that is available as well as its quality, freshness, safety, access to markets, and affordability. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on the United Arab Emirates food distribution systems and how consumer behavior changed in reaction to interruptions in the food supply chain and the food security problem. Hypothesis testing was used in the study’s quantitative methodology to assess consumer behavior, and participants who were consumers were given a descriptive questionnaire to ascertain whether the availability and security of food had been impacted. The study used JASP 0.17.2 software to develop a model of food consumption behavior and to reveal pertinent connections between each construct. Results show that consumer food stress and consumption behavior are directly impacted by food access, food quality and safety, and food pricing. Furthermore, food stress has an impact on how consumers behave when it comes to consumption. Food stress, however, is not significantly influenced by food supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Freshwater availability in coastal areas depends on the withdrawal from tidal rivers and is severely threatened by saltwater intrusion, especially in the dry season. Freshwater availability is associated with natural factors and human activities. Although analyses of freshwater availability under saltwater intrusion is problematic, it has received limited attention in the literature. We propose a new framework, i.e. regulation by avoiding saltwater withdrawal (RASW), where the relationships among saltwater intrusion, upstream streamflow, and water supply are established, using hybrid data-driven method coupling wavelet transform and random forest, and considering data on streamflow, tide, wind, salinity of withdrawal stations, capacities of withdrawal projects and reservoirs, and water demand. RASW contains three phases, i.e. estuary salinity-exceedance simulation, upstream streamflow distribution design, and local water supply security analysis. The method is tested on the water supply for Zhuhai-Macao of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area, South China. Results demonstrate that the salinity-exceedance simulation model using a hybrid data-driven method is quite accurate. The meta-Gaussian copula efficiently simulates the six-dimensional distribution of upstream monthly streamflow and is appropriate for streamflow distribution scenario design. Water supply security benefits greatly from the joint river-reservoir regulation mode. But for a given exceedance frequency of average streamflow, the modes and security situations are diverse, due to various streamflow distributions, i.e. extremely low streamflow and its occurrence time. The proposed framework facilitates integrated decision-making for water supply security in coastal areas. Moreover, the capacities of facilities should be carefully considered according to local conditions, and streamflow distribution design can be utilized as a management tool to regulate water supply system.&amp;#160;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dealing with the effects of urbanization and climate change has become a central task in urban water management. In this paper we present the web-based water distribution system modelling tool EWA, which was developed with the purpose to raise awareness for some of these tasks. We have linked gamification elements with modelling and have involved potential users of the tool into tool-development, following a participatory research approach. In EWA we provide tasks and challenges that have to be fulfilled by the user to guarantee a reliable water supply in future. Therefore, the UI provides a map view where model components can be added, removed, selected and are visualized. Forms are provided to edit selected components. For hydraulic modelling we use Epanet 2.2 (Rossmann, 2020) with OOPNet (Steffelbauer &amp; Fuchs-Hanusch, 2015). Water demand prediction is based on regression models incorporating climate change projections and population development for Austria. To provide an overview of system performance, indicators like the resilience index (Creaco et al.,2016) or the number of unsatisfied nodes are used. The change of these indicators over time is visualized in graphs. To follow a participatory approach, we are testing the usability of the tool with a group of engineers from governmental institutions, water utilities and members of the Game Lab and the Institute of Urban Water Management at TU Graz. In these tests the participants have to fulfil challenges related to a) basics, like editing parameter of an existing hydraulic system and adding new components to the system b) add additional components representing an urban development area and c) simulate and interpret system performance under climate change for different conditions like component failure. Such challenges can be generated by using the &amp;#8220;challenge editor&amp;#8221;, which was created by a master student of the TU Graz Game Lab, mainly to allow quick and flexible adaption of challenges defined by the urban water management team. The usability tests with water engineers have shown that the &amp;#8220;challenge-editor&amp;#8220; is also of interest for staff training at water utilities. Hence, we decided to put more effort in the design of the &amp;#8220;challenge-editor&amp;#8221; in a next step. Further a generation gap in user performance was identified, mainly in context of the time to fulfil the given challenges but also in preferences for structure and appearance of the UI. From this we derived to focus the adaptions of the UI on the feedback from the younger participants which we assumed to be our major target group.Acknowledgements: EWA is funded by the Federal Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry, Regions and Water Management of the Republic of AustriaCreaco, E., Franchini, M., &amp; Todini, E.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is a crucial activity that entails overseeing the movement of materials from the source, throughput, to the end consumer. However, in this endeavour, there are increased instances of uncertainties, i.e., speeds of delivery, flexibility, and environmental factors that affect the services rendered to the end consumer. This drives the concept of supply chain resilience as the ability of an organization to cope with stress from any factors in its environment and manage to maintain functionality in spite of unexpected or disruptive events. The healthcare sector has undergone significant changes over the past decades. Amidst these changes, attaining efficient and effective healthcare service delivery remains a distant prospect for many nations. This study therefore sought to find out the effect of supply chain resilience on service delivery in the public health care sector in the Western Region of Kenya. The hypothesis for the study was that supply chain resilience has no significant influence on service delivery in the public health care sector in the Western Region of Kenya. The study was anchored on two theories: the theory of human service delivery and strategic choice theory. The study adopted a positivist research philosophy and a descriptive survey research design, and the target population was 284 respondents from the four level 5 county hospitals in the western region. Questionnaires were used for data collection and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Data was presented using tables, scree plots, and scatter plots. The study is of value to researchers and academicians, county government authorities, and residents of the four counties. 258 respondents participated in the study, and preliminary data checking, screening, and cleaning were done. Validity and reliability statistics were done, and they indicated that the research instruments were adequate for their purpose. Diagnostic tests were also conducted, and none of the variables violated normality, linearity, homoscedasticity and multicollinearity assumptions. Regression analysis shows that there is a statistically significant relationship between resilience and service delivery (t = 6.115, p&lt;0.05). The null hypothesis was thus rejected. The study recommended that hospitals maintain communication and information sharing with suppliers to enhance collaboration, resilience, and responsiveness in their supply chains. Hospitals should engage in frequent forecasting of demand to ensure that their services are aligned with seasonal changes in demand.</jats:p>"

The nation's warehousing industry is seeing unprecedented expansion due to the ever-increasing demand from this vast populace, which, in contrast to other countries, is statistically superior in the median age of the below-30 age group and their consumption needs across sectors. Also, this sizable population is gravitating more and more towards buying goods and services from suppliers who make a point of publicizing their sustainability activities in storing these goods in light of the mounting damage that people are inflicting on the health of the earth. The widespread use of social media and its built-in advertising capabilities continue to play a significant but growing role in communicating these benefits to the general public. In addition to relying largely on road transport, India's logistics environment is seeing a proliferation of warehouses to support distribution, value-added services, and storage. Even though transportation contributes mainly to the carbon footprint of logistics, warehouses are a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and score well on the sustainability index (SI). Compared to innovations used to reduce emissions in the transportation vertical, green warehousing projects are still in their infancy. As a result, this study analyses the existing situation and sketches out the roadmap required to take advantage of the opportunity to reduce emissions in the Indian warehousing sector while steadfastly retaining economic viability.</jats:p>"

Reinforcement learning with neural networks with embedded quantum circuits is used. In such neural networks, projecting high‐dimensional feature vectors down to smaller vectors is necessary to accommodate restrictions on the number of qubits of NISQ hardware. However, a multi‐head attention mechanism is used where, even in classical machine learning, such projections are natural and desirable.

A preliminary version of the evaluation index system was established through a comprehensive review of literature and panel discussions. Two rounds of expert consultation were conducted using the Delphi method to finalize the indicators and their corresponding weights. The assessment criteria for pharmaceutical supply chain resilience comprises of ten primary indicators and sixty-two secondary indicators. These indicators encompass various facets such as the ability to design the supply chain, reserve resources, integrate processes, collaborate effectively, adopt eco-friendly practices, visualize data, and foster a culture of learning. The outcomes of the consultation conducted with experts reveal that the evaluation index system is reliable, as it demonstrates a significant level of attention, coordination, and authority among the experts. The determination of the weight of each indicator in the system was based on the relative significance of various factors in augmenting the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The development of an evaluation index system offers a systematic approach to evaluate and enhance the resilience of pharmaceutical supply chains, thereby providing a valuable scientific instrument. The results of this study hold potential value for various entities within the pharmaceutical industry, such as pharmaceutical companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Specifically, these findings may aid in the identification and resolution of potential weaknesses within the supply chain, the enhancement of management practices, and the fortification against external disruptions. Prospective investigations may center on the implementation of the assessment index system in practical scenarios, scrutinizing its soundness and dependability, and investigating methods to consistently enhance the robustness of pharmaceutical supply chains.</jats:p>"

We consider a retail context in which contracts with manufacturers are negotiated relatively infrequently and signed before the demand environment is known, and the retail prices are determined when the demand is known. We develop a Stackelberg model to study the retailer's product selection and pricing decisions and the manufacturers' contract design decisions. We show that it is optimal for each manufacturer to offer a contract with nonlinear prices so that total payments are the total production cost plus a fixed additional cost. In the case of two manufacturers this result allows us to characterize an equilibrium in which the retailer's choice maximizes the supply chain profit, each manufacturer makes a profit equal to its marginal contribution to the supply chain, and the retailer takes the remaining profit. We also find that while increasing demand correlation always benefits the retailer, it benefits the manufacturers only when the production costs are convex. In an extension it is found that our equilibrium continues to hold when the retailer's reservation profit is below a threshold, but the competition dynamics may change when the reservation profit is above the threshold. Finally, we show that the equilibrium results remain true for the case with more than two manufacturers under a submodularity property, which holds in the case of quadratic costs and linear demand.</jats:p>",

We demonstrated the key design considerations in terms of traceability in addition to a quality model to consider when designing smart Blockchain-based SC systems. In addition, we proposed an Intelligent Blockchain IoT-enabled fish SC framework that uses DLT for the trackability and traceability of fish products throughout harvesting, processing, packaging, shipping, and distribution to final delivery. More precisely, the proposed framework should be able to provide valuable and timely information that can be used to track and trace the fish product and verify its authenticity throughout the chain.

A special health programme called the SURE-P/MCH programme had both supply and demand interventions and was implemented over 5 years in selected states in Nigeria. The paper adds new knowledge on demand and supply-side determinants of MCH services at the primary healthcare level. It provides information on the factors that affect provision and utilisation and then discusses how they may improve access to MCH services.\nMethods\n This qualitative study was undertaken in Anambra state, southeast Nigeria. Anambra state was purposively chosen because the SURE-P/MCH programme was implemented in the state. The Three-Delay model was used to analyze supply and demand aspects that affect MCH services and improve access to care for pregnant women/mothers and newborns/infants.\nResult\n The findings show that there were problems with both the demand and supply aspects of the programme and both were interlinked. For service users, their delays were connected to the constraints on the supply side.\nConclusion\n There are some issues related to optimal supply and demand for MCH services within the programme that are important for improved programme design and implementation. Addressing the supply constraints would also improve problems with the demand for MCH services.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biomass is an abundant resource for energy production and it has gained attention as a mainstream option to meet increasing energy demands. Pyrolysis has been one of the most prevalent thermochemical processes for biomass conversion. In the pyrolysis process, the biomass decomposes into three byproducts: bio-oil (60–75%), biochar (15–25%), and syngas (10–20%), depending on the feedstock and its composition. The energy required to convert the biomass varies depending on the levels of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. This work proposes a novel two-stage stochastic model that designs an efficient biomass supply chain mindful of the trade-offs between pyrolysis byproducts (bioethanol and biochar). Remarkably, the model integrates biomass quality-related costs associated with moisture and ash content such as the energy consumption of preprocessing equipment and boiler maintenance due to excess ash. Biomass quality directly affects the production yield as well as the total cost of production and distribution. The results from our case study indicate a shortage of biomass from the suppliers to fulfill the demand for biochar from the power plants and bioethanol from the cities. Furthermore, the bioethanol price has the most impact on the total supply chain according to our sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

The rapid increase of forest biofuel market raises questions about sustainability of the supply chains and contribution of the forest biofuel produced in Latvia to the climate change mitigation. Sustainability of forest biofuel is addressed in multiple recent international political initiatives; particularly, the European 2030 climate and energy package and the nature restoration regulation. Climate change mitigation potential of forest biofuel is surrounded by multiple speculations, which have to be addressed by comprehensive evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to production and delivery of forest biofuel. According to the study results, average GHG emissions due to delivery of harvesting residues from the state forests correspond to 1.4 kg CO2 eq GJ-1, including forwarding, comminution and delivery to a 68 km distance. This is significantly less than the default values provided in the regulation (EC) 2018/2001, particularly during the delivery of forest biofuel. GHG emissions due to delivery of forest biofuel from removal of vegetation in abandoned farmlands are 1.9 kg CO2 eq GJ-1, from forest drainage ditches – 1.7 kg CO2 eq GJ-1, from pre-commercial thinning – 2.1 kg CO2 eq GJ-1. Estimation of the GHG emissions is complicated by limited information on some of the sources and productivity. Building of the system for collection of activity data is a crucial task for transparent demonstration of GHG emissions and the effect of applied mitigation measures. </jats:p>",

The current situation is analyzed with a total of 231 components under 11 main headings covering WWM practices. The assessment framework was tested in pilot utilities and the results were discussed. It is observed that the scores of utility I were generally better than those of utilities II and III. The novelty of this assessment framework is to evaluate the current situation of WWM practices with a unique scoring system, to define the weaknesses and strengths in WWM, and to present a roadmap for improvement according to the current situation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Owing to the development of the technologies of Industry 4.0, recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new concept of supply chain management, namely Supply Chain 4.0 (SC 4.0). Huge investments in information technology have enabled manufacturers to trace the intangible flow of information, but instruments are required to take advantage of the available data sources: big data analytics (BDA) and machine learning (ML) represent important tools for this task. Use of advanced technologies can improve supply chain performances and support reaching strategic goals, but their implementation is challenging in supply chain management. The aim of this study was to understand the main benefits, challenges, and areas of application of BDA and ML in SC 4.0 as well as to understand the BDA and ML techniques most commonly used in the field, with a particular focus on nonparametric techniques. To this end, we carried out a literature review. From our analysis, we identified three main gaps, namely, the need for appropriate analytical tools to manage challenging data configurations; the need for a more reliable link with practice; the need for instruments to select the most suitable BDA or ML techniques. As a solution, we suggest and comment on two viable solutions: nonparametric statistics, and sentiment analysis and clustering.</jats:p>"

The result shows a significant direct and indirect effect of information sharing and inventory management practices on firm performance. Generally, the results show that higher information-sharing practices and better inventory management practices lead to greater firm performance; and higher information-sharing leads to improved inventory management, which in turn leads to greater firm performance. Theoretically, the result provides evidence of the effects of information sharing and inventory management on the supply chain practices’ performance in a firm. The managerial implications of the results are enhancing information sharing and inventory management practices by adopting, internalizing, and building information technology into all the business operations to enhance information sharing and inventory management practices to enhance firm performance.</jats:p>"

The experimental protocol consisted of four water treatments utilizing water-saving irrigation techniques: FI (Full Irrigation 100%): irrigation with 100% of crop water requirements. DI (Irrigation 75%): deficit irrigation with the application of 75% of crop water requirements. PRDRight (Irrigation 50% on the right side): Irrigation by partial root drying. PRDLeft (Irrigation 50% on the left side): Irrigation by partial root drying. Simulation of soil water profiles was carried out by the Hydrus-1D model. The soil hydraulic properties were calibrated according to the experimental conditions using an inverse modeling technique. According to the obtained results, simulated soil water profiles were close to those measured. Indeed, the calculated NRMSE values are low, indicating the reliability of Hydrus-1D as a decision support tool to optimize water irrigation management. These results were then used to investigate the effects of a 2 °C temperature increase on soil water loss, and it was determined that the impact was insignificant.</jats:p>",

This study demonstrates that, when considering the life cycle of automobiles, higher levels of vehicle electrification over the next 30 years in Japan would generate higher carbon emissions, preventing the country from meeting carbon reduction and neutrality targets in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In 2020, 2030, and 2050, domestic emissions could decrease to 92.5, 72.9, and 49.6 Mt, respectively, while emission transfers to other countries could reach 12.1 Mt (11.5% of the global carbon footprint), 10.4 Mt (12.5%), and 8.7 Mt (14.9%). The results indicate that even if the widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles could reduce domestic emissions, such emissions might be transferred to foreign countries, and blanket promotion of automobile electrification should be avoided. Instead, governments and the automotive industry should take responsibility for global and whole life-cycle emissions of vehicles, not only domestic tank-to-wheel emissions. These results provide baseline information for use in the recommendation measures and international rules to be adopted by the automobile industry stakeholders and policymakers.</jats:p>",

Dalam proses nya pekerjaan pengecoran di Proyek KAPB Paket II Seksi 3 memiliki beberapa kendala, salah satu yang sangat berdampak bagi progres pengecoran adalah suplai raw material yang masih belum memenuhi target minimum, sehingga diharapkan malalui sistem supply by owner (SBO) dapat meningkatkan produksi beton harian. Adapun metodologi yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah dengan mengumpulkan semua data produksi beton, data penerimaan material per masing-masing jenis kemudian dilakukan analisa perbandingan atas kebutuhan material secara menyeluruh dan jumlah realisasi ketersediaan raw material di batching plant. Berdasarkan hasil analisa dapat diketahui bahwa ditengah keterbatasan suplai material dari PT Waskita Beton Precast, Tbk sistem SBO ini sudah dapat memberikan nilai tambah yang cukup signifikan terhadap ketersediaan raw material untuk produksi beton harian dan juga kewajiban dalam penyelesaian PMN Tahap 1, walaupun dalam analisa perhitungan perbandingan biaya ada deviasi harga dimana apabila produksi dilakukan dengan metode full service lebih murah secara total dibandingkan dengan metode supply by owner (SBO).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the emergent (subaerial) salt diapirs, the salt faces negative buoyancy when extruded to the surface, and flows outward around their vent by gravity spreading. It also faces dissolution and erosion. Salt supply, salt flow, dissolution, and erosion also influence the diapir&amp;#8217;s shape. Although satellite geodesy monitors the surface deformation of the salt-caprock glacier system, the interpretation of the resulting deformation pattern in terms of salt supply, dissolution, and erosion is not straightforward. To overcome these shortcomings, we analyze surface deformation pattern of a fountain-shaped and nearly symmetrical diapir (Finu) within the Zagros Belt of Iran using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI). The PSI data are extracted from the Sentinel-1 SAR images using the Integrated Wide Area Processor (IWAP) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) covering four years from October 2014 to December 2018. The line-of-sight signal from the PSI data is decomposed into the vertical and horizontal deformation signals. Within the diapir, the deformation signal is then spatially correlated with the influencing factors, including local position within the diapir, slope, karstification, and drainage. Along an E-W profile across the diapir, two-dimensional deformation vectors reflect salt supply and spreading; therefore, the magnitude and direction of these vectors are influenced by their local position within the diapir and the slope. There is a slight uplift in the central part of the salt domes with active salt extrusion. The deformation vectors divert outward in the slope direction, and the deformation reaches its maximum magnitude at the upper flanks of the central dome. The deformation decreases in the outer flat plateau regions of the extrusions and continues to decrease in the steep slopes at their lateral terminations. Along the same profile, relatively higher subsidence is detected in areas where sinkholes are abundant. In these regions, salt is removed in the subsurface by dissolution-driven karst development in contrast to areas where the surface drainage system is developed, and fluvial erosion is dominant. In the future, a better understanding of the factors controlling salt spreading around the vent and the impacts of dissolution/erosion mechanisms on the deformation will improve our ability to interpret surface deformation of the salt-caprock system at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.</jats:p>"

The functional scheme of the electric drive according to the CF-AM system is given. The purpose of the study is to develop a mathematical model of a pump unit in variable performance modes with a frequency-controlled electric drive of alternating current to ensure the necessary parameters (pressure, performance) and reliable water supply to consumers in general. The structural diagram of the linearized model of the pumping unit was developed. A comparative evaluation of the simulation results was performed when adjusting the variable productivity by the valve and the speed of the impeller. From the above results of mathematical modelling, it was determined that the application of the developed model allows the regulation of productivity as a function of time using a latch or the speed of rotation of the impeller.</jats:p>"

However, as a complex nonlinear system involving a number of subsystems, the fuel cell system requires multiple variables to be effectively controlled. Oxygen excess ratio (OER) is the key indicator to be controlled to avoid oxygen starvation, which may result in severe performance degradation and life shortage of the fuel cell stack. In this paper, a nonlinear air supply system model integrated with the fuel cell stack voltage model is first built, based on physical laws and empirical data; then, conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controls for the oxygen excess ratio are implemented. On this basis, fuzzy logic inference and neural network algorithm are integrated into the conventional PID controller to tune the gain coefficients, respectively. The simulation results verify that the fuzzy PID controller with seven subsets could clearly improve the dynamic responses of the fuel cells in both constant and variable OER controls, with small overshoots and the fastest settling times of less than 0.2 s.</jats:p>"

We also develop a hybrid algorithm solution to solve the model and design a resilient supply chain network.

A finite capacity material requirement planning (FCMRP) system for a three-stage SC, defined as “3-SC FCMRP,” is presented herein. The system aims to generate feasible production and transportation schedules for the SC based on the manufacturer-managed scheduling concept, which allows the main manufacturer to manage the production schedule by considering the finite capacities of the factory work centers, suppliers, as well as customers. The system is based on a modular design concept that allows each module to be modified easily and independently. Experimental results show that all subsystems have statistically significant effects on the total cost of the SC, and schedules generated by the 3-SC FCMRP system are more realistic than those generated by the FCMRP system for the single or two-stage SC.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Biodiesel is one of the biofuels identified as a complement to conventional fuels. Socially and environmentally, biodiesel has been known to provide benefits for creating new jobs, revitalizing rural areas, and reducing global warming. However, the biodiesel industry often faces various challenges, one of which is uncertainty in decision-making. Uncertainty in the supply chain is considered as one of the greatest challenges to managing and controlling the supply chain. Other types of uncertainty are associated with events that decision-makers cannot predict or control, such as natural disasters, accidents, or artificial disasters. Supply chain complexity and global competition have increased their exposure to disruption. Therefore, reacting appropriately to disruptions is necessary for business continuity. Ultimately, resilience capabilities must be developed to help companies become more resilient than before. This paper identifies and determines the vulnerability and capability factors in the Indonesian biodiesel supply chain. The result shows several vulnerability factors, such as turbulence (price, technological failure, and pandemic), external pressures (policy and regulation), and resource limits (supply, capacity, and land availability), that may affect the resilience of the biodiesel supply chain. Meanwhile, capability factors that can be utilized to reduce these vulnerabilities are flexibility in sourcing, flexibility in order fulfilment, capacity, adaptability, visibility, and collaboration. The practical implications are also described in this paper.</jats:p>",

Determining the crucial risks and improving the supply chain’s resilient capacity based on operation objectives has become important, in order to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of the BMSC. This paper combines quality function deployment (QFD), a multi-criteria decision method (MCDM), and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS); an integrated methodology is developed to achieve efficient design of BMSC resilient strategies (RESs), taking into account both customer requirements (CRs) and risk factors (RFs). A combined weighting method is employed to determine each CR’s importance. A decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is adopted to determine the RFs’ interrelationships. The results obtained with the MCDM are incorporated into QFD to construct a two-stage house of quality (HoQ) model, which transforms CRs into RFs, and then into RESs. The real case of the Guinea–China bauxite import supply chain is studied to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed framework. Research results reveal that the most important CR is ‘stability’. ‘Information sharing asymmetry’, ‘poor ship stability or obsolete equipment performance’, and ‘lack of coordination between shipping and ports’ are the most severe risks impacting the operation of supply chain. Furthermore, ‘constructing strategic alliances’ contributes to alleviating potential risks, optimizing the allocation of resources, and finally, improving the resilience of the BMSC significantly. This paper will help managers to understand how to achieve sustainable development of the supply chain through resilient strategies, and will aid rational decision-making in the management and operation of a resilient BMSC for alleviating risk.</jats:p>"

Secondly, we propose an optimization method for bus operation schedules that respond to passenger needs by optimizing departure time intervals and station schedules for supply–demand balance. The experiments were conducted in Future Science City, Beijing, China. The results show that the bus line’s punctuality rate has increased to 90.53%, while the retention rate for platform passengers and the intersection stop rate have decreased by 36.22% and 60.93%, respectively.

Generally speaking, the production of green products incurs higher additional costs, and thus, their total production costs also increase. In this work, we studied the coordination mechanism, by considering carbon emissions and product green level dependent demand, in which the product green level is related to the random demand. Under the green supply chain buyback contract with the green product R&amp;D cost sharing between the manufacturer and the retailer, both the product green level and the order quantity need to be decided, to maximize the channel profit. In order to coordinate the green supply chain, the manufacturer needs to share both the risk of good salvage and the green product R&amp;D cost with the retailer. We found that both the wholesale price and the buyback price increase in the manufacturer’s proposition of the green product R&amp;D cost, but decrease in the emission reduction efficiency coefficient or carbon trading price. In addition, the product green level, the optimal order quantity and the channel profit increase in the emission reduction efficiency coefficient, but decrease in the R&amp;D cost coefficient of the product green level. Interestingly, we found that if the carbon trading price is low, the manufacturer will set a low product green level, and the product carbon emission trading is a cost for the supply chain. The increment of the carbon trading price leads to a higher cost, such that the channel profit is decreased. However, if the carbon trading price is high, the manufacturer will set a high product green level, and the product carbon emission trading is a revenue for the supply chain. The increment of the carbon trading price leads to a higher revenue, such that the channel profit is increased.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper was to calculate the NPC for an Australian pork supply chain on the basis of the unique characteristics of Australian ingredients. While calculation of NPC is not complex, intimate knowledge of the source of the nutrients and their quality, and interpretation of their human-edible protein fractions is essential if an accurate estimate is to be achieved. The NPC for an Australian pork supply chain was calculated using (a) actual, published or estimated values for human-edible fractions of feedstuffs, (b) the percentage of protein available within raw materials considered to be human edible, (c) recommended amino acid scoring patterns for infants, adolescents and adults, (d) published, and calculated from standard reference nutrient databases, digestible indispensable amino acid scores, (e) carcase yields and carcase composition from published studies, and (f) actual feed formulations, feed volumes and production data from a large Australian pork supply chain. The NPC for the assessed Australian pork supply chain was 3.26. This means the supply chain generates more than three times the human-edible protein it consumes in the process. This NPC is higher than previously published values, largely because of the composition of Australian pig diets, but demonstrates the positive value that livestock production systems make to human food supply. Livestock systems are often targeted as net consumers of vital nutrients such as protein and amino acids and the diversion of these nutrients from human diets. If production systems focus on the utilisation of waste streams, co-products and human-inedible feedstuffs, then they can make a net contribution to human-edible protein supply.</jats:p>"

We construct the Divisia energy index based on Chinese data to test the model predictions. We identify energy supply shocks following the strategy of Kilian ( 2009 ) and obtain impulse responses using the local projection (LP) method proposed by Jordà ( 2005 ).

This paper proposes a multidimensional approach to examining the effective criteria for water supply projects in rural areas of Iran. The study compares alternative methods of project implementation and employs three multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods: analytical hierarchy process (AHP), Fuzzy-AHP, and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The results indicate that, among the five options analyzed, diverting water from the river and constructing temporary storage dams are the highest priorities, while pipeline branching to the nearby city or village is given the lowest priority. The study reveals that environmental and economic criteria are more critical than social-security and technical-management criteria, while negative environmental impacts and the possibility of risk-taking by subversive agents are the most important among the 14 sub-criteria studied.</jats:p>",

The recent climate extremes in California, USA over the past 2012-2022 decade provide a useful case study as one of the largest irrigated agricultural systems which are applicable to other semi-arid areas in the world. We present a framework to gather water supply availability for irrigation in California&amp;#8217;s large and complex water supply system, estimate idle land, potential cropping patterns response and economic costs to irrigated agriculture, downstream food processing sectors and regional economies. Recent groundwater regulation forcing sustainable pumping rates at a local level bring additional challenges to cope with water scarcity. We employ regional water balances which consider diverse water supply portfolios for agriculture, remote sensing, and economic models which estimate profit-maximizing crop response and economic costs of water shortages to agriculture and related sectors. We also discuss data challenges in quantifying ultimate impacts of low precipitation, surface water reserves and groundwater restrictions, in a highly engineered and diversified water supply system. &amp;#160;Estimated impacts on agriculture and regionwide income and employment from the 2012-2016 and the more recent 2019-2022 drought in California are discussed along with insights for short-term response, and longer-term water management, planning and policy.</jats:p>"

Based on the ECC algorithm in the blockchain model, this paper implements an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on elliptic curve mathematical theory to optimize the ECC algorithm. Combining the dynamic variational particle swarm optimization algorithm and the AdaBoost integration algorithm, the DPSO-SVM algorithm is weighted and combined into a strong classifier, and an evaluation model based on AdaBoost-DPSO-SVM is established, and the model is compared with other models. The experimental results show that the data platform based on “blockchain + supply chain finance” can well solve the problem of loss of confidentiality in the process of identifying agricultural products in the agricultural logistics industry. This also shows that through the way of “blockchain + supply chain finance”, it can provide a better development path for the agricultural logistics industry and can truly achieve low-cost commercial communication, i.e. multi-functional integration development.</jats:p>",

Available models normally prioritize the estimation of fine sediment in the field while the contribution of course-grained sediment is simplified or even neglected, especially in areas that require an analysis of hillslope failure events.&amp;#160;Herein, we selected the Upper Llobregat River Basin (Pre-Pyrenees, Spain) as a study area and focus on the 1982 rainstorm, which triggered more than 1000 mass movements. The present investigation aims to allow an assessment of sediment production that focuses on the characterization of coarse sediment source areas from a mountain range.The methodology includes analysis through geomatic methods, field surveys, and historic landslide inventories, followed by an index connectivity calculation to main rivers, morphometric parameters, and triggering factors. Preliminary results of this ongoing study confirm the importance of hillslope processes for the assessment of the sediment budget in mountainous areas. The outcomes will be incorporated into a modular sediment-budget model, which will be calibrated in our study area and tested in other watersheds in the Pyrenees. In addition, the impact of future changes (climate and land use) will be analyzed since extreme weather scenarios strongly affect both the production and transport of sediment in mountainous areas.</jats:p>"

Consistently high energy value in silages was achieved and despite minor differences in silage D-values, feed intake was highest for D1. The differences in energy-corrected milk yield between treatments were limited to an increase for D2 in Exp 2 so that feed energy conversion into milk was decreased with D1.

The main aim of this reverse supply chain model is to maximize the expected profit. The model is designed for single period context where the used multiple products are collected from different collection sites with sorting. The collection sites are assumed to have sufficient returned products where the multiple used products are collected from these collection sites for remanufacturing. It is modeled in three phases, and detailed discussion is being done for the model without sorting, model with sorting at phase one, and model with sorting at both the phases. The maximum expected profit is obtained when the acquisition quantities for each product are equal using nonlinear optimization method.</jats:p>",

Counterfeit drugs are one consequence of such limitations within existing supply chains, which not only has serious adverse impact on human health but also causes severe economic loss to the healthcare industry. Blockchain technology has gained tremendous attention, with an escalating hobby in a plethora of several applications like safe and relaxed healthcare records management. Similarly, blockchain is reforming the traditional healthcare practices to an extra reliable means, in phrases of powerful prognosis and treatment through safe and cosy facts sharing using SHA Hash Generation Algorithm. Within the future, blockchain will be an era that can probably assist in personalized, authentic, and at ease healthcare by means of merging the entire actual-time scientific information of a patient’s fitness and offering it in an up to date cosy healthcare setup. In this paper, we evaluation each the present and modern day trends inside the subject of healthcare with the aid of imposing blockchain as a model. We also talk the packages of blockchain, at the side of the demanding situations confronted and destiny views. The proposed system executed blockchain implementation in distributed computing surroundings and it gives the automated restoration of invalid chain by using Consensus and Mining Algorithm. In this system, we present a Custom blockchain-based approach leveraging smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage for efficient product traceability in the healthcare supply chain. The smart contract guarantees data provenance, eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides a secure, immutable history of transactions to all stakeholders. We present the system architecture and detailed algorithms that govern the working principles of our proposed solution. We perform testing and validation, and present cost and security analysis of the system to evaluate its effectiveness to enhance traceability within pharmaceutical supply chains.</jats:p>"

However, the extent to which functional units/departments integrate within and amongst them and the  effectiveness of the integration is not fully understood. This paper reports the results of a study carried out in three purposively selected large construction organisations that operate at national level, with the aim of assessing the extent of, and the effectiveness of their intra-firm integration.  Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data collected across the three organisations. Findings indicated that every department engaged in internal  integration practices (communication and information sharing, coordination and resource sharing, and organisational relationships) in varying  proportions, and the effectiveness of the practices equally varied amongst the departments. 47% of the departments indicated that the extent of  integration within and between them was high and effective, 22% indicated a moderate level and somewhat effective integration, while 31% indicated  that the extent of their integration was low and ineffective. It is concluded that internal integration, when effectively done within and across functional  units and departments, would enhance the internal operational efficiency and the external integrative capabilities that would increase competitive  performance of organisations.  </jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to theoretically analyse the impact of raw materials and goods from the colonies on the development of the economic sector in European countries. This study analysed a range of scientific sources and materials, and the following scientific methods were used: structural-functional and dialectical methods, synthesis, logical, and comparative analysis, and generalisation. The findings of this study proved that without colonial possessions, Europe would not have been such an influential continent as it is in the modern world. The study showed how the European Union has done a tremendous job and gained the status of a fairly developed and rich association. It was shown that for a long time Europe exploited dependent territories, which made it the most influential union. These territories include countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America. The study proved that the colonies had a special impact on the socio-economic development of not only European countries, but also other countries of the world. The colonial policy pursued by Europe influenced the development of the world economy. The study of the history of European development is ongoing, and therefore this study is of great practical importance for determining how the European economy was formed and developed</jats:p>",

For this goal, a decision support tool, that makes their dimensioning and performs an economic and performance analysis, was used for four different types of buildings: a single-family house, a multifamily building and two service buildings. For each case, distinct scenarios were defined, considering different end-uses of non-potable water, in order to evaluate the performance of the systems using effectiveness and performance indicators. Results show that the effectiveness of “non-potable water consumption” is influenced by two main factors: the final uses considered for non-potable water and the storage volume. In most of the study cases, values of effectiveness (ratio between the volume of non-potable water used and non-potable water demand for the final uses considered) greater than 50% were obtained. In the case of domestic buildings, such as single-family house and multifamily building effectiveness values above 67%, were obtained. And for the case of service buildings, the effectiveness was between 42.8 and 65.6% in one case, and between 12.9 and 93.6% for the other. The best performance of the studied hybrid systems is achieved when the volume of non-potable water used in the building is maximized, resulting in greater savings of potable water. In addition, the larger the fraction of greywater reused, the lower the volume of wastewater produced and sent directly to the sanitation network.</jats:p>",

For this, a model was created that allows you to combine several parameters (specific resistance and electrical conductivity, length, number of cables). We considered the case for removing the signal from one end of the cable.\nPractical significance. It is established that when changing the length of the resistance application and the number of cables, a change in the graph for the undamaged and damaged cable is displayed. The number and row in which the burst occurred were analyzed. In this way, the system that monitors one cable notifies about destruction and makes it possible to prevent it.</jats:p>"

The local government establishes a Regional Drinking Water Company which has responsibility for supplying drinking water at the regency/city level. The coastal city as the object of study manages clean water then transfers under a private company. Due to government restrictions regarding the authority to provide clean water, a technical implementation unit was formed for better solution in clean water services. The new form of institution will be able to make decisions and carry out execution at any time because it is directly under the authority of the government, it can also apply the concept of good governance to support more transparent management. In accordance with the policy, the new institutional form will be able to finance itself, develop the level of service and contribute to regional development as a source of local revenue. However, the institutional transition requires adaptation both from a functional and operational perspective. Through this study, an analysis of the readiness for the transition of institutional forms is carried out to minimize conflicts such the lack of improvement in the quality of drinking water services due to limited government authority, insufficient qualified human resources in water management, and the difficulty of developing drinking water service infrastructure because it still depends on the private sector. The analysis of the structure and human resources associated with clean water service targets also conducted. Institutional strengthening, both regulatory and institutional, is necessary to maximize the roles and functions of the relevant institutions. With a more comprehensive understanding in the preparation of contracts and division of authority, no parties will be aggrieved in the long term.</jats:p>",

And based on the circuit theory, the theoretical derivation is carried out. According to the known power flow results, this method uses the power component theory to track the network power flow forward and backward to construct a single power supply to a single load power supply network. It then scientifically strips out the loss of a single power supply to a single load power supply from the total loss and its complex proportional relationship to the power generation. The derivation process satisfies the classical circuit theory and does not introduce too many assumptions. While ensuring accuracy, it makes up for the lack of physical meaning of the previous network loss calculation methods. It provides a physical basis for formulating more economical scheduling schemes and promoting fair trading in the transmission market. The method is applied to a 7-node distribution network system, and the results confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the model.</jats:p>",

Drought and rapid expansion of agricultural activities are considered to be the main driving factors in the shrinking of the lake. To address this problem, an analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) is important. This research implemented a multi-source satellite image analysis through support vector machine (SVM) for mapping LULC distributions for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. Cellular automata (CA)–Markov was prepared for modeling the future landscape changes for 2030 and 2040. In the last step, the water requirement of agriculture in the catchment area of the Urmia Lake was simulated through the NETWAT model. Through the employed future LULC modeling, it was found that the areas covered by irrigated agriculture and gardens will grow from 1,450 and 395 km2 to 3,600 and 1,650 km2 in 2040, respectively, as deduced from the changes that occurred from 2000 to 2020.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Future water security in Palestine is challenged by the compound effect of water scarcity, operational inefficiencies in water supply infrastructure, and the unstable geo-political setting. Among these factors, water losses represent a major challenge to the environmental sustainability and financial stability of water resources management in the area. The Palestinian Water Authority estimated the amount of non-revenue water (NRW) in the Gaza Strip to approximately 35.7 million cubic meters in 2018. This is equivalent to a direct loss of 37.6% of the total water supplied, further indirectly implying inefficient use of water-related energy and resources to treat and distribute water.Water loss reduction and more sustainable water supply are key priorities in Khan Younis, the second most populated city in the Gaza Strip. Water supply and sanitation services in Khan Younis are managed by the Khan Younis Municipality (KYM). The KYM water distribution system is currently operated with an intermittent water supply scheme based on empirical and expert-based knowledge. The water loss rate in Khan Younis is rather uncertain and different estimates exist. However, the average water consumption from data provided by KYM in early 2021 was estimated to 74.7 liters per capita per day (lcd), which resides in the range recommended by the World Health Organization to meet the basic water needs, while the daily amount of water supplied via the distribution network was on average 99.5 lcd, indicating a NRW rate of approximately 25%.In this work, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing EU funded project &amp;#8220;Gaza H2.0: Innovation and water efficiency&amp;#8221; which aims at promoting efficient and sustainable water supply and demand, along with knowledge transfer to enhance resilience against water scarcity in the Gaza Strip. First, we analyse the gaps between research and practice which emerged in the project while updating the hydraulic model of the KYM water distribution. A rich body of literature highlights that building and calibrating a hydraulic model of a water distribution network is not a straightforward task that depends greatly on available data, calibration techniques, and modeler&amp;#8217;s expertise. This was proven true for building the KYM water distribution network model, as an up-to-date inventory of network components was not available and only limited historical data were recorded. Thus, an extensive surveying campaign was run in 2021 via the installation of 51 pressure sensors logging data with a 1-min frequency throughout the 27 distribution zones in the network. As a result, sufficient measurement data was recorded to perform an initial calibration of the hydraulic model. However, some components of the network remain ungauged. We will thus discuss lesson learned and propose recommendations to enhance hydraulic model calibration for KYM and similar networks. Second, we will describe and discuss the strategies planned and invoked during the Gaza H2.0 project to foster knowledge transfer to and increase involvement from all stakeholders. These actions aim to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the technological solutions proposed in the project, such that they can serve as a starting point to address future climate and infrastructure challenges.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</jats:p>"

A multidisciplinary team of geoscientists and reservoir, production and wells engineers was formed to re-evaluate how to maximise production from the Turrum Field. New seismic data, wireline surveillance, production and surface monitoring parameters were integrated with existing geological models. An enhanced understanding of the Turrum reservoir has emerged with a more informed view of future well work requirements for optimal depletion of the field. The integration of this new information along with enhanced seismic over the greater Turrum area has not only helped to optimise production from the existing wells, it is also supporting efforts to evaluate the potential to fund additional opportunities to optimise production from Turrum, increasing current and future gas supply to the domestic market.

In this paper, the specifications of ports/terminals (infrastructures) are considered in the model as a consequence of the selected LNG carriers. The objective is to determine the optimum size and number of LNG carriers for a particular route by minimizing the unit logistics costs which include shipping costs and required infrastructures (ports and facilities) costs. The proposed approach of this paper is a metaheuristic by using genetic algorithm. The computational results shows that the optimal solution can be achieved in a relatively short period of time and the optimum cuve satisfies the law of deminishing returns.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is noted that as a generalized characteristic of the functional gas generator, which is sensitive to variations in its parameters, it is advisable to use the transfer function, or its analogue - the amplitude-phase frequency characteristic of the gas generator. The amplitude-phase frequency characteristic of the gas generator includes two components - amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics. During the operation of the gas generator, there will be variations in its parameters - transmission coefficient and time constants, due to aging processes and the influence of external factors. Variations in the parameters of the gas generator lead to variations in its amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics. Mathematical models for variations in the frequency characteristics of the gas generator are built and it is shown that their frequency range should be limited by the bandwidth of the gas generator. The upper limit of the bandwidth of the gas generator is determined by the root of the biquadratic algebraic equation. For the typical parameters of the gas generator using a hydroreactive sample based on sodium aluminate, graphical dependences of variations of its amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics are constructed depending on variations of the transmission coefficient, time constants, and frequency. These dependencies are used to determine the parameters of the normal distribution law of variations in the frequency characteristics of the gas generator. In accordance with Lyapunov's rule, a normative law for the distribution of variations in the frequency characteristics of the gas generator is adopted. Due to the symmetry of the distribution of variations in the amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics of the gas generator, their mathematical expectations are equal to zero. Obtaining estimates of the amplitude and phase reliability of the gas generator is carried out using the Laplace function. The argument of this function is the permissible values of the frequency characteristics of the gas generator and their root mean square deviations. It is shown that with probabilities of 0,9973 and 0,9812, the amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics of the gas generator will not differ more than   when it is turned on.\nKeywords: gas generator, reliability, frequency characteristics.</jats:p>",

Instead, this paper theorizes about a specific type of interaction: coup-prevention strategies in nondemocratic regimes and external threats. Through quantitative analyses using the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) and the State Security Forces (SSF) data, we find that “coup-proofing” reduces the probability of alliance formation when potential allies are under high external threat and that this effect is driven by the coup-proofing regime’s reduced capability to defend their allies, rather than the regime’s increased vulnerability to aggression. Furthermore, we find evidence for the interactive relationship at the negotiation stage of alliance formation. Upon entering an alliance, a coup-proofing regime facing a higher level of external threat offers more policy concessions to the ally, whereas an ally under higher threat could make fewer concessions to the coup-proofing regime. Our study highlights the way nondemocratic domestic political institutions can interact with external threat to shape states’ alliance behavior. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Disasters do not follow a predictable timetable. Rapid situational awareness is essential for disaster management. People witnessing a disaster in the same area and beyond often use social media to report, inform, summarize, update, or warn each other. These warnings and recommendations are faster than traditional news and mainstream media. However, due to the massive amount of raw and unfiltered information, the data cannot be managed by humans in time. Automated situational awareness reporting could significantly and sustainably improve disaster management and save lives by quickly filtering, detecting, and summarizing important information. In this work, we aim to provide a novel approach towards automated situational awareness reporting using microblogging data through event detection and summarization. Therefore, we combine an event detection algorithm with different summarization libraries. We test the proposed approach against data from the Russo-Ukrainian war to evaluate its real-time capabilities and determine how many of the events that occurred could be highlighted. The results reveal that the proposed approach can outline significant events. Further research can be carried out to improve short-text summarization and filtering.</jats:p>"

The study allowed for participation from the entire population. \"Food Insecurity andHunger Experience in Post Covid-19 Pandemic Questionnaire (FIHEPCPQ),\" a structured questionnaire,used as the primary tool for data gathering. The validity of the instrument was done by two professionalsfrom the School of Vocational Educations and one from the Faculty of Education, Delta State UniversityAbraka. The internal consistency of the instrument was determined by administering the instrument to twenty(20) lecturers in Alvan Ikoku College of Education Owerri. The data collected were analyzed usingCronbach Alpha Reliability Approach to yield a reliability coefficient value of 0.79. Data were evaluated.using mean and standard deviation. The test of hypotheses was achieved using t-test statistics. The study'sfindings show that there is no discernible difference between the mean ratings of male and female professors'judgments of the impact of the global pandemic on food insecurity and hunger in Delta State, Nigeria, orbetween their opinions of the virus' impact on the state's food supply. Thus, the paper recommended, amongothers, that the school management should increase the rate of food supply available for Lecturers in theColleges of Education in Delta State and that the state government should increase the food distributionchannels to increase the accessibility of food in the state.</jats:p>"

It assumes a controllable function when it is critical to limit property and personal catastrophes and lessen their negative consequences on the natural and social course of events. In emergency decision-making problems, the aggregation method is crucial, especially when there are more competing criteria. Based on these factors, we first introduced some basic concepts about SHFSS, and then we introduced some new aggregation operators such as the spherical hesitant fuzzy soft weighted average, spherical hesitant fuzzy soft ordered weighted average, spherical hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric aggregation, spherical hesitant fuzzy soft ordered weighted geometric aggregation, spherical hesitant fuzzy soft hybrid average, and spherical hesitant fuzzy soft hybrid geometric aggregation operator. The characteristics of these operators are also thoroughly covered. Also, an algorithm is developed within the spherical hesitant fuzzy soft environment. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the Evaluation based on the Distance from Average Solution method in multiple attribute group decision-making with spherical hesitant fuzzy soft averaging operators. And a numerical illustration for “supply of emergency aid in post-flooding the situation” is given to show the accuracy of the mentioned work. Then a comparison between these operators and the EDAS method is also established in order to further highlight the superiority of the established work.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a framework for the design of green contract mechanisms in forestry supply chain management. We assumed that there was an applicant for harvesting timber in a forest, and that the owner tried to evaluate different scenarios to design a green contracting mechanism. We also assumed that the owner of a forest cared about green goals, such as carbon dioxide absorption, in the forest. We regarded the interests of the parties, such as the profit of the applicant as well as the green goals of the forest owner. We used multi-attribute decision-making techniques such as the weighted sum, normalized weighted sum, TOPSIS, and VIKOR to evaluate the various scenarios. In the literature, another approach was taken to solve a similar problem based on multi-objective techniques and the Pareto optimality concept. We compared the outcomes of the determined framework with the outputs of the previously employed methods. The recommended framework can provide more interpretable results since it considers the interests of different sides. The framework can assist businesses in designing contracts that promote sustainable operations and support compliance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>"

It takes into account the peculiarity of the movement of the radius connecting the centers of rotation of the gears with the point of engagement. The dependence of the angular velocity of rotation and the length of the radius on the position of the engagement point due to slipping of the working profiles of the gear teeth are determined. Estimation of the degree of non-uniformity of the supply, in accordance with the obtained model, differs significantly from the traditional ideas about the pulsation of the instantaneous supply in gear hydraulic machines.</jats:p>",

The analysis is based on the example of a grinding machine and its central cooling-supply system. In the first step, an energy-flexibility data model is built for each subsystem, which describes energy flexibility potentials generically. This is then extended to enable combined energy cost-optimal production planning. As a basis for the links between the data model representations, the cold flows between the subsystems are modeled using parameter-estimation methods, which have a mean absolute error of only 2.3 percent, making the subsequent installation of heat meters unnecessary. Based on the presented approach, the results successfully validate the possibility of energy-flexible cost-optimal and sensor-reduced production planning by reducing energy costs by 6.6 percent overall and 1.9 percent per workpiece produced.</jats:p>"

One of the most important operational responsibilities for carrying out SSC operations is the assessment and selection of a supplier. SSC performance indicators are critical for such operations. Current studies consider only partial aspects and do not include the triple bottom lines of sustainability. In this regard, the authors developed a metric that includes environmental, social, and economical indicators concerning supplier evaluation. The Fuzzy-AHP methodology was adopted to capture more consistent results among the indicators. These indicators were determined with a comprehensive literature review and validated by 6 supply chain experts. Analysis was carried out with Fuzzy-AHP to indicate the most critical indicators by calculating those weights. Fuzzy SAW was implemented to validate the results. Relying on the outcomes, social indicators are revealed to be the most important factors in SSCM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food product safety and quality are considered to be of the utmost significance on a global scale. Highly publicized food safety incidents have significantly increased public interest in food traceability, defined as “the ability to track any food, feed, food-producing animal or substance that will be used for consumption, through all stages of production, processing, and distribution” (European Union). The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that governments, producers, and consumers work together to ensure food safety, which calls for the dissemination of pertinent information throughout complex food value networks. Therefore, it is in the best interest of profit-driven businesses to implement information systems for tracking food goods, a significant byproduct of which is the likelihood of increased profitability. This paper aims to explore the ample possibilities for such implementations that are now available thanks to blockchain technology. In particular, the goal is to explore the dynamics of this technology and identify how it helps to create good customer relationships. For this purpose, the case of Lavazza, an important Italian roasted coffee company that has recently introduced a blockchain-tracked product to the market, is analyzed in detail, including all the steps that made the application of the technology possible and how it was finally communicated to the consumer. The case study offers a concrete example that resulted from both stakeholders’ internal need for greater traceability and consumers’ external need for greater transparency regarding the company’s sourcing processes. In this pilot project, collaboration among all the entities that are part of the chain was essential to delivering a formative, customized, and ultimately, easy-to-understand experience to the end consumer. Finally, Lavazza is an example of a company that decided to challenge itself by following a trend that will be increasingly present in future socioeconomic scenarios.</jats:p>"

This study aims to identify the factors that hinder the company's innovation process using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method and classify the model using MICMAC Analysis. The results showed that the ISM model of the barrier factor for the innovation process in the furniture industry supply chain has 6 levels. After the ISM model is obtained, the next process is to classify each variable indicator on the barrier factors of the innovation process with the help of MICMAC analysis. There are 4 classification clusters, the first cluster (autonomous indicators) has one indicator. While in the second cluster (dependent indicators) there is one indicator. In the third cluster (linkage indicators) there are 9 indicators. In the fourth cluster (independent indicators) there is one indicator. The third cluster (linkage indicators) is the highest cluster of indicator spreads where this indicator has high control and dependence. The conclusion of this study is that there are 12 inhibiting factors in the innovation process which are arranged into six levels of the ISM model and in the MICMAC analysis the third cluster is the highest distribution cluster.</jats:p>"

Dalam pengelolaanya timbul permasalahan berkaitan dengan belum optimalnya performa supplier yang mengakibatkan ketidaktepatan jumlah bahan baku yang dipasok ke perusahaan dan sering terjadi keterlambatan pengiriman bahan baku. Permasalahan yang lain adalah belum adanya standar kriteria kualitas bahan baku dan standar harga yang ditetapkan oleh perusahaan sehingga kualitas bahan baku tidak terjamin. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memilih supplier bahan baku kertas terbaik dengan menggunakan model kriteria quality, cost, delivery, flexibility, resposiveness dan membuat model e-supply chain management untuk mempermudah pemilihan supplier secara otomatis. Hasil studi pustaka dan brainstorming dengan perusahaan menghasilkan lima kriteria dan dua belas subkriteria yang dipertimbangkan dalam menentukan supplier terbaik di PT Papertech Indonesia. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) untuk menghitung skala rasio dan bobot masing-masing kriteria dan subkriteria dari supplier. Hasil analisis menunjukkan bahwa supplier Sawah Besar menjadi prioritas pertama dalam pemilihan supplier dengan bobot 0.4483, disusul supplier UD Sregep dengan bobot 0.2123, kemudian supplier Cahyo Kertas dengan bobot 0.2084 dan yang terakhir adalah supplier Fada Indonesia dengan bobot 0.1320. Hasil pembobotan AHP digunakan untuk mendesain model e-supply management. Dengan model pengembangan E-SCM dapat memudahkan bagian purchasing dalam pembelian bahan baku.</jats:p>"

The study adopted PSM-DID as the identification strategy to alleviate the endogenous problem of the model; it found that the supervision policy significantly improved the supply of public goods in villages, and increased the satisfaction of villagers with the village economic base and public social services. There is regional heterogeneity in the improvement effect of policy on public goods supply, which mainly reflects the regions with weak economic development. This policy mainly promotes the optimization of public goods supply by strengthening villagers’ public participation, and promoting the improvement of the current situation of public goods by restraining village cadres’ duty behaviors. It is also found that the coupling of clan power and village formal authority can inhibit the positive effects brought by the policy, and only in areas with strong clan power can the negative effects be mitigated. Moreover, there is an alternative relationship between the assessment pressure of village cadres and the supervision force sent to the countryside, which will form a situation of excessive supervision and inhibit the optimization of village public goods. The conclusion of this paper provides empirical support for the view that “top-down external institutional supervision and bottom-up internal democratic supervision should be effectively integrated” in the theory of village power supervision.</jats:p>"

Digital technology, as a critical enabler of green supply chain management, has been widely considered and recognized by academia and business circles. With the advent of the Industry 4.0 era and the rapid development of digital technology, this emerging field of technology is constantly being updated, and so the academic research in this field is increasing but has yet to reach saturation. We systematically reviewed 144 relevant papers published in the last 14 years. We used qualitative analysis to classify, summarize and analyze the literature in two dimensions (i.e., digital technologies and green supply chain practices). Then, we continued the classification from each dimension. According to the basic characteristics, there are five digital technologies: the Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. The green supply chain is divided into green procurement, green production, green consumption, and green logistics according to the essential practices of the supply chain. This study explores which digital technologies are needed in a green supply chain. The study also discusses how these technologies can reduce the input of resources and energy and the emission of pollutants, finally improving the operating efficiency of the green supply chain, and achieving economic, social, and environmental benefits.</jats:p>"

In fact, the majority of such systems are technically centralized in nature.

Decentralized information sharing can serve several benefits to supply chains. Blockchain is an emerging database technology that facilitates decentralized information sharing.

The next topic up for discussion is the emancipation of individuals and the application of financial technology toward the management of financial risk in supply chains. In the final stage of the development of the computerized risk assessment model, the Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) is optimized, and the effectiveness and efficiency of risk classification are enhanced by introducing a variable penalty factor C. To test the efficacy of the C-FSVM risk assessment model, the Chinese auto sector is used as the study’s object. According to the results of the study, the C-FSVM model has a classification accuracy of 96.35% for the entire sample, 96.45% for credible firms, and 95.34% for default enterprises. The training time of the C-FSVM model is 473.9s, which is far lower than the SVM and FSVM models’ training times of 1631.6s and 1870.2s. In summary, the C-FSVM supply chain financial risk assessment model is effective and has great application value in banking practice.</jats:p>"

Pebble accretion can significantly increase the accretion efficiency and help explain the presence of planets on wide orbits. However, the pebble supply is typically parameterized as a coherent pebble mass flux, sometimes being constant in space and time. Here we solve the dust advection and diffusion within viciously evolving protoplanetary disks to determine the pebble supply self-consistently. The pebbles are then accreted by planetesimals interacting with the gas disk via gas drag and gravitational torque. The pebble supply is variable with space and decays with time quickly, with a pebble flux below 10 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊕</jats:sub> Myr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> after 1 Myr in our models.

By then, planetesimals only capture pebbles about 50 times their mass and as little as 10 times beyond 20 au due to limited pebble supply. Further studies considering multiple dust species in various disk conditions are warranted to fully assess the realistic pebble supply and its influence on planetesimal growth.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a new pulsed power supply approach in which the charging process is resumed after high instantaneous power delivery. Through this, the loss of residual energy in the capacitor was decreased and load turn-on speed and energy efficiency were significantly improved. The proposed structure consists of a buck converter that charges the capacitor using inductor current. A pulse frequency modulation (PFM) technique was used to generate the necessary signals for the buck converter switches, which resulted in controlling the inductor current.

For the operation and management of water transfer, the decision-making of water supply chain under the scenario of economic benefit, producer surplus, and water quality utility should be considered simultaneously. According to the idea of supply chain, this paper regards water transfer operation management as a water supply chain composed of water transfer companies, water supply companies, and consumers. From the perspective of social welfare and water quality utility, a comprehensive optimization and coordination decision model for water transfer is proposed. Taking the South-to-North Water Diversion Project as the research object, the cost-sharing contract is designed, and the Stackelberg game method is used to optimize the decision-making and coordination of the water supply chain. The results show that when the concern coefficient and the cost-sharing ratio are evaluated within a given feasible value region, the profits of both the water transfer company and the water supply company can be improved. The feasible value interval of the concern coefficient decreases with the increase in the cost-bearing proportion. When the concern coefficient increases, the profit of the water transfer company decreases, while profit of the water supply company, water quality, consumer surplus, water quality utility, and utility of the water transfer company increase gradually.

It mainly affects women but also vegans, vegetarians, and athletes and can lead to various clinical pictures. Biofortification of vitamin C-rich vegetables with iron may be one new approach to face this nutritional challenge. However, so far, little is known about the consumer acceptance of iron-biofortified vegetables, particularly in developed countries. To address this issue, a quantitative survey of 1000 consumers in Germany was conducted. The results showed that depending on the type of vegetable, between 54% and 79% of the respondents were interested in iron-biofortified vegetables. Regression analysis showed a relationship between product acceptance, gender, and area of residence. In addition, relationships were found between consumer preferences for enjoyment, sustainability, and naturalness. Compared to functional food and dietary supplements, 77% of respondents would prefer fresh iron-rich vegetables to improve their iron intake. For a market launch, those iron-rich vegetables appear especially promising, which can additionally be advertised with claims for being rich in vitamin C and cultivated in an environmentally friendly way. Consumers were willing to pay EUR 0.10 to EUR 0.20 more for the iron-biofortified vegetables.</jats:p>"

Climate change with expected decreases in averages precipitation values jointly with increases in the frequency of heavy rainfall events does not show a clear pattner to how water resources in karstic aquifers are going to evolve. This work, focused in the Guadalest watershed (province of Alicante, southeast of Spain) assesses the behaviour of four karstic aquifers (the Mela, Beniard&amp;#225;-Polop, Benimantell and Serralla-Aixorta aquifers), whose resources supply urban water consumption for close municipalities. In these aquifers, we estimate groundwater recharge, extractions and their relation within the Exploitation Index (EI) by using the SWAT and SIMPA models, previously calibrated and validated in this watershed, during the period 1980-2016. These groundwater estimations were tested (validated) with field measurements performed by local authorities during the above mentioned period. Thus, in the Mela aquifer an EI of 0.19 was estimated with SWAT and SIMPA while an EI of 0.13 was obtained by local authorities; in the Beniard&amp;#225;-Polop aquifer an EI of 1.43 was estimated while an EI of 1.26 was obtained in the fieldwork; in Benimantell an EI of 0.25 and an EI of 0.22 were estimated and obtained respectively; and finally in the Serralla-Aixorta aquifer an EI of 0.19 and an EI of 0.2 were estimated and obtained respectively. Our results denote that: i) both models simulate correctly groundwater abstractions; ii) assessed aquifers depict a clear reduction of their reserves during the study period which represent an important issue considering that currently groundwater extractions are the unique water source of these populations. Therefore, it will be necessary to design supply strategies for these inhabitants and to carry out them, meeting budget restrictions and avoiding potential water shortages.Keywords: groundwater; SWAT; SIMPA; Exploitation Index; urban water supply; southeast of Spain.</jats:p>"

The research shows that the concentration of supply chain aggravates the overinvestment and underinvestment of enterprises, resulting in inefficient investment of enterprises. This conclusion is still valid after endogenous test and robustness test. Mechanism analysis shows that in the case of excessive investment, supply chain concentration exacerbates corporate financialization, reduces asset specificity, and leads to inefficient investment by enterprises; In the case of insufficient investment, supply chain concentration weakens corporate governance and reduces inventory turnover, leading to inefficient investment for enterprises. This inspires enterprises to increase their corporate governance capabilities, improve supply chain efficiency, promote rational asset allocation, and improve investment efficiency</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Clermont Auvergne M&amp;#233;tropole is an agglomeration of 300,000 inhabitants. Two types of aquifers are exploited for the drinking water supply of this population: the alluvial aquifer of Allier River (70%) and three volcanic water basins located in the Cha&amp;#238;ne des Puys (30%). Recent studies have shown that the quantity of water in the Allier alluvial aquifer decreases drastically during drought periods and that this decrease will amplified in the future due to climate changes (2022 for example). Water managers of Clermont Auvergne Metropole are thus interested in identifying the potential of their volcanic resources to secure the water supply of the population. In this purpose, a multidisciplinary study, using existing data and providing new ones has been projected. This study includes: 1) the use of the geological model previously established by Aumar (2022) at the Cha&amp;#238;ne des Puys scale, that allows to constrain the geometry of aquifers; 2) the acquisition of hydrochemical data that help to better define the functioning of the volcanic watersheds; 3) the measurement of hydrodynamic and meteorological data to better define the terms of the hydrological balance. Natural tracers such as stable water isotopes (18O and 2H) or major and trace elements give information on the origin of those groundwaters (local or remote) and in particular their infiltration zone (average altitudes), their flow paths or the impact of various external processes (environmental or anthropic). Groundwater dating methods (CFC, Tritium) brings a constraint on the residence time of water within the aquifer. Yet, groundwater ages are still unknown in all watersheds of the Cha&amp;#238;ne des Puys, but it remains essential to understand groundwater flow and storage. The coupling between hydrodynamic monitoring, a large panel of hydrochemical tracers and groundwater residence time data associated with a well constrained geological model allows to provide relevant management tools to stakeholders both in terms of quantification and protection of their resources. &amp;#160;</jats:p>"

Food security across time and its quantity dimensions were measured using the food consumption score (FCS). Ordered logit regression showed that FCS was significantly influenced by season, region, and household characteristics such as the head’s education and women’s possession of personal plots. The regional differences were large: Households categorized as having “poor” diets were approximately 1% and 38% in the south and north, respectively. Nutrient adequacy was assessed by converting 24 h dietary recall into nutrient supply and comparing the results to the requirement. While macronutrient balance appeared adequate in the pooled sample, it became unacceptable when the two regions were considered separately. Most micronutrient supplies were insufficient. Cereals were the main nutrient sources, and leaves of crops and potash (additive containing potassium) were also non-negligible for micronutrient supplies. Overall, we found large regional differences in nutrition and food security, indicating that various local contexts must be considered for effective nutritional improvement.</jats:p>"

A descriptive survey was used as a research method. The study population consisted of consumers of Nigeria Bottling Company products in the city of Ibadan. Because of the infinite nature of the population, Godin’s formula was used to determine the sample size of 384 respondents who were randomly selected from the capital city of Ibadan. Primary data for the study were obtained through a survey of respondents. The study used both descriptive and inferential statistics when analyzing data using SPSS version 23. The results showed that supply chain integration has a strong positive impact on performance, with an r value of 0.645 in the hypothesis tested, i.e. an impact of 64.5%. The study concluded that supply chain integration has a significant impact on product performance and therefore recommends that managers at the Nigeria Bottling Company improve their supply chain performance, especially information sharing, to ensure productivity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management can significantly benefit from contemporary technologies. Among these technologies, blockchain is considered suitable for anti-counterfeiting and traceability applications due to its openness, decentralization, anonymity, and other characteristics. This article introduces different types of blockchains and standard algorithms used in blockchain technology and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. To improve the work efficiency of anti-counterfeiting traceability systems in supply chains and reduce their energy consumption, this paper proposes a model based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm of alliance chains. This model uses a credit evaluation system to select the primary node and integrates the weightage to contributors (WtC) algorithm based on the consensus mechanism. This model can reduce the decline in the algorithm success rate while increasing the number of malicious transaction nodes, thereby reducing the computing cost. Additionally, the throughput of the algorithmic system increases rapidly, reaching approximately 680 transactions per second (TPS) in about 120 min after the malicious nodes are eliminated. The throughput rapidly increases as the blacklist mechanism reduces the number of malicious nodes, which improves the system’s fault tolerance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a case study was conducted using data from the anti-counterfeiting traceability system of the real-life supply chain of a food company. The analysis results show that after a period of stable operation of the WtCPBFT algorithm in the proposed model, the overall communication cost of the system was reduced, the throughput and stability were improved, and the fault-tolerant performance of the system was improved. In conclusion, this paper presents a novel model that utilizes the PBFT algorithm of alliance chains and the WtC algorithm to improve the efficiency and security of anti-counterfeiting traceability systems in supply chains. The results of the case study indicate that this model can effectively reduce communication costs, improve throughput and stability, and enhance the fault tolerance of the system.</jats:p>"

Then, using Lyapanov theory, it is proved that the nonlinear feedback controller can reduce the synchronization error to zero in a finite time. The simulation results show that the proposed neural fuzzy controller architecture well controls the synchronization of the two chaotic supply chain networks. In the other part of the simulation, a comparison is made between the performance of the nonlinear controller and the adaptive neural fuzzy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Arid and semi-arid regions such as the Middle East and North Africa are increasingly suffering from water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change and population growth. This trend calls for new strategies for managing water demand and supply to face global changes in social-economic development, water system expansions, and cross-border differences.In this work, we explore the potential to mitigate the existing conflicts over the Nile River Basin, interconnecting water demand and supply using novel technological solutions, such as desalination and aquaponics, combined with traditional uses (i.e., groundwater extraction and water reuse). We analyse the complex dynamics and tradeoffs between energy production and irrigation water supply in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt. We propose innovative portfolios of interventions that combine the coordinated operation of large water dams (i.e., the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance, Merowe, and High Aswan) and the main irrigation diversions with smart water demand management options. Desalination involves the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater, making it suitable for irrigation and other domestic uses. Aquaponics involves the cultivation of fish and plants in a symbiotic environment, with the waste produced by the fish providing nutrients for the plants and the plants purifying the water for the fish. This technology can be an efficient and sustainable way to produce food with very low water consumption.Our approach is used to study current and future tradeoffs, generating solutions that are efficient and resilient to future hydroclimatic and demographic scenarios. We first quantified the impacts of dynamically downscaled and bias-adjusted climate projections for three Representative Concentrated Pathways (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) on the runoffs of the main tributaries of the Nile. We also considered stochastic projections of water demand based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and a strategic model that reallocates crops according to future climatic and demographic scenarios, according to a balanced diet and agricultural intensification strategy to generate a positive impact on food self-sufficiency.Our results show that the Nile River Basin features both strong tradeoffs and synergies across riparian countries, with the irrigation supply in Sudan playing a major role in allocating water between competing sectors. The results show a decrease of up to 20% of the Nile River's runoff and a doubling of the Egyptian municipal demand in the most severe scenario that leads to exacerbating tensions between the three countries. Notably, the potential reduction of the Egyptian water demand through different combinations of aquaponics, desalination, reuse, and groundwater pumping in the Nile Delta, along with a substantial decrease in Sudan irrigation demand through crop reallocation, can contribute to mitigating existing and future conflicts. Further technological improvements are needed for attaining large water demand reductions via soilless agriculture and desalination, which today cannot completely substitute reuse and groundwater contributions, whose high exploitation can induce relevant environmental risks.</jats:p>"

Particularly, little is known about the mediating role of information sharing, uncertainty and transaction frequency on the trust-supply chain performance relationships in the agri-food sector. Based on the transaction cost theory, this study used logistic regression to investigate the mediating role of transaction cost attributes on the trust-supply chain performance relationships.

Analysis was performed using logistic regression in SPSS version 23 and Amos version 23. The results show that, while trust positively influences supply chain performance, information sharing is the only transaction cost attribute that mediates the relationship between trust and supply chain performance. Agribusiness managers, therefore, need to not only renew the effort of sharing accurate and timely information regarding the market's demand for specific volumes and quality of agricultural products and market trends and storage facilities but also utilize the information to become competitive and improve supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

The goal of this research is to identify the internal and external factors that cause high vulnerability to disruption and to investigate how COVID-19 disruption, resilience, and adaptation strategies affect supply chain performance (SCP). The research was conducted using qualitative and quantitative approaches, based on a case study at a pharmaceutical company. Document analysis, observation, and interviews were used to collect research data. The techniques and analytical tools used in this study include value chain analysis for internal factor analysis, PESTLE for external factor analysis, and multiple linear regression using Minitab to measure the relationship between variables. The study's findings indicate that internal and external factors influence a company's vulnerability when the COVID-19 disruption occurs. The COVID-19 disruption has had a negative impact on SCP. SCR, SCRM, SCI, and SCE are all components of resilience that have a positive impact on SCP. This research also shows that adaptation strategies such as intertwining, substitution, and repurposing can reduce the impact of pandemic disruptions on SCP and improve it. This study suggests that additional research be conducted on companies with different uniqueness and business processes in order to develop a more complete theory.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has dramatically increased the volume of drug exchanges and the role of pharmaceutical supply chains in society for providing drugs has become recognized, but one of the most important concerns in this area is trust and confidence to the authenticity of drugs. Developing an accurate system for tracking productions in pharmaceutical supply chains is necessary. These advances can be used for improving the quality of pharmaceutical supply chains. Using IoT, it is possible to track the status of productions in supply chains. Also, blockchain technology can be used for recording and sharing data transparently. So, this integration of IoT and blockchain technology can reduce concerns about the authenticity of drugs and prevent their distribution. Given the important role of medicine for improving the health of society, this chapter explores the role of IoT devices and blockchain in the successful development of pharmaceutical supply chains.</jats:p>",

Currently, the flow models of vortex pump just consider flow rate at the design condition, which results in low efficiency under off-design flow rates in practical engineering. Therefore, the main objective of this article is to build a flow model that takes into account the impact of flow rates. To reveal the flow mechanism of vortex pump, we provide refined flow field simulations for a vortex pump. Performance experiments were conducted to validate the numerical simulation method. The study found that the vortex structure in the non-blade cavity can be regarded as a Rankine-like vortex. The inflow range is limited to the hub diameter (45 mm), smaller than the volute inlet diameter (85 mm). The action radius of the forced vortex gradually decreases from the impeller side to the inlet side. The maximum radius of the forced vortex on the impeller side is determined by the impeller diameter. As the flow rate increases, the action radius of the forced vortex on the inlet side gradually increases, while the axial length of the vortex in the inlet pipe gradually decreases. Based on the study of internal flow, a new flow model is proposed.</jats:p>",

The regular supplier is a low-cost offshore supplier, whereas the expedited supplier is a responsive nearshore supplier. Such dual sourcing inventory systems have been well studied in the literature, mostly being solely evaluated from the buyer’s perspective. Since the buyer’s decisions have an impact on the supply chain profit, we adopt the perspective of the entire supply chain, i.e., by taking the suppliers explicitly into consideration. In addition, we study this system for <jats:italic>general (nonconsecutive) lead times</jats:italic> for which the optimal policy is unknown or very complex. We numerically compare the performance of two different policies in a two-echelon setting: the Dual-Index Policy (DIP) and the Tailored Base-Surge Policy (TBS). From earlier studies we know that when the lead time difference is one period, DIP is optimal from the buyer’s perspective, but not necessarily from the supply chain perspective. On the other hand, when the lead time difference grows to infinity, TBS becomes optimal for the buyer. In this paper, we evaluate the policies numerically (under various conditions) and we show that from <jats:italic>a supply chain perspective</jats:italic>, TBS typically outperforms DIP at a limited lead time difference of a few time periods. Based on data collected from 51 manufacturing firms, the results of our paper imply for many supply chains with a dual sourcing setting that TBS quickly becomes a beneficial policy alternative, especially given its simple and appealing structure.</jats:p>",

In this study, we explored the spatial configuration and structural disparities between TSN and TDN in the complex urban environment of Beijing. By constructing subdistrict-scale TSN and TDN using urban public transportation operation data and mobile phone data, we analyzed the spatial characteristics and structural disparities of these networks from various dimensions, including global indicators, three centralities, and community structure, and measured the current public transportation supply and demand matching pattern in Beijing. Our findings revealed strong structural and geographic heterogeneities of TSN and TDN, with significant traffic supply–demand mismatch being observed in urban areas within the Sixth Ring Road. Moreover, based on the percentage results of supply–demand matching patterns, we identified that the current public transportation supply–demand balance in Beijing is approximately 64%, with around 18% of both excess and shortage of traffic supply. These results provide valuable insights into the structure and functioning of public transportation supply–demand networks for policymakers and urban planners; these can be used to facilitate the development of a sustainable urban transportation system.</jats:p>"

In terms of generation, two generation sections—wind and solar—and a lithium-ion container storage system will be taken into account. With regards to energy consumption, household load curves, determined on the basis of the tariff for residential consumers and modified by a random disturbance, will be taken into account, as well as the processes for charging electric cars with AC chargers, with power outputs ranging between 3.6 and 22 kW. Analyses were carried out for three locations in Poland—the Baltic Sea coast (good wind conditions), the Lublin Uplands (the best insolation in Poland) and the Carpathian foothills (poor wind and insolation conditions). The mathematical and numerical model of the system and the MOPSO (multiobjective particle swarm optimisation) algorithm were implemented in the Matlab environment. The results include Pareto fronts (three optimisation criteria: minimisation of energy storage capacity, minimisation of energy exchanged with the power grid and maximisation of the self-consumption rate) for the indicated locations and three electromobility development scenarios with determined NPVs (net present values) for a 20-year lifetime. The detailed results relate to the inclusion of an additional expert criterion in the form of a coupled payback period of no more than 10 years, a maximum NPV in the last year of operation and a self-consumption rate of at least 80%. The economic calculations take into account the decrease in PV installation capacity as a function of the year of operation, as well as changes in electricity and petrol prices and variations in energy prices at purchase and sale.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapid and even disruptive innovations are needed to make cities fit for the future. The particular challenge will be to transform existing urban spaces in order to increase climate resilience. Along these lines, rainwater harvesting has taken place insufficiently to date, even when Sponge City concepts are implemented. Thus, the concept presented here addresses existing urban neighborhoods and proposes to collect rainwater from nearby rooftops and treat it in decentral treatment units called “City Water Hubs” (CWH) equipped with modular coupled low-energy technologies to produce various customized “City Water” qualities, and store it until it can be used or distributed. A feasibility study with a focus on the campus area at the main building of the Leibniz University of Hannover, the determined rainwater qualities, and the results from investigations with two laboratory test plants provided the basis for the technical design of the pursued concept. The feasibility study showed how sufficient rainwater for irrigation purposes can be made available for the listed large university park even under extreme dry and heat wave conditions. If large portions of the roof area (11,737 m2) of the university’s main building were activated, even in a dry year with only 49.8% of the average precipitation, only 19.8% of the harvested stormwater would be needed for irrigation. The rainwater samples showed TSS concentrations of up to 7.54 mg/L, COD of up to 58.5 mg/L, and NH4 of up to 2.21 mg/L, which was in line with data reported in the literature. The treatment technologies used for the two pilot plants are proven approaches for stormwater treatment and were composed as follows: (1) gravity-driven membrane filtration (GDM) and (2) slow sand filter with integrated activated carbon (AC) layer. The treatment with both (1) and (2) clearly improved the rainwater quality. The GDM reduced turbidity by 90.4% and the Sand/AC filter by 20.4%. With regard to COD, the studies for GDM did not show a clear elimination trend; the Sand/AC filter reduced the COD by 77%. Taken together, decentralized low-energy rainwater treatment can reliably provide quality-assured City Water for any specific use. Regarding the treatment design, GDM is preferable and can be better operated with downstream UV disinfection, which might be needed to reduce the pathogenic load, e.g., for local heat control measures. The research steps presented here will pioneer the development of a city-wide rainwater harvesting infrastructure on the way of establishing stormwater as a resource for a new wing of urban water supply. The presented findings will now result in the implementation of a full-scale CHW on the campus to ensure long-term irrigation of the listed park, relieving the public drinking water supply.</jats:p>"

This work resulted in a decision support system for optimising a biomass supply chain in Portugal, allowing a more efficient operations management, and enhancing the design process. Uncertainty and variability in the biomass supply chain is a critical issue that needs to be considered in the production planning of bioenergy plants. A simulation/optimisation framework was developed to support decision-making, by combining plans generated by a resource allocation optimisation model with the simulation of disruptive wildfire scenarios in the forest biomass supply chain. Different scenarios have been generated to address uncertainty and variability in the quantity and quality of raw materials in the different supply nodes. Computational results show that this simulation/optimisation approach can have a significant impact in the operations efficiency, particularly when disruptions occur closer to the end of the planning horizon. The approach seems to be easily scalable and easy to extend to other sectors.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to identify and analyze IoT applications in the pharmaceutical supply chain agility in the post -COVID -19 era Method: We first review previous studies in appl ications of IoT in pharmaceutical supply chain agility and identified the findings through qualitative content analysis. Then, the identified factors were given to 20 management and information technology experts to confirm and validat e. Results: The resu lts showed that IoT applications on the pharmaceutical supply chain agility in 9 components and 50 indicators. First of all, the most important factor is faster communication with other stakeholders (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers) u sing the IoT in the supply chain . Secondly, the use of IoT for drug production; manufacturers invest in technologies that lead to lower operating costs in the long term, because network devices and sensors do not make mistakes, do not need rest and trainin g, and do not take vacations. Therefore, they increase the agility of the production process and are a reliable and cost -effective alternative for productivity in production. Conclusion: The wide applications of the proposed model indicate the need to cons ider the use of the IoT in the pharmaceutical industry supply chain in order to improve overall supply chain performance and focus on supply chain agility.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Packaging plays an important role in the movement and distribution of products along the supply chain by safely ensuring proper product delivery, achieving economies of scale through standardization, and serving as a selling tool. Packaging presents associated high economic and environmental costs for transportation, picking, handling, storing, and returning products. Considering the high demand for paper and cardboard worldwide and the projected increase during the next decade, there is a latent need to prevent and reduce the possible waste from packaging. The return of cardboard boxes used for packaging to the product suppliers could be a feasible solution to tackle this issue; however, it seems to be a disposable cost that companies assume when delivering products to highly fragmented markets. This research intends to understand the role that nanostores play in affecting whether or not cardboard packages are returned after receiving the products from suppliers and how likely shopkeepers are to support closing the loops in the current supply chain system. A survey with 27 questions related to recycling, reusing, reselling, returning, and waste was designed and applied to three hundred thirty-seven shopkeepers in two stages. The data was analyzed through plot analysis and descriptive statistical methods. The results show that some dynamic drivers and intervention schemes may increase the current returnability rate of packaging (11%) to the level of reuse rates (75% in these small, family-owned retailers). We found that thicker cardboard packages foster reuse and recycling rates. Based on the results, we propose that startups close the gap to trigger returnability and recycling while the government develops regulations to support these initiatives.</jats:p>"

(2) RESEARCH METHOD As a research method, the supply of systematic private construction rental housing and the supply case of elderly housing in major developed countries were first compared and analyzed based on previous research papers and various literature. In addition, various statistical data at home and abroad were used here. (3) RESEARCH FINDINGS As a result of the study, the reason for the sluggish supply of welfare housing for the elderly and the high-priced supply were that the market principle of supply and demand in the elderly housing market has not worked properly. 2. RESULTS As a way to improve and revitalize this, first, it is to classify and define elderly welfare housing defined as facilities into housing type and facility type, and to prepare detailed regulations on the supply, installation, operation, and management of elderly welfare housing. Second, it is to improve the system to guarantee the return of full admission deposits and secure land ownership. Third, the government or local governments supply land cheaply to social welfare corporations, medical care, and religious corporations to improve the profit structure of suppliers, while allowing installation operators to pursue the public interest of welfare for the elderly. Fourth, local governments develop and distribute programs to introduce a facility operation evaluation system, train professional operation managers, and supervise facility operation.</jats:p>",

Based on a dataset of 277 public US firms between 2010 and 2020, a panel quantile model of firm growth showcases that while internal green supply chain capabilities and green political capabilities affect firms' growth performance positively, external green supply chain capabilities are associated with slower growth. Importantly, the results indicate that the positive growth effects of green political capabilities are short‐lived, while those of internal green supply chain capabilities are long‐lived. The study contributes to the sustainability‐oriented dynamic capabilities literature by showing that different capabilities have different implications for firm growth depending on the firm's base performance and the time periods under consideration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Woody biomass is suggested as a substitute for fossil fuels to achieve sustainable development. However, transitioning the land purpose to produce woody biomass entails investment and a tradeoff between wood pellet production and the current utilities created by the land, hindering the willingness of private landowners. To many forest landowners, forest trees and residues considered unprofitable to transport would be left in the forest without other proper use. The wasted woody resources on the land can be a potential source to increase the woody biomass supply. To support the policymakers, logging companies, state agencies, and landowners to better capitalize on these wasted resources, we aimed to identify the characteristics of woody-resource-wasting landowners and examine how to increase their likelihood to contribute to woody-biomass-based energy. By employing Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 707 private landowners in the United States (US), we discovered that landowners being male, having higher income, and being a member of a state/national forestry organization were more likely to waste woody resources. Moreover, woody-resource-wasting landowners perceiving woody-biomass-based energy as a substitution for fossil fuel were more likely to sell wood. In contrast, those perceiving environmental costs over the benefits of woody-biomass-based energy were less likely to sell. These findings can be used as insights for policymakers, logging companies, and state agencies to find an additional supply of woody-biomass-based energy from landowners likely to waste woody resources.</jats:p>"

A network with 1032 m of water distribution pipes and 350 user‐side water meters in Taipei was separated into five zones. The lowest volume of daily water flow occurred between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., with values ranging from 0.004 to 0.785 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/min; these data can be regarded as a minimum value of water leakage in the network at midnight. The volume of water leakage was strongly correlated with observed pressure transients, enabling the measurement of the water leakage in the network, which ranged from 5.76 to 628 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/d. The total water leakage simulated by EPANET was 1.48 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/d in the network. Although this value deviated by 23% from the District Metered Area (DMA) results, both EPANET and DMA tools confirmed that zones 4 and 5 had severe water leakage problems. Simplifying valves and combining neighboring pipes of the same diameter during the EPANET simulation was efficiently tackle water leakage. EPANET allows for quick diagnosis of the water leakage areas, whereas the DMA tool allows for precise measurements of water volume and pressure. The costs of in‐situ diagnosis and EPANET simulation include instruments, labor, and time, and are estimated to be lower than those of the DMA tool. Furthermore, the methodology of this study can reduce the risks of underground working disasters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents an analysis of the influence of power system deviation prediction on the bidding strategy of renewable generation units in spot markets. The optimal bid that a renewable generator makes is subject to the best possible forecast at the time it submits the energy bid to the spot market, which is usually between 12–36 hours in advance of the time of delivery. With these lead times, renewable generators have to assume a significant volume risk in relation to the difference that may occur between the energy finally delivered and the energy previously committed for their participation in the market, since deviations from the committed energy will be valued at the deviations price. In this sense, the analysis carried out in this work shows that the prices of deviations are highly influenced by the energy needs to be raised or lowered by the system at the time of delivery. In other words, in the event that the deviation of the renewable generator goes against the system, the generator will generally have a higher penalty, having to assume the cost of the energy deviation at a price higher than the spot market price. On the other hand, if the plant’s deviation benefits the system, the penalty will be significantly lower (and sometimes even zero). The proposed analysis methodology develops the formulation of the expected benefit of the plant obtained through its participation in the spot market and subsequent settlement of the deviations. This formulation includes the modeling of the effect of the system deviation on the plant’s profits, which allows to satisfactorily identify the influence of the prediction of this variable on the optimal offer strategy. This methodology has been tested for the case of a wind farm operating in the Spanish market. For this purpose, real data of forecasts and final production of the wind farm have been used, as well as real data of the spot market, prices of the balancing service and real deviation of the system, which has allowed to verify in totally realistic conditions the importance of the prediction of the direction of deviation of the system in the optimal bidding. In this way, it will be possible to establish new optimal bidding strategies that focus efforts on advanced prediction techniques for this variable, which will result in greater benefits for wind power plants for their participation in the energy markets. </jats:p>"

Existing empirical analyses are primarily conducted on a regional level, so that findings may depend on the regarded regional level and only provide limited insights into the existence and effects of agglomeration on growth at the firm-level. We use kernel density estimation to avoid the arbitrariness of spatial boundaries and scales, and find that the regional agglomeration patterns vary considerably between different sectors. Our econometric analysis reveals that input supplier and customer densities have a statistically significant effect on firm growth and that the firms’ age plays a crucial role in analyzing agglomeration economies.</jats:p>",

However, increasing urban population and dependence on shallow groundwater systems make it imperative to evaluate the availability and the contamination of these resources, and define new strategies of water exploitation taking into accounts these findings and constrains. This study has been carried out on the shallow groundwaters of Yaounde, central Africa. Based on head slug-in tests, chemical and isotope analyses, we demonstrate the importance of geomorphological and geological settings that constrain hydrogeology, urban occupation and therefore, water exploitation and contamination.&amp;#160; Slug test results show spatial variability of well recovery rates with higher values recorded in the valleys compare to the hills, presenting saturated hydraulic conductivity of 10-6-10-8 m/s. Groundwater evolves from recharge zone as Ca-HCO3 in the hillside lateritic system to discharge zone in the slope/valley colluvium/alluvium system as NaK-NO3. The groundwater composition dominated by silicates/water interaction in the hillside lateritic system, and anthropogenic processes in the slopes and valleys. &amp;#948;15N and &amp;#948;18O of nitrates indicates that nitrate pollution of groundwater is mainly from sewage and human waste. Shallow groundwater in the hillside/new urban district and to a lesser extent slopes should therefore be protected and prioritised for usability and sustainability of the resources while ensuring the abstraction of the deeper part of the shallow aquifer in the valley/central districts due to the presence of denitrification. The proposed conceptual scheme for Yaounde can then be used as a guide in the development, exploitation and management of local wells in hard rocks system of Africa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global warming-induced melting and thawing of the cryosphere are rapidly changing hydrogeomorphic processes and cryospheric hazards in high mountain areas worldwide. These processes and hazards include glacial retreat and collapses, permafrost thaw and associated landslides, rock-ice avalanches, debris flows, and outburst floods from glacier lakes and landslide-dammed lakes. The changing slope instability and extreme flood have accelerated landscape erosion and increased fluvial sediment loads. For example, the rivers in High Mountain Asia are becoming muddier due to increased suspended particulate matters from melting glaciers and thawing permafrost, likely degrading water quality as fine-grained sediment are easily bonded with organic carbon, phosphorus and most heavy metals (e.g., mercury, chromium, arsenic and lead). Importantly, numerous hydropower dams and reservoirs are under construction or planning in high-mountain areas worldwide such as in the Himalaya and Andes. The increasing amounts of mobilized sediment can fill up reservoirs, cause dam failure, and degrade power turbines, threatening the short-term safety and longer-term sustainability of these hydropower systems.In the future, we recommend forward-looking design and maintenance solutions that can help transition towards climate change-resilient high-quality water supply and hydropower systems in high-mountain areas. The specific suggestions include: (i) monitor the climate, glaciers and permafrost, glacial lakes, unstable slopes, discharge and sediment yields to better understand the cascading links between climate change, glacier retreat and hazards; (ii) predict future fluvial sediment loads, water quality and reservoir sedimentation in a changing climate and develop sustainable sediment management solutions; (iii) establish real-time early warning systems and enhance social awareness and drills, especially for in-construction dams to minimize human and infrastructure losses; (iv) enhance transboundary cooperation by establishing data-sharing schemes and adopting joint-operation strategies to better cope with hazards and optimise sediment flushing; and (v) promote the inclusion of indigenous and local knowledge in policy, governance, and management for water quality assessment and dam and reservoir construction.The major results of this study have been published online: Li, D., Lu, X., Walling, D.

Yet, behavioral work withdrawal, e.g., lateness and absenteeism, among frontline logistics employees is an acute challenge, estimated to contribute millions annually in related costs such as overtime or temporary workers. Our work seeks to capture potential causes for these withdrawal behaviors in the logistics supply chain. Extending prior work on regulatory focus theory, we propose that behavioral work withdrawal depends on fit or misfit between leadership behavior and the follower's regulatory focus. Leadership behaviors appealing to opportunities and growth (i.e., inspirational styles) are likely effective at reducing withdrawal for employees high in promotion focus, while behaviors appealing to accuracy and avoiding errors or failure (i.e., management‐by‐exception styles) are likely effective at reducing withdrawal for employees high in prevention focus. We combine survey and archival data to test our moderation hypotheses. Support is found for the fit perspective, confirming that no single leadership behavior is consistently better at reducing withdrawal, yet attentiveness to this perspective is critical as misfit increases withdrawal. These findings can help reduce overtime, employee burnout, and service delays and allow managers to reduce associated costs.</jats:p>",

Detecting UGM in the supply chain is a challenge as the genetic information is not always available. In India, four <jats:italic>Bt</jats:italic> cotton events are approved, whereas several other GM events have been imported for research purposes. Many food derivatives (non‐GM) are being imported from the countries where GM events of food crops are approved so it is necessary to track the unauthorized entry of GM products. Selected consignments or food products need to be checked for GM status for regulatory compliance. In farmers' fields, the chances of unintentional introgression or adventitious presence of transgenes also need to be monitored in a systematic manner. An appropriate strategy needs to be developed to check for UGM in the food and agricultural supply chain. In this article, approaches for UGM detection have been discussed with a focus on application in the Indian context. Detection methods based on the GMO matrix, multiplex PCR, real‐time PCR (qPCR), and loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) could be employed keeping in view the regulatory requirement or practical application. For checking UGM with unknown genetic construct, methods such as next‐generation sequencing (NGS) may be employed.

Many international humanitarian organizations have had to ensure the continuity of their already complex development programs, while addressing their supply chain disruptions linked to the pandemic. Process modularity has frequently been advocated as a strategy to mitigate such disruptions, although empirical evidence regarding its impact on supply chain responsiveness and what moderates this impact is scarce. This exploratory research uses supply chain data analysis, qualitative content analysis, interviews, and a three‐round Delphi study to investigate how Doctors without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières; MSF) and its 151 missions employed process modularity during the Covid‐19 pandemic. Our results show that despite severe disruptions, process modularity—based on a modular architecture, interfaces, and standards—has helped MSF maintain supply chain responsiveness. Specifically, it (1) enabled time‐consuming, nonessential tasks to be skipped, (2) relieved internal and external bottlenecks, and (3) facilitated better allocation and prioritization. Our analyses also put forward eight moderators, structured in three dimensions (visibility, alignment, and resource orchestration), which can affect the impact of process modularity on supply chain responsiveness. We extend the literature on supply chain responsiveness and process modularity by presenting extensive empirical results suggesting that process modularity improves responsiveness in crisis situations, how it does so, and what moderates this impact. Our study thereby highlights the potential of this strategy and provides operationally relevant insights that could help organizations to implement or to review and redesign their process modularity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considering the recent rapid increase of the energy costs for heating commercial greenhouses, solutions for more efficient use of the solar energy are needed. In this study there is investigated application of solar energy for greenhouse heating with a joint equipment, which consists of 8.0 kW solar photovoltaic panels (PV), coupled with a 5.0 kW air-to-water heat pump, 15.0 kW solar collectors (SC), a 10 kWh solar energy accumulator (SEA), and 1600 litre water heat accumulators (WHA). The tests of the joint equipment were made in a 50 m2 experimental greenhouse (EG) in several stages: testing of heat accumulation in the water-based heat tanks, testing of the amount of the solar energy, produced by the photovoltaic panels, used for direct water heating and for the operation of the air-to-water heat pump with and without the solar accumulator; and in the periods with insufficient solar energy directly from the grid. Surplus heat from the system was used to heat the irrigation water or to drive the biomass dryer. The temperatures in various points of the heating system were measured and analysed together with average temperatures and the data about the heat and solar energy. The results of the 2022 study showed that in EG, at the average annual solar intensity of 1227.4 kWh·m-2, 6762.7 kWh of electricity was produced by PV panels, and 12385.2 kWh of heat energy by SC. In the industrial greenhouse (IG), where the total energy consumption during the period, when natural gas was used, was 17.95 m3·m-2 or 163.73 kWh·m-2, causing climate change-promoting gas emissions (GHG) of 30.29 kg CO2·m-2; the experimental greenhouse (EG) emission factor was not detected. We concluded that, without a long–term energy storage system, covering several weeks of heat consumption, the solar energy system should be supplemented with external energy sources to cover the extended periods with insufficient energy supply at the beginning and the end of the vegetation season.</jats:p>",

The sample is designed to be representative of rural and peri-urban grid-electrified regions of each zone. Our surveys collect data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, energy access and supply quality, electrical appliance ownership and usage time, cooking solutions, energy related capabilities, and supply preferences. We encourage academic use of the data presented and suggest three avenues of further research: (1) modelling appliance ownership likelihoods, electricity consumption levels and energy service needs in un-electrified regions; (2) identifying supply-side and demand-side solutions to address high usage of diesel generators; (3) exploring broader issues of multi-dimensional energy access, access to decent living standards and climate vulnerability.</jats:p>"

To accurately simulate the operating conditions of the shore-to-ship power supply system, the simulation model of the ship power system is established completely. According to the characteristics of the inland port, the simulation model of the shore-based power supply system is designed and established. Based on the established simulation model of a low voltage shore-to-ship power supply system, to meet its protection requirements of it, an associated protection method including safety interlock, under-voltage protection, and short-circuit protection is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of the associated protection, power faults are set in the shore-to-ship power supply system, and the action of the associated protection during the fault is analyzed by comparing the voltage and current waveforms of the shore-to-ship power supply system with associated protection and unprotected ones. The results show that the associated protection can effectively detect the power failures of the shore-to-ship power supply systems and take timely protection measures to ensure equipment safety.</jats:p>",

We performed dynamic blood flow (<jats:italic>f</jats:italic>) study that started with 296–444 MBq (8–12 mCi) F-18 FDG injection and lasted for 10 minutes, and glucose metabolism (<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>) imaging one hour later. On each frame, mean activity concentration (AC) values (Bq/mL) were recorded on a spherical volume of interest (VOI) having a volume of ~ 1 cm3 on the hottest voxel of primary tumor (T), across normal breast gland (NG) and ipsilaterally axillary lymph nodes (iLN). Correlations among PET parameters and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (c-erbB2) and Ki67 index were analyzed.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold> T volume (TV) ranged from 1.1 to 85.28 cm3 [median (IR): 6.44 (11.78)].

In the ER positive (ERP) patients, TV and TAC<jats:italic>m</jats:italic> were significantly lower than those of ER negative (ERN) (respectively p = 0.044 and p = 0.041). In patients with two positive Ki-67 indices, iLN-SUVmax was significantly higher than one-positive patients (p = 0.020). There was a negative correlation between NGAC<jats:italic>m</jats:italic> and histological grade of tumor (p = 0.005, r=-0.365).<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold> Being able to examine tumor tissue characteristics such as blood flow and glucose metabolism with a single diagnostic technique and to reveal its relationship with histological parameters can provide a reliable pretherapeutic evaluation in breast cancers.</jats:p>"

Based on the core literature base of Web of Science (WoS), screening 3791 academic publications closely related to supply chain emergency governance as research objects, using visual measurement tools to conduct descriptive statistical analysis and cluster analysis of the literature, summarizing the research on supply chain emergency governance. The results found that the literature in the field of supply chain emergency governance continues to rise, and with the outbreak of the COVID‐19, the number of publications in this field reached a record high in 2021. In the cluster analysis of the literature, supply chain management, blockchain, and emergency response research under the COVID‐19 ranked in the top three research themes. This paper provides a literature review for these three major clusters and summarizes the research on emergency governance under different themes.

The compression process in a single-screw compressor was analyzed with the determination of different inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Considering the misalignment of meshing pairs caused by the offset of the star wheel axis and screw origin, the differential expansion of the vertical meshing pair was further analyzed. The inner ring of the sealing end face, the wall of the inner ring of the bearing at the inlet and outlet ends, and the bottom surface of the bracket were analyzed by different coordinate systems and different constraints, thus facilitating the design and selection of the single screw. The critical point for the design of a steam-type single-screw compressor is an outlet temperature of 350 °C and an outlet volume flow rate of 130 m3/min. At a flow rate of 130 m3/min, when the temperature exceeds 350 °C, the reliability of the compressor is still limited, and the differential expansion of the meshing pair exceeds 0.3 mm. In addition, superheating of steam can be improved by applying a centrifugal compressor with cascade compression and centrifugal compression in conjunction with reflux adjustment at the compression outlet.</jats:p>"

While previous research mainly focused on the perception of domain-specific challenges and risks or has been limited to specific stages in the supply chain, this study aims to determine how stakeholders perceive the importance of past barriers and future risks along European insect supply chains, and to identify the applied risk management strategies. Data were collected from stakeholders across four stages of the supply chain (rearers (n=23), processors (n=8), and insect derived feed (n=14), and food (n=12) producers) through an online survey. In total, 60 different barriers and risks, as well as 20 different risk management strategies, were evaluated. We find that stakeholders across all stages of the supply chain perceived ‘financial, cost and market’ barriers and risks as most important, specifically referring to the lack of financial investments and price and demand uncertainties. In addition, legal restrictions were perceived to constrain upscaling opportunities across all supply chain stages. Worker and food safety barriers were generally perceived as least important. The main risk management strategies across all stages of the supply chain related to investments in technologies enhancing stability of both the quality and the quantity of insects and derived products. Stakeholders were most optimistic about the future reduction of ‘operational’ and ‘financial, cost and market’ risks. To further stimulate upscaling of the sector, we recommend to enhance financing opportunities, and to improve authorisations for the use of different substrates and the production of a wider set of insect-based ingredients for feed and food products.</jats:p>",

Existing approaches either depend on ground-level sensors or satellite photography for ICM, which suffer from high maintenance costs or inadequate precision. Computer vision (CV) has the potential to tackle the limitations by providing a precise and scalable solution based on near-shore cameras and increasingly affordable drones. To explore the potential of CV for ICM, this paper presents a systematic study of salient image features for differentiating typical ice evolvement phases throughout the freeze–thaw cycle. First, ice condition during the freeze–thaw cycle is studied to provide a categoric system of typical ice stages. Second, multiple image feature descriptors are proposed to characterize the distinction between different ice conditions. Finally, with the proposed descriptors as input, two support vector machines (SVMs) are trained to classify the ice condition for automatic ICM. Experiments have been implemented to identify salient features for ice characterization. It was found that the SVMs can achieve 71.9 and 77.3% accuracy for the prediction of ice stage and ice flow strength, respectively. Future research is suggested to develop the research findings into practical solutions for webcams or drone-based automatic ICM.</jats:p>",

This article conducted a systematic review of all available publications from two prominent databases (WoS and Scopus) through PRISMA guidelines to explore the relationship between variables upon which the theoretical framework will be identified. Followed by semi-structured interviews with MSMEs’ eco-system stakeholders to validate the proposed framework using content analysis based on NVivo software. The findings revealed the relationship between SCMPs and CRM objectives through MSMEs’ operational performance, and a set of indicators has been determined for each variable, upon which a theoretical framework has been developed. Moreover, content analysis for interviews validates the key determinants for SCMPs, operational performance, customer satisfaction, and loyalty for MSMEs, upon which a proposed framework has been developed. This research provides a framework that can be used by academics and practitioners to assess the impact of SCMPs on CRM objectives through improving MSMEs’ operational performance and corrective action for MSMEs’ procedures. </jats:p>",

For the power sector, such a transformation means the emergence of so-called prosumers, i.e., agents that both consume and produce electricity. Due to their inflexible VRE output and flexible demand, prosumers will potentially add endogenous net sales with seasonal patterns to the power system. With its vast hydro reservoirs and ample transmission capacity, the Nordic region is seemingly well positioned to cope with such intermittent VRE output. However, the increased requirement for flexibility may be leveraged by incumbent producers to manipulate prices. Via a Nash-Cournot model with a representation of the Nordic region’s spatio-temporal features and reservoir volumes, we examine how hydro producers’ ability to manipulate electricity prices through temporal arbitrage is affected by (i) VRE-enabled prosumers and (ii) the latter plus a high CO<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$_2$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>price. We find that hydro reservoirs could exploit prosumers’ patterns of net sales to conduct temporal arbitrage more effectively, viz., by targeting periods in which prosumers are net buyers (net sellers) to withhold (to “dump”) water.

Hence, in spite of a flexible demand side to complement additional intermittent VRE output, strategic hydro producers may still exacerbate price manipulation in a future power sector via more tailored exercise of market power.</jats:p>",

The study adopts a twofold approach to identify and prioritize the dimensions and sub‐dimensions of supply chain (SC) mapping. At the first stage, through an extensive review of literature, 43 sub‐dimensions of SC mapping were identified. In the second stage, Gray ‐ DEMATEL‐based Analytic Network Process (GDANP) was employed by taking the input from 25 experts selected from Oil and Gas industry of an emerging market. The findings reveal three major dimensions of SC mapping followed by 15 sub‐dimensions. Among the dimensions, upstream mapping contains the highest priority weights, followed by midstream and downstream mapping. The findings suggest a step‐wise strategy to adopt SC mapping where upstream mapping should be given the first priority. The major contribution of this study is to develop a framework for measuring the extent of SC mapping of a firm using GDANP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tomatoes are one of the major productions in Italy. One of the main cultivation areas is the southern plain of Capitanata (Puglia, Southern Italy). However, a series of impacts from cultivation to distribution are connected to this production. Different methodologies have been proposed to evaluate and quantify these impacts from the single product to the supply chain. This work proposes a methodology for assessing environmental sustainability, using the agri-food chain of industrial tomatoes in a specific area of Italy (Puglia) as a case study. The theoretical approach adopted refers to the paradigm of ecological economics, recalling the concept of strong sustainability through the conservation of natural capital and its non-replacement with economic capital. This condition can be assessed through the ecological balance tool by comparing the availability and use of natural capital in economic activities. The aim of this study was to understand the extent of the load generated on the environment, thus evaluating whether the carrying capacity of the agricultural system was able to support the environmental load of the entire supply chain. The results show an overall unsustainability of the entire supply chain with a value of EB = −1911.49 gha. The agricultural phase is the only one to present a positive value EB = +62.99 gha, which fails to compensate for the impacts of the transport (EB = −349.13) and industrial (EB = −1630.96) phases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the sustainability of the tomato food chain using the ecological footprint method. In the agricultural sector, there is a constant search for tools capable of combining economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. In this sense, the ecological footprint methodology provides essential information that can be used by policymakers of different levels to define sustainable development strategies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Halal supply chain management has transformed beyond food and beverage certification. However, extant literature shows that Halal transaction management still has much to improve in terms of transaction permissibility, with the main gap in understanding Halal businesses and their transactions limited to a system that separately defines e-commerce and financial technology data into its IT business environment. This study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of managing Halal transactions and its permissibility analysis through a proposed Halal Supply Chain Management Transactions (HSCMT) model and prototype by applying a business analytic approach to integrate both e-commerce and financial technology data. The study uses literature analysis to ensure the correct structure of the integrated datasets, before modeling the transaction's permissibility and prototyping its analytics into decision-making analytics. The developed HSCMT prototype uses a payment gateway that can be embedded into a Halal SME owners' e-commerce site. This creates a holistic Halal Financial technology (FinTech) transaction permissibility dashboard, increasing the effectiveness of HSCMT for Malaysia Halal SME Owners (MHSO) by an average usability score of 83.67%. Results also indicate that the key basic mechanisms to verify transactional permissibility are the source of the transaction, the use of the transaction, transaction flow, and transaction agreement. Furthermore, its mechanisms must be mapped onto a submodule post-transformation and modeling of the transaction dataset. Further improvements in multisource data points can be further considered, as this research only focuses on local data points from one payment gateway service. This is due to restrictions in data policy when involving overseas supply chain and transaction documentation. This research utilizes available data in business through data management, optimization, mining, and visualization to measure performance and drive a company's growth. The competency of business analytics can be beneficial to Halal SMEs players because it can provide them with insights into the permissibility decision-making process.</jats:p>"

The management of material procurement and logistics may entail participation from several stakeholders. It may be crucial to a project’s success in reconstruction. A reliable supply chain is required to guarantee an appropriate building supply. The supply chain for building materials significantly impacts the course and results of reconstruction after a disaster. This study intends to map the post-disaster restoration process’s formation of the construction supply chain pattern. In order to detect potential issues and disturbances that could contribute to the failure of the post-disaster restoration process, the supply chain pattern for building materials is being mapped. The path of the supply chain for construction materials is undoubtedly significantly impacted by post-disaster environmental circumstances. Because it can impact project prices and timelines, the choice of building material suppliers is crucial in construction supply chain management. During the reconstruction process in disaster-affected areas, this research used qualitative approaches by conducting surveys and questionnaires to gather data and facts.</jats:p>",

Specifically, methodology aims to assess seasonal variations of several parameters (EC, TDS, pH, SO42−, Cl−, Ca2+, Na+, HCO3−, NO3−, PO43− and Mg2+, organic matter, suspended solids, BOD5, COD) from 2007 to 2013 to define the processes controlling the mineralization and pollution of the surface water. The results show high salinization recorded during the periods of heavy precipitation or flooding, due to leaching of dolomitic limestones and evaporitic deposits from the saliferous formations of the surrounding mountains. High concentrations of NO3−, NO2−, NH4+, and organic matter can instead be attributed to the use of fertilizers in agriculture. Moreover, the PCA application shows that salinization (49.92%), anthropogenic pollution (19.38%) and agricultural pollution (12%) are the most significant degradation factors, respectively. The saturation index of carbonates and gypsiferous minerals shows the carbonates precipitate before the gypsiferous minerals, which allowed the chemical elements coming from the dissolution of gypsum and halite to acquire significant contents. In addition, the evolution of biological oxygen demand and organic pollution shows slight pollution of the dam water.</jats:p>",

The authors found as first RG that there are still no mathematical models that could address the generalized trapezoidal fuzzy set (GTFs) based green supply chain performance measurement (GSCPM) multi-level hierarchical index for computing the performance of a production enterprise in % except in the forms of GTF set/scale/crisp value. Next, as the second research gap, the authors identified that a few research articles are published in the extent of degree of similarity approaches. Entire approaches are limited to recognize the weak metrics under assessment of two GTFN sets from experts and also not competent to measure the performance gap of metrics from its ideal value. The objective of research work is turned to overcome the identified two RGs. To fulfill the first RG, the authors first of all proposed the two GTFN set-based mathematical models, which are executed to compute the priority weights and appropriateness ratings (PWsaARs) for 1st level measures from 2nd level PWsaARs of metrics (discarded the requirement of PWsaARs data for 1st level measures from experts). Furthermore, the authors developed GTFN set-based novel fuzzy performance index (NFPI) approach (by combining the crisp as well as fuzzy percentage rule over FPI) to compute the performance in %. To address the second RG, the degree of similarity (DoS) approach is modified by introducing idea of negative and positive ideal solution into DoS (eliminate the need for assessment of two GTFN sets from experts). Next, modified DoS is applied over evaluated FPII (fuzzy performance importance index) to identify the weak and strong metrics and also quantify the GSCP gap of metrics from its ideal value. Eventually, the research work is demonstrated with empirical case research of an automobile parts manufacturing industry.</jats:p>",

Longitudinal 2018 and 2019 data collected from the canteen of a major Italian food production company were analyzed. The results showed that the amount of food lost and wasted has decreased over time, reaping important environmental benefits and illustrating specific differences between the food lost in meal preparation and the food left on employees’ plates. It is therefore important to implement education initiatives and to use digital tools to share food‐related data collected within companies among both employees and kitchen and catering staff in order to raise awareness of their behavioral strengths and weaknesses.

So starting in 2022, the Government must update the regulations governing the energy sector to encourage the implementation of renewable energy. As an archipelagic country, one of the renewable energy potentials is Ocean Renewable Energy (ORE). The contribution of the ORE to Indonesia’s National Energy Mix is almost none. Thus, it is a good chance for the government to give more incentives for implementing ORE, especially in eastern Indonesia where they are abundantly available. Since the infrastructure and supporting facilities there, including industries, are sparse and the supply chain management depends on Java Island, it needs special regulations to speed up the implementation of ORE. This paper studies the supply chain management of the implementation of marine current turbines base on secondary data and the experience of engineers from the National Research and Innovation Agency when they implemented the converter technology of the marine current turbine at Larantuka Strait, Nusa Tenggara Timur. Results In this study, the implementation of ocean current turbines must be integrated with government policies related to maritime connectivity and security because the energy produced is large enough and suitable for execution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Integrated circuits have become more vulnerable to soft errors due to smaller transistor sizes and lower threshold voltage levels. Energy reduction methods make circuits more error‐prone since even the smallest amounts of environmental radiation can cause a bit flip. Furthermore, redundancy‐based error detection and correction methods induce higher costs and area overhead. Thus, several conflicting parameters may need to be considered during embedded system design (e.g., area, performance, energy, and reliability). High‐level synthesis (HLS) is the most practical design step to consider all these parameters as complexity increases at lower levels. HLS can be viewed as a multi‐objective optimization problem of finding a set of Pareto‐optimal designs, allowing designers to choose the ones that best fit the requirements. Moreover, the number of synthesis options superlinearly affects the search space growth, necessitating efficient optimization methods. In this study, we propose simulated annealing (SA)‐based HLS methods for multi‐Vcc application‐specific integrated circuit design, aiming to optimize energy consumption and reliability under the area and latency constraints. Furthermore, we use duplication to improve design reliability as much as the constraints allow. We compared our methods against genetic algorithm (GA)‐based and integer linear programming (ILP)‐based methods and showed their effectiveness in finding optimum or near‐optimum results in a short running time. SA‐based methods achieved up to 21.20% reliability improvement on average and up to 38% energy reduction on average, while preserving the reliability value against the GA‐based metaheuristic counterpart under joint reliability and energy optimization on four HLS benchmarks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The conversion of renewable energy into hydrogen (H2) by power-to-gas technologies involving electrolysis is seen today as a key element in the transition to a sustainable energy sector. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) could be integrated into future green H2 networks as users of oxygen (O2) produced alongside H2 in water electrolysis. In WWTPs, O2 is required for biological treatment steps, e.g., in activated sludge (AS) systems. However, the production costs of electrolysis O2 should be competitive with those of conventional O2 production processes. In this study, mathematical models of a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser (PEME) plant and the WWTP of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2) were used to simulate electrolysis O2 supply to an AS system and estimate net costs of production (NCP) for produced O2 via a techno-economic assessment (TEA). Assuming that produced H2 is sold to a nearby industry, NCPs for O2 were calculated for two different PEME plant dimensions, four alternatives regarding electricity supply and costs, and three sets of assumptions regarding system performance and market conditions. The analyses were performed for 2020 as a reference year and 2030 based on forecasts of relevant data. Results of the dimensioning of the PEME show the O2 demand of a municipal WWTP with an installed capacity of 80,000 population equivalents (PE), such as the one of the BSM2, can be covered for more than 99% of the simulated period by either a 6.4 MW PEME operated for 4073 full load hours or a 4.8 MW PEME operated for 6259 full load hours. Investment costs for the PEME stacks and the operational costs for electricity make up most of the NCP of electrolysis O2. The projected decrease in PEME stack costs and renewable energy prices in favourable market conditions can result in a competitive NCP for electrolysis O2 in 2030. The approach described in this study can be applied to analyse O2 supply to biological wastewater treatment in WWTPs with different characteristics, in processes different from AS, and under different assumptions regarding economic conditions.</jats:p>"

Our research focuses on: (1) formulating an appropriate model for this complex problem; (2) characterizing the structured optimal policy, which can be used to develop effective heuristic policies; and (3) generalizing our studies for more applications. To address these issues, we formulate a discrete‐time finite‐horizon stochastic dynamic program model in which FDE is represented by a world state evolving in accordance with the discrete‐time Markov chain. The supply chain for the fashion product is modeled by a two‐stage tandem production system with a make‐to‐stock (MTS) stage for the fabric and a subsequent MTS stage for finished fashions. In parallel, the supply chain for the basic products is also modeled by a two‐stage tandem production system with a MTS stage for the fabric and a subsequent make‐to‐order (MTO) stage for finished basics. Further, the two supply chains are coupled via the unilateral transshipment of fabric with random transshipment time. By value iteration, we characterize the optimal policy for the single‐product problem with a set of monotone switching surfaces. The results are extended to the multi‐product multi‐supplier case. Further, based on the structure of the optimal policy, we develop a heuristic policy for the multi‐dimensional dynamic program model. From a practice perspective, we demonstrate the value of transshipment and controlled transshipment, analytically and numerically, and therefore justify the establishment of two separate local manufacturing bases in dual supply chains. Additionally, to achieve both quick response and efficiency, we show that the total cost can be reduced significantly if sufficient fabric is prepared just in time (JIT) for in‐season production at the beginning of a season.</jats:p>",

Vertical supply chain coordination in the form of contract-based marketing agreements between producers and export agents/distributors could facilitate increased export. The aim of this study was to investigate the willingness of horticulture producers to participate in export focused contract-based marketing agreements. To achieve this aim, a survey including a discrete choice experiment was conducted. The results from a mixed logit model and a latent class model suggest that there are three clusters of producers: a) the export interested, b) the likely risk averse, and c) those well established in the domestic markets. Only producers in group a) expressed a preference for contract-based export marketing agreements. These producers appear to be younger, already have some export experience, and have a relatively high level of collaboration in their product supply chains. Producers in groups b) and c) expressed an interest in stronger coordination within the domestic retail sector, potentially in the form of contract farming. Prices of produce and potential higher production costs are determinants identified by all producer groups as important for their decision-making about changes to their supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, developing a fully circular supply chain system is costly and time-consuming, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

This study aims to (1) critically validate the hierarchical structure of CSCM for SMEs; (2) identify the causal interrelationships among the attributes; and (3) determine the practical attributes for SME improvement in Indonesia. An approach consisting of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), best worse method (BWM), and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) is designed to fulfill the objectives of this study. The results show the hierarchical structure in CSCM implementation that benefit SMEs through performance improvement gains. Waste management practices and circular product design are causal aspects; in particular, waste management practices support SMEs in building CSCM as an alternative. The criteria to provide practical insights for CSCM in Indonesia are eco-design, sustainable product design, green technology, waste treatment capability, and designing for the environment.\n</jats:p>"

Elevated CO2 decreased the maximum CO2 assimilation rate (Amax), maximum CO2 carboxylation capacity per unit leaf area (Vcmax), and maximum CO2 carboxylation capacity per unit leaf mass (Vcm-m) by 20%, 24%, and 44%, respectively. Meanwhile, it reduced the SPAD value, maximal fluorescence level in the dark-adapted state (Fm), and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm). Moreover, root branches, root number, root dry weight, and nitrogen-use efficiency were further increased in response to elevated CO2 under low nitrogen. When elevated CO2 was applied together with nitrogen nutrients, the Vcm-m and root nitrogen concentration (RNC) declined by 32% and 12%, respectively, but the total root dry weight (TRDW) increased by 88%. If the nitrogen nutrient was individually applied, the TRDW decreased by 16%, while the RNC increased by 21%. When the high temperature was individually applied, the TRDW increased by 104%, but the RNC decreased by 5%. Overall, elevated CO2 exacerbated photosynthetic down-regulation and significantly affected nitrogen redistribution among strawberry organs, reducing leaf nitrogen concentration and accelerating leaf senescence. However, it could increase seed quantity and improve its quality as well. In other words, under nitrogen-deficient conditions, elevated CO2 could improve the survival of offspring via the cost of the mother plant’s growth capacity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The amazingly rapid growth of bamboo shoots requires strong respiration and provides a large amount of energy and intermediate metabolites. Strong aerobic respiration requires a large amount of O2. This raises the following question: What is the source and mechanism of O2 supply to meet aerobic respiration? However, currently, this remains unknown. The underground buds (US), the 2-m-high overground buds (AS), and the 8-m-high growth arrest buds (HS) of bamboo (Phyllostachys prominens) were collected to represent their different stages of growth and development. The fifth bamboo shoot node at each stage was sealed by two membranes, and treated in a polyethylene zip-lock bag filled with air (21% O2 + 79% N2) and nitrogen (100% N2) for 1.5 h. The concentrations of free O2 and CO2 in the shoot cavities in polyethylene zip-lock bags, and the ethanol content in the shoot body before and after treatment were determined. In addition, the photosynthetic rates of the fifth bamboo internodes of 1 y/o, 2 y/o and 3 y/o bamboo in the field were measured. The results indicated that: (1) When treated with air and nitrogen, US, AS and HS mainly exhibited aerobic respiration, and there was almost no anaerobic respiration; (2) When treated with air, 59.66%, 54.47% and 45.84% of the O2 in the aerobic respiration of US, AS and HS came from the polyethylene zip-lock bag, 0.06%, 0.57% and 0.650% came from the shoot cavity, but 40.28%, 44.96% and 53.51% of the O2 was of an unknown source; (3) Treated by nitrogen, 0.19%, 4.71% and 4.79% of O2 in aerobic respiration of US, AS and HS came from shoot cavity, while the other 99.808%, 95.290% and 95.21% of O2 came from unknown sources; and (4) The photosynthesis of the fifth internodes of 1 y/o, 2 y/o and 3 y/o bamboo generated little oxygen that could not absolutely meet the huge O2 supply for aerobic respiration. It was concluded that the respiration of P. prominens shoots in its different growth and development stages was dominated by aerobic respiration. O2 supply pathways were mainly via the sheath stomata; however, there was little absorption from dissolved O2 in the soil water and little supply produced by shoot/stem photosynthesis. It was found that the large supply of oxygen in the aerobic respiration of bamboo shoots and young bamboo was of an unknown source under air treatment and nitrogen treatment, i.e., 40.28%–53.51% and 95.21%–99.81% of oxygen in the aerobic respiration of bamboo shoots and young bamboo was of unknown origin, respectively. Therefore, we proposed that bamboo shoots may exhibit the phenomenon of acting as an “oxygen sink”, which can provide a large amount of O2 from unknown sources to ensure the rapid growth of bamboo shoots and young bamboo.</jats:p>"

We do so by advancing an analytical framework that conceptualizes FCA and identify important contextual conditions that help to explain accountability dynamics. Applying this framework, we show that the drafting, implementation, and enforcement of such regulations are highly political processes, wherein competing ideas embedded within unequal actor constellations and institutional environments shape the possibilities to achieve more transformative change.

However, with the increasing water demand and frequent extreme droughts, numerous rivers worldwide go through periods of water scarcity and water ecosystem deterioration to varying degrees. Balancing the water supply and ecological flow of the dam-regulated river network is essential in the context of river restoration. In this study, we proposed a hydrodynamic and water quality model of a dam-regulated river network balancing water supply and ecological flow using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). A section of Jinjiang watershed located in the southwestern of China was chosen as the study area. Firstly, the model was calibrated and validated. By comparing the simulated values with the measured values, the statistical analysis results showed that the relative root mean-squared error (RRMSE) values of water level, COD and NH3-N were 5.5–8.1%, 23.6% and 28.4%, respectively, indicating an adequate degree of agreement between simulation and observation. Based on the established model, dam operation schemes under a dry hydrologic scenario and emergency contamination scenario were formulated to ensure the requirement of ecological water flow and water quality simultaneously. For the dry hydrologic scenario, the ecological water requirement could be satisfied through the dam operation. However, in an emergency contamination scenario, regional water quality requirements cannot be met through dam operation. The dam operation only plays a role in controlling the scope of pollution. This study is expected to provide scientific support for dam-regulated river network management and downstream river ecosystem protection.</jats:p>"

To investigate this question, we analyse the CSO sector in Iraq, which transformed since 2003 from being implicitly banned to being a central pillar of poverty alleviation and social service provision with thousands of formally registered organizations. Using OLS regression analysis with district level and official register data, we examine the geographic distribution of CSOs in relation to poverty levels in Iraq. We find no significant confirmation for demand side drivers that social service providing CSOs form in high poverty districts. Instead, we find strong support for CSO formation in governorate administrative centres, which confirms supply‐side drivers of CSO development.

The quality choice for different channels poses a great challenge to the suppliers, which also bears implications for the online retailer's choice between the reselling format and the agency format. This paper uses a game‐theoretic model to investigate the interaction between the supplier's quality differentiation strategy and the online retailer's selling format choice in dual‐channel supply chains. Different from the previous literature, we endogenize the supplier's quality decisions and find that the supplier always chooses to sell the high‐quality product through the direct channel and sell the low‐quality product through the online retailer. Moreover, compared with the reselling format, the quality level of the low‐quality product is reduced but that of the high‐quality product is lightly increased under the agency format. The intuition is that the supplier tends to highlight the advantage of each channel to acquire more profit. Regardless of the supplier's choice, the online retailer always prefers the agency format. We further extend our model in several important directions, which lend robustness to our core insights.</jats:p>",

Households often deal with the issue by adopting various coping strategies that are representative of economic decentralization (e.g., using private wells, sourcing from third‐party vendors) and political decentralization (e.g., making petitions to a public provider). There is growing interest in these user‐level decentralized coping strategies, but their relative effects on provider's behavior and the long‐term sustainability of public water supply remain unclear. This puzzle has not been tackled using an experimental approach. This study reports a controlled behavioral experiment conducted to test the relative effectiveness of different coping strategies on infrastructure quality and users‐provider cooperation in the context of agricultural water supply. We tested experimental treatments involving two classes of coping strategies: <jats:italic>exit</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>voice</jats:italic>. The exit option represents users' shift to an alternative water source. The voice option represents users' direct effort to influence a public irrigation service provider. We recruited 272 human subjects into our 4‐player experiment (one provider and three users) and observed and compared their decisions under four treatments (exit, voice, their combination, and no options). The results show that the voice option leads to improved outcomes compared to other choices that include the exit option, suggesting that contrary to previously thought, the exit option can be detrimental to users‐provider cooperation. We also observed that a user tends to cooperate more (pay and use the public service) when other users do the same.</jats:p>",

To achieve a flexible bandwidth from 0.2 to 10 kHz without additional power consumption, a programmable Miller compensation technique was proposed and used in the CCIA. By using a Squeezed inverter amplifier (SQI) that employs a 0.2-V supply, the proposed CCIA addresses the primary noise source in the first stage, resulting in high noise power efficiency. The proposed CCIA is designed using a 0.18 µm CMOS technology process and has a chip area of 0.083 mm2. With a power consumption of 0.47 µW at 0.2 and 0.8 V supply, the proposed amplifier architecture achieves a thermal noise of 28 nV/√Hz, an input-related noise (IRN) of 0.9 µVrms, a closed-loop gain (AV) of 40 dB, a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of 87.6 dB, and a common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 117.7 dB according to post-simulation data. The proposed CCIA achieves a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 1.47 and a power efficiency factor (PEF) of 0.56, which allows comparison with the latest research results.</jats:p>"

To tackle the challenge of reducing world carbon emissions, alternative technologies for the automobile industry are widely researched. The automotive industry has started to shift from Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs), where EVs are the future of the automotive industry in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. EV manufacturers are continuously looking for opportunities to optimize the supply chain processes, aiming for supply chain resilience.  In this study, we present an Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) to achieve the best decision, which is an extension of the traditional Vehicle routing problem (VRP) which in particular finding the shortest route for electric vehicles. The objective function is to find the best travel route that minimizes travel distance. Each route serves a set of customer nodes that starts and ends at a given depot node. We take battery capacity and charging stations as the constraints. In addition, the use of homogenous fleets and single depot are considered in this paper. A hybrid metaheuristic approach is used to find the best solution with the Adaptive Simulated Annealing algorithm. The use of adaptive in simulated annealing generates a higher probability of finding the best operators, which results in better solutions. A comparison of results from various metaheuristic methods is also presented in this paper to get the best method for the EVRP based on a benchmark dataset. This paper ends with recommendations for creating a routing plan that is resilient to disruptions to distribution.</jats:p>",

The aim of the current experiment was to study the effects of abomasal infusion of increasing amount of linseed oil (L-oil) on plasma distribution of α-linolenic acid (α-LA) and its transfer efficiency into milk fat. Five rumen-fistulated Holstein cows were randomly distributed in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Abomasal infusion of L-oil (55.9% α-LA) was performed at the rate of 0, 75, 150, 300, and 600 ml/d. Concentrations of α-LA increased quadratically in TAG, PL, and CE; a less steep slope was observed with an inflexion at an infusion rate of 300 ml L-oil per day. The increase in plasma concentration of α-LA was of a lower magnitude in CE as compared with the other two fractions, resulting in a quadratic decrease in relative proportion of this FA circulating as CE. The transfer efficiency into milk fat increased from 0 to 150 ml L-oil infused, and a plateau was maintained thereafter with greater levels of infusion (quadratic response). This pattern resembles the quadratic response of the relative proportion of α-LA circulating as TAG, and the relative concentration of this FA in TAG. Increasing the postruminal supply of α-LA partly overcame the segregation mechanism of absorbed polyunsaturated FA in different plasma lipid classes. Proportionately more α-LA was then esterified as TAG, at the expense of CE, increasing its efficiency of transfer into milk fat. This mechanism appears to be surpassed in its turn when L-oil infusion was increased over 150 ml/d. Nevertheless, the yield of α-LA in milk fat continued to increase, but at a slower rate at the highest levels of infusion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the electroslag remelting (ESR) process, low‐frequency power supply can significantly reduce power consumption and achieve three‐phase balance of power supply. Therefore, a transient coupling model of fluid flow, heat transfer, and component transport in the ESR process, which is coupled to the electromagnetic field calculated using Maxwell 3D software, is established to study the influence of low‐frequency power supply on desulfurization. When a 50 Hz power supply is used, a skin effect is observed in the metal, and the direction of the Lorentz force at the slag/metal interface changes. However, this effect becomes less pronounced with decreasing current frequency. Sulfur is mainly transferred at the electrode tip, and the desulfurization rate is approximately 50%. Electrochemical reactions mainly occur at the electrode tip/slag interface and the metal pool/slag interface. The removal rate of sulfur using direct current (DC) power supply is less than that using an alternating current power supply. The DC reverse polarity power supply leads to higher desulfurization rate than DC straight polarity, which is 74% and 31%, respectively. The sulfur removal rate increases from 81.37% to 84.59% as the frequency decreases from 50 to 2 Hz because of the longer electrochemical reaction time at this lower frequency.</jats:p>",

Plasma glucose concentration and oral glucose absorption were decreased despite an increased electrogenic phlorizin sensitive transepithelial transport of glucose in infected calves. No difference in the gene or protein abundance of glucose transporters, but an enrichment of glucose transporter 2 in the brush border was observed in the infected calves. Furthermore, the mRNA for enzymes of the glycolysis pathway was increased indicating enhanced glucose oxidation in the infected gut. In summary, <jats:italic>C. parvum</jats:italic> infection modulates intestinal epithelial glucose absorption and metabolism.

Backup power in buildings is usually provided with diesel generators (DGs). In this study, the use of a hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) power supply backup system is studied. Its operation is compared to a DG and a techno-economic analysis of the latter’s replacement with an HFC is conducted by calculating relevant key performance indicators (KPIs). The developed approach is presented in a case study on a school building in Greece. Based on the school’s electricity loads, which are calculated with a dynamic energy simulation and power shortages scenarios, the backup system’s characteristics are defined, and the relevant KPIs are calculated. It was found that the HFC system can reduce the annual CO2 emissions by up to 400 kg and has a lower annual operation cost than a DG. However, due to its high investment cost, its levelized cost of electricity is higher, and the replacement of an existing DG is unviable in the current market situation. The techno-economic study reveals that subsidies of around 58–89% are required to foster the deployment of HFC backup systems in buildings.</jats:p>"

Revealing the mechanism behind the forage supply–demand relationship and balancing forage supply and demand is essential in pastoral socio-ecological systems. Taking Altay Prefecture as the case study, this study quantified the dynamics of natural forage supply, artificial supplemental forage, and forage demand. The ratio of forage supply to demand was calculated in the traditional grazing scenario and the grazing prohibition and supplemental feeding scenario. The results showed that during 2001–2018, the forage supplied by natural grasslands fluctuated, with the highest and lowest values in 2013 and 2008, respectively. The artificial supplemental forage increased at a higher rate in 2011–2018 than in 2001–2010. The overall trend of forage demand was upward, at approximately 2.98 × 104 t/a. The ratio of forage supply to demand decreased in the traditional scenario with an average value of 0.4717 and increased in the grazing prohibition and supplemental feeding scenario with an average value of 0.8289. The influencing factors were analyzed from the perspective of the interactions between the socio-ecological system elements, and the forage supply–demand relationships were conceptualized based on the social–ecological system framework. This study concludes that natural grasslands cannot entirely meet the increasing forage demand without artificial supplemental forage. The increasing artificial supplemental forage has promoted a balance between forage supply and demand, indicating an optimized grassland utilization pattern. The factors that affect forage supply–demand relationships are interrelated, and a holistic perspective should be adopted when implementing management measures.</jats:p>"

Objective: To develop approaches to ranking territories of the Russian Federation based on indicators characterizing the state of drinking water supply and identifying health risk areas. \nMaterials and methods: We have analyzed tap water quality indicators and characteristics of water supply systems in 15 regions of the Russian Federation included in the Arctic zone and the Northwestern Federal District based on data retrieved from the Federal Statistical Observation Form 18 “Information on the sanitary condition in the region” for 2021. A discriminant and correlation analysis were performed to verify the correctness of area classification. \nResults: We ranked the study regions based on 31 tap water quality indicators. The results of the discriminant analysis showed that six regions (Novgorod Region, Republic of Karelia, Arkhangelsk Region, Nenets Autonomous Area, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Chukotka Autonomous Area) were risk areas, 93.3 % of the original grouped observations were classified correctly. Poor chemical indicators of tap water quality in rural areas made a significant contribution to the classification of the regions as risk territories. \nDiscussion: The selected quality indicators of drinking water supply are appropriate and sufficient for the regional level thanks to their universality for all territories. This fact is also confirmed by a strong statistical inverse correlation between the proportion of the population provided with quality tap water from centralized water supply systems and the calculated total score characterizing the state of drinking water supply. \nConclusions: The study proved correctness of the choice of indicators characterizing the quality of drinking water supply for the classification of regions. Ranking of territories will allow developing management solutions to improve the quality of drinking water and identify regions that need priority measures aimed at preserving health of the population.</jats:p>",

This study builds a Stackelberg game model for an e-commerce closed-loop supply chain (ECLSC) under different sales cooperation modes between a manufacturer of electrical and electronic products and an e-commerce platform. Reverse induction is used to obtain the optimal decision-making and profit of the ECLSC under three sales cooperation modes, considering the influence of environmental effects on optimal decision and objective functions. The results show the following: the sales cooperation mode and environmental cost do not affect the WEEE recovery prices of manufacturers and e-commerce platforms, nor do they affect government subsidy standards for dismantling WEEEs; they are, however, positively correlated with environmental benefits. Furthermore, the wholesale and retail prices of electrical and electronic products under different sales cooperation modes are related to sales cooperation modes and environmental costs. Moreover, the processing fees imposed on the manufacturers are related to the environmental costs of the electrical and electronic products; the thresholds of environmental costs of products for government to levy processing fees are different under different sales cooperation modes. Finally, the environmental cost of products required by the government’s levying of processing fees are the lowest under a hybrid model. Generally speaking, under WEEE regulations, governments should levy more processing fees for electrical and electronic products with higher environmental costs. Meanwhile, increased environmental benefits will always increase the profits of supply chain members, but increased environmental costs do not always reduce the profits of supply chain members, and multichannel product sales do not always generate profits for manufacturers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The spread of globalization, and then the pandemic associated with COVID19, the beginning of ITS led to the need to revise the landscape of competition in national and global markets. The focus of researchers’ attention has shifted from the competitive interaction of individual firms to the rivalry between supply chains. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which structure of the supply chain is the most preferable for each of its participants. The article examines the economic behavior of a focus firm in relation to other participants in the supply chain. Three situations are analyzed. The first involves the fully autonomous functioning of all participants in the chain. The second is that the dominant firm integrates with the seller (integration forward), and the third – with the supplier (integration backward). The paper evaluates the strategies of a focus firm in the supply chain based on profit analysis. A formalized model is proposed that allows analyzing the incentives for the integration of a focus firm with other participants in various variants of the chain organization and assessing the conditions in which the supplier and the end seller will be motivated to cooperate. The value of the profit of the supplier and seller is also analyzed, representing the extreme links of the chain in the case when they will be more inclined to autonomous functioning. The methodological basis of the research is a combination of the paradigm of the theory of industrial markets, economic theory and supply chain management. The scientific novelty of the research is an original approach to considering the supply chain as a system focused on the market function of demand, i.e. the activities of all participants in the chain are configured to produce and sell such a volume of goods for which demand is presented. The supply chain is also considered from the perspective of optimizing its structure and motivating partners to cooperate based on an analysis of the profits of each participant. The proposed approach allows us to compare the results of the functioning of firms in the supply chain from the standpoint of the theory of industry markets and economic theory, which goes beyond logistics or strategic management.</jats:p>",

The ability to understand and predict coarse-sediment transport in torrent catchments is a key element for the protection against and prevention of the associated hazards. In this study, we collected data describing sediment supply at 99 torrential catchments in the northern French Alps. The sample covers a wide range of geomorphic activity: from torrents experiencing debris flows every few years to fully forested catchments exporting small bed load volumes every decade. These catchments have long records of past events and sediment supply to debris basins. The mean annual, the 10-year return period and the reference volume (i.e., the 100-year return level or the largest observed volume) of sediment supply were derived for the studied torrents. We examined the relationships between specific sediment supply volumes and many explanatory variables using linear regression and random forest approaches. Results showed that the ratio of sediment-contributing area (bare soil or rock) to catchment area is the most important predictor of the specific sediment production volumes (m3 km−2). Other variables such as the Melton index or the indices of sediment connectivity also have an influence. Several predictive models were developed in order to estimate the sediment supply in torrents that are not equipped with debris basins.\n                    </jats:p>"

Smart fibers with on‐demand functionality are ideal candidates for fabricating noninvasive and conformal bioelectronic devices owing to their considerable flexibility. Herein, a multifunctional textile patch based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/tetra‐aniline (TANi) fiber for simultaneous biomarker monitoring and energy supply is reported. Benefiting from the multi‐electrochemical redox states and proton doping/dedoping characteristics of TANi, rGO/TANi hybrid fibers are combined into an energy storage device and biosensor in a physiological environment. GO flakes increase the viscoelasticity of the wet‐spinning dope by regulating the noncovalent interactions between TANi aggregates, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and conductivity of the resulting rGO/TANi hybrid fiber. Consequently, the hybrid fiber exhibits high volumetric capacitance and versatile sensing capability for various physiological analytes, e.g., pH, K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and glucose in sweat electrolyte. Furthermore, a wireless continuous sweat monitoring system is constructed by integrating the multifunctional fiber sensor into a printed electric circuit board with programmed functionality. Such a delicate integrated design that harnesses the signal collection and communication units is anticipated to facilitate practical applications in personalized diagnostic and physiological health.</jats:p>",

We split the network and tissue meshes by the Schur complement method of domain decomposition to obtain a reduced set of system equations for the tissue oxygen concentration at steady state. The use of a Cartesian grid allows the corresponding matrix equation to be solved approximately with a fast Fourier transform‐based Poisson solver, which serves as an effective preconditioner for Krylov subspace iteration. The performance of this method enables the steady‐state simulation of cortical oxygen perfusion for anatomically accurate vascular networks down to single micron resolution without the need for supercomputers.</jats:p>",

Understanding the equity and spatial differentiation mechanisms between the demand and supply of healthcare resources for the elderly in cities, especially in rapidly urbanized areas, can help policymakers to promote the planning and construction of a ‘Just City’ and ‘Age-Friendly City’, safeguarding the human well-being of the elderly. This study combines outpatient appointment data classified by service type with community-scale demographic data to assess the equity in the supply of medical resources for the elderly in the city using a refined two-step moving search method. Taking Xiamen City as an example, we analyzed the spatial heterogeneity in the equity in the supply of different types of health care services for potential elderly patients in each community in the city. Then, we selected six driving factors to explore the underlying driving factors. The results showed that there were 308 communities (61.11%) with a high medical service balance of the internal medicine type for the elderly in Xiamen City, concentrated in the southwest of the whole area. There are only 157 communities with high medical service balance for the surgical type of medical services, concentrated in the central part and southwest of Xiamen City. For these two types of medical services, the number of communities with low medical service balance is 30 (5.95%) and 182 (36.11%), respectively. These communities are far away from the central city. Economic vitality is the most important driving factor in the spatial distribution pattern of equity in the balance of medical services for the elderly. Our study can provide quantitative information on the current situation evaluation and decision support for the development and design of a ‘Just City’ and ‘Age-Friendly City’ Planning.</jats:p>"

The goal is to fit a set of boxes with strongly heterogeneous boxes into a container with a specific dimension to minimize the broken space and maximize profits. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm incorporates the bottom-left fill method, which is a heuristic strategy for packing containers. We conducted numerical testing to identify optimal parameters using the C~ metric method. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of our proposed algorithm by comparing it to other heuristics and meta-heuristic approaches using the relative improvement (RI) value. Our analysis showed that our algorithm outperformed the other approaches and achieved the best results.

Principal component analysis showed planted systems provided higher removal efficiencies than the unplanted system and A. gayanus performed better for treating most water quality parameters. As expected, removal efficiencies for suspended solids (SS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were greater than 90% in all filters. The removal of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) was, however, significantly greater in the filter planted with A. gayanus than in the unplanted control. For plant-beneficial parameters such as nutrients (NO3−, NO2−, NH4+, and PO43−), the removal in the planted filters was significantly higher than in the unplanted filter (&amp;gt;90% versus 73%–78%). The reduction of fecal coliforms was significantly greater in the two planted systems and exceeded 2.5 log10 removal. Analysis of the microbial water quality characteristics showed the concentration of fecal microbial indicators would achieve WHO guidelines for restricted irrigation with retention of some embedded nutrients, thus reducing pressures on areas experiencing climate variability, water scarcity, and land degradation.</jats:p>",

A smart green system to control water leakage and monitor drinking water quality in the water supply system of Paramythia city will be built in the context of SMASH project. It consists of: (a) IoT system comprising three local control stations, installed in selected parts of the water supply network, monitoring water quantity&amp;quality parameters in real time; (b) the hydraulic simulation model of the water supply system of Paramythia; (c) a virtual sensors system, which will be used for water quality prediction; (d) a Decision Support System (DSS) for leakage detection and optimal management of water supply system parameters in an automated manner.The DSS will detect and locate water leakages within the DMA zone and inform the operators for excessive values in drinking water quality parameters. The DSS will use as inputs the data from the IoT system, will interact with the hydraulic simulation model, and obtain the water quality data from the virtual sensors. All these data will be processed by the DSS logic in the backend subsystem. The IoT and the hydraulic simulation data, based on the digital twin of the water supply system, are used for the calculation of specific performance indicators related to water leakage, such as well-known IWA indicators: water losses, ILI, etc. Calculating the divergences between the PI values observed &amp; the ones representing the optimal operation of the water network without leakages and setting appropriate thresholds, the DSS will detect the leakage, while several different scenarios will run in hydraulic simulation. The frontend subsystem of the DSS will be able to visualize the water distribution network, statistical values of water quantitative &amp; qualitative parameters. It will provide alarms in case of leakage or exceedance of water quality parameters&amp;#8217; values and it will show the leakage location in a map.

DHFF was introduced in all district councils in the 2017/18 financial year. One of the anticipated goals of DHFF is to improve availability of health commodities. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of DHFF in improving the availability of health commodities in primary health care facilities. This study employed cross sectional study design, using quantitative techniques to analyze data related to expenditures and availability of health commodities at the primary health care facilities in Tanzania mainland. Secondary data was extracted from Electronic Logistics Management Information System (eLMIS) and Facility Financial Accounting and Reporting System (FFARS). Descriptive analysis was used to summarize the data using Microsoft Excel (2021) and inferential analysis was done using Stata SE 16.1. There has been an increase in allocation of funds for health commodities over the past three years. The Health Basket Funds (HBFs) accounted for an average of 50% of all health commodities expenditures. The complimentary funds (user fees and insurance) contributed about 20%, which is less than the 50% required by the cost sharing guideline. There is potentiality in DHFF improving visibility and tracking of health commodities funding. Implementation of DHFF has increased the amount of funding for health commodities at health facilities. The visibility and tracking of health commodity funding has improved. There is a scope of increasing health commodity funds at health facilities since the expenditures on health commodities is lower than what is indicated in the cost sharing collection and use guideline.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In drinking water supply, riverbank filtration (RBF) is an efficient and cost-effective way of eliminating pathogens and micropollutants using a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. Microbial communities in the hyporheic zone both contribute to and are shaped by these processes. Microbial water quality at the point of consumption is in turn influenced by the source water microbiome, water treatment and distribution system. Understanding microbial community shifts from source to tap and the factors behind them is instrumental in maintaining safe drinking water delivery. To this end, microbial communities of an RBF-based drinking water supply system were investigated by metabarcoding in a one-year sampling campaign. Samples were collected from the river, RBF wells, treated water, and a consumer’s tap. Metabarcoding data were analysed in the context of physicochemical and hydrological parameters. Microbial diversity as well as cell count decreased consistently from the surface water to the tap. While Proteobacteria were dominant throughout the water supply system, typical river water microbiome phyla Bacteroidota, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota were replaced by Nitrospira, Patescibacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteriota, Methylomicrobilota, and the archaeal phylum Nanoarcheota in well water. Well water communities were differentiated by water chemistry, in wells with high concentration groundwater derived iron, manganese, and sulphate, taxa related to iron and sulphur biogeochemical cycle were predominant, while methane oxidisers characterised the more oxic wells. Chlorine-resistant and filtration-associated taxa (Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bdellovibrionota) emerged after water treatment, and no potentially pathogenic taxa were identified at the point of consumption. River discharge had a distinct impact on well water microbiome indicative of vulnerability to climate change. Low flow conditions were characterised by anaerobic heterotrophic taxa (Woesarchaeales, Aenigmarchaeales, and uncultured bacterial phyla MBNT15 and WOR-1), implying reduced efficiency in the degradation of organic substances. High flow was associated the emergence of typical surface water taxa. Better understanding of microbial diversity in RBF water supply systems contributes to preserving drinking water safety in the future changing environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Housing shortages has been a recurring dilemma for Malaysia and the domination of traditional methods have made it hard to deliver targets. With today’s construction industry being more complex, specialized, and demanding, Industrialized Building System (IBS) has been promoted to help the sector deliver citizen’s house demands. However, this initiative has been hampered by fragmentation issues causing IBS to be inefficient. Joint Effort and Technological Collaboration, which stems from Supply Chain Management (SCM) philosophy has been suggested as the way forward for the industry by capitalizing on the various tools available to improve coordination, integration, and information flow. However, many proven successes have not translated to higher adoption rate in Malaysia. Implementations are rather scarce. This paper therefore sheds light into the barriers and enablers of Joint Effort and Technological Collaboration uptake among Malaysian IBS housing project supply chains from the perspective of industry experts. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken on five (5) practitioners with a minimum of twenty (20) years’ experience for a deep scrutiny on the matter and responses were analysed using content analysis. Finding indicated that the main barriers stemmed from commitment issues, indicating their hesitance towards committing to positive changes in practice, which hampers virtually any initiative. On the other hand, most significant enabler to Joint Effort and Technological Collaboration rooted on the willingness of industry players to transform themselves and adapt to new technologies and working culture. The outcome of this study not only contributes to the body of knowledge regarding collaborative initiatives in construction, but it is also expected to benefit the industry on identifying the stopping blocks and ways forward for better diffusion of these initiatives for future success.</jats:p>"

Many economies have adopted or planned for strategies to reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic goods and materials. The benefits of reductions in waste generation and GHG emissions need to be evaluated for setting the priority to select policy instruments for managing various plastic materials, products, and wastes. Several studies have made evaluations for the circulation of plastic using different models. However, many models for the circular economy focused on the effect on the macroeconomy rather than the detailed supply chain effects of an individual policy proposal. The reason could be the lack of an environmental assessment model with sufficient clear resolutions in the sectors, waste types, and waste treatments. In addition, the structure of the models limits many studies in modeling the scenarios diverting end-of-life products from waste treatments to recycling and reuse as secondary materials. To bridge this gap, this study adopted the waste input–output analysis methodology and compiled the models of baseline and four scenarios using the material flow and waste stream data of Taiwan with reference to a classification of four kinds of circular intervention from a review paper. We provide the details about the modeling results and settings for diverting plastic to the solid recovered fuel for power generation, closing the loops of plastic bags, extending the life of plastic cabinets and other plastic products, and improving the plastic products supply chain’s resource efficiencies. In the illustration of the results of GHG reductions in the supply chains and waste treatment activities, we present Sankey diagrams, which make the analysis of supply chains more straightforward. The developed method to render the Sankey diagram from the modeling result of an input–output-based model is presented in this article.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The challenges brought by a growing number of large-scale land development projects (e.g., Northern Metropolis, Lantau Tomorrow, and related infrastructures) in Hong Kong must be met by innovative land acquisition planning and processes. A recent quick win solution to land supply for Works projects has been in trial commissioning the provisional draft land resumption plan preparations and related survey works from the government to consultants, specifically the Authorized Land Surveyor (ALS) in the private sector. The industry therefore must consider the necessary and diverse sources of expertise available, and the existing land surveying technical resources that will render support to such new initiatives. Collaboration is called for between the spheres of public sector, education, and works industry to successfully move the use of cadastral survey for land management forwards, bridging the gap between lands and works practices for efficient processing of Works projects, and smart city development of Hong Kong.This paper will examine the new approach of professional surveying that private practicing ALSs bring, and why the overall number of ALS and engineering surveyors in the construction industry is growing so slowly. It will additionally compare Hong Kong's practice with that of the mainland China, Singapore, and the UK to grasp global learning points. The paper recommends the establishment of a Cadastral Survey Lab (CSL) firstly to explore the policy implementation of a sound cadastral system. The processing of lot boundary determination by ALS is reviewed. The regulatory roles of the Land Survey Authority (LSA) are requested in approving new land boundary plans; this both replaces the Demarcation District (DD) Sheet boundary and improves land boundary records. Secondly, the CSL can serve as a coordinating body in curating various kinds of land records from diverse sources, and aids the research and knowledge management of cadastral survey, land law, land tenure, land registration systems, land boundary record keeping, problematic lot boundary determination, etc. These topics can be considered in the refining geomatics education curriculum, and furthermore developed into guidance notes for geomatics survey practitioners.The evolution of the traditional land surveying profession into the geomatics services has become a recent international trend that is growing in popularity in the survey profession. Combining geo-spatial data from the planning and design stages, alongside the use of standardised survey data processing in project implementation and asset management, would encourage data sharing, avoid duplicate efforts, and facilitate the formation of a digital city. The spectrums of geomatics education in universities should be widened with a refined curriculum on combining geomatics with cadastral survey that has evolved from the traditional lot boundary survey to multi-purpose cadastre, city information modelling, urban informatics, smart city administration, and a full-blown Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI).\n                    </jats:p>"

This article discusses the effects of the FAP supplier profit-sharing ratio, the CGP agency profit-sharing ratio, and consumers’ sensitivity to FAP freshness on the supply chain stakeholders’ freshness preservation efforts. Moreover, based on the fairness preference theory, this article designed a profit-sharing contract that involves the Nash bargaining game between the FAP supplier and the CGP agency as the supply chain coordination mechanism. Modeling results revealed that: (1) The CGP agency’s freshness preservation efforts increased total supply chain profits. (2) The FAP supplier profit-sharing ratio, CGP agency profit-sharing ratio, and consumers’ sensitivity to FAP freshness have a positive correlation to the profits of the FAP supply chain and promote the coordination of the supply chain. (3) Considering fairness preferences, with the increase in FAP suppliers’ business negotiating ability, their freshness preservation efforts and fairness utility both increased gradually, while the fairness utility of the CGP agency gradually decreased.</jats:p>"

A systematic literature review approach was used to analyze and synthesize the findings from the existing literature, focusing on fundamental research themes, research gaps, and the direction of future research on the impact of blockchain adoption in the agri-food supply chain. Twenty-seven full-length articles were considered and thematically analyzed in this study. The authors identified eight themes from the literature, including factors responsible for blockchain adoption and new research areas such as digitalization and the impact after adoption. These themes shed light on the agri-food supply chain practices following the adoption of blockchain technology. Moreover, this study provides a foundation for strategic and policy initiatives in the agri-food industry involving blockchain technology. The findings indicate that critical factors driving blockchain technology adoption in the agri-food industry include ensuring food traceability and transparency, food safety and security, food supply and logistics, food integrity, environmental awareness, and reducing food waste. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of guidelines and policy-level involvement after adopting blockchain technology, particularly in facilitating accurate quantification and promoting digitalization to address challenges and streamline processes. The study concludes by suggesting future research avenues for blockchain technology in the supply chain domain.</jats:p>"

However, few studies have examined water supply and demand under multiple future spatial patterns of land use, particularly under sustainable development scenarios. Further research is therefore needed to determine how affect water output services under various land use patterns. We used the GMOP-PLUS (Gray Multi-objective Optimization-Patch-generating Land Use Simulation) and the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) models to investigate future land use programs and the current and future trends in water yield services supply and demand in the typical dryland region of Xinjiang, China. The GMOP-PLUS model was used to project the spatial patterns of land use/land cover (LULC) change in Xinjiang in 2025 and 2030 under programs of business-as-usual, rapid economic development, ecological land protection and sustainable development. We then used the InVEST model to project the spatiotemporal evolution of water yield services supply and demand under the four different scenarios. Our results show that Our results show that water production in Xinjiang decreases to 911.30 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in 2020–2030 under the business-as-usual scenario, with an expansion in arable land and a reduction in forested land being the main causes of this decrease. The decline in water production under the ecological land protection scenario is 913.88 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The retention effect of vegetation slows the decline in water production, but the ecological land protection scenario is not effective in controlling the reduction in arable land. The rapid economic development scenario produces a significant increase in water yield of 915.09 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, mainly due to an increase in the area of impervious surfaces caused by the expansion of built-up land; however, the rapid economic development scenario leads to a decreasing trend in ecological land. The sustainable development scenario produces 914.15 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of water. The sustainable development scenario increases water production while balancing the development of Constructed and the protection of ecological land, and the arable land also shows a slow growth trend. Between 2025 and 2030, the water security index fluctuates between –0.0225 and –0.0400, with a continued future deficit in water supply and demand in Xinjiang and a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Programs for advancing sustainable development narrow the supply–demand gap for services that produce water.</jats:p>"

However, inappropriate land use and reforestation practices can negatively impact this balance. In this study, the ES balance of the Saihanba region in China was quantified by integrating land use/cover change (LUCC) data, landscape metrics, and ES indicators. The relationship between ES balance and its driving factors was analyzed using spatial panel models. The spatiotemporal changes of landscape patterns from 2002 to 2020 were also explored. The results indicated that the overall ES supply capacity of the study region, especially in the southwestern area, increased during the research period. The ES balance and its determining factors exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity and spillover effects. Large–scale afforestation increased the local ES supply and provided economic benefits, but it also led to ecological issues, including declines in wetland area and landscape fragmentation. Our study emphasized the importance of considering the supply–demand balance in the planning and decision–making of ES, providing insight into multifunctional management and the sustainable development in the Saihanba area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The bioeconomy has gained traction among the broader discourses on sustainable development, ecological transition, and the circular economy. Governments in the Global North and international institutions maintain that the bioeconomy can gradually replace fossil-based raw materials and nonrenewable resources with biomass and biological renewables. The Global South has increasingly adopted the approach, but with important variations across mega-biodiverse regions. In these regions, the bioeconomy must encourage economic activities that preserve biodiversity and strengthen local communities, promoting their well-being and cultural diversity. This paper argues that conventional research methods and indicators are not fit for this purpose. We therefore propose an alternative method and indicators and present an initial validation of the approach with an application to the pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) value chain in the Brazilian Amazon. By applying a bottom-up approach to evaluation that considers the perspective of the individuals and communities involved, the proposed methodology captures relevant dimensions of the value chain—including trade-offs—-while identifying bottlenecks and the role of institutions. It also allows for verification of the achievement of the objectives of the socio-biodiversity bioeconomy in this model. The application to the case study finds that the managed pirarucu fisheries are a viable value chain associated with improved fish stocks and lower than average forest loss. Socio-economic benefits include the generation of reasonable income and greater participation by women. Income remains a complement to other sources of livelihood, however, and attractiveness to local communities is an issue. Positive outcomes are owed largely to local knowledge, collective action, and the role played by meta-organizations, while negative ones such as overfishing have resulted from institutional failures. Conventional analysis would likely not have considered these factors and missed these policy lessons. This corroborates the view that alternative methods and indicators are needed for the socio-biodiversity bioeconomy. While the application to the case study suggests the method and the indicators are conceptually suitable, we identify a number of shortcomings regarding the identification of interventions, attribution, and monitoring of the sustainability of the model.</jats:p>"

With recent anthropogenic and climate-induced changes in the flow regimes, it is challenging to constrain the fluxes and elemental signatures of the suspended organic matter in rivers. This study aimed to understand seasonal changes in the characteristics of total suspended matter (TSM) associated organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) during high and low flow periods in three large Asian rivers (Ganges, Mekong, and Yellow). By measuring organic C and total N contents and their isotopic compositions at multiple locations along the studied rivers, distinct seasonality in the sources of organic matter was observed. Allochthonous sources dominated the organic matter pool during the high flow condition, whereas autochthonous organic matter derived from enhanced phytoplankton production appeared to have dominated during low flow. C/N ratio showed positive correlation with altitude during wet period, which reversed during dry, supporting the transition of sediment dominated high flow riverine system into relatively clear and productive low flow system. Generally, organic matter content in TSM was higher during the low flow with signatures of potential N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation. Temporal analysis based on present and earlier estimates of fluxes and yields of TSM indicated manifold decrease in TSM load and associated C and N fluxes over decades in the three river systems largely attributed to reduction in river discharge. Wastewater dominated locations showed similar C and N contents and isotopic signatures as those of productive river waters during low flow, indicating a possible interference in the interpretation of biogeochemical information.</jats:p>"

The government encourages farmers to make sustainable technologies' input by providing cost share or flat payment. The firm procures products from multiple farmers and shares a portion of input costs. The optimal sustainable technologies' input, wholesale price and government subsidy are determined, and the impacts of different parameters on the decisions with the endogenous or exogenous subsidy are analysed. The results show that when competition intensifies to a certain threshold, farmers will not invest in sustainable technologies. When the subsidy is endogenous, the firm will obtain less profit if he shares more costs because the optimal subsidy decreases with the cost‐sharing proportion. When the subsidy is exogenous, the farmers' optimal sustainable technologies' input under the government's cost share is higher, and the firm may obtain more profit with cost sharing if the subsidy is relatively high. The government provides a higher subsidy to motivate farmers to adopt sustainable technologies when the pollution is more environmentally damaging. The government's cost share is superior to flat payment because it alleviates the government's financial burden with the same effect on motivating sustainable technologies' input.</jats:p>",

It is intensely managed, draining several major tributaries, many reservoirs, and numerous irrigation distribution systems and canals. Analysis of seasonal changes in dissolved ion concentrations using geochemical diagrams, elemental ratios, statistical correlation, and equilibrium modeling allowed the characterization of mineral formation processes that control the dissolved chemical composition. Measured water hydrochemistry and composition type differs substantially from previous reports from the upper reaches of the Syr Darya in Kyrgyzstan. Element ratios, statistical correlation, and the presence of NO3- and NO2- suggest that the downstream trend of increasing total dissolved solids (TDS) from Zhetysay city to the Aral Sea in June is controlled by evaporation–crystallization processes, which contribute to the river dissolved load through soil runoff and return irrigation waters following leaching of secondary salts. Downstream sample composition during the growing season shows significant changes in magnesium-to-calcium ratios in the river water. Elevated magnesium levels in Syr Darya waters may pose a problem to sustainable uses for irrigation.</jats:p>",

These kinds of systems are more sensitive under load changes. Particularly, an unbalanced voltage supply may be produced for large, single-phase loads. On the other hand, the connection/disconnection of high current loads may lead to important frequency variation, especially in weak grids where the short circuit current capacity is reduced. These conditions make the control of the power converter a more difficult task, because of the variations in the frequency and unbalancing. To address these issues, this paper proposes a resonant control algorithm to deal with variations in the voltage amplitude as well as grid frequency when a distorted power supply is considered. The frequency variation is an important drawback for resonant control because the resonance must be tuned at the grid frequency. This issue is overcome by using a variable sampling frequency in order to avoid re-tuning the controller parameters. On the other hand, under unbalanced conditions, the proposed method relaxes the phase with lower voltage amplitude by taking more power from the other phases in order to help the stability of the grid supply. To corroborate the mathematical analysis and the proposed control, a stability study is performed, including experimental and simulated results.</jats:p>"

Four subsidy strategies are proposed to ensure a desired service level in case of an emergency: zero subsidy, a fixed subsidy, a marginal subsidy, and a hybrid subsidy. We develop a game theoretical model to examine how the government can induce a manufacturer to set up a flexible production line that can respond promptly to an emergency, based on the manufacturer's cost structure (fixed and marginal costs). We find that when the marginal profit of an emergency product is higher than that of the manufacturer's regular product, a fixed (marginal) subsidy is the dominant strategy if the manufacturer's fixed (marginal) cost is high, while a hybrid subsidy strategy is dominant if both costs are high. When the marginal profit of an emergency product is lower than that of the manufacturer's regular product, neither a fixed subsidy nor a zero subsidy will be the dominant strategy. We also find that a marginal subsidy can ensure the effectiveness of the strategy, while a fixed subsidy helps improve strategy efficiency. We use government subsidy strategies implemented for Chinese COVID‐19 emergency supplies as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the subsidy strategies under the proposed framework. We also extend the discussion by considering the manufacturer's social consciousness.</jats:p>",

The creation, management, and impact coping techniques of the supply chain economy now face wholly novel requirements as a result of the escalating level of global uncertainty. Although a significant literature applies uncertainty analysis and optimization modeling (UAO) to study supply chain management (SCM) under uncertainty, there is a lack of systematic literature review and research classification. Therefore, in this paper, 121 articles published in 44 international academic journals between 2015 and 2022 are extracted from the Web of Science database and reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Bibliometric analysis and CiteSpace software are used to identify current developments in the field and to summarize research characteristics and hot topics. The selected published articles are classified and analyzed by author name, year of publication, application area, country, research purposes, modeling methods, research gaps and contributions, research results, and journals to comprehensively review and evaluate the SCM in the application of UAO. We find that UAO is widely used in SCM under uncertainty, especially in the field of decision-making, where it is common practice to abstractly model the decision problem to obtain scientific decision results. This study hopes to provide an important and valuable reference for future research on SCM under uncertainty. Future research could combine uncertainty theory with supply chain management segments (e.g., emergency management, resilience management, and security management), behavioral factors, big data technologies, artificial intelligence, etc.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food losses and waste (FLW) reduction and mitigating climate impact in food chains are priorities in achieving sustainable development goals. However, many FLW-reducing interventions induce additional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for example, from energy, fuel, or packaging. The net effect of such interventions (expressed in GHG emissions per unit of food available for consumption) is not obvious, as is illustrated in a number of case studies. We recommend that in the decision to take on FLW-reducing interventions, the trade-offs on sustainability impacts (such as GHG emissions) are taken into consideration. Since FLW induce demand and extra operations in all stages along a supply chain, adequate representation of cumulative GHG emissions along the production and supply chain, including ‘hidden parts’ of the chain, is required, which is challenging in full LCA studies. As a workaround, the case studies in this paper are based on a generic tool, the Agro-Chain greenhouse gas Emission (ACE) calculator that includes metrics and data for common food product categories and supply chain typologies. The calculator represents the structure of a generic (fresh food) supply chain and offers data sets for, amongst others, crop GHG emission factors and FLW in different stages of the production and distribution chain. Through scenario calculations with different chain parameters (describing pre and post-intervention scenarios), the net effects of an intervention on GHG emissions and FLW per unit of food sold to the consumer can be compared with little effort. In the case studies, interventions at the production stage as well as in post-harvest operations, are analyzed. Results show that post-harvest activities (especially FLW) contribute substantially to the carbon footprint of supplied food products. The FLW-reducing interventions are considered to induce additional GHG emissions. In most case studies, FLW-reducing interventions lower total GHG associated with a unit of food supplied to a client or consumer. However, in one case study, the extra emissions due to the intervention were higher than the prevented emission from lowering food losses. Consequently, in the latter case, the intervention is not an effective GHG emission reduction intervention.</jats:p>"

However, in terms of configuring the output network as an Euler graph, the concept of ‘removing odd nodes’ can be considered more reasonable.Conclusion : It is difficult to configuring watersupply network as a perfect Euler graph. Therefore, the application of the concept of removing odd nodes suggested in this study can promote efficient simplification of the network. In addition, it can be thought that the application of this concept can expect efficiency in terms of hydraulics and water quality.</jats:p>"

The temperature-programmed experiment is a commonly used and effective method for studying the characteristics of coal spontaneous combustion. Aiming at the problem that the numerical simulation of coal spontaneous combustion characteristics under the condition of external air supply and temperature control in a temperature-programmed experiment is insufficient, a multi-physical field coupling numerical model of coal spontaneous combustion in the temperature-programmed experiment is established. The variation characteristics of coal temperature, oxygen, and oxidation products under external air supply and temperature control were studied. The results show that the numerical simulation results are consistent with the experimental results. With the increase in temperature, the volume fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide decrease and increase, respectively. As the air supply volume increases, the oxygen volume fraction at the outlet increases, and the peak value of the oxygen volume fraction change rate exhibits a “hysteresis” feature, and the time corresponding to the peak value increases. Moreover, the temperature change rate increases. With the increase in the heating rate, the peak value of the oxygen volume fraction change rate increases and shows an “early appearance” characteristic, at the same time, the maximum coal temperature displays a linear increase trend.</jats:p>"

Daylight vision is initiated in the retina by cone photoreceptors, which are gradually lost in RP, often as bystanders in a disease process that initiates in their neighboring rod photoreceptors. Using physiological assays, we investigated the timing of cone electroretinogram (ERG) decline in RP mouse models. A correlation between the time of loss of the cone ERG and the loss of rods was found.

In Tigrai, most water supply construction projects are not completed within the predetermined contract time and planned budget. Hence, this research was carried out to investigate the causes and effects of time and cost overrun in water supply projects in Tigrai, northern Ethiopia and further recommend effective mitigation measures. A total of 87 questionnaires were distributed, 50 of them were collected, and desk study of 12 water supply projects were conducted. Data were analyzed using relative importance index and statistical software SPSS version 20. Results showed that the most important causes of time overrun were design errors and changes, lack of consistency between bill of quantities and drawings, and change order. Similarly, the most important causes of cost overrun were design errors and changes, lack of consistency between bill of quantities and drawings, and shortage of construction materials and electromechanical equipment in local market. The most effective mitigation measure of the overruns was complete and proper design. Time and cost overrun of the projects ranged between 0 and 203% and between 0 and 25%, respectively. The regression model showed that time overrun was estimated well (r2 = 0.95) using delays caused by design errors and changes and material import. Similarly, cost overrun was estimated well (r2 = 0.98) using factors that affect cost. Overall, the major cause for the overruns was design problem, hence clients and consultants should give due attention for the design process.</jats:p>",

We investigated how long social adaptations can usefully persist when they are not routinely expressed, by using experimental evolution to document the loss of social traits associated with the supply and demand of parental care. We allowed populations of burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides to evolve in two different social environments for 48 generations in the lab. In “Full Care” populations, traits associated with the supply and demand of parental care were expressed at every generation, whereas in “No Care” populations we prevented expression of these traits experimentally. We then revived trait expression in the No Care populations at generations 24, 43, and 48 by allowing parents to supply post-hatching care and compared these social traits with those expressed by the Full Care populations. We found that offspring demands for care and male provision of care in the No Care populations were lost sooner than female provision of care. We suggest that this reflects differences in the strength of selection for the expression of alternative traits in offspring, males and females, which can enhance fitness when post-hatching care is disrupted.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Grain supply chain transportation problem is a nontrivial and intractable issue for many developing countries. Grain as a bulk commodity is usually transported by bulk carriers. By taking into account the special condition of Ukraine, we proposed the containerized grain supply chain transportation optimization problem. In this problem, the sustainable supply chain system delivers grains in containers among primary elevators, intermodal yards, and port container terminals. Then, a containerized grain transportation model was developed to minimize the total cost of the sustainable supply chain system. Specifically, 20-foot containers were proven as more reasonable to be used in this paper. We also considered different transportation tools: trucks that can load one 20-foot container, trailers that can load two 20-foot containers, and wagons that can hold two 20-foot containers. Additionally, a disruption model was proposed by considering different disruption scenarios. Based on an analysis of the simulation results, some cost minimization strategies were proposed. Finally, a sensitivity analysis that aimed to analyze the effect of the proposed strategies on the minimal total cost and sustainability of the supply chain was conducted. The main conclusions drawn from the simulation are that the established food supply chain model is meaningful and accurate, and the incorporation of the disruption model aligns with practical requirements. Additionally, an increase in intermodal yard capacity, truck park size, and wagon park size decreases the total cost of the supply chain. The first two have a positive effect on the sustainability of the supply chain, while the latter increases the disruption risk of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, the link between hydro-meteorological droughts and large-scale atmospheric circulations, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), has received very little attention. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the hydro-meteorological droughts that occurred in the Kelantan River Basin (KRB) between 1985 and 2020 using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) as well as their connections to ENSO, IOD, and MJO. Sen's slope and Mann–Kendall test were employed to evaluate the trends and magnitude changes of the historical droughts, respectively. In addition, the response rate of SSI to SPI was considered to understand how precipitation affects streamflow. The results show that extremely dry events occurred in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1997–1998, 2015–2016, and 2020. Based on the SSI results, more than 70% of extremely dry periods last 6 months or longer. Interestingly, from January to May, when there was low precipitation, SSI had a higher response rate to SPI. The ENSO, as opposed to the IOD and MJO, had a stronger impact on the dry conditions over the KRB.</jats:p>",

An adequate supply chain has a multifaceted structure that focuses on integrating all factors, including pricing. The final product is delivered to customers based on maintaining market values and increasing strategic interactions. Present study aims to present the most effective functioning of competitive supply chain pricing in accordance with aspects of social responsibility. In doing so, we conducted a case study on oil-related products of Iranian knowledge-based companies. A combined analysis with 15 university-level industrial management experts was employed in this study to establish the components (competitive supply chain pricing function) and research propositions (dimensions of social responsibility). Twenty managers of knowledge-based enterprises in the oil field evaluated the components and propositions identified in the form of matrix questions using interpretative rating (IRP). The results showed that the proposition of the ethical dimension is the most effective measure of the social responsibility of knowledge-based companies in the oil field, creating competitive supply chain pricing functions based on value. This result shows that, under the ethical dimension of social responsibility, processes of competitive supply chain pricing are formed in accordance with the customer values and, according to the strategic relationship between the company and the economy with regional and global partners, maintaining values are a critical factor in developing our interactions between pricing factors. Given the results, in the first step for success, knowledge-based companies are recommended to consider the priorities of professional ethics in addition to knowledge in order to be able to gain the trust of customers by understanding their functional nature in the country’s developing economy. In this situation, the pricing process based on the creation of comprehensive values for customers can help to increase the company’s competitive position and make these companies to be at the first level of strategic interactions with companies that use petroleum products.</jats:p>",

First, this work extracts four common satisfaction factors based on factor analysis. They are satisfaction of forest characteristic physiotherapy entertainment project, satisfaction of forest rehabilitation basic service project, satisfaction of forest rehabilitation infrastructure construction project, and satisfaction of forest health culture consumption project. Secondly, by calculating the factor scores, it can be found that the forest health consumption satisfaction of the elderly population in the three northeastern provinces is the highest in Shenyang, followed by the Northeast, Harbin is slightly lower than the Northeast, and Changchun is the lowest. At present, the elderly population in the capital cities of the three northeastern provinces is relatively satisfied with the supply of forest sanitation services, and only Shenyang has a driving effect on the comprehensive satisfaction of the capital cities in the three northeastern provinces. It was found that Shenyang’s satisfaction with forest characteristic physiotherapy and entertainment projects and forest health cultural consumption projects and Harbin’s satisfaction with forest reclamation basic service projects and forest reclamation infrastructure construction projects have positive effects on forest reclamation infrastructure construction projects of the three provincial capital cities in Northeast China. However, Changchun City showed opposite effects on the four satisfaction factors.

To achieve this, it is necessary that the tourist potential of the area be taken into consideration. However, the tourist attraction capacity is not always considered, which has led to a significant increase in the number of rural lodgings. This has caused strong imbalances in Extremadura, Spain. On the basis of this premise, in this research study, we aim to determine whether there is an adjustment between the main factors that attract rural tourists to the study area. To determine this, we make use of different geostatistical procedures based on spatially weighted regression models (GWR and MGWR). A comparative study is conducted using these models, on the basis of which it is deduced that one type of regression offers advantages over the other. However, the results show that neither regression models can explain the presence of rural accommodation in places that do not meet the requirements demanded by tourists. This fact shows that the increase in the supply of rural accommodation follows unsuitable patterns in some cases, which translates into numerous problems, such as low occupancy levels. In this study, it is concluded that there is no strong relationship between the attractiveness of a territory and its volume of supply, highlighting the need to rethink tourism plans in order to adjust them relative to reality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 pandemic caught the world by surprise. On March 11th, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO)  announced the global pandemic, and governments started to initiate various kinds of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and disease containment measures. These NPI measures reduced the mobility of the population and slowed down business activities. State governments had to come up with viable fiscal support packages for the health and economic sectors. It created a unique opportunity for economists and academia to compare the effectiveness of different state governments and policies vis-a-vis the consequences of suddenly imposed health and economic challenges. It raised the issue of why in some countries the depth of the crisis (GDP % change) and speed of recovery from the crisis (attaining the level of 2019 GDP) was different. In order to comprehend the complexity of various factors influencing economic developments, this article aims to research economic and other social-economic factors defining the depth of the crisis and speed of recovery. The article will also try to establish whether these factors could be associated with more financial and fiscal resources needed in the due course and further increase of the outstanding public debt and debt service costs in the future. The author will be using the regression method to compare various economic variables. Results prove that stringency and NPI measures were not the only factors influencing the depth of the crisis. Research findings indicate that public debt plays a crucial role in precluding the recovery and efficient use of fiscal resources. However, the quality of institutions, governance, and confidence in government are clear contributors to the efficient use of limited fiscal resources and shallower economic crisis and speedier recovery, too.</jats:p>",

The aim of the study is to assess the potential of energy crop waste biomass with particular focus on biofuels in the case of Lithuania. The posed research question is: what type of energy crop waste biomass is considerable for the consumption of biofuel production. The results of analysis showed that the dominant position was associated with biodiesel production in Lithuania's transport sector, followed by bioethanol production. Biogas production has taken the lowest position in the biofuel industry. It was determined that the highest potential of biofuel was associated with four based energy crops. Unfortunately, the biofuel potential is still not used by utilization of other energy crops. The recommendation is to promote the cultivation of energy crops, such as miscanthus, hemp, switchgrass, reed canary grass, and others energy crops in the agricultural sector of Lithuania.</jats:p>",

Wood packaging material (WPM) such as dunnage, pallets, crates, and spools, is an integral part of the global supply chain due to its function in containing, protecting, and supporting the movement of traded commodities. The use of untreated solid wood for WPM introduces the risk of wood boring and wood-infesting organisms into the supply chain, while the handling and storage conditions of treated WPM presents risk of post-treatment contamination by surface-adhering or sheltering pests. The wood-boring and -infesting pest risks intrinsic to the solid wood packaging pathway were addressed in the 2002 adoption and 2009 revision of ISPM 15, which was first implemented in 2005–2006 in North America. Although this global initiative has been widely implemented, some pest movement still occurs due to a combination of factors including; fraud, use of untreated material, insufficient- or incomplete- treatment, and post-treatment contamination. Here we examine the forest-to-recycling production and utilization chain for wood packaging material with respect to the dynamics of wood-infesting and contaminating pest incidence within the environments of the international supply chain and provide opportunities for improvements in pest risk reduction. We detail and discuss each step of the chain, the current systems in place, and regulatory environments. We discuss knowledge gaps, research opportunities and recommendations for improvements for each step. This big picture perspective allows for a full system review of where new or improved pest risk management strategies could be explored to improve our current knowledge and regulations.</jats:p>",

Incomes are lower in rural areas than in urban areas in any country. Labour productivity in the agricultural industry varies significantly, i.e. tenfold, across EU Member States, with the lowest labour productivity being reported mostly in East European Member States, which makes it necessary to achieve higher productivity in these Member States. The present research aims to examine trends in agricultural labour productivity in EU Member States. The research found that the fastest increase in agricultural labour productivity occurred in East European Member States, while a mixed situation was observed in West European Member States, i.e. in some Member States the productivity increased at a lower rate or even decreased. An analysis of correlation between agricultural labour productivity and the number and average size of agricultural holdings revealed that the situation was mixed across the Member States, with some of them showing a positive trend, whereas some had a negative trend. The Member States with the lowest agricultural labour productivity need to foster increases in it through encouraging their farmers to own/manage larger areas and take advantage of economies of scale.</jats:p>",

These new factors also affect the normative aspects of citizenship: what does it mean to be a good citizen in this new reality? This article focuses on the relationship between citizenship and space and whether and how these social processes change people's attitudes toward the role of the nation-state. Based on in-depth interviews with Latvian citizens conducted in 2022, it can be concluded that the state is still the primary reference point for citizens when thinking about citizenship, civic duties, and virtues, but the aforementioned societal processes are changing the perception: technological developments make it possible to be a good citizen in several countries at the same time; globalisation makes it possible to get to know and accept diversity, even if global and national interests (and therefore the responsibilities of a good citizen) conflict (e.g. ecological and demographic issues). Latvia's population has also been affected by the transformation of the country's territory - the collapse of the USSR and accession to the European Union - which has had an impact on the sense of belonging and the perception of which countries are \"close\" and which are \"distant.” However, as in theoretical debates, this study shows that the nation-state continues to dominate the understanding of citizenship; rights, responsibilities, and political activities are all discussed in the context of the state.</jats:p>",

To sum up, it turned out that it is possible to group arguments into certain categories that determine the recognition of reliable and unreliable information. The arguments of those who claim to be able to recognize reliable information: emphasize self-analysis; use of common sense; enabling critical thinking; trust their abilities; believe in intuition. The arguments of those who cannot recognize reliable information: that it is impossible to understand the reliability of information; they admitted that the information may be biased; they missed the consistency of the research process, they simply do not trust themselves. The majority of respondents do not share news articles on their personal social media. The data of the conducted research revealed the differences in opinion when choosing both social media channels and the means of information dissemination, the possibilities of separating the truth and uncertainty of information, and the further use of such information with the label of reliable or unreliable information. The conducted research will allow an overview of the spread and impact of real and fake information on social networks.

The main results illustrate the framework for cooperation between diaspora professionals and the public administration in Latvia, the most significant benefits of diaspora diplomacy and the benefits from diaspora engagement for development (the transfer of social capital, as well as the transfer of experience, knowledge, ideas and practices to the public administration and other sectors).

The aim of this article is to analyse the institutional framework of the Latvian adult education and related institutions to assess what opportunities and what obstacles it creates for individuals to undergo the necessary training to enter a new occupation. Theoretically, the article is based on institutionalism theory, which explains the impact of institutions on the economic behaviour of agents, and middle-range theories on the impact of the structure of the education and labour market institutions on occupational mobility prospects. The analysis is based on a systematic examination of the legal acts and their amendments introduced in Latvia since 2009. The data suggest that Latvian institutional environment is generally favourable for occupational change, but specially targeted public policy support is aimed at the upgrading and retraining of medium- and low-skilled workforce, leaving the occupational transition of high-skilled workforce largely to their own discretion.</jats:p>",

This consumption is particularly affected by two factors. One of them is the power grid’s capital size in the electricity supply chain (ESC) and the other is the carbon emission reduction level elasticity of electricity consumption. Further, the financial strategy directly exerts quantifiable influence on one of the factors of capital size, while the procurement strategy plays a role in another factor. However, the impact of strategic behavior on all participants in the ESC remains unexplored. Thus, we construct a game model for the ESC consisting of two heterogeneous power plants and a strategic power grid with financial constraints, in order to analyze the purchasing and financing strategies for low-carbon electric-power consumption and examine the profit scenario from the credit and option hedging. We find that for the power grid, high self-owned funds level or affluent credit line encourages procurement. And when considering the power grid funds are uniformly distributed on or are constant, this funds property variation surely imposes influence on the wind electricity purchases. We find price elasticity of demand shows monotonic on the purchase when the power grid funds are constant but not necessarily when funds are uniformly distributed. The two power plants pursue the most favorable scenario for profit-maximizing by means of credit interest rate. Whether the power plants increase the financial credit interest is contingent upon option portfolios, the grid’s fund property, and wind yield conditions. We also find whether the relations between the two power plants are competitive or complementary depending on the wind yield rate. Numerical study shows that when the power grid funds are uniformly distributed, executing the double option seems to be the most profitable choice for the power grid and the traditional energy power plant, whereas with the uniform distribution of the grid’s funds, executing the call option but abandoning put is the most profitable to the traditional energy power plant. Moreover, under the grid’s fund of uniform distribution, it can both motivate power user consumption for clean energy generation and expand the power grid’s capital size.</jats:p>",

However, this aspect has been largely overlooked in the supply chain risk literature. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of distance on the perception and response to supply chain disruption risk. An online survey was conducted with 1055 managers working within the supply chain of ZTE, a Chinese multinational company providing integrated communications and information solutions. The survey aimed to examine how their distance from the disruption epicenter (i.e., ZTE) affected their risk perception and subsequent managerial responses. The findings indicate that those closer to the epicenter perceive a lower risk of disruption compared to those farther away, resulting in a reduced likelihood of taking management action. This phenomenon is referred to as the “psychological typhoon eye” (PTE) effect in supply chain disruption risk. Further analysis revealed that risk information quality mediated the relationship between distance and risk perception, while an individual’s job position level moderated the relationship between risk information quality and disruption risk perception. To mitigate the PTE effect in the multi-tier supply chain, the focal firm must prioritize high-quality information synchronization, extending beyond single-company initiatives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The scientific literature has extensively covered digital marketing communication and the advantages brought by it – interactivity, intelligence, individualisation, integration, independence of location etc. However, in the context of sustainable development, a key aspect in marketing communication is collective social responsibility, more specifically – legal and ethical digital marketing communication, one that does not pose threat to health, safety etc. or otherwise harm the society or its individual members. The increasing role of digitalised processes in the daily life of businesses, including the management of digital marketing and marketing communication, and the lack of legislation governing the digital commercial environment highlight several negative trends and risks for both businesses and the public. The goal of the study is to identify the factors that influence the use of legal and ethical digital marketing in entrepreneurship based on an analysis of the regulatory framework governing digital marketing and expert survey. The study implements a cross-disciplinary approach by incorporating research methods characteristic of law, economics and management sciences in the methodology. The methods used in the research are the monographic method, expert survey, regulation and case law analysis, secondary data analysis. The main results show that important factors in putting the digital commercial environment in order and mitigating risks are the lack of competence and knowledge in digital marketing practice, responsibility sharing between the company and the communication stakeholders, conflicts of interest, the focus on immediate sales, the lack of awareness and knowledge of collective social responsibility, ethicality in the digital environment – marketing communication, and the lack of regulatory framework, especially in the fields of privacy protection, intellectual property, data and personal information security, influencer activity, and in the context of sustainability policy in the European Union.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The food items, such as pulses and oil crops, are influential means of nutritional security for the people in Bangladesh. Pulses are widely called here as an alternative to meat for poor households. The study aimed to predict productivity and national demand of pulses and oil crops in Bangladesh by 2030 and 2050, minimizing the supply and demand gaps of these crops. Using the ARIMA model developed by Box and Jenkins, the current study projected Bangladesh’s pulse and oil crop demand and supply for the years 2030 and 2050. The projections showed that the total demand for pulses in 2030 will be 17.9 lakh MT and further increased to 19.5 lakh MT in 2050. The deficit in the supply of pulses will be 12.36 lakh MT in 2030 and 9.26 lakh MT in 2050 although the shortage of pulses will disappear as a result of productivity improvements and innovations. Per capita consumption of edible oil in Bangladesh is 20–22 g per day. The majority of domestically produced soybean (5% of total demand) is used in the feed industries, while edible oil from soybean depends on import. The supply of mustard oil is predicted to be in deficit by 0.30 lakh MT in 2030 and 1.68 lakh MT in 2050. Nevertheless, the estimates also warn that supply of these food items could be threatened due to climate changes. In facing future challenges, supportive government policy and substantial investment in research and extension should be given priority for technological innovation and productivity improvement. Government also needs to develop a strategic import substitution policy for higher production of these crop and storage facilities.</jats:p>"

Research approach: qualitative research methods – expert interview, semi-structured interviews and document analysis, a quantitative method – questionnaire survey. It is concluded, hypothesis that subjective factors are the most important factor influencing the reproductive behaviour of the population has been confirmed. According to the respondents, the most significant factors influencing reproductive behaviour are: the desire to have children 65%, a stable partner and his support 53%, financial stability 51%. The tendency of modern society to “postpone the birth of children as late as possible” is a significant factor influencing reproductive behaviour has been confirmed. The birth of a child is delayed by the population for subjective reasons, such as uncertainty about the future, the desire to accumulate capital, to live and travel, and so on. The general population does not value their reproductive age. In general, the population does not objectively assess their reproductive age, because the average age of the respondents is 37.2 years, 40% of all respondents do not have children, but the answers show that respondents would like to have 2–3 children, in case all the conditions are favourable.</jats:p>",

This study presents the opportunities and challenges of supplying raw materials from waste using a remote sensing technique, mycorrhizal-assisted phytoremediation, and hydrometallurgical techniques to transform mining waste from a problem to a resource. Soil/mine wastes from the Sierra Pintada mine (Mendoza, Argentina) were mineralogically and chemically analyzed, and then, a mapping of the mining waste was carried out by Sentinel-2A images to identify areas with similar characteristics. The bioaccumulation of HMs by autochthonous shrubs was also determined to select accumulator plant species, and to evaluate their potential for phytoremediation of mine soils at different technological scales, when they were inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi originated from a mining-impacted area. RMs were recovered from plant biomass by scaling in bioreactors, the depuration module, and hydrometallurgical techniques. The encouraging results highlight that this multidisciplinary approach can be applied to meet the increasing demand for RMs supply and, at the same time, to protect the environment and public health.</jats:p>"

Women are more concerned about environmental problems than men but have less resources to build their resilience towards a variety of interconnected social, political, ecological and economic crises. Aspects such as women’s political rights to access, control and manage environmental resources determine their vulnerability. As their role is often assigned to maintaining a healthy environment at home, at work and in the community, unequal pressures, unfair expectations and unspoken challenges were explored in the qualitative research. Since no similar research has been carried out before, a broad group of participants were invited to participate in the study. The immediate aftermath of pandemic restrictions and the time of Russian military aggression in spring 2022 interfered with the phase of data gathering and in result broadened the spectrum of issues discussed with women. The historical moment in which we conducted our research has shown that long-term and time-stretched risks play a secondary role in women's lives. Because of their social role as caregivers, immediate problems usually require much more of their attention and resources. This leads to limitations in possible adaptation and resilience building.</jats:p>",

To achieve a more sustainable economy, the EU launched the European Green Deal, a development strategy to transform the EU into a zero-emission economy. The study aims to assess changes in the productivity of energy inputs in agriculture in EU countries in connection with the changes in the volume of production and energy inputs. Based on Eurostat data, changes for the period 2010-2020 were determined. It was found that agricultural production in the EU-27 increased by 1.36%, while the amount of energy used in agriculture increased by as much as 12%. As a result, energy productivity decreased by as much as 10% from EUR 360,000 to EUR 325,000 per 1 TJ of energy input. A decrease in energy productivity was observed in 20 of the 27 countries surveyed. On average, production or energy use volume changes in particular countries were not large and did not exceed 5% in the analysed period. An increase in the efficiency of energy use in agriculture is possible through rational concentration of production, mechanization and introduction of innovations in production technologies. The phenomenon of emission leakage outside the EU and large imports of food should be avoided, as the efficiency of energy use in agriculture in the EU is higher than in less developed countries. Achieving a reduction in energy consumption in agriculture seems to be difficult to reconcile with maintaining production volumes.</jats:p>",

An important prerequisite for their successful addressing is a well-developed social work profession and a sufficient number of qualified social work specialists. Despite the topicality of social work, its practical implementation in Latvia faces a number of problems, among them the country still lacks a significant part of the necessary specialists. This paper aims to analyse the factors that motivate people working in the demanding profession of social work in Latvia, revealing the main factors that should be addressed as a priority in solving the problem of insufficient number of employees. Empirical data was collected by survey method, n=145. The study is based on A. Maslow's needs theory and F. Herzberg's two-factor motivation model. It is analysed how social workers evaluate the importance of and the satisfaction with motivating factors; the attention is also paid to the factors that have a greater influence on the willingness to work to work in the field of social work. The research concludes that there is a difference in the opinions of social workers about the importance and satisfaction: more important factors have lower satisfaction scores, especially reward-related issues. This is one of the most important aspects that needs to be addressed, because the issues of pay, workload, working conditions are the ones that reduce the willingness to work in the social work profession.</jats:p>",

The European Union's efforts to secure 5G networks and data security are taking longer than the technology ecosystem expects. The fact that the implementation of 5G technologies has been transferred to the hands of telecommunications operators (private business structures, with very little public capital or even global structures) and the development of different services are more private sector-oriented as well creates a threat that people and even state will not be able to control the use of data that is processed using data transmission networks.

We propose six actions to improve water infrastructure resilience: increase water‐use efficiency by municipal, industrial, agricultural, and thermoelectric power sectors; adopt indirect potable reuse or closed loop systems; allow for water sharing during droughts but regulate inter‐basin transfers to protect aquatic ecosystems; increase nutrient recovery and reduce discharges of carbon and nutrients in effluents; employ green infrastructure and better stormwater management to reduce nonpoint pollutant loadings and mitigate urban heat island effects; and apply the CRIDA framework to incorporate climate and hydrologic uncertainty into water planning.</jats:p>",

After governance landscape changing administrative-territorial reform (2021) in the country, researchers now were aiming to study governance dimensions’ framework in municipal practice – studying governance triple dimensions as content, stakeholders, and governance instruments. Research-and-development framework has been applied, using case study research methodology, based on the analysis of documents, general municipal practice structural overview, additional expert interviews/consultations, and, three chosen detailed municipal best practice case studies in Ventspils, Kekava and Valmiera municipalities with complementary governance approaches. Based on these studies, as well as on national previous studies and international best practice comparisons, there are emphasised the two core preconditions for the improvement of municipal environmental governance in Latvia. Since there is to be seen, that municipal environmental governance comprehensive integration approach, being theoretically well thought, but is having only limited success in current pragmatic municipal practice, there is to be secured municipal task-related vertical institutional environmental governance system, covering all four inner municipal administration levels. In parallel with statutory organized ground level environmental sector municipal companies, so-called communal services (drinking/sewage water, energy/heating, sanitary etc. basic environmental sub-sectors), other and newly growing environmental governance content issues are to be also institutionalised, but at the higher local government administration and decision-making levels. Next core precondition - municipal environmental communication complementary instrumentalisation and structural development, including environmental information, education/training, involvement/participation, and pro-environmental behaviour. These improvements would provide the necessary systemic overview and co-management of the whole complexity of environmental governance processes and procedures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the European Union (EU), the cattle sector is made up of meat and dairy farming. These sectors are closely interlinked, as a significant proportion of dairy cows are slaughtered for meat. In the mid-1990s, as market conditions changed in Latvia's agricultural sector, the development of specialised breeds of beef cattle began, so the aim of the research is to examine trends in the development of beef cattle breeding in Latvia. Dairy farming is still one of the largest agricultural sectors in Latvia, but between 2003 and 2023 the total number of specialised beef cattle herds in Latvia has decreased by 46.9%, while the number of specialised beef cattle themselves has increased almost four times compared to 2003. The results of the study show, in 2023, the most popular beef cattle breeds were Charolais, Limousine, Hereford and Aberdinangus, and these breeds accounted for 87% of the total number of beef cattle. The beef cattle industry showed a positive trend in the development of specialized beef cattle breeds with an increase in the number of herds of 3-49 and 50-199 cattle in 2023, which accounted for 86% of the total number of beef cattle. In Latvia, beef cattle are concentrated in certain districts in the eastern, western, and northern parts of the country where favourable conditions (pastures) are available for rearing them. Authors conclude that in the future, farms producing cattle of specialized beef breeds will have to review their production practices in order to adapt to environmentally friendly solutions and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the European Green Deal.</jats:p>",

We apply data fusion of visible near infra-red (VIS-NIR) and short wave infra-red (SWIR) reflectance and fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy data features to classify fish from fresh to spoiled condition. Farmed Atlantic and wild coho and chinook salmon and sablefish fillets were measured. Three hundred measurement points on each of four fillets were taken every two days over 14 days for a total of 8400 measurements for each spectral mode. Multiple machine learning techniques including principal component analysis, self-organized maps, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and linear regression, as well as ensemble and majority voting methods, were used to explore spectroscopy data measured on fillets and to train classification models to predict freshness. Our results show that multi-mode spectroscopy achieves 95% accuracy, improving the accuracies of the FL, VIS-NIR and SWIR single-mode spectroscopies by 26, 10 and 9%, respectively. We conclude that multi-mode spectroscopy and data fusion analysis has the potential to accurately assess freshness and predict shelf life for fish fillets and recommend this study be expanded to a larger number of species in the future.</jats:p>"

The promotion of health care and paid services is complicated, dependent on several ethical, legal etc. factors. Digital marketing enables healthcare specialists to demonstrate their competence to potential patients, expand their professional domain, and improve the image of the healthcare industry. But we must not forget about sustainability - ensuring a healthy life and promoting well-being for all society. The aim of the study is to identify digital marketing tools that positively influence consumer choices in the purchase process of paid health services. To achieve the goal, the following research methods were used - monographic, secondary data analysis and quantitative research (survey) methods. The consumption of digital tool changes depending on level of education – higher educated respondents use more tools than lower educated respondents. Irrespective of gender, income and education, respondents aged between 18 and 27 are more affected by digital tools than other age groups. In contrast, respondents aged over 65 are practically unaffected by digital tools, except some cases at a certain level of education and income or depending on gender. The article deals with UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDGs 3 (Good health and well-being). The results of the study have both theoretical and practical significance.</jats:p>",

While the second group represents firms whose share capital is fully owned by the residents of Latvia. Productivity indicators are calculated for both groups. To assess the productivity differences across domestic firms and firms with foreign capital in Latvia, the author has combined a rich firm-level dataset using ORBIS and Lursoft IT Ltd. data. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the firms with foreign capital are, on average, more productive than the firms whose share capital is only Latvian capital.

As insurance business is related with money people have always tried to perform illegal activities to earn extra income. Insurance fraud as a type of financial crime has existed since the origination of commercial business. Therefore, insurance fraud, its identification and prevention is one of the most topical and essential problems in the insurance industry. The research aim is to assess property and casualty insurance market trends in line with the insurance fraud. The research mainly applies the monographic descriptive method as well as the methods of analysis and synthesis. Content analysis is used to study case laws and analyse insurance fraud cases. The research results demonstrate that in Latvia, the annual amount of compensations paid by insurance companies due to fraudulent claims may range between EUR 7.55 million (in case of 5% fraud) and EUR 30.10 million (in case of 20% fraud). Yet, 20% of fraudulent cases might basically refer to the recent pandemic years like 2021 and 2022. The most popular and serious insurance fraud cases relate to a car theft, staged accidents, submission of false documents and hidden actual causes of the fire in property insurance. The analysed court cases report fine, forced labour and even imprisonment as penalty measures for the committed insurance fraud.</jats:p>",

This study examines how institutions are acting in the governance of biomass regarding to its potential impacts on global health. Thirty semi-structured interviews and twelve focus groups involving farmers and local institutional leaders were conducted in two disparate Communes near the capital Antananarivo. The purpose of these discussions was to gather information linking global health to the life of agrarian communities. As achievement of the methodological deployment, a mapping of institutions was set, showing the coexistence in the Malagasy highlands of traditional institutions: the household (ankohonana), the community (fokonolona) and the state (fanjakana), and new ones: the decentralised collectivity or Commune, religious communities and private enterprises or firms. Households, even though as mostly agrarian, are the most active in the production, consumption and transfer of biomass. However, their decision-making aptitude on biomass governance can be influenced by the authority of the state as a provider of public policies or by the holders of financial means as firms that favour certain productions over others. The activities of the interacting institutions maintain the power relations between them more than they preserve the regenerative capacity of biomass, the main source of well-being for agrarian societies.</jats:p>",

Despite the rapid development of technology, many companies avoid the use of big data, and the interest of consumers in the use and processing of their data is also growing. The research objective is to evaluate the scientific and practical problems of big data use and privacy, to identify the main actualities of big data use in marketing, the advantages and limitations of use, as well as to investigate consumer attitudes towards the use of big data.

Historically, the company has addressed capacity constraints through capital investments in network upgrades, thereby increasing the nominal capacity of the elements installed in the network and increasing the capacity of the network. European experience shows that capital costs in network reinforcement can be deferred by offering the customers their desired capacity with temporary constraints. This study defines a process for designing an optimal investment strategy, which allows ST to compare the investment in network reinforcement against restrained capacity offer through customer demand flexibility. It was concluded that the concept of flexibility services versus reinforcing the existing network is the most cost-effective option to maintain a consistently high quality of energy supply while minimising the cost to the utility if the customer flexibility cost does not exceed 300 EUR/MWh. Adding that only by updating and improving input data, calculations and forecasts flexibility services can be further developed and implemented in Latvia.</jats:p>",

In 2020, health measures introduced due to COVID-19 pandemic by many European countries, including Latvia, have brought changes to the traditional concept of workplace, creating remote and hybrid working environments within multiple economic sectors. The rapid uptake of remote or hybrid working and the positive feedback of both workers and employers indicate a fundamental shift in the concept of workplace, suggesting a need to revisit the established rural population development approach. This study aims to evaluate the changes in rural population dynamics and population disposition towards demographic processes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, while assessing the possible changes in the rural demographic development approach needed in order to encompass the changing realities. Authors use available population statistics and compare results of the two consecutive nationwide population opinion surveys carried out before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. Study results indicate some new opportunities and new challenges for the rural population development in Latvia. Authors conclude that rural areas can benefit from the remote work possibilities, as it reduces role of employment constraints in the rural development equation. However, remote work is still unlikely to fix the rural-urban divide in Latvia, as many rural areas are lacking the necessary infrastructure or enabling institutions necessary to attract and sustain remote workers.</jats:p>",

Then, we analyse the impact of different subsidy policy and adverse weather on the costs of the government and profits of the farmer and the company. By comparing with the non-subsidy policy, we find that both the fixed subsidy policy and the ARC policy encourage the farmer to improve the environmentally sustainable investment level and increase the profit of the farmer and the company. We also find that both the fixed subsidy policy and the ARC subsidy policy lead to an increase in government spending. Our results show that the ARC subsidy policy has a significate advantage in encouraging the farmer’s environmentally sustainable investment if the adverse weather is relatively serious, comparing with the fixed subsidy policy. In turn, our results also show that the ARC subsidy policy is more beneficial for both the farmer and the company than the fixed subsidy policy if the adverse weather is relatively serious, which then leads to a higher expenditure of the government. Therefore, our conclusion serves as a theoretical basis for governments to formulate agricultural subsidy policies and promote sustainable development of the agricultural environment.</jats:p>"

The literature on pandemics in the past shows that plague influenced the volume and the structure of agriculture output. The consequences varied between the pandemics and in the frame of the same pandemic between countries. What's more, the length of the analysis period matters. The short-term effects were generally damaging however, the evaluation perspective matters. The assessment of long outcomes is complex. The positive, profound long-run effects were identified. The past pandemics impacted the economy and agriculture through the decrease in the availability of labour because of massive deaths. In the pandemic COVID-19, this channel of transmission occurred as well, but in the form of shortages of labour forces due to governments’ restrictions on people's movement. The analyses found that in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, agriculture production did not decrease. It stemmed from the time gap between the production decisions and getting output. A modest reduction occurred in the second year of plaque. The analyses of the structure and dynamics of the sown area show that farmers restrain themselves from the changes in plant production. Larger adjustments took place in the sector of animal products than in plant products. The most remarkable changes took place in branches of animal production depending on export. Because of the plummet in egg prices, egg production decreased in 2020 and 2021. The fall in meat prices in 2020 resulted in a drop in the meat production in 2021. Despite the unfavourable changes in milk prices, milk production was stable.</jats:p>",

This concept has lately been regarded as a very promising tool in achieving several Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. Understanding and proper implementation of the Blue Economy principles in coastline territories have become urgent and topical issues. The purpose of this study is to analyse and assess the feasibility and potential of introducing a fish and seafood production sector in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, which is located in Georgia. The current study explores the opportunities, challenges, and potential benefits associated with establishing such sector in this region, characterizes existing aquaculture farms and identifies reasons that hinder the increase of farms’ productivity. In scope of this study, a survey of 70 fish farms was carried out, and the research results highlight possibilities to develop scenarios for further field development where collaboration between aquaculture farms and the government can be identified as crucial issues to stimulate the production of fish products. By summarizing the research results and analysing the data, the following conclusions can be drawn: Georgia faces a challenge in introducing the modern Blue Economy and its principles; the existing aquaculture farms in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara have low productivity; farmers lack the necessary knowledge for sector development; it is crucial to strengthen aquaculture farms with government support.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past decade, the role of social entrepreneurship has increased rapidly. The driving force of the social enterprises is the succesfull project management and ability to use various tools to further improve the work with stakeholders. Project management, unlike management in general, is a continuous process that has a specific end result that is limited in time and finance and is the key differentiator of project management from management. There are many project management programs and tools available; however, social entrepreneurs are unaware of or reluctant to implement them. It is estimated that there are altogether approximately 300 management tools are availabe in the world (Rudder, 2022). One of such tools is project management stakeholder matrix. The aim of the paper is to determine the awareness of the project management stakeholder matrix in social enterprises in Latvia. To achieve this aim, the following steps are determined: to provide a theoretical explanation of project management in the context of social entrepreneurship and empirically obtained information to identify the awareness about project management stakeholder matrix in social enterprises in Latvia. The paper employed quantitative research - surveying social enterprise project managers in Latvia. One of the tools that helps improve social entrepreneurs project management and achieve project goals is a stakeholder analysis of the project. The knowledge about the project management stakeholder matrix helps social entrepreneurs to increase the security to deal with low use of digital tools capacity in the team and allows better management of the project team.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this article is to describe a multi-level model for designing (planning) and managing the sustainable development of socioeconomic objects in the invariant coordinates' system using power (energy) units of measures. The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that, based on the analysis of socioeconomic, technical and environmental factors that determine the sustainable development, natural science meters are determined, reduced to universal power unit of measurement in systems that are open at the input and output in terms of energy. Within the framework of the proposed design model, the data of the Central Statistical Office of the EU, the World Bank and the United Nations Organization database were used for calculations.

State social insurance benefits in Latvia include benefits in case of unemployment (unemployment benefit and benefit in case of death of an unemployed person) and benefits and allowances for maternity and sickness insurance (maternity and paternity benefits, parental allowance, sickness benefit and funeral allowance). The defined research hypothesis states that the amount of social insurance benefit and wage remuneration are subject to the impact of the same factors. The research aim is to study factors impacting state social insurance benefits in Latvia. The authors have identified factors impacting work remuneration and respectively social insurance benefits based on the scientific literature and the research of the Ministry of Welfare of the Republic of Latvia. In the course of the research, seven experts were asked to evaluate the identified factors by means of the paired method and determine the most significant factors influencing the amount of social insurance benefits. The research results show that experience and education (personality-related factors) are among the most important factors influencing wage remuneration and, hence, the amount of social insurance benefits. The research highlighted a necessity to make a proposal to the State Employment Agency to continue organising various training courses and educational programmes that increase the qualification of an employed person. However, the influence of a region was noted by experts as the main factor when evaluating the impact of the workplace on the wage remuneration.</jats:p>",

The plots corresponded to water regimes (full and deficient), the split plots to N fertilization (0 and 1000 kg ha−1 N-urea), and the split-split plots to harvest times of soybean plants (16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 58, 65, 79 and 86 days after emergence), with three replicates. In general, the accumulation and partitioning of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulphur (S), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and boron (B) were decreased in plants subjected to water deficit and without N fertilization. Although nitrogen fertilization promoted elevated N accumulation in tissues, it did not result in any significant yield gain, and the highest seed yields were found in plants under full irrigation, regardless of N supplementation. However, deficient irrigation decreased the seed oil content of N-fertilized plants. In conclusion, N fertilization is critical for nutrient homeostasis, and water availability impairs biomass and nutrient accumulation, thereby limiting soybean yield performance.</jats:p>"

This is impossible without the development and improvement of human capital and modern education system. Advancement of science, technology, medicine and other fields requires appropriate development of human capital. We consider particularly important the investments made in human capital according to different (especially tourism and agricultural) sectors and the study of their effectiveness. The purpose of our study is to justify the need to invest in human capital and to investigate its effectiveness, for which we conducted a survey of employers and employees in the field of agriculture and tourism about their attitude towards professional growth measures (training/seminars); the role of the state in this direction is also important. In the research process, we used statistical analysis and qualitative research methods. The conducted research showed us that. Holding of training/seminars for improving the qualifications of employees is without compromise, but it is becoming difficult to find funding. There is a mixed attitude on the part of the state and employees, while 57% of these measures are financed by employers. The investment made in this direction has an economic and social effect. Increases employee motivation and productivity, which has a positive impact on both the company's and employee's income. Effective management of investment in human capital contributes to the development of creative social actions. Based on the actual data of the developed countries, it was found that there is a direct relationship between the expenditure on education and the economic growth in the long term. As a result of acquired knowledge and experience, in the presence of highly developed human capital, productivity and profitability increase. International indices and rankings are one way to measure a country's progress in various directions; however, it should be noted that they do not accurately reflect the current situation in the country. The human capital index (0.57) is considered a good level, however, in reality; the quality of the databases used in their calculation reduces the accuracy of the indices and ratings.</jats:p>",

Research is aimed at determining the influence of the land use system on the sectoral components of the economy of European countries. To achieve the goal, land use was grouped taking into account the types of economic activity and institutional sectors of the economy. Typification of land uses was carried out, taking into account the types of economic activity and institutional sectors of the economy of countries, and the corresponding types of land uses were formed, namely, food-forming, ecologically stabilizing, social-infrastructural, production-commercial - economic-forming. The proposed grouping system consolidated the following types of economic activity: forestry, agriculture, construction, industry, transport, trade, IT, scientific and technical, financial and insurance activities, administrative activities, defense, government, management, education, health care and social services, other services (taxes, arts, entertainment and recreation). As part of the study, the relationship between economic indicators of profitability (average GDP per unit area) and the use of land resource potential was identified, taking into account the institutional sectors of the country's economy. The conducted analysis demonstrates to what extent the income of a certain sector of the economy depends on the area of land use, which participates in the formation of economic benefits. Based on the circle-centric model, it was established that the increase in economic efficiency from the use of land-resource potential is proportional to the distance from the centre of the model (mainly food security) to the top (economy-forming industries of production).</jats:p>",

However, each EU Member State has its own energy policy, so in order to achieve the common goal of a higher share of renewable energy in the national economy, the Member States choose different ways to achieve the goal. The aim of this article is to find out whether the regulatory acts in Latvia regulate the development of the biogas industry in a favourable way. Considering the unprecedented geopolitical situation created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during 2022 the renewable energy indicators to be achieved by 2030 were reviewed in the EU. They were adjusted to promote Member States' energy independence and, in the long term, the goals of climate neutrality and zero pollution, as well as to phase out dependence on Russian fossil fuels and reduce energy prices.

Trends of urban agriculture, which are characterised by inclusion in dimensions of the sustainability, develop the practice of community gardens that in Latvia are currently in the development stage. This highlights the need to evaluate the population's attitude and views on the aspects of urban agriculture in Latvia. The agricultural sector in Latvia is developed and rural regions are relatively close to urban areas, therefore, agricultural practices in cities for the realization of production can create a different, even negative attitude of society towards urban agriculture and its relevance in Latvia. Therefore, the aim of this study is the assessment of the attitude of the population in Latvia towards practices and products of urban agriculture. In order to achieve the aim, two tasks have been set: 1) to analyse the attitude of Latvia’s population towards the practice of urban agriculture; 2) to analyse the population's attitude towards urban agricultural products, in the context of their food choice criteria. To fulfil the tasks, a survey of Latvia’s population was conducted. In general, the population's attitude creates supportive aspects for urban agriculture in Latvia, but challenging are aspects of the attitude regarding the potential pollution of food in the urban environment, its role and performance in cities, which population do not associate with agricultural practices.</jats:p>",

Single cell RNA sequencing demonstrates the stepwise emergence of DE-MSCs, while endoderm-specific gene expression can be elevated by signaling modulation. DE-MSCs display multipotency and immunomodulatory activity in vitro and possess therapeutic effects in a mouse ulcerative colitis model. This study reveals that, in addition to the other germ layers, the definitive endoderm can also contribute to MSCs and DE-MSCs could be a cell source for regenerative medicine.</jats:p>"

Some  surveys show that the use of e-commerce in Latvia is a problem for most companies in the SME sector; however, there is still a lack of in-depth research to justify the directions of action contained in strategic policy documents. The purpose of the article is to provide analysis of external and internal factors that affect the use of electronic commerce in the SME sector. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to identify the factors that most positively and negatively affect the e-commerce development of companies. Data from the expert survey were used to conduct the analysis with the AHP method. 17 experts from the state administration, academia and the business environment participated in the survey, who assessed the impact of various internal and external factors on the use of e-commerce in companies. Since the application of e-commerce in companies is one of the measures for faster recovery of the state of the national economy, including developing the export of the SME sector in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, recommendations have been prepared for public and commercial organizations to have a positive impact on the use of e-commerce in SMEs.</jats:p>",

The aim of the article is to determine the level of acceptance of innovative food products by young Poles. We put a thesis that innovative food products are not readily accepted and that consumers do not perceive them as worth more than typical food products. Thus, food products are difficult to be subjected to major innovations. The research methodology was based on the literature review summarizing scholarly literature on the chosen research topic, a questionnaire survey, comparative analysis and logical construction research methods. This study is essential from at least two perspectives: 1) acceptance of novelties is important for the authorities shaping social policies regarding sustainable development and food security; 2) understanding the customers is important for food industry companies that want to introduce new products to the market. Food preferences are often tied to cultural traditions, which can make it difficult for new or unfamiliar foods to gain traction. This is confirmed by the results of the study elaborated in the article: the approach of respondents to innovative food products is ambiguous - they agree that such products are beneficial for people and the Earth's resources, but not always they are ready to use them themselves. The research also shows that innovative products would not be accepted immediately and consumers would need time to get used to them. Therefore, the authorities shaping social policies regarding sustainable development and food security, as well as food producers, should plan educational campaigns explaining the benefits of alternative food sources and innovative food products.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the study is to develop a method of accounting for charity donations to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and to substantiate recommendations regarding their accounting display by business entities. The task of the article is to reveal of the content and research of the normative and legal framework for the regulation of charity activities, characteristics of the current system of accounting for charity expenses, with the aim of identifying problematic issues in the conditions of martial law. The forms of charity (volunteer, humanitarian, philanthropic) are characterized and the types (charitable donation, charitable grants, public collection of charitable donations, charitable servitudes and charitable endowments) and methods of charity activity are substantiated. The characteristic features of charitable assistance are substantiated: voluntariness, selflessness, purposeful activity. The need to regulate certain provisions and clarify the terminological apparatus in the field of charitable activities at the level of current legislation is substantiated. It is proposed to clarify the legislative definition of the content of the category \"charitable activity (charity)\" and introduce additions to the legislative documents of the terms \"charitable assistance\", \"humanitarian activity\", \"patron\", \"patronage assistance\". The revenues of the consolidated state budget of Ukraine in the period from 2014, from the beginning of the occupation of certain territories of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, until now have been analysed. Problematic aspects of the accounting of charitable assistance provided by business entities for the needs of the army are identified and the relevance of solving this methodological issue is substantiated. The obligation to document charitable donations for the benefit of the army with standard forms of documents and the Act of acceptance and transfer of humanitarian (charitable) aid is substantiated, which will confirm the fact of providing charitable aid, ensure the legitimacy of the operations carried out and reduce abuses in this area. The main accounting stages of the provision of charitable assistance are highlighted. The practical value of the study lies in the development of proposals regarding the accounting system for charitable donations to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which will contribute to reducing the risks of erosion of the tax base by business entities, as well as increasing the level of information provision for stakeholders at various levels of management.</jats:p>",

However, under the load disturbances scenario, the optimal control effect is difficult to guarantee. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new control method based on real-time disturbances observation and MPC optimal control. The decoupling of air pressure and air flow is realized by feedback linearization, and then an extended state observer is designed to achieve accurate estimation of load disturbances. Based on the principle of optimal output power of the fuel cell system, the reference trajectory of air pressure and air flow is obtained. Based on this, the optimal MPC controller is designed to achieve accurate tracking of air pressure and air flow by controlling the motor voltage of the air compressor and the opening of the back pressure valve. Under load disturbances, compared with feedback linearization control, improved tracking and robust performances of the proposed strategy can be exhibited through offline and online tests, the net power of PEMFCs is increased by 3%. </jats:p>",

The usage of the following methods was the methodological basis of the research: analysis and synthesis to establish the interrelationship of analytical indicators applied in models for assessing the state of economic security of business entities; theoretical generalization and grouping to substantiate management accounting tools that serve as risk indicators for lowering the level of economic security; comparison in conducting an analytical assessment of actual performance indicators of agricultural enterprises with their indicators. The paper puts forward a hypothesis about the priority of management accounting in information support for safety oriented management and forms a system of indicators used as risk assessment indicators for the activities of agricultural enterprises, including the C/S ratio, the margin of safety, the breakeven point, and the operating leverage factor. The practical value of the scientific research is justified by the proposed approach for assessing the state of economic security of agricultural enterprises, which methodologically expands the toolkit of security specialists and contributes to strengthening the argumentation for funding protective measures to reduce the impact of critical risks and threats. The testing of the proposed approach to modelling the state of economic security has revealed catastrophic risks associated with the inefficient cost structure of domestic agricultural enterprises. In conditions of a decrease in the market volume for agricultural products, this leads to a sharp increase in the losses of activities and a decline in the level of economic security.</jats:p>",

Uneven scattering of industrial capacities across the EU determines the unequal distribution of wealth among the member states. The EU economy's Green Deal strategy determines the necessity of developing new technologies in both existing industries and developing new ones.  The research emphasises two theories concerning territorial development issues. Circular cumulative causation theory and economic geography distinguish the development of industry, especially the manufacturing sector, as a crucial aspect of the economic development of a particular area. The symbiosis of both theories provides guidelines for a balanced approach to territory economic development capabilities in light of industry sustainability requirements in the present-day economy. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the combined circular cumulative causation and economic geography theory analysis approach by comparing the potential for the development of the green hydrogen industry in Latvia and Estonia. Hydrogen is one of the most likely energy sources to replace fossil fuels in the coming decades, and it possesses high potential for transportation, manufacturing, energy supply, and other sectors of the economy. The study established the research pattern within theoretical bases and identified general trends concerning an assessment framework, which can lead to unbalanced values in the industry’s potential evaluation process. The findings of the evaluation of the green hydrogen industry indicate Estonia's slight advantage over Latvia.</jats:p>",

Despite the mentioned natural advantages, Georgia's agriculture has been facing significant challenges, in particular local production is underdeveloped, food safety is not protected and the food self-sufficiency ratio is low. In the context of agricultural development support programs, legislative regulation of cooperative activities and an association agreement signed with the European Union, the development and revival of agriculture was expected, which should have been a prerequisite for the possibility of opening the European Union market for Georgian agricultural products; however, in the context of land fragmentation, it’s still not possible to stimulate the production and export of agricultural products. The aim of the article is to assess the role of cooperatives in the process of development of agriculture and integration into the trade area of the European Union. The main reason for the failure of ongoing reforms in the field of agriculture is its inconsistency and imperfect laws, which leads to the inability of individual state programs to support agricultural value chain. Thus, in order to ensure the success of the reform, it is necessary to stimulate cooperatives using systematic and integrated approaches, which means, first of all, increasing the access of cooperatives to land, providing training services, technological, marketing support, providing preferences in public procurement, ensuring compliance with the conditions of product standardization and continuity of supply to enter the EU market.</jats:p>",

Several characteristics are identified for each of them: degree of freshness, energy value, amounts of protein, vitamins, micro- and macronutrients as well as various additives etc. However, the main characteristics of quality food of animal origin relate to its healthiness and safety for the consumer. From the perspective of a producer, quality represents specific characteristics to be achieved by the producer, and product quality is one of the basic elements of economic development to produce competitive products. Food production and processing, especially food of animal origin, is a complicated process that involves several stages and production process deviations affected by risk factors, and the elimination of the deviations is usually associated with significant financial expenses. Risk factors can appear at one or more stages and pass from one production stage to another, thereby negatively affecting the subsequent stages and the final product. In the production of venison, one of the groups of risk factors relates to venison harvesting, pre-processing and storage. Properly processed venison is usually clean and its microbiological contamination is not high, while non-compliance with venison storage requirements as well as bacterial contamination of venison in case of the non-compliance with storage requirements should be considered as a cause of possible materialization of some risks. Therefore, the present research aims to identify changes in venison quality important to the consumer during venison harvesting and storage. Microbiological control of venison is an important factor that affects the quality of the product, its shelf life and, in the long term, the competitiveness of the enterprise in the market. The research has found that venison could be stored for 45 to 50 days in vacuum packaging at a temperature of +3 to +4 ̊C, provided that all the hygiene requirements are met during venison processing, which makes it possible not only to sell the product in the domestic market but also export the fresh venison.</jats:p>",

The supply chain for maritime containers has faced considerable obstacles as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous factors, such as port closures, travel restrictions, and a decreased workforce, have impacted the supply chain. The risk of cargo theft, piracy, and other security events has increased as a result of these difficulties. Therefore, it is essential to look at the risk variables that may affect the security of the marine container supply chain during the pandemic. This research paper highlights those risks through the following three indexes: the likelihood index (LI), severity index (SI), and average risk index (ARI) by analyzing 64 risk factors that were prepared and designed by incorporating the Delphi expert survey technique to prepare a systematic questionnaire. The article addresses worries over the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on international supply networks. The causes of the most recent global shipping industry disruptions and their impact on supply chains have been thoroughly examined. In order to reduce the number of disruptions in global supply chains and lower the direct and indirect costs for consumers, the authors have also mentioned the necessary actions that must be implemented. The results concluded after the analysis pointed to “management activities,” such as human resources or the working environment as having the highest possibility of going wrong, whereas “operation activities” were judged to likely be the fatal ones if the security of maritime containers was ever compromised. The main objective of the study is to evaluate how the COVID-19 epidemic may affect international shipping, particularly container shipping, which is currently the most important link in the world’s multimodal land–sea supply chains.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of PLA (polylactic acid) film, as an alternative to petroleum-based bags, on the shelf-life of fresh-cut wild rocket and sea fennel grown in a cascade cropping system (CCS). To this end, wild rocket (main crop) was cultivated using either peat or compost as a growing medium. Sea fennel (secondary crop) was subsequently grown in a floating system with leachates from the primary crop as a nutrient solution. The leaves of both crops were harvested and packaged in OPP- (oriented polypropylene) or PLA-based bags and stored for 7 days at 4 °C. The leaves of wild rocket and sea fennel showed lower dehydration and lower respiration when compost was used as a growing medium or leachate. Wild rocket in compost increased in nitrate and vitamin C contents at harvest while leachates had scarce influence on their contents in sea fennel. After storage, regardless of the crop, no relevant detrimental changes were observed on leaves packaged with PLA, being a product microbiologically safer when compared to OPP. The bag type had almost no influence on most relevant phytochemical compounds. In conclusion, the use of a PLA-based film on minimally processed wild rocket and sea fennel leaves is a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based plastic for a short food supply chain.</jats:p>"

The two outer layers are 3D‐printed using a calcium‐crosslinked mixture ink containing soy protein isolate, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium alginate, and combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P). The inner layer is one patch of poly (lactic‐<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>‐glycolic acid)‐based electrospun fibers loaded with tirapazamine (TPZ). The preferentially released CA4P destroys the preexisting blood vessels and prevents neovascularization, which obstructs the external energy supply to cancer cells but aggravates hypoxic condition.

Together these processes induce apoptosis, block the intracellular energy supply, counteract the disadvantage of CA4P in favoring intratumor angiogenesis, and suppress tumor metastasis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Ukraine, land is an important resource for agricultural enterprises. Such enterprises cannot function without land, which is the main means of production. The long history of land reform has led to significant violations in the course of legal relations established since the initial acquisition of ownership of the land plot, the land share (share) so far, including violation of the terms of the moratorium, conclusion of agreements, restricting the right of use of the land plot, non-conformity of the actual boundaries of the land plot with the borders fixed in the documentation on land management etc. The process of adapting existing national accounting standards to the requirements of international accounting standards and international financial reporting standards on the formation of an intangible asset as a land lease right is supported by a number of regulatory legal acts approved by the Government of Ukraine in the recent period. Their effectiveness in extremely difficult conditions (under martial law) is particularly relevant because the use of agricultural land for its intended purposes ensures agricultural production and contributes to the country’s economic and food security. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the conceptual basis of accounting for the right to lease a land plot by allocating it as part of intangible assets. The solution of the tasks is achieved by applying general scientific methods (system analysis, generalization) and specific methods of scientific research (economic and statistical, observation, comparison etc.). The subject of the study is the allocation of the object of accounting - the right to lease land as an intangible asset. The article reveals the basic principles of international and national accounting standards of rights to lease land in the intangible assets of business entities. It was noted that Ukrainian legislation (especially those under martial law) has been amended to ensure the targeted use of agricultural land and to avoid food security risks. The process of formation of the object of accounting, in particular the right to lease agricultural land as a type of intangible asset, the criteria for the right to use land parcels, ensuring their inclusion in the composition of intangible assets, have been identified. Emphasis is placed on the need to conduct an audit (legal and technical component) before obtaining rights to land. Thus, the role and functional features of audit in the reliability of providing the legal component of the reflection of intangible assets, in particular the right to lease agricultural land, have been identified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a zoonotic disease that can affect both poultry and humans. Since 2005, the Vietnam government has implemented a national vaccination campaign to prevent the spread of avian influenza (AI). In 2021, the first outbreak of HPAI H5N8 was reported in a chicken farm in Quang Ninh province. To understand the stakeholders linked to the AI campaign, and their roles within the vaccine supply chain, we conducted a cross-sectional study from November 2021–January 2022.  We purposively selected 114 participants, including 71 poultry farmers using HPAI vaccines, 16 veterinary drug store owners, 18 commune animal health workers (CAHWs), 8 staff from the Centers for Agricultural Services (ATSCs), and one vaccine distributor who were interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Three HPAI vaccines (H5N1 clade 1 &amp; 2.3.2.1, H5N1 clade 2.3.4 and H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1b) were used, and they were effective against the locally circulating virus strains. Distributors stored vaccines at the required temperature and transported them in appropriate vehicles. Vaccines remained in the supply chain for 3–5 months within their 12-month shelf-life period. The free government vaccination campaign, implemented by CAHWs, and administered by the ATSCs, reached 61% of small-scale poultry farms with a 1.21% vaccine wastage rate. Large-scale poultry farms followed the national campaign but paid a fee for the vaccines. We recommend expanding the support for AI vaccination to increase the vaccination rate among large-scale poultry farms, selecting higher efficacy seed vaccines, and that smaller dose vaccine vials are available for cost-effective vaccination.</jats:p>"

Por lo tanto, el suministro de agua potable y el saneamiento ha llevado a los expertos a explorar nuevos enfoques y estrategias para su gestión. Ubicándose en esta línea de trabajo el presente documento explora los indicadores de evaluación de desempeño para la gestión del recurso hídrico aplicados a los servicios de abastecimiento de agua a nivel nacional e internacional. El objetivo consiste en proponer indicadores relacionados con los enfoques de gestión del agua, orientados al derecho humano al agua y a un medio ambiente sano, y armonizando con el ODS-6 se plantea evaluar tanto los indicadores cualitativos, como cuantitativos, a través de una revisión de la literatura y criterios de selección como: aplicabilidad, relevancia, datos existentes, así como, características locales de manejo que le dan al recurso hídrico. Aplicando al estudio de caso el Sistema de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de León, Guanajuato (SAPAL). La investigación aplicó la metodología Análisis Jerárquico de Procesos (AHP), indicando aquellos indicadores relevantes para la gestión del recurso hídrico bajo la perspectiva de soluciones multidisciplinares, integrales y sostenibles para el servicio de abastecimiento de agua; con lo cual pudo verificarse la disponibilidad de datos para la aplicación de los indicadores propuestos. Se concluye que a partir de este planteamiento se cuenta con indicadores que consideren los enfoques en materia socioambiental que impacten en la gestión sostenible del agua de manera que coadyuve al diseño, seguimiento, evaluación y toma de decisiones de políticas públicas enfocadas a los organismos operadores de manera integral.</jats:p>"
