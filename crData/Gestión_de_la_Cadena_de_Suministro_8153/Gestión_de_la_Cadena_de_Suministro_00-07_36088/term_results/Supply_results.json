Several researchers have estimated the cultivator supply response to different techno-economic factors (Cummings, 1975a and 1975b; Askari and Cummings, 1977; Cooley, 1973; Chen, Courteny and Schmitz, 1972; Ghoshal, 1975; Tweeten, 1986). However, as agriculture modernises, the relative significance of different factors affecting farm inputs and outputs changes; factors regarded as significant determinants of farmer decision at one time may not be relevant at another time. Similarly, the transformation of agriculture in the desirable direction invariably necessitates and at times renders desirable the use of new measures and policy instruments. How farmers react to changes in market forces and government measures is important to know in different ways. In fact, policy makers are interested in knowing the appropriateness, effectiveness and impact of measures for the ultimate formation or legislation of farm regulations.</jats:p>",

Price‐based, value‐based, and activity‐based cost management approaches to target costing are discussed, and recommendations for their use based upon customer requirements and supply chain relationships are offered.

These virtual organizations are characterized by a confederation of specialist skills or capabilities provided by the network members. It is argued that in turbulent environments such collaborative arrangements can provide a more effective means of satisfying customer needs at a profit than the single firm undertaking multiple value‐creating activities. The implications of the network organization for relationship management are considerable. In particular, the challenges to logistics management are profound. The analysis of relationships is clearly linked to competitive strategy in a network context, yet the exploration of the interface between relationships, strategy and supply chain management is far from complete. Therefore, this paper seeks to conceptualize the relationship strategy interface in supply chain contexts. A framework is proposed and its basic principles illustrated through an analysis of the development of relationship strategies between leading market players in the UK brewing industry.</jats:p>",

Evaluating the quality of the training received, grouping the retailers, and detecting significant differences among the groups will enable the bodies organising and/or giving courses to diversify their offerings in terms of the characteristics of those receiving training. They will also be able to determine the strengths and weaknesses of these courses at an overall level as well as for each of the groups.

Because of rapid changes in technology and ongoing engineering changes, all parts subject to obsolescence are purchased only for the current customer order. The procurement lead times of the components are random. Moreover, although the order for the finished product has a defined due date, the contract allows the customer to change the order quantity. Consequently, the assembler also faces a random demand. The assembler must determine how much to order and when to order each component part. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, including the cost of holding components prior to their assembly, penalties for tardiness visa-vis the assembly due date, and overage and underage costs in satisfying the demand quantity. We present some structural results and discuss insights regarding optimal policies. We also present several simple heuristic policies and compare them to optimal policies. Computational results indicate that ignoring lead time variability can be costly, but relatively simple heuristics that consider lead time variability perform quite well. </jats:p>",

This paper explores and develops the concept of enterprise logistics [Greis, N.P., Kasarda, J.D., 1997. Enterprise logistics in the information age. California Management Review 39 (3), 55–78] as a tool for integrating the logistics activities both within and between the strategically aligned organizations of the extended enterprise. Specifically, this paper examines the fit between an organization's enterprise logistics integration capabilities and its supply chain structure. Using a configurations approach, we test whether globally dispersed network organizations that adopt enterprise logistics practices are able to achieve higher levels of organizational performance. Results indicate that enterprise logistics is a necessary tool for the coordination of supply chain operations that are geographically dispersed around the world. However, for a pure network structure, a high level of enterprise logistics integration alone does not guarantee improved organizational performance. The paper ends with a discussion of managerial implications and directions for future research.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Effects of seasonal and interannual variations of the net freshwater supply (runoff plus rainfall minus evaporation) on salinity variation within the bay were also examined. Particular attention was paid to the effects of runoff, which are the focus of ambitious plans to restore and conserve the Florida Bay ecosystem. From 1965 to 1995 the annual runoff from the Everglades into the bay was less than one tenth of the annual direct rainfall onto the bay, while estimated annual evaporation slightly exceeded annual rainfall. The average net freshwater supply to the bay over a year was thus approximately zero, and interannual variations in salinity appeared to be affected primarily by interannual fluctuations in rainfall. At the annual scale, runoff apparently had little effect on the bay as a whole during this period. On a seasonal basis, variations in rainfall, evaporation, and runoff were not in phase, and the net freshwater supply to the bay varied between positive and negative values, contributing to a strong seasonal pattern in salinity, especially in regions of the bay relatively isolated from exchanges with the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Changes in runoff could have a greater effect on salinity in the bay if the seasonal patterns of rainfall and evaporation and the timing of the runoff are considered. One model was also used to simulate spatial and temporal patterns of salinity responses expected to result from changes in net freshwater supply. Simulations in which runoff was increased by a factor of 2 (but with no change in spatial pattern) indicated that increased runoff will lower salinity values in eastern Florida Bay, increase the variability of salinity in the South Region, but have little effect on salinity in the Central and West Regions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> COLIN MASON IS PROFESSOR OF Economic Geography at the University of Southampton, England; Richard Harrison is Director of the Centre for Entrepreneurship and Professor of Management, University of Aberdeen, Scotland. The need to increase the availability of small-scale early stage venture capital has been recognised as a key factor in the development of an entrepreneurial economy. Informal venture capital plays a key role in financing the earliest stages of entrepreneurial growth ventures. This paper is an exploratory attempt to identify the factors that influence the supply of informal venture capital. A questionnaire survey of business angels sought to examine the macro-economic factors that influence the proportion of their personal investment portfolio allocated to investments in unquoted small businesses. The findings indicate that tax is the most significant influence on the willingness of business angels to make such investments whereas the economic environment-the rate of economic growth, interest rates and the rate of inflation-exerts a much mote modest influence. </jats:p>",
