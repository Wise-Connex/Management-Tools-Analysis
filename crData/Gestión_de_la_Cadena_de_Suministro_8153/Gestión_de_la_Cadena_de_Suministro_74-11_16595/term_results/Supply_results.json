The animals were given 10 mg of F<jats:sup>‐</jats:sup> per kg body weight daily during 14 weeks. During this period, excessive periosteal bone formation occurred at the lateral part of the tibial middiaphysis. The newly formed bone contained more fluoride than the average experimental bone, but the data suggested a similar “fluoride pressure” on each part of the cortex. Thus the localization of the periosteal bone formation was not regarded due to differences in “fluoride pressure”. The magnesium concentration was higher in the experimental bone than in the control bone. However, any relationship between fluoride and magnesium concentrations was not observed.</jats:p>",

During the period from flowering to fruiting, nitrogenase activity and accumulation of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C‐photosynthates in the nodules declined by 60%, whereas the photosynthesis of the plant doubled. Studies of the translocation of the photosynthates within the plant during this period suggested that this might be due to an increase from 17% to 50% of the photosynthates which accumulated at the shoot apex. Consistent increases in nitrogenase activity over the 24 hours following removal of the shoot apex were only achieved in fruiting plants, however, although vegetative, flowering and fruiting plants all showed increased accumulation of photosynthates in the nodules. Continuous removal of flowers as they were formed over a 2‐week period resulted in a large increase in accumulation of photosynthates in the nodules and in nitrogenase activity.</jats:p><jats:p>Other factors which may regulate nitrogenase activity in these plants are discussed.</jats:p>",
