Sobrid) grown in nutrient solution with low FeEDDHA concentrations during preculture. In contrast to conditions for plants adequately supplied with iron, suboptimal iron supply leads to temporary Fe stress with rhythmic rates of uptake and translocation of iron (period 2–4 days). This rhythmic behaviour of iron uptake is associated with corresponding changes in morphology (thickening of root tips) and physiology (increase in reducing capacity) of the roots. Iron stress is alleviated within less than one day if sufficient iron is available. This is indicated by normalisation of root morphology, reducing capacity and rate of iron uptake and translocation. This rhythm in iron uptake stresses the importance of rhythmic patterns of biochemical behaviour in complex biological systems. It is suggested that phytohormones are involved in the transformation of the iron nutritional status of the shoot apex into a “signal” for the uptake sites of iron in the roots. Preliminary experiments with sunflower in calcareous soil indicate an ecological importance of this fine regulation mechanism for plants on soil with a low iron availability, manifested in rhythmic iron stress reactions.</jats:p>",

The growth of both N‐fertilized and symbiotic plants was inhibited by salt. Ammonium nitrate moderated salt stress most strongly during the later period of growth (after 31 days). Growth inhibition of N‐fertilized plants was associated with excess Cl accumulation in shoots, which occurred regardless of N treatment. Additional effects could account for the greater inhibition in symbiotic plants. Salt delayed nodulation, and N‐treated plants showed greater retention of Na in roots and lower concentrations of Na in shoots than completely symbiotic plants</jats:p><jats:p>The data indicate a clear need for greater salt tolerance in chickpea.

The vascular pattern to the rat CP and GP is described utilizing vascular endocasts and scanning electronmicroscopy in aging, normotensive rats. Endocasts were produced by intra-cardiac infusion of Batson's Corrosion Compound. The vascular pattern is complex, involving 1) recurrent vessels from the anterior cerebral artery, 2) branches from the arterial circle rostral or caudal to the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), 3) up to 6 branches from the MCA, and 4) 2 major branches from the caudal part of the arterial circle. The vessels in groups 1--3 were serpentine, their luminal diameters abruptly reduced at branch points, and the angle of departure from the parent vessels approximated 90 degrees. These vessels supplied much of the CP and GP, while group 4 supplied the caudal CP with vessels arranged in a lattice-like fashion from the 2 penetrating parental arteries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Overnight fasting significantly increases plasma inorganic phosphate ([Pi]p) in rats previously fed low Pi diet (LPD), whereas it slightly decreases [Pi]p in rats previously fed high Pi diet (HPD). We assessed the role of the kidney in these differing responses by investigating the influence of overnight fasting on renal tubular capacity to reabsorb Pi by clearance technique in conscious rats. To also evaluate the effect of Pi deprivation during overnight fasting three groups of animals were studied: fed, completely fasted, and fasted with a Pi supply in the drinking water. In intact LPD and HPD rts the tubular Pi reabsorptive capacity was not different between fed and completely fasted rats. It was, however, found to be lower in fasted but Pi-supplied than in fed animals, indicating a decrease by overnight fasting with respect to all nutrients except Pi, i.e., by fasting per se. Conversely, it was higher in the animals completely fasted than in those fasted but Pi-supplied, showing an increase by overnight Pi deprivation. These two opposite effects explain the absence of any significant influence of overnight complete fasting on tubular Pi handling. The same results were obtained in thyroparathyroidectomized rats on low Pi intake. This study shows that the kidney can adapt its transport capacity for Pi according to changes in Pi supply within 12 h. It also suggests that it may react by a decrease in reabsorption to the reduction in Pi utilization that can be expected to occur during fasting per se. Furthermore, our data explain how the kidney, by adapting its tubular Pi transport to the prior dietary intake of Pi, can account for the difference in phosphatemic response to overnight fasting and consequently in the diurnal fluctuation of [Pi]p observed between LPD and HPD animals. </jats:p>",
