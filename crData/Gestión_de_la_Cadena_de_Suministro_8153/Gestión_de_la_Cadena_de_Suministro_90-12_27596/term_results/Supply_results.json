Lake States aspen utilization increased greatly in the last 10 years and during the period 1982-87 accounted for 47-55% of the total pulpwood harvest. In 1987, removals were estimated at 286 million ft ft³ and growth at 282 million ft³ Canadian aspen utilization has also increased dramatically since 1980 and is expected to expand as demand for structural flakeboard and hardwood pulp increases. Even with increased use, less than 10% of the Canadian allowable cut is being utilized. Despite evidence on the importance of aspen on the economy of the U.S. Lake States and Canada, only a minor amount of research has been undertaken in the last 10 years to genetically improve and/or maintain the existing aspen resource.

Employees were clustered using variables relating to their work histories, current job attributes, employment expectations and personal attributes. Five clusters of employees were identified, which differed markedly in their past, present and expected future labour market behaviour. The main theoretical tenets of segmentation theorists were supported, in as much as the labour market was found to foster and perpetuate the advantages and disadvantages of identifiable groups of workers. The analyses presented in the paper suggest that this structuring of the labour supply is both complex and varied, giving rise, for example to several markedly different types of secondary workers. Examples are given of how this segmentation approach to analyzing labour markets can further our understanding of related phenomena, such as the position of women in the labour market and work values. </jats:p>",

We are able to successfully estimate an “accelerator” type model of plant deliveries, driven by movements in employment and the after‐tax cost of corporate capital. Our model can be used to estimate a measure of excess plant capacity in the market, and historic values of this measure do move parallel to some recent industrial vacancy data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent months have brought a steady procession of well publicized food scares-some more perceived than real—that have alarmed consumers and drawn attention to the surveillance and inspection activities of various regulatory programs. Investigations by Congressional committees, the General Accounting Office and others have revealed significant shortcomings in program design and execution. Many problems are deeply rooted in a history of food regulation too often characterized by hasty, piecemeal solutions to health threats that have arisen in one food sector or another. Less attention has been paid to examining potential hazards in the food supply as a whole and directing limited federal resources toward areas where risks to health are greatest. </jats:p><jats:p> The result is a system replete with inconsistencies, conflicts and gaps. Nor have regulatory programs kept pace with science. In some instances, regulators continue to use analytical tools that are decades out of date. State governments increasingly are moving into what they perceive as a regulatory vacuum with the best of intentions but the very real prospect of adding to regulatory conflicts and contradictions, without any corresponding benefit to public health. </jats:p><jats:p> There is a pressing need to harmonize and modernizing the food regulatory system as a whole. A growing number of policymakers, consumer groups and industry leaders believe that this can be accomplished through the implementation of a science-based set of regulatory principles known as Hazard Analysis, Critical Control Points (HACCP). These principles, applicable to every link in the food production, processing and distribution chain, focus on the process rather than the product, and seek to control potential hazards at critical points on the farm, in the plant, in the market and elsewhere. However, the introduction of science based systems of food safety assurance will pose numerous challenges to the federal, state and local agencies charged with food regulation. Moreover, since HACCP transfers much of the burden of safety assurance onto the industry itself, its success ultimately depends on the good faith commitment of the food industry. </jats:p><jats:p> The lively dialogue now taking place in the food regulatory arena has widespread implications for other sectors of the economy where government safety assurance activities may also require harmonization and modernization. </jats:p>",

Indeed, a net depletion of nodule starch is observed only under conditions of suboptimal rates of nodule metabolism. Therefore, maximal rates of nodule metabolism are associated with a continual supply of phloem sap to the nodule, delivering water, carbon and other solutes. A restriction of phloem supply to the nodule may result in changes in turgor between the apoplast of the export pathway and the symplast of the nodule. This change may cause the observed decrease in the permeability to gases and to the rate of product export from nodules deprived of a phloem supply.

Growth of <jats:italic>U. fenestrata</jats:italic> was hyperbolically related to tissue N but linearly related to tissue P. Phosphorus‐limited <jats:italic>U. fenestrata</jats:italic> maintained high levels of tissue N, but N‐limited algae became depleted of P. For <jats:italic>E. intestinalis</jats:italic>, tissue N remained at maximum levels during P‐limitation whereas tissue P decreased to about 85% of maximal levels during N‐limitation. Growth rates for <jats:italic>U. fenestrata</jats:italic> decreased faster during P‐limitation than during N‐limitation. Simultaneously, tissue P was depleted faster than tissue N. Our results suggest that comparing tissue N and P of macroalage grown in batch cultures is useful for monitoring the nutritional status of macroalgae.</jats:p>",

These strips can be very effective in protecting the quality of public potable water supply reservoirs by removing sediment and associated pollutants, reducing bank erosion, and displacing activities from the water's edge that represent potential sources of nonpoint source pollutant generation. As part of a comprehensive watershed management protect for the State of New Jersey, a parameter‐based buffer strip model was developed for application to all watersheds above water supply intakes or reservoirs. Input requirements for the model include a combination of slope, width, and time of travel. The application of the model to a watershed in New Jersey with a recommended buffer strip width that ranges from 50 to 300 feet, depending upon a number of assumptions, results in from 6 to 13 percent of the watershed above the reservoir being occupied by the buffer.</jats:p>",
