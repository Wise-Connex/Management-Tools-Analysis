      "abstract": "<jats:p>I investigated the diets of three species of Darwin's ground finches (Geospiza Gould) on Isla Pinta, Galapagos. Diet choice was examined in relation to both the finches' handling efficiency on seed types and the profitability of patches. Handling efficiency on different seed types was related to the size of the finch species. Correspondingly, the two larger finch species generally ignored small seeds with low rewards, and the two smaller finches avoided feeding on seeds apparently too large and hard to crack. In G. fuliginosa, the smallest species, seed choice was correlated with seed depth within the range of seed sizes actually consumed. In addition, the proportion of its diet made up of given seed types was correlated with the profitability of patches within these seeds occurred. Certain seed types providing low individual returns per unit handling time were highly profitable by virtue of their high density within patches. Conversely, large search times between valuable seeds diminished the relative profitability of respective patch types. Diet breadth of G. fuliginosa was investigated in relation to seasonal changes in food supply. Results on seed choice in relation to relative densities of seed types were ambiguous, but a slight shift toward feeding on smaller seeds in the dry season was detected. However, the shift could be explained by the greater profitability of patches of the small seeds in this season. These finches did not generalize their use of patch types, despite a large seasonal decline in food abundance. This result contradicts a prediction of optimal foraging theory. Serval possible explanations for this are discussed, including an hypothesis that when food was abundant finches selected a diet that was less than maximally efficient.</jats:p>",

In this essay, the author delineates two periods of population growth—a small one from 1250 to 1600 and a large one from 1700 to 1850—and relates their spatial and temporal characteristics to agricultural production. His conclusions challenge the popular assumption that frontier populations in China grew because of improved agricultural techniques or increased arable land. In the Southwest, between 1250 and 1600, population doubled because of the government investment in agriculture, but, between 1700 and 1850, population quadrupled because of the development of local mining industry. In Qing China, as elsewhere in the early modern world, major increases in population were often a consequence of early industrialization.</jats:p>",

Root wt. was not changed by different levels of mechanical resistance but root extension growth and cone resistance were curvilinearly related. At high mechanical resistance, root growth was more horizontal; vertical root growth was very limited at high cone resistances. Specific root length was also smaller, root diam. larger and fewer laterals/cm main root were developed although their av. length was not affected. The influence of mechanical resistance on root distribution and morphology reduced nutrient uptake and therefore shoot growth. With low P availability, P limited shoot growth more the higher the mechanical resistance. With sufficient P, K had the same effect. If an aboveground factor such as a low light intensity limited shoot growth, mechanical resistance had no effect on shoot growth.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The oxygenation of intestinal tissue is dependent on the interaction of three distinctive transport processes: 1) convection (i.e., blood flow), 2) diffusion, and 3) chemical reaction. Oxygen is transported to the capillary level by convection. Local adjustments of blood flow in accordance with tissue oxygen demand serve to stabilize capillary oxygen tension. After reaching the capillary, oxygen is transferred into the parenchymal cells by diffusion. Intrinsic modulation of the number of perfused capillaries allows vascular control of exchange surface area and effective capillary-to-cell diffusion distance. On entering the cell, molecular oxygen acts as the electron acceptor responsible for maintaining continuous mitochondrial respiration and the interlinked oxidative formation of ATP. The basic interaction of blood flow, diffusion, and mitochondrial respiration under a variety of conditions are illustrated utilizing a simplified graphic approach. The analysis demonstrates the ability of the flow and exchange controllers, operating in unison, to provide a wide margin of safety against development of cell hypoxia under a variety of stresses. Finally, the role of oxygen, adenosine, and prostaglandins as possible mediators of intrinsic vasoregulation in intestine is discussed. </jats:p>",
