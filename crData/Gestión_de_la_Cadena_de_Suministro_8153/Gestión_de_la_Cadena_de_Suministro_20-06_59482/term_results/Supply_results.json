      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to the research of modern tendencies of defining the essence of supply chain management as an innovative philosophy of spiral business dynamics. The research is based on the generalization and application of the basic principles of wave theory of development, classical theory of marketing, modern provisions of the theory of TQM and conceptual provisions of the theory of spiral dynamics. A new look at supply chain architecture, from identifying growing needs for specific products and ending with utilization, namely the emergence of new links in the chain of transformation of resources such as the stage of intelligent innovation processes to create modifications and upgrades or design a new product to meet growing needs. A multicomponent process of change is considered in view of current trends. The application of the theory of the spiral dynamics of the supply chains is a logical and predictable extrapolation of the general tendencies of the development of the life support system and the growing needs of society, starting from the “subsistence economy” and to the creation of modern global economic associations such as transnational corporations and international transport corridors. economic associations of countries and international programs of scientific search in the field of artificial intelligence and development of the cosmos.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The constantly rising supply chain risk probabilities and increasingly negative performance impact on the supply chain force us to rethink and define an effective supply chain risk management approach. When a certain risk occurs, all internal and external stakeholders along the entire supply chain are affected. Therefore, it is essential to drive a holistic end-to-end supply chain risk management by setting up a dedicated supply chain risk management organisation with interfaces to all relevant business functions, by implementing an customised supply chain risk management process and by putting digital information technologies (eg artificial intelligence [AI]) in place in order to enable the process. The organisation builds a solid fundament and acceptance environment of the process implementation, while the process determines the strategic direction and scope of the information technologies selection. Only a clear vision, mission, strategy and roadmap can ensure and keep the enterprise-wide supply chain risk management programme running in the most efficient way. The systematic set-up of risk and business continuity management in the supply chain requires a sophisticatedly designed organisational structure and a comprehensive stakeholder management. An independent supply chain risk management organisation could be a recommended option in order to drive this strategic topic without any target conflicts between different business functions. The coverage and responsibility share between supply chain risk management and enterprise risk management must be aligned in order to use the existing enterprise-wide risk governance framework, methodology of risk quantification and risk management knowledge. A corporate supply chain risk management process defines a standard approach with roles and responsibilities and should cover the entire risk management cycle: identification, analysis and evaluation, treatment, monitoring and review. Both preventive and reactive supply chain risk management approaches should be considered and integrated as a complete concept. With advanced intelligent information technology, for example machine learning or risk management tools, the complete supply chain risk management process can be automated and digitalised. The process can be managed with minimum human effort and maximum benefit for the entire enterprise.</jats:p>"

Different approaches to the construction of conceptual foundations, structure and functionality of this area are considered. The meaning of the term “logistics of the defense sector” is substantiated. The spheres and functionality of military logistics are outlined. The conditions for the integration of logistics and medical support systems, which are able to provide support to all components of the defense forces and the civilian population of the country, have been studied. The research is based on the main strategic goals of the state in the framework of defense reform: the National Security Strategy of Ukraine to ensure Ukraine’s integration into the European Union and the formation of conditions for NATO membership. Approaches to structuring definitions and concepts of modern military logistics taking into account the military-political realities of Ukraine are offered. The term “military logistics” is proposed to be interpreted in two ways: first, as a practical activity (a means of implementing operational, tactical or strategic tasks of the defense sector in real resources and time); secondly, as a scientific field aimed at developing models for optimizing the logistics processes of the state defense sector.</jats:p>"

The problem of logistics potential development for the railway transportation companies with a purpose of strengthening its competitive positions is actualized in the conditions of railway transportation market liberalization and deregulation.\nPurpose: to develop a methodology for railway enterprises logistics potential evaluation by supplementing it with qualitative parameters (by applying the hierarchy analysis model) and thus expanding its scope. In particular, when assessing competitiveness.\nMethods: the hierarchy analysis model by T. Saati; expert evaluation method; the integral index of competitiveness evaluation method.\nConclusions and value added: The enterprises logistics potential evaluation method with hierarchy analysis model usage was further developed. The logistics potential assessment problem is presented in a form of three-tier hierarchy of criteria. The hierarchy consists of eighteen third-level criteria and five second-level criteria, which compose a comprehensive system of indicators for railway enterprise logistics potential assessing. The qualitative parameters were obtained for enterprises logistics potential criteria evaluation. The research with the described method usage allowed to distinguish the components of logistical potential according to their level of importance in terms of strategic priorities for the industry development in general and the target market requirements; and to identify those criteria, the consideration of which will allow to increase the railway transport enterprises competitiveness. This approach expands the enterprise’s logistics potential methodology scope, especially when assessing competitiveness, helps to choose a further strategic direction.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the robustness of the e-Tap is evaluated in the laboratory regarding (1) accuracy of the flow meter and (2) the flow rate reduction caused by addition of a y-strainer and debris build-up. An average relative error of +3.63% across varying flow rates is found. A general calibration will bring 95.45% of measurements within a ±4.54% error range. In the y-strainer, smaller gauze sizes, smaller debris sizes, and higher debris loads cause greater flow rate reductions. The maximum reduction observed was only approximately 68% of the baseline flow rate. These physical findings can be integrated into software solutions to management problems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An analysis of the performance of modern companies has revealed a trend of active investment in innovation, especially in such a dynamic field as logistics in order to optimize supply chains. The article proves the need for a systematic approach to innovative measures in the transportation and distribution system based on the analysis of foreign experience. The dynamism of logistics processes complicates the process of control and forecasting of enterprises. The logistics trend of DHL, which regularly publishes a key tool for the global logistics community, is a radar of logistics trends that reflects the development of society, business and technology. Two major trends are analyzed: 1) social and business and 2) technological. To solve this problem, the process of digitization and the willingness of companies to work online with the help of e-commerce technology have been proposed. Two components of modern innovative business models that enable a business to be competitive and efficient are analyzed: the sharing economy and the marketplace in the logistics services market. It is determined that the main resources in logistics are material assets (especially warehouses and vehicles), labor and time. It is established that transport exchanges are actively developing in the Ukrainian market, where logisticians can choose vehicles, but there are no sites where one can simply choose a warehouse on demand (as a service). There are no tools in the Ukrainian market for quick search and safe rent of warehouses for different types of products. Searching for a warehouse is a complicated and lengthy procedure for the following reasons: the lack of a warehouse database in one source and the complexity of comparing warehouses (search on OLX.ua or through a local or international broker, or on the recommendation of acquaintances), the risks of renting warehouses from unverified agents / owners, the procedure for selecting and concluding warehouse lease agreements, the need for warehouses under peak load, continued. Therefore, in 2019, a new Ware Teka online platform has emerged for finding warehouses for rent or purchase with the largest warehouse real estate base to date, allowing real estate to be rented as soon as possible. The basic features of the Ware Teka online platform are analyzed. It is determined that modern logistics companies in Ukraine have started to implement the system of routing of goods (delivery on points of sale) and receive constant errors, therefore the process of digitization of current deliveries in real time is offered. The Ukrainian market for foreign startups is not interesting for today, and they are not ready to costomize, or costomization will have a very high cost and it is necessary to consider the issues of support after adaptation of the ready solution, to make a premature request about the main problems of adaptation of software products of automation of logistics processes. Support is an important cycle in working with your ISP to be able to refine or modify the software in the future and not be dependent on your provider, so you need to request technical documentation immediately. The importance of automation of logistic processes of transportation and distribution has been proved.</jats:p>"

Cargo owners are relatively more focused on the improvement of internal processes and treat AEO certification as a privilege that helps them achieve a high level of efficiency.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study fills the existing literature gap as it focuses on the differences between two distinct groups (cargo owners and service providers) in terms of their perception of the AEO certification. As empirical research in this area is scarce, especially at the cross-country level, this study also significantly complements knowledge on AEO certification in the EU.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because of the eco-consciousness and the environmental protection companies become ’green’, therefore many green supply chains are realized in the business sphere. Companies of green supply chain take care on the environmental protection. These companies try to decrease the pollution, so they implement some eco-conscious processes. The green supply chains contain these companies. The biggest problem is the coordination of these chains. Nowadays, supply chains have many members, so the cooperation is getting more and more difficult. It could be a potential good solution, if the chain members use the different contract types to coordinate the chain. Contract tries to handle the inequality between the chain members and gives a framework to the cooperation of chain members. This paper introduces the wholesale pricing contract, which can be used in the case of green supply chain and its different settings effectively. The wholesale pricing contract is one of the traditional contract types but it produces different performance in the case of centralized and decentralized setting. Centralized setting has a chain leader – this member operates and coordinates the whole chain and defines common goals for the members. In decentralized setting the members define their own goals and they act in accordance with their own interest. A simulation with numerical example is also included to represent the difference between the two settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Concerns about water affordability have centered on access to networked services in low-income countries, but have grown in high-income countries as water, sewer, and stormwater tariffs, which fund replacement of aging infrastructure and management of demand, have risen. The political context includes a UN-recognized human right to water and a set of Sustainable Development Goals that explicitly reference affordable services in water, sanitation, and other sectors. Affordability has traditionally been measured as the ratio of combined water and sewer bills divided by total income or expenditures. Subjective decisions are then made about what constitutes an “affordable” ratio, and the fraction paying more than this is calculated. This measurement approach typically omits the coping costs associated with poor supply, notably the time costs of carrying water home. Three less commonly used approaches include calculating (a) the expenditure related to procuring a “lifeline” quantity of water as a percent of income or expenditures, (b) the amount of income left for other needs after water and sewer expenditures are subtracted, and (c) the number of hours of minimum wage work needed to purchase an essential quantity of water.</p>\n               <p>Lowering water rates for all customers does not necessarily help those in need in low- and middle-income countries. This includes tariff structures that subsidize the price of water in the lowest block or tier (i.e., lifeline blocks) for all customers, not just the poor. Affordability programs that do not operate through tariffs can be characterized by (a) how they are administered and funded, (b) how they target the poor, and (c) how they deliver subsidies to the poor. Common types of delivery mechanisms include subsidizing public taps for unconnected households, subsidizing or financing the fees associated with obtaining a connection to the piped network, and subsidizing monthly bills for poor households. Means-tested consumption subsidies are most common in industrialized countries, whereas subsidizing public taps and connection fees are more common in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n               <p>A final challenge is directing subsidies to renters who are more likely to be poor and who do not have a direct relationship with a water utility because they pay for water through their landlord, either included as part of their rent or as a separate water payment. Based on data from the 2013 American Housing Survey, approximately 21% of all housing units in the United States are occupied by this type of “hard to reach” customer, although not all of them would be considered poor or eligible for an assistance program. This ratio is as high as 74% of all housing units in metropolitan areas like New York City. Because of data limitations, there are no similar estimates in low-income countries.</p>\n               <p>Instead of sector-by-sector affordability policies, governments might do better to think about the entire package of services a poor person has a perceived right to consume. Direct income support, calculated to cover a package of basic services, could then be delivered to the poor, preserving their autonomy to make spending decisions and preserving the appropriate signals about resource scarcity.</p>"

The main priority areas of using certain types of logistics services in the world and in Ukraine are identified. The object of research is the process of digitalization of logistics services through the influence of e-commerce. Analysis of the current state of logistics services in the world and in Ukraine, revealed a trend of active investment in innovative logistics services and stimulating the need for distribution services is growing much faster than in the current cycle due to demand for goods purchased online, especially food. The article considers the essence and features of the logistics activities of e-commerce. The main components of logistics functions are studied and the main tasks of e-commerce logistics activity are determined. The structure of connectivity of trade and technological process operations in e-commerce enterprises is considered. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks of the development of electronic commerce of logistics services are also identified. The impact on the development of logistics services through global changes in the world and prospects for development in Ukraine, with an emphasis on marketing tools to promote services. The positive and negative factors influencing the development of e-commerce of Ukrainian enterprises are analyzed and singled out. Authors identified further opportunities for the development of logistics services through the use of e-commerce, namely the development of modern technologies and Internet availability, which will change the consciousness of consumers and the growth of online users, rapid business growth and the formation of new market segments, cost-effectiveness of advertising channels to the target audience. The authors determine that e-commerce in Ukraine is in a state of active development and has great potential. E-commerce has advantages over traditional forms of business, as it provides an opportunity to increase productivity. E-commerce has a low barrier to market entry, including global. As a result, it significantly reduces the cost of the business and increases the efficiency of its management. Authors identified the main trends in the development of e-commerce: increasing the activity of Internet users, their adaptation and loyalty to online shopping, trust in Internet services and resources, which are rapidly expanding their range. Authors determined that the main problem of e-commerce in Ukraine is inadequate legislative regulation of their activities, incentives and regulations. There is growing competition in online formats where established online sales giants have formed, so not all retailers can easily switch from one format to another, and it is determined that such companies need discounts on rental in the warehouse segment in order to be able to ensure their livelihood.</jats:p>"

The role of air transport in the world economy is emphasized because its weight grows every year, because it provides the development of tourism, international programs and cooperation between individual regions of the world. There has been an increase in the number of multinational corporations, increasing the mobility of business passengers what is very important for the airlines. The critical analysis of scientific publications made it possible to state that in Ukraine and abroad the development of the air transportation market was studied by many scientists and their contribution to solving a number of scientific problems related to identifying prospects and opportunities for international and national air transportation markets as well as with the optimization of air carriers is important. However, it was found that insufficient research on recent trends and prospects for the development of global and national air transport markets is in the face of new challenges including the outbreak of coronavirus infection COVID-19. It was found that air passenger traffic in the global market has grown steadily in recent years by 7-8% every year and a quarter of sales depend on the regularity of air transportation of which 70% of this type of business determine the vectors of market expansion. The analysis of aviation accidents revealed that they have a very significant impact on the performance of the carrier whose aircraft suffered them. This applies to both reputational and purely financial losses. The problems with the Boeing 737 Max type also became a serious challenge for the aviation industry due to a number of incorrect design decisions of the world’s leading aviation concern and attempts to save on the training of pilots of this type of aircraft. It is noted that modern passengers are trying to minimize the time spent on travel, the trend of fragmentation of the holiday period is growing rapidly. As a result of the analysis of the domestic air transportation market, it was revealed that during 2019 there was an expansion of the market in general, as well as the activities of foreign airlines, travel from Ukraine to Europe and other parts of the world increased rapidly. A radical change in market trends was observed in mid-March 2020, when due to the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus in the world, quarantine was introduced and regular flights were stopped. The national air carrier Ukraine International Airlines has declared a two-stage period of resumption of work after the end of quarantine. The authors found signs of hybridization of the airline’s business models at the first stage of the restart and the transition to the airline’s business model which has features of both point-to-point models and obvious features of the model of low-cost carriers. Whereas in the second stage the transition to a partial network model with low-cost models is most likely followed by the emergence of a new already stable hybrid business model based on network principles but with stable features of a low-cost airline.</jats:p>"

However, the extraction and use of natural resources is highly interconnected, spatially and sectorally, within a complex web of interactions and feedbacks. Conventional resource footprinting does not reveal how pressures on natural resources are distributed across country and sector supply networks. Within this study pressures across the global water, energy and land (WEL) system are located within the supply networks of 189 countries and 24 global sectors. Pathways of water, energy and land use are found to be mainly indirect, arising from country and sector resource dependencies on immediate (Scope 2) and upstream (Scope 3) producers in their supply network. However, the distribution of these pressures is found to exhibit a high level of variation within and between national and sectoral supply networks and resource systems. Such differences in the resource pressure profile of countries and sectors is scarcely recognised by existing modelling approaches or supplier reporting guidelines, but is of major consequence for the study and management of pressures across the WEL system. If measures are not taken to extend accountability for the indirect pressures imposed across the WEL system, the resource burden of consumption will be greatly mismanaged.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem setting. Nowadays the content of secondary education in Ukraine does not take into account individual characteristics of the students and it is not focused on the formation of creative potential and  system of  knowledge by interests, the educational process is overburdened with secondary factual material and  is overly regulated. It necessitates the search  and implementation of new approaches to organization of  educational process in high school. One of such approaches is career counselling for secondary school students that provides thourough and specialized general education, access to quality education  in accordance with the individual skills and needs of the student youth.Recent research and publications analysis. The problem of career counselling for secondary school students in Ukraine has become the subject of research by Ukrainian scholars. In particular, theoretical and conceptual foundations of career counselling training were investigated by N. Bibik, M. Burda, S. Volyanskaya, O. Adamenko, V. Kizenko, A. Samodrin, B. Fedorishin, G. Vashchenko, M. Goncharov, N. Dmitrenko.Highlighting previously unsettled parts of the general problem. The introduction of specialized secondary education is one of the priorities of public education policy. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate the legal bases for introducing career counselling for secondary education system in Ukraine within the science of public administration.The aim of the article is to analyze the legal support for the introduction of career counselling for secondary education system in Ukraine.Paper main body. According to Article 53 of the Constitution of Ukraine everyone has the right to education. However, the deterioration of indicators of competitiveness and the innovative attractiveness of secondary education system in Ukraine need a thorough reform within the framework of the Concept of Implementation of the State Policy for the Reform of General Secondary Education “New Ukrainian School” for the period up to 2029. The aim of the reform of the education system in Ukraine is to create the conditions for personal development and creative self-realization of every citizen of Ukraine, to create generations capable of learning throughout life, to create and develop the values of civil society.In accordance with the objectives of the first phase of implementation of the Concept (2017 – 2018), a new Law of Ukraine “On Education” was adopted, Article 10 of which defines three levels of secondary education: primary education lasting four years; basic secondary education lasting five years; specialized secondary education lasting three years. At the third stage of the Concept implementation (2023 – 2029), it is planned to introduce a specialized level of secondary education – a process of individual and differentiated learning, the basic ideas of which are the education of students in grades 10 – 12 by: interests; competencies; plans for self-realization.According to the Law of Ukraine “On Education”, obtaining a specialized secondary education involves two directions:– academic – specialized education based on the combination of the content of education which is defined by the standard s of secondary specialized education, and in-depth study of individual subjects taking into account the abilities and educational needs of education recipients focusing on continuing education at higher levels of education;– professional – labor market oriented specialized education based on a combination of educational content defined by the standard of secondary specialized education and a professionally oriented approach to learning taking into account the abilities and needs of students.Conclusions of the research and prospects for further studies.1. The crisis and the challenges of the problem have led to the reform of the content of secondary education in Ukraine on the basis of competent and personally oriented approaches to learning;  orientation to the acquisition of skills necessary for successfu students self-realization in their professional activity.2. One of the directions of modernization and improvement of the secondary education system in Ukraine is to ensure the acquisition of appropriate qualitative skills and competences at school needed for work, innovation and active citizenship through the introduction of a specialized link education. The content of career counselling for secondary education involves the introduction of the process of individual and differentiated learning of students in grades 10 – 12 by interests, competencies and plans for self-realization.3. The legal basis for career counselling for secondary education system in Ukraine is the Constitution of Ukraine, the Laws of Ukraine “On Education”, “On Complete General Secondary Education”, the Concept of the implementation of state policy in the field of reforming general secondary education “New Ukrainian School” for the period up to 2029. For the effective reform of the general secondary education with the introduction of  the career counselling component it is necessary to implement the provisions of the Law of Ukraine “On comprehensive general secondary education”, to develop and adopt the new Law of Ukraine “On Vocational Education”.The subject of further scientific research in this area will be the content and forms of organization of specialized education in secondary school.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance of research Ukraine has an urgent problem of supplying adequate quality drinking water, especially in rural areas. Only 30% Ukrainian rural areas are equipped with water supplying systems. The main sources of water supply in local agricultural water pipelines are groundwater. However, groundwater in Ukraine is often characterized with a rather high iron content, which is sometimes ten times higher than the current regulatory requirements Cn = 0.2 mg / dm3.&#x0D;\nThe purpose and objectives of the study For groundwater treatment we propose to use biological methods with the placement of treatment facilities in the body of the water tower (WT), which can significantly reduce capital and operating costs. When the downward movement of aerated source groundwater through the bioreactor (BR) a transition of divalent iron into a ferric iron form occurs with the help of iron bacteria, immobilized on fibrous media, and when the ascending movement of water through floating polystyrene foam media of the contact clarification filter (CCF), it is clarified from colloidal particles of iron hydroxide due to their compressed sedimentation in the subfilter space of the CCF.&#x0D;\nResearch methods. The results of laboratory research on iron reduction when water deferrization for a certain period of time are given, the technological solution for the optimization of constructive and technological parameters of WT and CCF in the absence of repeated \"charging\" of the filter is offered.  When a contact-clarifying filter is flushed it is recommended to leave a part of the Gmin residue, which will serve as a catalyst during the next water deferrization cycle.&#x0D;\nProspects for research, directions for further work. We proposed a new automated water deferrization plant equipped with an elevated water tank. The advantage of it is to provide a high efficiency of biological water-based iron removal with complete automation of water filtration and filter flushing, while reducing the cost of its construction and operation.</jats:p>"

For successful strategic management of the supply chain, an integrated approach is needed to link the supply chain strategy with the overall strategic management of the company. It is the Balanced Scorecard which seems to be a suitable and effective tool for this purpose. The Balanced Scorecard focuses on formulating a supply chain strategy, linking it to the corporate vision and turning it into particular actions to achieve the strategic objectives. In this article, a methodology for strategic supply chain management is proposed based on the Balanced Scorecard as an instrument for supply chain strategy formulation and implementation. The methodology consists of twelve steps, each of which is commented in more detail.

This complex logistics management problem can be studied through several indicators related to integration of the inner supply chain and to the management of relationships with product suppliers, buyers and trade partners, and logistics services providers. The article outlines the results of a study of the logistics functionalities of some leading e-commerce platforms and reveals some trends in their evolution and their readiness for supporting some of the supply chain management processes.</jats:p>",

The next generation of procurement tools is here, and a new wave of procurement transformation is set to change our tools and our profession more in the next five years than in the previous 40. In order to be ready for this transformation, procurement professionals must: 1) understand the future architecture of procurement-related tools and services; 2) develop a new language of expression for dealing with suppliers, tool providers and stakeholders; 3) fundamentally shift the focus of reporting and performance metrics in procurement; and 4) avoid falling into new hazards. Those procurement organisations that can make this shift will enable competitive differentiation for their teams and their company overall. Like all business improvement efforts, changes in procurement tools and the associated practices require adequate change management including structured initiatives for communication, education, and transparency to end users and overcoming specific resistance factors. This paper discusses a new age of procurement, in which full automation through AI will be key. The aim of the paper is to inspire procurement professionals to redefine their practices, beginning by redefining their mission, vision, and values.</jats:p>"

Reacting to growing pollution during the 1960s, Parliament passed the ambitious Environmental Protection Act of 1973. This led to significant improvements in the regulation of pollution from industry and in wastewater treatment during the 1970s, but water pollution remained a problem, in part because of increasingly intensive use of agricultural land. From 1987 onwards, several action plans for the aquatic environment were launched, but meeting EU standards for water quality will require further efforts, as will the protection of habitats and biodiversity. For almost two decades following the first OPEC oil price shock, energy security was the overriding goal of energy policy. Aided by extensive regulation, oil was replaced by other sources of energy, and large increases in energy efficiency were achieved, partly via combined heat and power plants. From around 1990, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions took precedence, and in large part, fossil fuels have been replaced by wind power and biomass in the production of electricity and heating. Nevertheless, climate policy must face up to several new challenges if Denmark is to remain a green frontrunner nation.</p>",

The results showed that infiltration depth for one rain event was equal to the distance from the surface to the crossover point between the two soil water distribution curves with soil depth before a rain event and after the rain event. The soil water supply for one rainfall event was the difference in the soil water resources in the soil layers from maximum infiltration depth that occurred after a long period, and could be estimated by a series of two-curve methods. A maximum infiltration depth of 2.9 m occurred in the artificial Caragana shrubland. The results provide a foundation for controlling soil degradation and sustainable use of soil water resources in water-limited regions.</jats:p>"

In supply chain also understandable is managing dynamics of supply chain, both the internal operations, and the relationship. Pricing decisions have different effects on operations in logistics and supply chain. In supply chain management, revenue management is the use of pricing to increase the supply chain surplus, profit generated from the limited supply chain available on the assets utilized. Pricing is a factor that gears up profit in supply chain through an approval to match supply chain demand. Revenue management can be defined as the application of pricing to increase profit, which is produced from a limited supply of supply chain assets. The supply chain limited assets are available for assembly, shipment, storage, while inventory are available in the inner portion of supply chain activities, which are utilized to develop , and make items accessible for production, distribution, wholesalers, selling. In supply chain there may be two forms one is the capacity of the assets that exist for production, transportation, storage, and another is the inventory that exist in order to improve the product\navailability, in which multiple customers, revenue management aims to grow profits by selling the assets to the customer, at the right price in supply chain.</jats:p>"

The increased morbidity and mortality rates in children under five in developing countries are mostly attributed to poor availability and failure of prescribing lifesaving medicines. This study was aimed at evaluating the availability and utilization of the WHO-recommended priority lifesaving medicines for children under five in public health facilities. <jats:italic>Method</jats:italic>. A cross-sectional survey complemented with a qualitative method was conducted in 14 health centers and four hospitals in the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. In the facilities, we assessed the availability within the last half year and on the day of the visit. Utilization of the medicines was assessed through a review of patient records of the last one year. Twelve in-depth interviews were carried out to collect the qualitative data, and the analysis was executed using thematic analysis. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. For treatment of pneumonia, amoxicillin dispersible tablets and gentamycin injection were available in 94.4% of the facilities. For treatment of malaria, artemether/lumefantrine was available in 61.1% of the facilities. For pain management, paracetamol tablets were available in 94.4% of the facilities. AZT+3TC+NEV for HIV/AIDS management was available in all facilities. At least one essential medicine was out of stock in the past six months with the average duration of 33.6 days in health centers and 28.25 days in hospitals. Oral rehydration salt and zinc (84.7%) and AZT+3TC+NEV (100%) had better utilization. However, for almost all cases, other nonpriority medicines were highly prescribed. Lack of administrative commitment, supply of near expiry products, complexity of diseases, and lack of customized child formulations were among the challenges of availability and utilization of those medicines. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. The overall availability of lifesaving medicines on the day of the visit was fairly good but with poor utilization in almost all facilities. Some products were not available for considerable length of time in the past six months.</jats:p>",

The project, which started on 1st January 2018, has adopted an integrated approach, working both directly on the water supply infrastructure and at a systemic level in the river basin. Through capacity development, investments and technical assistance, the project will provide a strong boost to improve the operations of the Cagayan de Oro Water District (COWD). Water supply coverage, sanitation services and disaster risk reduction are being expanded to up to 7,000 previously unserved households in relocation areas, primarily inhabited by people who lost their homes in the 2011 Sendong flood. In the upstream Cagayan de Oro River Basin (CDORB), several pilot reforestation interventions are being implemented in partnership with local Indigenous Peoples (IP) communities to demonstrate effective and sustainable ways for addressing the causes of flooding. The project aims to contribute to an enabling environment in which public and private stakeholders in CDO and Bukidnon Province cooperate towards flood risk reduction. The R2CR2T project is a Public-Private Partnership including partners Cagayan de Oro Water District, VEI, FITC, Unifrutti Tropical Philippines Inc, Cagayan de Oro River Basin Management Council, Hineleban Foundation, Bukidnon Indigenous Peoples Advisory Council, Wetlands International, Philippines Red Cross and Netherlands Red Cross. The R2CR2T project is 49% co-funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and administered by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) through the Sustainable Water Fund.</jats:p>",

However, other modes of transmission also need to be clarified in more depth, especially, the foodborne transmission. We assessed the effect of animal origin foods consumption on the pandemic of COVID-19. For this purpose, we studied the relationship among 20 food supply as independent variables, and the parameter of Total Cases as dependent variable. Here we show a relationship between a group of animal origin foods and total cases. Regression, Bayes, and Lasso results showed that eggs and fresh water fish have positive coefficient. So, among the transmission ways of COVID_19, the role of foodborne transmission should be more significant than previously thought. The possibility of animal origin foodborne transmission should be taken into more consideration. The perspective is to expand the surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 during the food production chain. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that one important vehicle for SARS-Cov-2 may be some of animal origin foods. It is recommended that virologists examine the possibility of freshwater fish and chicken‘s eggs being as excellent vehicles/preservatives for SARS-Cov-2.</jats:p>"

He entered the newspaper industry in Plymouth, launching the <italic>Western Morning News</italic> in 1860, and in 1863 he and his brother-in-law Edward Spender set up one of the first UK news agencies, the Central Press, in London, supplying news and other editorial matter to provincial papers. He founded or purchased other papers around the country, and shared content between them – to some resistance, mainly from journalists. Saunders’s career highlights the dependence of many provincial papers on central sources of news and content, and challenges simple ideas of local, national and provincial. It also shows the contrast between the romantic myths about local journalism peddled by journalists, and the industrial reality of the syndication processes by which those myths were disseminated.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is a challenging task to manage a perishable food supply chain (PFSC), due to the product’s short lifetime and to demand uncertainty. Even worse is the fact that, because of the multitude of participating stakeholders in production, distribution, and retailing, the PFSC becomes complex and thus particularly vulnerable to crises. Product shortages that result from an outbreak like COVID-19 often cause customers to seek alternative sources of supply, possibly with a larger purchasing amount (i.e., hoarding), leading to even severer demand uncertainty after the shortage period. To manage a sustainable and resilient PFSC after an outbreak, supply chain partners need to share and use the right information to facilitate decision making. A system dynamics simulation was thus applied to study a cheese supply chain with three tiers. Three scenarios that cause product shortages were simulated. Seven balanced feedback loops and two reinforced feedback loops were identified from the simulation model. Through the feedback loop dominance analysis, we identified four dominant loops that facilitate the generation of endogenous demand. In order to alleviate the negative influence of endogenous demand, it is suggested that the information sharing that causes endogenous demand be stopped and a loosely coupled strategy to support decision making utilized.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to investigate the use of acoustic sensors to locate the exact position of leaks, which work 24 hours per day in different modes, i.e. fixed installation and mobile exploration. The results showed that the maximum distance between the acoustic sensors installed on the pipeline was 380 m. Field application results indicated that detecting threshold of the distance was 300 m and the intensity ratio of leaking state noise (LSN) to background noise was 1.9 respectively. The pipeline length by manual hunting area (MHA) is 1.3 times longer than the acoustic logger tested area (ALTA), but the detected leakage points in MHA is 20% less than in ALTA. Furthermore, the cost of leakage detection in MHA was about 6,000 yuan/detected leakage point. That in ALTA was about 2,500 yuan/detected leakage point. The case study also indicates that the acoustic logger is a promising tool with the advantage of lower cost and faster detection, compared to manual ground listening with a sound stick. The acoustic leakage detection method can detect the leakage in different sized pipelines, whereas the manual detection was concentrated in small-sized pipelines.</jats:p>",

A good management system can greatly reduce the loss of internal management, avoid the loss caused by the failure of control, and improve the operating efficiency. Secondly, from an operational perspective, supply chain finance promotes great integration across business areas. While developing supply chain financial services to earn additional income, it strengthens the original customers’ preference, consolidates the main business, looks for stability and changes, and reduces the operational risks brought by the launch of new businesses. From the perspective of the whole supply chain, this business increases the overall economic value of the supply chain and relieves the financing difficulties. However, there are still imperfect mechanisms for controlling risk, limited funding, and insufficient innovation. The potential of the logistics industry and the increasing financing needs still demand us to stop. The development of third-party logistics and supply chain financial services led by SF Express has become inevitable.</jats:p>"

Organizations must identify and manage the risks of every link in the chain, while pursuing sustainable development. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainable development must be the result of a deliberate and coordinated response by the entire organization. A suitable segmentation of suppliers allows development strategies to be prioritized. This article presents the steps that should be followed in supply chain management, the identification of risks, and the new leadership of purchasing management to develop a sustainable supply chain. To this end, some of the key industrial actions reported in the literature are outlined, and two case studies are presented to identify the steps for the segmentation and dynamic development of suppliers.

The local dairy supply chains were analysed and found that the shorter milk supply chains were more profitable with reduced intermediaries and higher producer shares in consumer rupees for all dairy products. The supply chains which involved intermediaries had lesser cost per unit of operation in dairy processing but fetched lower prices due to the quality issues and more distance travelled by dairy products. The economic viability and financial position of the processing units exhibited favourable results for both supply chains but it was higher for Supply Chain-I.</jats:p>",

Via the example of plastic food packaging, two different practice-theoretical approaches to food supply are discussed regarding their suitability for relating the material properties of packaging to their everyday use by producers, retailers, and consumers: (1) the network approach (portraying food supply as a network of practices; these practices include material elements that interrelate with other elements like competence or meaning) and (2) the nexus approach (investigating the interrelation between social practices and material arrangements in which they take place). Depending on the given research interest, both perspectives have their pros and cons: the network approach is stronger in understanding the everyday use of technologies, while the nexus approach encourages the integration of infrastructures and environmental contexts that are not directly observable within the practice.</jats:p>",

The Danube, Europe’s second-longest river, has rich potential for tourism over its whole course, and river cruises offer superb opportunities to explore. This study aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the most important characteristics of cruise tourism on the Danube. In our research, a literature review (LR) and content analysis (CA) were used to examine trends in the inland waterway cruise sector, which, despite the growing interest in the product, is still not deemed to be a part of mass tourism. Danube cruise tourism relies heavily on alternative (niche) tourism features, which satisfy both cultural and authentic tourism preferences. Currently, many elements of niche tourism are missing from the product supply, but, with a modest addition of such features, the demand for the product could increase and its economic performance in the period following the expected recession would be enhanced.</jats:p>"

For that there will be an automated system which takes payment in advance and then supplies the water according to the purchased plan ,which is based on the user's needs. Hence the purpose of this project is to develop a system which is based on prepaid payment for water supply and monitoring water supply system for housing society. Water supply is measured by using flow control to control the flow of water according to the usage of the user. By doing this we can decrease the rate of human errors. All payment transactions are recorded in the system for further reference. This System evolves Automatically because it detects the recharge details from the message. After that it will give supply to that user according to their recharge details. This System is fully automated which can overcome the problems of improper bill creation, delay in bill availability and delay in payment process.

Therefore, it is important to understand how different rationales for the implementation of certification schemes have developed in the past because they considerably influence the overall success of sustainability management efforts. This paper picks up on this gap and presents the results of an in-depth comparative case study drawing on interviews conducted with five managers of three companies from the clothing sector in 2018 and abductive content analysis. By applying such a qualitative approach, this study explores motivations and benefits as well as elaborates on the implementation of certification schemes in apparel supply chains. It outlines that certification in the clothing sector is driven by strategic factors, marketing considerations, and information considering sustainability aspects. The study also shows that certification schemes may strengthen the marketing and competitive position of clothing companies as well as sustainability awareness in textile and apparel supply chains in general. Finally, a framework conceptualized from the findings of the interviews presents relevant SSCM practices in the clothing industry. Therefore, the present study contributes to theory building in SSCM by confirming and extending previous research on the implementation of certification schemes for sustainability, as well as to practice by examining reasons to apply certification schemes and potential performance outcomes.</jats:p>"

The CIHAM-UC-FFR method consists of three stages: (1) calibration and validation for the effective precipitation model, called CIHAM-UC-EP model, (2) calibration of forecasting models for components of the CIHAM-UC-EP model, (3) proposed model for forecasting of gridded flood risk called CIHAM-UC-FR. The CIHAM-UC-EP model has a mathematical structure derived from a conceptual model obtained by applying the principle of mass conservation combined with the adapted principle of Fick's law. The CIHAM-UC-FR model is a stochastic equation based on the exceedance probability of the forecast effective precipitation. Various scenarios are shown for a future time where the flood risk is progressively decreased as the expected life parameter of the hydraulic structure is increased.</jats:p>",

The complexities of the networks make the problem more challenging as various situational operations must be accounted for to ensure that the entire system performs under recommended conditions. In general, this problem is addressed by the installation of pressure reducing valves (PRVs) in WDNs and determining their appropriate settings. Researchers have proposed the utilization of several control techniques. However, the limitations of both computational and financial resources have compelled the researchers to investigate the possibility of limiting the PRVs while ensuring their control is sufficient for the entire system. Several approaches have been put forward to mitigate this sub-problem of the pressure control problem. This paper presents a review of existing techniques to solve both the localization of PRVs and their control problems. It dwells briefly on the classification of these methods and subsequently highlights their merits and demerits. Despite the available literature, it can be noted that the solution methods are yet to be harmonized. As a result, various avenues of research areas are available.

Software and tools successfully used in other countries (e.g., Finland, Sweden, Canada, etc.) are not as effective in Russian conditions for a number of reasons. This calls for the development of an original approach to solve this problem with respect to Russia’s specific conditions. The main factors affecting the operation of wood harvesting companies in Russia were determined. The optimization problem was formulated taking into account all important features of wood harvesting specific to the country. The mathematical model of the problem was formulated and analyzed. An important requirement is that the solution algorithm should find high-quality plans within short computation times. The original problem was reduced to a block linear programming problem of large dimension, for which an effective numerical solution method was proposed. It is based on the multiplicative simplex method with column generation within Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition and uses heuristics to determine feasible solutions based on the branch and bound method. We tested the solution approach on real production data from a forest company in southern Karelia with a planning horizon up to a year. This case study involved 198 sites and 14 machines harvesting up to 200,000 cubic meters from an available stock volume of about 300,000 cubic meters. An increase in profit by 5% to 10% was observed, measured as revenue from the sale of products, net of harvesting and transportation costs.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on coordination between two players and cost-sharing in an SCM that considers a vendor and a buyer. For random demand and complex product production, a flexible production system is recommended. The study aims to minimize the total SCM cost under stochastic conditions. In the flexible production systems, the production rate is introduced as the decision variable and the unit production cost is minimum at the obtained optimal value. The setup cost of flexible systems is higher and to control this, a discrete investment function is utilized. The exact information about the probability distribution of lead time demand is not available with known mean and variance. The issue of unknown distribution of lead time demand is solved by considering a distribution-free approach to find the amount of shortages. The game-theoretic approach is employed to obtain closed-form solutions. First, the model is solved under decentralized SCM based on the Stackelberg model, and then solved under centralized SCM. Bargaining is the central theme of any business nowadays among the players of an SCM to make their profit within a centralized and decentralized setup. For this, a cost allocation model for lead time crashing cost based on the Nash bargaining model with the satisfaction level of SCM members is proposed. The cost allocation model under Nash bargaining achieves exciting results in SCM coordination.</jats:p>"

(1) and Article 15/F. (1) of the Act LVII of 1995 on Water Management. A kind of dualism concerning the price of the irrigation can be observed in Hungary. On the one hand, the necessity to irrigate has to be reflected in the price due to the negative impacts of drought on crop production, although irrigation scores low on the hierarchy of water uses. On the other hand, the price must also express the value of water as an irreplaceable natural resource with limited renewable capacity. Based on the analysis of the said provisions, it can be concluded that though allowing derogations from paying for the agricultural irrigation can be justified in many cases,  concerns can be raised regarding their uniform application without involving discretion regardless, among others factors, of the differences in the economic situation of the farmers.</jats:p>"

Monitoring of chlorine residual in water distribution systems is necessary not only for ensuring potable water quality but also prevent emergence of disinfection by-products due to excess chlorination. Modelling work for chlorine residual was carried out for water supply distribution network of a town using both second order and first order reaction rate models. For the development of the model, the bulk reaction decay rate was determined in the laboratory using bottle testing while the wall decay rate was determined by calibration of the water quality model using field residual chlorine concentration measurements. The model results show that there is no significant difference in the residual chlorine between the two models or the cost saving that result in terms chlorine usage for the range of initial chlorine dosages anticipated. Constant rate chlorine model is more conservative and offers additional safety in terms of chlorine residual present. Significant differences only occur at excess chlorine residual concentration within the distribution system above the intended maximum residual to be attained. Further research that relates the chlorine dose with the water quality characteristics is necessary to make a more general evaluation.\n                        </jats:p>"

The major cause of emissions of harmful gases into the environment is due to the high utilization of petroleum derivatives. In this way, it is paramount to explore environmentally sustainable energy sources for feasible advancement, to satisfy these expanding energy demands and to secure the environment. To mitigate these global problems, academic, industrial, and governmental sectors have engaged in a lot of brainstorming and research to surmount these difficulties, which have brought a steady ﬂow of new information in the area of cultivation of microalgae in innovative technologies including photobioreactors and high rate algal ponds. In this respect, biomass generation from aquatic plants in enriched aquatic environments like wastewater has received considerable. Therefore, this review article provides comprehensive information on recent accounts on applications of microalgae in wastewater treatment using different technologies and their potentials in feedstock generation for biofuels applications. However, in the course of this study, high rate algal ponds (HRAP) and photobioreactors were found to be a reliable system for the cultivation of microalgae and wastewater treatment. Hence, the two-step method of dewatering methods is found to be the most effective approach for microalgae cultivation for wastewater treatment and generation of algal-based feedstock, taking into account high yield potentials and economic factors such as cost of operation and energy required for large scale algal biomass processing for biofuel generations.</jats:p>"

After verifying that our results for U.S. post-World War II business cycle fluctuations are largely in line with the prevailing consensus, we proceed to study output and price fluctuations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We attribute two thirds of the decline in 2020:Q1 GDP to a negative shock to aggregate demand. In contrast, regarding the staggeringly large decline in GDP in 2020:Q2, we estimate two thirds of this shock was due to a reduction in aggregate supply. Statistical analysis suggests a slow recovery due to a persistent effects of the supply shock, but surveys suggest a somewhat faster rebound with a recovery in aggregate supply leading the way.</jats:p>"

In our dynamic model, supply constraints increase the price of housing services by only half has much as the purchase price of a home, since the purchase price responds to expected future increases in rent as well as contemporaneous rent increases. Households respond to changes in the price of housing services by altering their housing consumption and location choices, but only by a small amount. We evaluate these predictions using common measures of housing supply constraints and data from US metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2016. We find sizeable effects of supply constraints on house prices, but modest-to-negligible effects on rent, lot size, structure consumption, location choice within metropolitan areas, sorting across metropolitan areas, and housing expenditures. We conclude that housing supply constraints distort housing affor dability, and therefore housing consumption and location decisions, by less than their estimated effects on house prices suggest.</jats:p>"

Whether you were a mainland European country with supply chain partners in the UK, or a UK manufacturer that depended on European companies for supplies, the uncertainty and potential disruption to well-grooved supply chain processes became a major headache. At first, it was the uncertainty that proved the major issue as governments played politics and refused to define the likely deal that would enable supply chain terms to be put in place.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The accelerated urbanization and industrialization in China is leading to major challenges due to rising energy demand and emissions. Cities in particular play an important role in the decision-making and implementation processes for the energy transition. However, they often have only limited local energy potential and are heavily dependent on supply regions. We therefore assess how a predominantly renewable power supply can be implemented based on the availability of local or imported renewable resources. We present a case study in which an advanced energy system model is parametrized and applied to address questions which are relevant to the transformation of the energy system in China. The model is capable of simultaneously optimizing investment decisions and hourly power balances of a scenario year, taking into account different storage technologies, regional power exchange and policy constraints such as carbon cap, carbon price and renewable portfolio standards. The study takes the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region with Inner Mongolia as a supply region—considered as exemplary regions characterized by heterogeneous infrastructures, resources and consumption—as its model. Starting from a context-related normative energy scenario, we analyze a possible future electricity system under various assumptions using the Renewable Energy Mix (REMix) energy system model developed at the DLR (German Aerospace Center). Depending on the estimated potentials of renewable energies, technology costs and the projected electricity demand, the metropolitan region is mainly supplied with imported wind and solar power. A sensitivity analysis considers installed capacities, annual generation, CO2 emissions and costs. The results indicate that the assumption of storage costs is of great importance for the future total costs of an electricity system. Variations in other parameters led to different generation portfolios with similar system costs. Our results provide insights into future regional infrastructure needs, and underline the importance of regional coordination and governance for the energy transition in China.</jats:p>"

The case study presented here is of palm oil sourced from smallholder farmers in Ghana's Eastern region: a commodity normally synonymous with environmental degradation and an area left behind by the economic development of Greater Accra. The case study seeks to demonstrate how Traidcraft's explicit focus on working with small producers and new innovative product ranges provides a counter-balance to consolidation of certified 'Fairtrade' around core commodities. At the same time, the case study highlights some of the challenges of bringing new products to market in the UK's current retail environment.</jats:p>",

The aim was to compare the doses for conventional and enhanced coagulation and, consequently, arrive at optimized coagulation where both had synergistic maximum removal. High basicity PACl was used to coagulate simulated waters prepared by humic acid (HA) and kaolin. The removal of turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 was evaluated. The impact of varying input concentrations of HA and turbidity on doses was studied. The enhanced coagulation doses were higher than conventional ones. However, with an increase in input TOC, the difference between enhanced and conventional doses narrowed. The doses for optimized coagulation ranged from 2 to 9 mg Al/L. At optimized coagulation, the removal of TOC, DOC and UV254 varied from 30–85%, 30–89% and 73–91% respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed the presence of Si-O-C bond. The interactions of unsaturated bonds of hydrophobic organics to inorganic clay were possibly favoured over hydrophilics. HA agglomeration reduced coagulant consumption as the input TOC increased. It was concluded that instead of a stoichiometric approach, a modified dosing approach can be applied for limiting underdosing and overdosing while ensuring maximum removal of impurities.</jats:p>",

In spite of the superiority of the bank-attached vanes to spur dikes, the vanes' tips are still vulnerable to local scour caused by flow–structure interaction. In this study, slotted bank-attached vanes are proposed to reduce local scour at the tip of the triangular submerged vane. For this, a rectangular slot is created parallel to the chord of the vane with an area of ten percent of the effective area of the vane surface. Two types of conventional vanes and slotted vanes were installed at different angles of attack of 23, 30, 40 and 60 degrees in an arch flume. Experiments were carried out in clear water conditions with different flow regimes with Froude numbers of Fr = 0.287, 0.304 and 0.322. The results show that the slotted vane outperforms the conventional vane by reducing maximum scour depth by about 70, 20, 17 and 54 percent for different angles of attack of 23, 30, 40 and 60 degrees, respectively. The proposed slotted vane also resulted in reduction of scour hole volume around the vane and formed the scour hole away from the outer bank.</jats:p>",

According to the results, TiO2 incorporation increased the membrane hydrophilicity, increased the membrane swelling values, enhanced the membrane flux and improved the salt rejection. Moreover, UV treatment has a positive effect on desalination performance. The best improvement was achieved in the results of 10 wt.% TiO2-doped membrane. It was found that the flux value of the UV-treated membrane having 10 wt.% TiO2 concentration was 8.2 kg/m2·h and the salt rejection value was 99.97%.

From the global value chain theory, there is no evidence on what types of supply chain ownership structures help firms to achieve more innovation. This deficiency led us to investigate types of supply chain ownership structures, i.e., Pure Domestic Chain, Pure Joint Venture (JV) Chain, Pure Multinational Corporation (MNC) Chain, Export Chain, and Import Chain, that can help firms to achieve more innovation. One-way ANOVA is used to analyze 856 responses collected from the Thai manufacturing industry during 2012–2017. The results indicate that firms in the Pure MNC Chain have the highest levels of product and process innovation. There is less innovation for the Pure JV Chain, Export Chain, Import Chain, and Pure Domestic Chain, in decreasing order. This means that firms in global supply chain networks tend to have better innovation performance than firms in local supply chain networks. The innovation capabilities of local firms can be enhanced through knowledge transfer and knowledge co-creation by joining global supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve this, a simulation model of the beer game supply chain is developed along with an ordering strategy based on the Economic Order Quantity with additional rules, such as no backorder policy, vendor-managed inventory, and taking into consideration route deliveries, all of which are implemented in the ordering algorithm. In the literature, there is extensive research conducted on the causes of the bullwhip effect and in the presence of certain inventory management policies. However, these terms are rarely combined with simulation modeling to provide satisfactory proven results. In this article, our proposed ordering algorithm avoids the bullwhip effect to a very large extent. The results show that approximately half the cost is incurred compared to recent studies with the same settings. </jats:p>",

Çalışmada, gümrük ve vergi mevzuatı açısından gümrük bölgesi dışı kabul edilen oldukça geniş teşviklerin tanındığı serbest bölgeler yasal mevzuat çerçevesinde daha ucuz üretim, montaj ve depolama imkanları sunduğu dolayısı ile bu avantajlarından dolayı serbest bölgelerin tedarik zincirine entegre edilmesinin işletmelerin tedarik zinciri maliyetlerini düşürmelerine katkılar sağlayacağı bulgusuna ulaşılmıştır.

Bu amaçla, üretim maliyetlerini düşürebilecek teşviklerin sağlandığı serbest bölgeler tedarik zincirlerinin kârlılığını artırmasına yardımcı olabilir. Üretimin denizaşırı ülkelere kayması ve küresel eğilimler, düzenlemeler ve prosedürlerdeki son değişiklikler, serbest bölgelerin işletme perspektifi açısından yeniden değerlendirilmesi durumunun gerekliliğini ortaya koymaktadır.</jats:p>"

Industry 4.0 is reshaping the future of education, which opens up our vision and makes us to consider what knowledge and skills students should possess after they have graduated from college, when to accelerate workforce reskilling and what is the building blocks and connections of education supply chain. In this study, it is the first time the concept of ‘education supply chain’ is proposed and coined. Furthermore, our research has led us to view educational systems and configurations, such as international mobility and transnationalization, as outcomes of enduring power related to industrial revolutions. Finally, a curriculum structure based on system thinking is proposed. We engage our inquiry with transformations that are happening around higher education and position our research on the benefits of sharing of global intellectual resource and top talents through transnational mobility and education joint ventures in the context of Industry 4.0.</jats:p>",

The calibrated model shows that, to achieve the policy goal, 10% of equipment operation in the high energy-consuming sectors must be shut down. This policy leads to an improved energy structure in which total energy consumption drops by 4.75% at the cost of a contraction in economic growth, where the total output declines by 12.31%. The numerical experiments find that the optimal policy is to limit the production scale in both the iron/steel industry and the fossil energy industry, closing 9% and 7% of the production, respectively, since doing so minimizes output loss and improves the energy structure. This paper quantifies the impact of the current capacity removal policy and provides policy alternatives to reach the same policy target with a lower output loss.</jats:p>"

In fact, reverse logistics is in many ways inseparable from the growth of global e-commerce in the consumer retail sector. The functional elements of reverse logistics are similar to those of its traditional forward logistics counterpart and yet many striking differences exist. The reverse supply chain has a character both in business operations and in consumer buying habits that is as complex and challenging as it is essential to market performance.

The objective of this research was to determine the effects of variations in the influent temperature on a floc blanket using laboratory and field experiments and to assess whether the cohesivity of the blanket expressed as the sludge cohesion coefficient (SCC) can be used to interpret the effect of temperature variations. Effluent turbidity exhibited a strong positive correlation with inflow temperature during the increasing temperature phase and a strong negative correlation during the temperature recession phase. An increment of 2 °C in the influent temperature caused the effluent turbidity to increase by 1 NTU. The SCC of the blanket exhibited a significant relationship with the influent temperature. The optimum blanket cohesivity (SCC of 0.7 mm/sec) was observed at a temperature of 23.2 °C, above which the cohesivity decreased. At higher temperatures, frequent particle collisions owing to high inertial forces cause particle motion with the upward flow and increase the effluent turbidity. No correlation between SCC and blanket settling velocity was observed.</jats:p>",

A novel synthetic magnesium carbonate with spherical flower-like structure (MCSF) was prepared. Its performance for phosphorus adsorption from a eutrophic lake by in situ magnesium phosphate formation was tested and characterized. The effect of initial phosphorus concentration, adsorption time, adsorption dose, temperature, ionic strength and pH on phosphorus adsorption by MCSF was investigated. Results showed that higher initial phosphorus concentration and longer adsorbing time could improve the adsorption capacity. The maximum sorption capacity was 143.27 mg/g under initial pH value 7.0. The phosphate adsorption process was fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameter values revealed that the sorption process at 298–318 K was spontaneous and endothermic. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of MCSF revealed that electrostatic attraction and chemical conversion were the major contributors for phosphate adsorption. MCSF releases magnesium ions from its surface and rapidly combines with phosphate to form insoluble magnesium phosphate precipitate. The prepared MCSF has the potential to be used for the restoration of eutrophic lakes by removing phosphate with higher adsorption capacity.</jats:p>",

A possible cause is that usually supply chain optimization models are deterministic and linear or mixed-integer linear, while forecasting methods and inventory control systems are stochastic and non-linear. It is clear, however, that inventory costs might have a significant impact on optimal supply chain configuration and on distribution systems expansion or contraction. This article presents a practical strategy that considers an item-by-item inventory control system by means of a Monte Carlo simulation model as a starting point to include inventory holding costs in a supply chain optimization model. Three strategies to include inventory costs in the objective function were analyzed: The Square Root Law (SRL), the potential functions that relate average inventory with warehouse throughput, and the estimation of average inventories by simulation. The results suggest that the SRL should not be used unless unusual assumptions hold and that potential functions are a very good approximation to consider inventory costs for supply chain configuration.</jats:p>"

The increase in the capacity of the transducer is limited by the design capabilities of the transducer itself and the selection of the dielectric separating the plate from the surface of the electrically conductive testing object. Using modern methods of processing the received information significantly complicates and increases the cost of implementation of the device using a capacitive transducer. The most acceptable, at the moment, way to increase the sensitivity is to increase the power of high-frequency voltage supply generators provided that packet pulses are excited. The generator presented in the article allows to create pulsed peak voltages in low-capacitance transducers of more than 3 kV with frequencies up to 5 MHz with a duration of 1 period of the filling frequency and sounding frequencies up to 1 kHz. It was experimentally shown that using the prototype of a new generator, the amplitudes of the pulses transmitted through a steel sample 20 mm thick were obtained, the ratio of which to the noise amplitude received by the miniature piezoelectric transducer is 13 times. Using the developed powerful amplifier of voltage pulses will increase the amplitude of the pulses received from the transducer and repeatedly reflected in the product.</jats:p>"

Anaerobic incubation at high temperatures with prolonged storage was found to result in higher organic content than aerobic incubation (3.6–6.8 times at 40 °C). The high temperatures caused changes in the DOM fractions, with humic-like substances mainly formed in aerobic incubation and protein-like substances in anaerobic incubation. Results showed that the fluorescence intensity of humic-like and protein-like substances increased by 45% and 22%, respectively, at the end of the anaerobic incubation period. The UV-absorbing DOM constituents in aerobic incubation had lower molecular weights and were more heterogeneous than those in anaerobic incubation.</jats:p>",

The use of big data technology is not only an inevitable choice for supply chain, but also an important guarantee for the development and innovation of supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to study the ecological economic development based on supply chain in the era of big data. This paper firstly analyzes and studies the development problems of enterprises in the supply chain, and expounds the significance of applying big data technology to ecological supply chain. Then it introduces the connotation and composition of ecological supply chain. Then, based on the gradient promotion decision tree algorithm, a cost sensitive xgboost algorithm, called cs-xgboost algorithm, is proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that it is of practical significance to apply the decision tree algorithm proposed in this paper to the risk prediction of ecological supply chain. In this paper, AUC and ACC are used as performance indicators to test the cs-xgboost algorithm, and the value of AUC of the algorithm is 0.9.</jats:p>",

The identified lean practices can serve as a template to enhance the performance of a supply chain. The present study offers a multi-criteria decision-making approach to identify the effective performance practices in automotive lean supply chain. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) was applied on a matrix of observed values and the actual effect of proposed practices was observed. Further it was confirmed with the help of fuzzy- Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR; that means multicriteria optimization and compromise solution, with pronunciation). The criteria which had the most impact are proposed for achieving the future goals of leanness. It was found that among the lean criteria considered, quality management, information management and customer management practices influence the key performance measures more than others. Although DEMATEL and fuzzy-VIKOR were applied for situation leading to setting up of priorities of factors that considered affecting automotive manufacturer, the proposed methodology can be applied in diverse industrial settings. The present study may help decision-makers to device the appropriate strategy in identifying major practices that influence the lean supply chain. </jats:p>",

This study found that pressure values in manual calculations range from 1.85 meters to 84.22 meters. The minimum pressure requirements from BPP-SPAM is 7 meters (0.7 bar). While the simulation results using the EPANET program, the pressure value is at 1.90 meters up to 84.22 meters. Therefore, the pipe diameter selection is appropriate and the pressure meets the requirements of the BPP-SPAM. The difference between pressure values less than 5% indicates that the selection is the right pipe diameter.

As a green economy, tourism economy has been favored by governments everywhere. Tourism has become an important pillar industry of China’s national economy. The development of tourism economy promotes consumption and realizes the growth of economic benefits. Tourism economy has positive and negative effects on tourism ecological environment. As a kind of capital, tourism ecological environment has great influence on tourism economy. Tourism is a comprehensive and linked production and transformation, which is accompanied by a series of social and economic activities in the process of tourism consumption, adding vitality to the development of the whole city’s economy, culture and culture. Theoretically, ecology and environment are indispensable to human beings, and they are one of the elements of human wealth creation. Based on the perspective of supply side, this paper analyzes the relationship between environment and economy, environmental benefits and economic benefits in tourism development from the perspective of factors affecting tourism economy.</jats:p>",

Toyyib,which isa prerequisite for halal products, is translated asaform of guarantee of the procurement process, material handling, products, and transportation in accordance with Islamic law. The collaboration betweenproducers andsuppliers, distributors, and consumers is the key to implementing supply chain management (SCM) of halal products. Then, the participation of all business actors in the supply chain network to engage in continuous improvement is an articulation of the implementation of total quality management (TQM). The previous literature shows that research that examines halal products from the perspective of TQM and SCM is still limited. Therefore, this paper investigates halal products from the viewpoint of TQM and SCM. Both perspectives are used with the consideration that the toyyib process is not only the responsibility of the producer, but also the responsibility of the supplier, distributor, and consumer. The combination of TQM and SCM is expected to produce a production process for halal products that conformswith Islamic law</jats:p>"

However, in order to implement GSCM in the oil palm industry there are many barriers, but not yet comprehensively formulated what the barriers are and how to eliminate it. This study aims to identify barriers GSCM in the palm oil industry in Indonesia, to model the relationship between GSCM barriers and to classify any of it to the palm oil industry in Indonesia using the MICMAC approach. The interpretive structural modeling method was used in this study, where the stages began with a literature study to obtain GSCM indicators of the palm oil industry in Indonesia, then breakdown to get the barriers. The structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) is then structured based on contextual relationships between obstacles by experts who have worked in the palm oil industry. Furthermore, SSIM is converted into a binary matrix. To get the level of each barrier, the level partitions stage is used to developing a chart and a model between the GSCM barriers in the palm oil industry in Indonesia. This research resulted in 15 GSCM barriers in the palm oil industry, then arranged into a 6-level model of GSCM barriers and divided into four clusters. The implication of this research is the addition of knowledge about GSCM especially the palm oil industry.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, increasing environmental issues are gaining attention to facilitate the adoption of green innovation for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Sustainable environmental practices have been well-considered in the literature; however, no study has focused on adopting green innovation practices for sustainable development. Thus, environmental management authorities are putting pressure on industries to implement green innovation criteria for SSCM operations. Moreover, it is important to select traditional suppliers to transform its practices to that of sustainable supply chains in order to achieve the industry’s sustainable supply chain goals. In response, this research identified and analyzed the green innovation criteria for SSCM and then selected a supplier that could implement green aspects in the SSCM. This study developed an integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS). The objective of this study was to analyze suppliers to implement green innovation criteria for SSCM practices in the textile manufacturing companies of China. This study reviewed and identified three green innovation criteria and seventeen sub-criteria. Then, the FAHP technique was employed to analyze and rank green innovation criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, the FTOPSIS method was used to investigate and rank eight suppliers. The findings of the FAHP indicated that economic (EC) criteria were the most vital green innovation criteria in the SSCM. Furthermore, the FTOPSIS results revealed that supplier 5 was the most suitable supplier for implementing green innovation criteria in the SSCM. These findings will help managers, practitioners, and policymakers implement green innovation criteria in sustainable manufacturing supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Numerous studies have confirmed the negative impact of the lack of coordination on supply chain performance. In particular, the lack of coordination leads to the bullwhip effect, which has severe impacts on supply chain stability. This paper evaluates a proposed coordination mechanism that allows a decentralized information sharing in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed mechanism “Info-Smooth” utilizes the ordering rule of the generalized (R, S) policy in which a replenishment order can be transferred to upstream echelons including two pieces of information (demand forecast and inventory balance). As the generalized (R, S) can allow order smoothing, Info-Smooth combines the power of both information sharing and order smoothing. A simulation modeling methodology is employed to investigate the effectiveness of Info-Smooth in a multi-echelon supply chain. The factorial design results have shown that Info-Smooth is successful in mitigating the bullwhip effect whilst keeping acceptable inventory stability, compared to the traditional supply chain model. </jats:p>",

The experiments were conducted using a constant confluence angle (α) equal to 90° and various bank slope angles of 45°, 60°, 75° and 90°. Applying different Qr and Frg3, the maximum effect of θ on scour depth was observed when the minor Qr was used in the tributary channel. The mildest bank slope angle caused the minimum scour depth for any given Frg3. Generally, the experiment using θ = 45° and Qr = 0.194 showed the best performance and reduced the maximum scour depth by 46%. Considering two obtained empirical relationships, it was concluded that the effect of θ on the height of the point bar is more than its effect on the scour depth. Finally, Frg3 and θ demonstrated their greatest influences on dimensionless scour depth (dse/y3) and dimensionless height of point bar (Hse/B3), respectively.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is important to find optimal solutions, which are beneficial for both supplier, manufacturer and retailer.Design/methodology/approach: This research focuses on a semi-continuous manufacturing facility by assuming that the production of succeeding cycle starts immediately after the production of preceding cycle. In reality, the inventory of a supply chain system may not be completely empty. A number of products may be left over after the deliveries are made. These leftover inventories are added to the next shipment after the production of required amount to makeup a complete batch for shipment. Therefore, it is extremely important to search for an optimal strategies for these types production facilities where leftover finished goods inventory remains after the final shipment in a production cycle. Considering these scenarios, an inventory model is developed for an imperfect matching condition where some finished goods remains after the shipments.Findings: Based on the previous observation, this research also considers a single facility that follows JIT delivery and produces multiple products to satisfy customers’ demand. For this problem a rotational cycle model is developed to optimize the facility operations. Both problems are categorized as mixed integer non-linear programming problems which are to be solved to find optimum number of orders, shipments and rotational cycle policy for multiple products. Also, this solution will lead to estimate the optimum production quantity and minimum total system cost.Research limitations: This research considers the supply chain based on manufacturers point of view and it does not consider the transportation cost associated with supply chain. Next study will be focused on issues with joint decision making, information sharing, and transportation decision.Practical implications: This study will help the managers of refinery and paper industries in making their operation smooth by applying optimizing techniques and robust decision making.Originality/value: Based on the literature, no research was found on continuous production system supply chain and its optimization with JIT delivery. This research will definitely provide a direction for such problem to the researchers.</jats:p>"

A significant deterrent to the development of autonomous gas supply systems based on butane mixtures with air is their high cost and the absence of scientifically sound recommendations for choosing system parameters. To develop scientifically sound recommendations for the design of systems, considering all the factors of influence that ensure the optimal cost of gasification and subsequent maintenance by the consumer, additional studies are necessary. The article considers the choice of optimal centralization of gas supply systems based on a mixture of butane with air to determine the minimum cost of construction and operation for consumers. the systems analysis, mathematic model methods with calculation of optimal values in the presence of corresponding limits and the methods of material correlation processing are used. The data have been obtained for effective centralization of gas supply systems based on butane-air mixture. The criteria are set which influence the optimum number of houses connected to a tank installation, such as population density in a gas supplied area, climatic features of an area, a type of consumer’s gas-using equipment and a form of settlement development. As a result of the research, the optimum number of apartments has been determined for gas supply to a settlement connected to a tank installation. These recommendations will make it possible to increase efficiency of gas supply source selection and consumer connecting to a gas sup-ply network at minimum cost for consumers</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the functioning of power supply system, there can be situations where the culprit in interruptions of power supply to consumers and a power quality violation is a power supply company or a consumer himself. Therefore, the economic incentive for power supply companies and consumers to increase power supply reliability and power quality is an urgent task. To implement such incentives, it is necessary to control the facts and time of power supply outages and their values as well as cases and time of non-compliance of power quality with the requirements of standards. It is possible with the use of a monitoring system for power supply reliability and power quality. (Research purpose) The research purpose is in developing a technical and economic method for stimulating power supply companies and consumers to increase efficiency of power supply system. (Materials and methods) The article provides a review of the structural diagram of a system for monitoring power supply reliability and power quality including devices for monitoring the number and duration of power outages and voltage deviations. (Results and discussion). An economic method has been developed to stimulate power supply companies and consumers to increase power supply system efficiency. The essence of the method is to control the parameters of power supply reliability and power quality, identify the violation of these parameters, determine the culprit of the violation, determine the time characteristics of the violation, summarize the duration of violations for the reporting period, compare the actual amount of duration with the allowable one, determine the amount of compensation for the violation and impose sanctions on payment compensation by the perpetrators of violations of these parameters. The article presents an algorithm for adjusting the cost of electricity supplied to consumers depending on the number and duration of voltage deviations and the number and duration of outages. The algorithm serves to ensure the operation of the specified technical and economic method. (Conclusions) The algorithm works in conjunction with a system for monitoring power supply reliability and power quality based on signals from devices that control the number and duration of outages and voltage deviations.</jats:p>",

The influence of the thyristor non-sinusoidal voltage  on the energy flows and the power factor of the source is analyzed. Thyristor converter is considered as a nonlinear electric power unit consuming electricity from the primary power source at a fundamental frequency, part of which is converted and returned back to the network as a secondary energy stream of zero-sequence systems and higher harmonics, thereby reducing the overall power factor and the quality of electricity becomes worse. It is analyzed the influence of the considered harmonics quantitative composition  on the accuracy of the currents and voltages calculations. The dependence of the  higher harmonics amplitudes on the thyristor firing angle  is established. The constant component and the 2nd order harmonic voltage are the most denoted in the thyristor harmonics spectrum. In general case it is shown that in the nonlinear circuit with a sinusoidal power source, even in the absence of inductive and capacitive electric load, the fundamental  current harmonic of the power source does not coincide in phase with the sinusoidal EMF of the source. Thus, the thyristor can be considered as a reactive inductive element that consumes reactive power of the fundamental frequency of current, regardless of the its firing angle and the presence of other reactive elements in the system. Therefore, in order to increase the power factor, it is necessary to compensate the reactive power of displacement only at the current fundamental frequency, which should be recorded by electronic meters. It is proposed to use the relative current value of the first harmonic of the power source to characterize the effect of the secondary energy flow on the total power factor. In a four-wire network, the presence of a thyristor converter causes a significant current increasing in the neutral wire, even under symmetrical phase loading, due to the zero sequence currents flowing, which are multiple of three, and they must be taken into account during wire cross-section selection  and  power losses calculation. It is proposed the practical measures to limit the level of higher harmonics and improve the electricity quality.</jats:p>"

The heat exchange area and pressure drop in the spiral- wound heat exchanger, the volume of the buffer tank and the pressure drop in the pipeline of the gas supply system were calculated by programming using Python. Experiments were carried out during the process of starting and running the dual fuel engine using this gas supply system. Experimental data show that the gas supply system can supply gas stably during the process and ensure the stable operation of the dual fuel engine. The effects of the parameters of natural gas and ethylene glycol solution on the heat exchange area of the spiral-wound heat exchanger and the volume of the buffer tank in the gas supply system were studied. The results show that the heat exchange area calculated according to pure methane can adapt to the case of non-pure methane. The temperature difference between natural gas and ethylene glycol solution should be increased in order to reduce the heat exchange area. The heat exchange area selected according to the high pressure of natural gas can adapt to the low pressure of natural gas. The volume of the buffer tank should be selected according to the situation of the minimum methane content to adapt to the situation of high methane content. The main influencing factor in selecting the volume of the buffer tank is the natural gas flow. The results can provide guidance for the design of the gas supply system for dual fuel engines.</jats:p>",

In this research, two leakage calculation methods including Background and Bursts Estimates (BABE) and minimum night flow (MNF) have been evaluated for a rural network in the north of Iran with a high non-revenue water (NRW) percentage of 47%. Initially, the data related to the inlet flow rate of the network and the average pressure at zone was measured using ultrasonic flow meters and pressure transmitter, respectively. Then, remote data loggers collected these data. With the water loss analyses based on the BABE method (annually) and based on the MNF technique (every 10 minutes), the average leak was found to be 1.45 and 1.105 Lit/s, respectively. Also, according to hydraulic and consumption conditions, the highest frequency of MNF occurrence was observed at 00:00 and 05:00. Moreover, the effects of legitimate night-time consumption (LNC) and leakage exponent (N) were evaluated. The results indicate that determining the LNC, especially in the networks in which the domestic customers use private tanks, is significantly important.</jats:p>",

The aim of this article is to investigate the potential possibilities for implementation of Logistics 4.0 and Supply Chain 4.0 in the automotive industry plants, in particular in Bulgaria. Specially designed survey was used as investigation method. It consists of two groups with proposals and assumptions. The survey was conducted by 12 automotive industry logistics experts who are on 6 different logistics positions. The results show that the production visibility (assembly lines connected to internet) and blockchain technologies have the biggest values to the logistics and supply chain.

Many studies have suggested HOR models, but a methodology to define HORs that considers the actual residential environment of users and differing water-supply methods for residential buildings has not yet been proposed. This study considered water-use data from buildings and actual differences in residential environments in a surveyed area (including building heights, topography, and water systems within buildings) and water-supply methods (indirect/direct water supply, existence of a pump within buildings) to develop a methodology and derive a representative HOR for the target area for PDA. Further, a representative HOR was determined for each block by applying the developed methodology for two blocks with similar residential environments but different water-use patterns. It confirmed that the HOR induced through this process could provide high water-supply performance despite a low supply head and needed to reflect the diversity of the water-supply method. The proposed HOR-definition methodology can be easily applied in water-pipe network design and operation processes and ensure objectivity and rationality of HOR selection to yield reliable PDA results.</jats:p>"

Many researchers have argued that such relationships have a positive impact on knowledge sharing across the supply chain. However, it is important to acknowledge that the termination of a personal relationship may well adversely affect the knowledge transfer process between the supply chain member firms. This study addresses the impact of the termination of personal relationships within the supply chain. An exploratory study was employed via semi‐structured interviews with 20 senior managers from 10 different companies based in the United Arab Emirates. The findings reveal five distinct factors that adversely affect knowledge transfer between the managers of buying and supplying firms, once their personal relationships are terminated. These factors further result in inferior knowledge transfer between the partnering firms.</jats:p>",

Also, there is a scarcity of empirical research on both topics. By pulling together seemingly unrelated concepts of knowledge sharing and supply chain risk management, this study devises an integrated model investigating the extent to which operational risks affect supply chain performance and the moderating role of knowledge sharing. The dataset contains 225 responses collected from the firm managers of the Australian food supply chains (FSCs) and analyzed through structural equation modeling. The findings uncover that operational risks significantly undermine FSCs performance. However, knowledge sharing inversely moderates the adverse effect of operational risks, such that the higher the knowledge sharing, the lower the adverse performance effect of operational risks and vice versa. The findings enhance managerial discernment about the criticality of frequently occurring operational risks and the role of knowledge sharing in risk mitigation. The novelty of this study lies in the unified model that simultaneously delves into the performance effect of operational risks and moderating influence of knowledge sharing on risk‐performance nexus.</jats:p>",

Demand for these species was estimated by interviewing 191 Ayurvedic and other Indian system of Medicine (ISM) industries about their annual requirements in drug preparations. Supply from forests and other sources was estimated by interviewing traders at each block level where the species occur and quantity of trade district wise. \nTotal demand for Embelia tsjeriam-cottam (Baibirang) is 37.79 quintals and supply is 248 quintals in M.P. In the case of Celastrus paniculatus (Malkangni) the demand in the state is for 42.9 quintals and supply 218.5 quintals. Similarly for Centratherum anthelminticum (Vanjeera) also the demand is 213.80 quintals and supply available is 2610 quintals.

We investigated whether a manufacturer (the integrated manufacturer) should add an online channel and examined how it affects channel members’ decisions and profits. We formulated the power structure as the retailer-Stackelberg model and analyzed the pricing decisions for the supply chain. The results demonstrate that the integrated manufacturer prefers not to add the online channel when online and offline market bases are comparable and the level of complementarity is moderate. The integrated manufacturer gains more power at the expense of the offline retailer and the other manufacturer (the traditional manufacturer) when the complementarity between the offline and online channel is the same as offline channels with the addition of a new online channel; furthermore, the retailer earns less, while the traditional manufacturer’s profit hinges on the complementarity between the online and offline channels. It is beneficial for the offline retailer to balance the online and offline market bases of product 1 by improving the sales environment of the physical store. The integrated manufacturer can benefit from varying their marketing actions to decrease the degree of complementarity between the retail and online channels for the two products, while the traditional manufacturer can be better off from the online channel introduction by taking steps to increase the complementarity of the two products between the offline channels.</jats:p>"

Micro- and nanobubble (MNB) technology and its application for wastewater treatment has emerged as a problem-solving alternative for such challenges. This paper reviews the important studies on water treatment in the areas of MNBs and discusses their fundamental properties, such as bubble stability (as tiny entities in water solutions), generation methods, and various chemical and physical features. The paper further overviews the current status of MNB application in water treatment processes such as flotation, aeration, and disinfection and its uses in various sectors, including agriculture, aquaculture, medical, and industry. Based on this review, studies regarding MNBs' basic properties, generation, and application are identified and recognized for future research. This study concludes that despite the promising role of MNBs in water-related application, the current status of research has not reached its true potential. Specifically, there is a need to enhance MNB application at a broader scale.</jats:p>",

To this end, the present research starts with this method and, based on a support vector machine (SVM), it introduces ant colony optimization (ACO) to optimize its penalty coefficient C, Kernel function parameter g, and insensitivity coefficient p, to construct a data-driven ACO-SVM model. The validity of the method is confirmed by taking the Minjiang River Basin as an example. The results show that the runoff predicted by use of ACO-SVM is more accurate than that of the default parameter SVM and the Bayesian method.</jats:p>",

Declining indigenous natural gas production and growing demand for gas in the EU has encouraged investments in cross-border transmission capacity to increase the sharing of resources between the member states, particularly in the aftermath of the Russia–Ukraine gas crisis in January 2009. This article models the EU interconnected natural gas system to assess the impact of investments in the gas transmission network by comparing the performance of the system for scenarios of 2009 and 2017, using a mathematical optimization approach. The model uses the technical data of the infrastructures, such as production, storage, regasification, and exchange capacity through cross-border pipelines, and proposes an optimal collaborative strategy which ensures the best possible coverage of overall demand. The actual peak demand situations of the extreme cases of 2009 and 2017 are analyzed under hypothetical supply crises caused by geopolitical or commercial disputes. The application of the proposed methodology leads to results which show that the investments made in this system do not decongest the cross-border pipeline network but improve the demand coverage. Countries such as Spain and Italy experience a lower impact on gas supply due to the variety of mechanisms available to cover their demand. Furthermore, the findings prove that cooperation facilitates the supply of demand in crisis situations.</jats:p>"

Firstly, wind resource in oilfields is critically assessed based on recorded meteorological data. Then, the wind power potential is numerically tested using specified wind turbines with density-corrected power curves. Later, estimations of annual costs and energy-saving are carried out before and after the installation of SWT via the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) and the EROI (Energy Return on Investment). The proposed methodology was tested against the Daqing oilfield, which is the largest onshore oilfield in China.

The prototype system of 100 mm DSV (diameter spherical volume) was designed and made.The MRI image of a mouse fetus (25 mm long) was obtained successfully with 2.9 T under a power supply driven operation. However, the HTS(ReBCO)-MRI magnet still had a considerable magnetic field fluctuation for clear MRI imaging due to a long-lasting attenuation of screening current induced on the superconducting tapes. To solve this problem, we introduced a power supply system consists of a exciter power supply and a small trimming current supply, which compensates the magnetic field deviation due to the screening current, in parallel. We measured and evaluated the magnetic field stability of a commercial 3T-LTS-MRI magnet under both the power supply driven operation with proposed system and the persistent current operation. The availability of the power supply system was discussed using an experimental HTS-MRI system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Apicomplexa phylum groups important human and animal pathogens that cause severe diseases, encompassing malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. In common with most organisms, apicomplexans rely on heme as cofactor for several enzymes, including cytochromes of the electron transport chain. This heme derives from <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> synthesis and/or the development of uptake mechanisms to scavenge heme from their host. Recent studies have revealed that heme synthesis is essential for <jats:italic>Toxoplasma gondii</jats:italic> tachyzoites, as well as for the mosquito and liver stages of <jats:italic>Plasmodium</jats:italic> spp. In contrast, the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasites rely on scavenging heme from the host red blood cell. The unusual heme synthesis pathway in Apicomplexa spans three cellular compartments and comprises enzymes of distinct ancestral origin, providing promising drug targets. Remarkably given the requirement for heme, <jats:italic>T. gondii</jats:italic> can tolerate the loss of several heme synthesis enzymes at a high fitness cost, while the ferrochelatase is essential for survival. These findings indicate that <jats:italic>T. gondii</jats:italic> is capable of salvaging heme precursors from its host. Furthermore, heme is implicated in the activation of the key antimalarial drug artemisinin. Recent findings established that a reduction in heme availability corresponds to decreased sensitivity to artemisinin in <jats:italic>T. gondii</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Plasmodium falciparum</jats:italic>, providing insights into the possible development of combination therapies to tackle apicomplexan parasites. This review describes the microeconomics of heme in Apicomplexa, from supply, either from <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> synthesis or scavenging, to demand by metabolic pathways, including the electron transport chain.</jats:p>",

GWSS are an object of increased attention, have a great social and environmental significance, require significant capital investments and financial resources for operation, ensuring the required reliability and manageability. Therefore, the issues of optimization of design solutions for the structure and parameters of structures are relevant and require improvement and development of methodological and software solutions to these problems. The paper proposes a method of redundant design schemes and a method of schematic and structural optimization based on a sequential and iterative solution of two problems: for a fixed value of flows in the graph of the redundant scheme, network parameters are optimized (pipeline diameters, heads, and the composition of pumping stations); with fixed network parameters, the problem of the distribution of water flows is solved in the GWSS.</jats:p>",

PKA menjadi alasan utama ibu berhenti menyusui secara dini dan alasan untuk memberikan makanan tambahan lebih awal pada bayinya. Prevalensi PKA belum diketahui secara pasti, diperkirakan antara 30-80% dari ibu yang menyusui mempunyai PKA. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tujuan :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; untuk mengetahui faktor paling dominan dalam PKA.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metode:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Desain penelitian ini menggunakan Cross Sectional.

She felt that her breast milk is not enough to satisfy the needs of the baby. PIM was the main reason mothers stop breastfeeding early and a reason to give extra food early on the baby. Prevalence of PIM is not certain, it is estimated between 30-80% of breastfeeding mothers has PIM.       &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; This study aimed to find out the most dominant factors related to PIM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Design of this study using cross-sectional. The numbers of samples in this study were 71 samples of mothers with babies’ 0-6 months exclusive breastfeeding failure due to experiencing PIM. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Found as many as 59 (83.1%) mothers had PIM with enough milk. There is a significant correlation counseling exclusive breastfeeding during Antenatal Care (ANC) by PIM that has enough milk, mothers who did not receive counseling when the ANC likely to have 19.7 times PIM, p = 0.012; OR = 19.746 (95% CI 1.926 to 202.456). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Exclusive Breastfeeding counseling during ANC quality does health personnel in preparation for breastfeeding implement a very important thing. Utilization of “Gathering of speech” in the concept of 10 T in the ANC should be effected to discuss preparation for lactation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;KEYWORDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: exclusive breastfeeding, perceptions of insufficient milk supply&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Of late, the intrinsic fluvial hydraulics associated with the formation of braided rivers interspersed with sand bars have been vital topics of research. In this paper, the findings yielded from a research foray on the aforementioned underlying processes are presented. For obtaining the requisite experimental data, the three-dimensional flow velocity components are measured with the help of acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) and these velocity data are analyzed using quadrant bursting techniques. The flow characteristics are greatly affected by the presence of a mid-channel bar. The depth-averaged contours of turbulent parameters are analyzed in the present study. Herein, the hole size concept is adopted for separating the bursting events. The effect of hole size on the quadrant events is also studied. The experiments are performed for different submergence ratios. A new parameter, Bursting Index (BI), is proposed in this research to reflect a quantitative measure of the turbulent bursting effect on streambed elevation changes. The parameter BI is the ratio of the odd event occurrence probability to the even event occurrence probability. The high values of correlation coefficients signify that the BI is profoundly influenced by streambed elevation changes, which makes it an ideal parameter for analyzing scour and deposition phenomena in real-life water management projects. The prime focus on performing the experiments has been to analyze the impact of bar height on flow structure in the vicinity of the mid-channel bar.</jats:p>",

In order to represent and predict this diversity, we built a simple and generic model at root tip level combining structural and functional knowledge on root elongation. The tip diameter, reflecting meristem size, is used as a driving variable of elongation. It varies, in response to the fluctuations of photo-assimilate availability, between two limits (minimal and maximal diameter). The elongation rate is assumed to be dependent on the transient value of the diameter. Elongation stops when the tip reaches the minimal diameter. The model could satisfactorily reproduce patterns of root elongation and tip diameter changes observed in various species at different scales. Although continuous, the model could generate divergent root classes as classically observed within populations of lateral roots. This model should help interpret the large plasticity of root elongation patterns which can be obtained in response to different combinations of endogenous and exogenous factors. The parameters could be used in phenotyping the root system.</jats:p>",

By considering a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer and a manufacturer, this paper discusses the effect of the manufacturer’s fairness concerns and the retailer’s fairness concerns on the fresh agriculture product supply chain within the framework of Nash bargaining. Meanwhile, a revenue-sharing contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain with fairness concerns. The results show that the manufacturer’s behavioral tendency of fairness concerns will reduce their fresh-keeping effort; thereby, the freshness of products and market demand will also decrease. The behavioral tendencies of fairness concerns of both sides reduce the overall effectiveness of the supply chain and adversely affect the stability of the fresh produce supply chain. Both the optimal retail price and the fresh-keeping effort can be achieved while all parties get higher utilities under the revenue-sharing contract in comparison to the case without coordination.</jats:p>",

In addition, the groups of heat exchangers with a tied supply of heat, i.e. with redistribution of the heat flow in a variable mode of operation, are used. A new method for calculating the variable modes of operation of heat points with a tied heat supply has been developed. The method of mathematical modeling defines the dependencies that determine the change in the heat exchanger parameters in variable operating modes.

Specifically, we consider how resource dependence theory, institutional theory, resource orchestration theory, structural inertia, game theory, real options theory, event systems theory, awareness–motivation–capability framework, prospect theory, and tournament theory offer ideas that can help scholars build knowledge about pandemics’ effects on supply chains as well as help managers formulate responses.</jats:p>",

In order to accomplish this objective, the key enablers of circular initiatives are identified through a comprehensive review of the available literature and then finalized through experts’ opinions. This study identifies ten significant enablers of circular initiatives and evaluates them appropriately through grey DEMATEL. The adopted methodology is to develop causal relationships among the identified enablers of circular initiatives. Further, it also categorizes the enablers of circular initiatives into cause and effect groups. The findings suggest that consumer attitude, top management commitment, economic incentives, policies and legal frameworks are vital for the implementation of circular initiatives. This study identifies and analyses the enablers that are significant for the implementation of circular practices and assists the managers/policy planners who want to move towards a CE. </jats:p>",

In an explanatory study, we have collected data about sustainable supply chain practices in 11 European luxury good companies, by interviewing and surveying 13 managers. In a first consumer study, we held interviews with French luxury consumers in Bordeaux about their sustainability expectations (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>= 170). The results show that while the distribution of attention is dependent on the respective supply chain activities, luxury goods companies address sustainability concerns and aim to take responsibility for their activities. However, the emphasis is on the dimension of economic sustainability. A comparison with sustainability expectations of French luxury goods consumers suggests that business practices are not perfectly well aligned with these expectations. Consumers put more emphasis on social and environmental sustainability dimensions. On the other hand, business activities concerning waste reduction and raw material management rather well match consumer expectations.</jats:p>",

We focus on decreasing returns from excessive bricolage and, more importantly, highlight an important role played by supply chain knowledge in mitigating decreasing returns from bricolage. The role played by supply chain knowledge in reducing the negative effects of excessive bricolage is not explored yet. This study, in the context of an emerging economy, seeks to isolate the linear and quadratic effects of bricolage on firm performance and examines the moderating influence of supply chain knowledge on the bricolage-to-firm performance relationship. To test the proposed relationships, data from large-scale manufacturing firms in north-west India were used. The final sample size of 106 firms was used for testing the relationships using stepwise OLS analysis. The results revealed that at lower levels of supply chain knowledge, bricolage had an inverted-U relationship with firm performance. In other words, supply chain knowledge mitigates the negative effects of bricolage on performance. However, it did not strengthen the positive effect of bricolage on performance.</jats:p>",

The goal of the ESI is to decide on how much service capacity is required for placing orders to the ESP, who directly serves the customers. Considering discrete and continuous demand distribution statuses, a centralised model with symmetric demand information and decentralised models with asymmetric demand information are developed to analyse the optimal ordering decisions and discuss the influence of information asymmetry. Furthermore, option contracts are applied to help coordinate the supply chain under asymmetric demand information based on different demand distribution statuses. Optimal option contract menus are designed for the ESP to promote the information sharing. Results show that the option contract can coordinate the EHSSC with asymmetric demand information under both discrete and continuous demand distribution statuses. The exercise price will be higher under lower demand information than that under higher demand information and the transfer payment will be less under lower demand information than that under higher demand information. Moreover, although the ESI has demand information superiority and can make use of opportunistic behaviour to maximise its own profit, the ESP as the leader can design the option contract to incentive the ESI to achieve true information sharing, and even obtain nearly all of the channel profit.</jats:p>",

A conceptual framework was proposed and tested using questionnaires, which were filled through face-to-face interviews. A mixed-methods approach was used to achieve a comprehensive understanding of research relationships. The population was 101 international organizations in Egyptian automotive industry within its three sub-sectors (manufacturers of auto-feeding and automotive industries and distributors). Structural equation modelling was used to examine the proposed relationships. Results indicated that ICT positively/significantly affects both SC integration (SCI) and HSCP. SCI positively/significantly affects SC information sharing (SCIS). SCIS affects HSCP in terms of mass customization and postponement positively/significantly. The three sub-sectors are using a new blended SC strategy that hybridizes attributes of each approach according to the SC node’s position. This article adds value to the current debate on the applicability of implementing a blended lean-agile SC strategy by integrating two main lines of management research (leagility approach and hybridized lean-agile manufacturing systems) into one new hybrid approach. It is the first study that investigated empirically the direct/indirect ICT–HSCP relationships of multiple nodes in a heterogeneous market. It maps the hierarchical auto SCs of an emerging market. It provides automotive SC players with practical insights on using ICT for better SCI and SCIS and choosing the appropriate aspects of leanness, agility and leagility based on the organization’s position across its SC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance. The traditional scheme of blood supply to the spinal cord, formed in the 60-70s of the last century, does not correspond to the pathogenesis of many neurological disorders of the spinal cord. There is also a discrepancy in terminology: the names of arteries found in surgical and neurological works do not correspond to the names of the International Anatomical Nomenclature. Therefore, today this issue needs further analysis.&#x0D;\nObjective: to summarize the information of different authors on the number of spinal branches and their branches, topography, blood supply to each segment of the spinal cord, to analyze the individual variability of sources of blood supply to the spinal cord.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. Analysis of scientific publications in the international electronic scientometric database PubMed by keywords for the period 2000-2018. and comparing these data with the imaginations of 1760-1993.&#x0D;\nResults. The idea of ​​the structural organization of the blood supply to the spinal cord has changed. With modern data, intracranial sources, namely: anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the blood supply to the true cervical spinal cord, and the rest of the department - lower cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal - blood supply from extracranial sources, and they exist in this area segmental branches of the aorta. Nowadays, extracranial sources are considered the main in the blood supply to the spinal cord. It is now known that the anterior and posterior spinal arteries are intermittent and cannot provide blood supply to the spinal cord, as previously thought. The general plan of arterial blood supply of a spinal cord can be presented in the form of a set of pools of front and back radical (radiculomedullary) arteries. The anterior radicular arteries are 4-8, and the posterior 15-20, respectively, along the spinal cord in its ventral and dorsal departments the same number of arterial pools are formed. There are anastomotic connections between these pools, which are not always functionally complete. Each of these basins is supplied by a separate radiculomedullary artery. Each such artery feeds not one but several segments of the spinal cord. The number and levels of approach to the spinal cord of radiculomedullary arteries, especially the anterior ones, differ significantly in individual variability. The perception of the vascularization of the cervical spinal cord was analyzed. At different times, information about the number of arteries that supplied blood to this department differed significantly: in 1760 it was believed that it was 31 arteries; and in 1882-1939 - only 7; in 1943 - 27, in 1958 - 6-8; in 1958 - 7-10; in 1961-1963 - 5-8; in 1966-1973 - 5; in 1993 - 1-2 arteries. Such different information about spinal cord vascularization is the result of significant individual variability.&#x0D;\nConclusions. Incomplete current knowledge about the blood supply to the spinal cord is the cause of unresolved problems of etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical course of spinal ischemic strokes, including cervical localization. The existing terminological confusion regarding the names of the arteries that supply blood to the spinal cord, in particular its cervical region, is explained by the significant variability of the radiculomedullary arteries of this zone in terms of number, diameter, and location. Due to the existence of arterio-venous anastomoses, arterial myelobulbar anastomoses, adjacent areas of blood supply in this area, theft phenomena are formed and distant foci of ischemia appear, including both the spinal cord and the brain. Therefore, in order to make an angiotopic diagnosis, it is necessary to take into account not only anatomical but also physiological and pathophysiological aspects of regulation and compensation of cerebral circulation.</jats:p>"

Project management scholars access conceptual frameworks and methods that shed light on day-to-day project management practices, but such practices are themselves shaped by the supply and cost of finance capital. Consequently, project management scholarship would benefit from a closer look at finance industry practices to better understand how, for example, calculations and risk assessments matter for day-to-day project management practices. In order to theorize the project organization form, finance theory and its key concepts of risk and uncertainty need to be recognized and subject to scholarly inquiry. This article presents two cases of project work, wherein the former (life science ventures) is thinly capitalized on the basis of uncertainty in the development activities, whereas the latter case (housing production) is thickly capitalized, which indicates that subsidies, insurances, and exemptions increase investment appetite. In either case, economic and social welfare are not maximized, which calls for project management scholars to recognize the role of finance industry practices when allocating finance capital to various projects. </jats:p>",

Various measures of lean, green, resilient, and agile \n  practices in CSC were identified from previous studies and experts’ opinions. Contextual relationships between practice measures were \n  established via brainstorming session. Measures were then classified based on their driving and dependence powers. The results showed \n  that measures of lean, green, resilient, and agile practices in CSC can be organized in a six-level structural model. Moreover, highly \n  dependent measures at top level in CSC model are operational costs and customer satisfaction, whereas the highly driving at most bottom \n  level of this model are ISO 14001 implementation and government support system for green cold supply chain. Validity of CSC model was \n  assessed in three CSC firms; food, pharmaceutical, and Third Party logistics firms. In conclusion, measures emerging with higher driving \n  power and those with high dependence in ISM hierarchy contribute significantly to enhancing capability of CSC. The proposed ISM may support \n  decision makers in prioritization improvement efforts and achieving effective CSC.</jats:p>",

To do this, these pumps are mostly manufactured with very rustic physical structures and only with analog markers that are not very precise. This situation keeps the equipment unprotected and only shows parameters analogically, this makes the process inefficient. With the present project, we designed, developed and simulated a prototype of a system that evaluates and monitors the physical parameters that influence the operation of different thermal machines used for pumping. To achieve the above mentioned, a series of sensors were installed, the signal is sent to Raspberry Pi 3, in which the data is processed, stored and shown to the user of the equipment through a graphic interface. A possible improvement of this system in the future would be to create a mobile application, which in real time, could alert the user of possible failures, decreasing the side effects on the environment, optimizing crop rotation for the continuous improvement of the competitiveness of the agro-industrial sector in northern Sinaloa.</jats:p>"

We find that in urban China, commute time does not have effect on daily labor supply but has negative effects on workdays per week and weekly labor supply. These results are different from those found in Germany and Spain, and are potentially related to the intense competition among workers in the labor market of China. Moreover, the effect of commute time on workdays per week is stronger for job changed workers. In addition, the effects of commute time on labor supply are not different between males and females. Finally, policy implications for active commuting are discussed.</jats:p>"

However, this technique is site-specific and therefore its application in developing countries with different hydrologic and environment conditions remains limited. In this research, a 3-discipline study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of the application of this technique in Aswan City (Egypt). Firstly, a hydrological model was developed to identify key environmental factors that influence the effectiveness of BF, and to formulate plans for the design and management of the BF system. Secondly, water samples were collected for one year (January 2017 to December 2017) from the water sources and monitoring wells to characterize the bank-filtrate quality. Lastly, an economic study was conducted to compare the capital and operating costs of BF and the existing treatment techniques. The results demonstrated that there is high potential for application of BF under such hydrological and environmental conditions. However, there are some aspects that could restrict the BF efficacy and must therefore be considered during the design process. These include the following: (i) Over-pumping practices can reduce travel time, and thus decrease the efficiency of treatment; (ii) Locating the wells near the surface water systems (&lt;50 m) decreases the travel time to the limit (&lt;10 days), and thus could restrict the treatment capacity. In such case, a low pumping rate must be applied; (iii) the consequences of lowering the surface water level can be regulated through the continuous operation of the wells. Furthermore, laboratory analysis indicated that BF is capable of producing high quality drinking water. However, an increase in organic matter (i.e., humics) concentration was observed in the pumped water, which increases the risk of trihalomethanes being produced if post-chlorination is implemented. The economic study ultimately demonstrated that BF is an economic and sustainable technique for implementation in Aswan City to address the demand for potable water.</jats:p>"

Because of the uneven distribution of water resources across the territory of our country, many localities and even cities do not have their own sources of water supply and reservoirs where it would be possible to discharge treated wastewater. To solve this problem, group and district water supply and sanitation systems are being designed, built and developed. The length of such systems is hundreds or even thousands of kilometers, and they include many pumping stations, regulating tanks, storage ponds, local and centralized treatment facilities. Significant financial investments are required annually for the construction and operation of such structures [1-6]. Therefore, the choice of routes, structure of structures, ways of transporting water and waste water, justification of the location of water intakes, treatment facilities are relevant and require special attention and technical and economic analysis of design options. The paper proposes a comprehensive approach to optimizing the structure of structures and methods for supplying water to consumers and transporting waste water to treatment facilities on the basis of the redundant design methods.</jats:p>",

Unlike previous reviews of the SCRM literature, our methodology utilizes both bibliometric and cocitation analyses of publications in selective management and operations and supply chain management journals. In addition to analyzing the current state of the SCRM literature via bibliometric analysis, we delve deeply into the clusters of literature informing SCRM studies through a cocitation analysis. By conducting a text analysis on these clusters, we identify the main themes and provide insights regarding article relevance, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies for each cluster. In addition, we categorize the themes within each cluster into three main groups of matured, developing, and emerging. Based on the identified categories, we provide detailed discussions on the promising avenues for research and practice in three main areas of sustainable SCRM, behavioral SCRM, and nascent methodologies and theories in SCRM studies. Finally, we dedicate a section in our review to discussing the direction of SCRM research during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 era.</jats:p>",

The challenge is the difficulty of managing the extra municipal solid waste to be disposed of, exposing great pressure and cost on the plant. Conventionally, the solution is either burning the surplus waste and providing the extra cooling required for the condenser with a summer chiller and paying the tax of the total heat generation of the plant, or paying other industries to burn the waste for their specific applications. Both of these solutions are, however, costly. In this study, to address this challenge the utilization of the extra available resources of waste incineration plants for district cooling supply is proposed. Then, the proposed solution is analyzed from the thermodynamic and economic points of view. The feasibility of the proposal is investigated for a real waste incineration plant in Denmark and its 50 neighboring office/service buildings as the case study. The simulations are done based on real hourly data of the plant and economic parameters. The results show that for the case study for a plant with a thermal capacity of 73 MW, a district cooling with a peak load of over 20 MW could be perfectly supplied. The payback period of the proposed solution, including the cost of piping, absorption chiller, etc., can be as short as five years.</jats:p>"

The results are related to the improvement and the use of new technologies to maximize efficiency in water management. However, energy consumption has been increasing as a consequence of new management and uses of water. Especially in pressurized water distribution systems, the use of pressure reduction valves (PRVs) increases the water usage efficiency but it decreases the energy consumption efficiency, since the valves dissipate energy that could be recovered. This research presents a proposal of a recovery system based on the installation of pumps used as turbines (PATs). These machines are located in different points of the high-pressure water distribution system in the Valencia Metropolitan System (Spain). An annual estimate of the theoretical recoverable energy as well as the “ideal” pump for each point were proposed. The theoretical recovered energy value was 847,301 kWh/year for a specific analyzed point. Besides, the characteristic curves of the PATs from a selected point were determined, estimating an improvement in the sustainable indexes. The calculus of these green parameters showed that the implementation of this solution caused a reduction in consumed energy of 1.50 kWh/m3.</jats:p>"

So, the demand of the products is influenced by selling price, service level and also promotional effort. On the basis of this gaming structure, two mathematical models have been formed - crisp model, where each member of the chain exactly knows all the cost parameters and fuzzy model where those cost parameters are considered as fuzzy numbers. Optimal strategies for the manufacturer and the retailers are determined and some numerical examples have been given. Finally, how perturbations of parameters affect the profits of the chain members have been determined.</jats:p>"

This studyanalyzed supply chain models of salt in selected industry in Central Java.. The study was conducted through case study on two selected industrial groups: (1) the salt processing industry, represented by two salt processing companies and (2) the salt user industry, represented also by two salt users (food and non-food industry), in Central Java. Indepth interview was applied to collect data, included the data on the flow of goods, flow of finances, and flow of information patern. The data was used to finalize the structure and model of salt supply chain in Central Java. The data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis, which refers to SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model dimension. The study showed that the salt processing industry supplied majorly by out-region supplier, counted for 30 – 70% of raw salt material needed.. The salt processing industry with large storage tended to keep large amount of salt as investment (buffer stock). In addition, industry with smaller storage capacity attempted to enhance the stok utility and accelerated cash-to-cash conversion for the available salt. The salt supply chain model on the processing industry possessed good reliability. In addition, the fish processing and textile industry merely made purchase to local area suppliers. The textile industry applied a collaborative management and took leadership role in the collaborative supply chain to secure the salt supply continuity.</jats:p>"

Research methods: theoretical analysis of primary sources, normative documents, conceptual principles of logistics; systematization, modeling, observation and testing. The results of the analysis revealed that the professional competence of future logistics officers is a personal education and an integral characteristic, which includes key and general competencies that are the result of training in higher military educational institution, covering the dynamic set of knowledge, skills and experience in this specialty, personal and socially significant qualities (ways of thinking, ability to self-study, learning styles, views, values, nature of behavior in unpredictable conditions, etc.) arising on the basis of the formed subject competences and provide an opportunity to perform the military logistics officer’s duties and professional tasks effectively. The principles of forming the professional competence of future logistics officers corresponding to their specialty as they are basic both in military-economic, and in pedagogical logistics are defined. These are: principle of systematization, principle of functionality, principle of integration and integrated goal setting, principle of «just in time», principle of «jit-reliability», principle of solving information problems by standardizing data, principle of prioritizing the needs of learners, principle of variability of strategies, methods and techniques, principle of focusing on the end result, principle of interaction of all components of the professional competence formation system, principle of coordination of actions of different divisions specialists. The influence of these principles on the formation of the future logistics officers’ professional competence is analyzed. An algorithm for the formation of professional competence was developed, which was modeled according to two opposite approaches – directions (direct and reverse): «bottom up», it means by stages of professional training in higher military educational institution – a sequence of courses, semesters and levels of training (bachelor, master) of future officers; and «top-down», it means from the principles of professional competence formation through the construction of a «goal tree» and the definition of its components (key competencies) and their manifestations in the material of subjects that form general subject competencies, to building a «competence tree» and designing them for each discipline and definition of subject competencies. There are a number of teaching methods and techniques that take into account the specifics of logistics, such as: methods of empirical adult learning, problem-based learning, the method of planned mistakes, visualization methods, methods of press conferences, dialogue, discussions, brainstorming techniques, case studies, which should be used in the educational process to form the professional competence of future logistics officers.

A fault sample consists of data collected from all the sensors at certain time, which lead the dimension of the fault sample is very high. When the ship is sailing, there is a randomness in fault categories and fault duration, which leads the fault data unbalanced. This paper proposes an appropriate combinational approach to address the above problems. First, to reduce computational complexity, the high dimensional fault samples are converted into the low dimensional ones using the principal component analysis (PCA). Second, a sample size optimization (SSO) strategy is proposed to address the problem of the learning from the imbalanced datasets, which improve the classification performance of support vector machine (SVM). Third, a three-dimensional Arnold mapping is introduced into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to improve its generalization capability. Finally, the SVM optimized by the improved PSO is trained as the classifier to identify the ten faults in the fuel oil supply system. Results demonstrate that the average correct diagnosis ratio can be as high as 93.9%.</jats:p>",

The aim of this work is to develop an energy-efficient “green” technology for the desalination of seawater and the production of fresh water from contaminated sources, through its forced evaporation with subsequent condensation of moisture. The process of obtaining fresh water is due to pre-saturated air in a closed thermodynamic cycle. The paper presents the thermal balance of modular installations. To increase the insolation power per unit area, it is possible to use various centers of solar energy. Experimental studies and a comparison of the performance of two variants of desalination plants in water with each other and with theoretically possible productivity were carried out. The productivity of the technologies is sufficient for the autonomous supply of drinking water to individual settlements and for the cultivation of plant foods by the hydroponic method.</jats:p>",

SC Risk has been studied in the literature, providing frameworks and methodologies to manage SC failures. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed to prevent hazardous and disruptive risks and their consequences. These risks must be considered during the process of designing a supply chain. Some methodological contributions concerning risk in the supply chain network design (SCND) are conceptual frameworks for mitigating SC disruptions, which suggest strategies and measures for designing robust and resilient SCs. Although such contributions are valuable, they do not indicate how to cope with risk when designing a SC. The main objective of this research is to describe a methodology aimed at including risk considerations into the SCND. Our proposal aims to be, on the one hand, a comprehensive approach that includes a risk identification and assessment procedure in each of the stages of the SCND process and, on the other hand, a tool for decision-making in SC design or redesign processes when SC risks need to be considered. The methodology proposed is an extension of a SCND methodology including risk considerations in order to improve the performance of the supply chains. A case study illustrates how the proposed methodological works, achieving the identification of SC risks already observed in previous works.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Postponement is a well‐known organizational concept and usually relates to the deferment in time of manufacturing and/or logistics operations. In the current global competitive landscape, situations where postponement can be applied are rapidly increasing. Faced with the wide range of customs duties and free‐trade agreements currently in place, companies need to (re)design their postponement strategies to customize their products appropriately, and to the proper degree, in each market. As the actual location where operations take place has a major impact on a company’s overall performance, the spatial perspective must also be taken into account when designing global postponement strategies, alongside the conventional temporal perspective. Heretofore, the academic literature does not offer any comprehensive framework on a global scale either for handling what is known as the postponement boundary problem, or for conceptualizing the related postponement strategies. Building on previous research, the aim of the present study was to investigate the postponement concept in a global environment with a downstream focus. The intended purpose is twofold: first, to review and expand previous studies on the subject and, second, to provide some guidelines for conceptualizing global postponement strategies. A structured literature review was first conducted, followed by the development of a framework that combines both the temporal and the spatial dimensions. Finally, the framework was applied to a group of 28 business cases taken from the literature, to act as a bridge between academic theories and practitioners’ current business operations.</jats:p>",

Firstly, based on the connection modes of distribution lines, interconnecting structure of substations and allocation of transformers, the typical power supply modes for medium-voltage distribution networks are constructed, and the mode attributes are calculated. Then, based on economic analysis and load supply capability, the optimal match mode and mode parameters for network/substation on different voltage levels are selected with the objective of minimizing load supply cost. Finally, 110kV distribution networks are introduced, and the power supply relations between 110kV lines and 110kV transformers are studied, and the optimal coordinated power supply mode for multi-voltage distribution networks considering 110kV lines is obtained, which can provide guidance for the coordination and planning of regional distribution networks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Rice is a major cereal crop that ensures food security and rural income generation in Nepal. The objectives of this study were to analyse the dynamics of the rice sub-sector from the perspective of production, research investment, and supply chain as expected outcomes are not yet achieved in spite of continuity in priority for research and production investment. Accordingly, this study was done by using secondary data covering 2000 to 2018 combined with a case study. For the case study, Morang, the district with the highest rice production was chosen. A random sample of 144 supply chain actors in which 100 rice producers, 10 collectors, 10 wholesalers, 7 millers, and 17 retailers were chosen from the list of the targeted population in each category. Findings revealed that rice production, productivity, and research investment were increasing at the rate of 1.25, 1.65, and 10.57 percent per annum, respectively. There was a strong positive link between research investment and production. Millers were the main value-adding actor. They have been getting the highest profit margin (31.5%) based on investing more (46.51%) in value-added activities. In contrast, farmers received a relatively low-profit margin (13.9%) with a 1.26 benefit-cost ratio. This was mainly due to the low adoption of improved production technology and weak horizontal coordination of rice producers. The percentage of food surplus households has increased, mainly due to the adoption of rice technologies generated by rice research programs, but this has not well reflected in terms of getting more profit margin by the rice-producing farmers. On the other hand, the research investment in rice was not consistent, and even not adequate for the required technology generation. Therefore, an increased investment could enhance the efficiency of generating technology packages, and implementation of effective extension services targeting the rice-growing farmers through increasing total factor productivity is crucial to increase the profit margin of rice producers. Moreover, with strengthened horizontal coordination among the major actors and with the increased investment in value-added activities in each stage of the supply chain based on consumer demand, increased profit margin for making the rice supply chain sustainable.</jats:p>",

The housing and communal services system is often one of the main sources of anthropogenic impact. So, when receiving thermal energy by burning of organic or mineral fuel, various types of pollutants enter the atmospheric air. In this paper, a comparison of gross emissions into the air during operation of a heat source using fuel oil and wood fuel (pellets) is made. An analysis of the results was carried out. It showed that the most “environmentally friendly” are heat sources, the main equipment of which includes boiler units burning wood fuel (pellets). With the operation of this type of boiler, the level of anthropogenic load in the form of pollutants emissions is significantly reduced, in particular, there is a multiple decrease in emissions of pollutants of hazard class III.</jats:p>",

This article focuses on whether adopting index insurance improves access to financial markets and reduces credit rationing, using empirical analyses focused on Ethiopia. With different identification strategies, including a newly developed method that leverages the varying availability of index insurance across areas, the authors control for potential selection biases by forecasting potential insurance adopters; they apply a cross‐sectional double‐difference method. Credit rationing can take the form of either supply‐side quantity rationing, in which case potential borrowers who need credit are involuntarily excluded from the credit market, or demand‐side rationing, such that borrowers self‐select and voluntarily withdraw to avoid transaction costs and threats to their collateral. By differentiating supply‐side and demand‐side forms and employing a direct elicitation method to determine credit rationing status, this study reveals that 38% of sample households are credit constrained. The preferred estimation techniques suggest that index insurance significantly reduces supply‐side rationing.</jats:p>",

However, the cocoa industry faces several problems including the various risks involved in the cocoa supply chain. The aim of this study were: 1) Identifying risks in the cocoa supply chain 2) Analyzing the members of the supply chain with the highest risk 3) Evaluating and mitigating cocoa supply chain risks effectively and efficiently. An integrated analytic network process (ANP) and weighted failure mode effect analysis (WFMEA) method will be used to determine and analyze the highest risk in the cocoa supply chain. The results of the priority of the members of the value chain in the cocoa supply chain risk management are SMEs (0.43801), with the risk having the highest priority is production risk (0.29262) as well as alternative strategic priorities namely by increasing income (0.28754). The results of risk control are mainly focused on efforts to increase the income of cocoa farmers by utilizing cocoa processing byproducts such as cocoa bean pulp and cocoa pod husks. The cocoa bean pulp can be processed into nata products and cocoa juice, while the cocoa pod skin can be used as fertilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers a multinational green supply chain (MGSC), composed of a manufacturer and a foreign retailer affected by import tariff. The main theme of this paper is to explore supply chain decisions and coordination contract. Four decision models were investigated: (1) the centralized decision supply chain model (model CS), (2) the decentralized decision supply chain model (model DS), (3) the R&amp;D cost sharing contract model (model RD) with the retailer sharing a portion of green R&amp;D cost, and (4) the quantity discount-cost sharing contract model (model QD), which combined a quantity discount contract with a cost sharing contract. The equilibrium decisions of these models were derived. The R&amp;D cost sharing contract was found to improve greenness and performance of the supply chain but cannot reach the optimal performance compared to the centralized decision model. While the quantity discount-cost sharing contract can achieve a perfect coordination of MGSC. Furthermore, import tariff has an adverse effect on the performance of MGSC. The increase in tariff shrinks the threshold of the highest wholesale price and quantity discount coefficient offered by the manufacturer, which will hamper the cooperation of supply chain. However, the enhancement of consumers’ green preference is conducive to encourage the retailer to participate in cooperation and smoothen the adverse effects of tariff fluctuation. In the same model, the adverse effect of tariff on product greenness and the retail price does not change with the increase in its value. However, the adverse effect on the green performance price ratio and the profits from all parties in the supply chain are slow.</jats:p>",

One critical aspect concerns the behaviour of the PAT in the presence of solid particles in the flow which impinge against the inner surface of the device, producing a loss of material termed impact erosion. In this paper, the numerical assessment of PAT erosion is performed, by referring, as a case study, to an existing pressure control station in Southern Italy. The variable operative strategy (VOS) was applied to derive the frequency distribution of flow rates over the PAT operation, under the hypothesis of performing the hydraulic regulation of the hydropower plant. The commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Ansys Fluent was employed for simulating the liquid–solid flow inside the PAT and then coupled with an in-house code to estimate the erosion. The vulnerability of the PAT to wear was analysed by varying its flow rate, aiming at characterizing the decay of PAT components at a constant rotational speed. Finally, a detailed characterization of the PAT response to the particle impingement at its best efficiency point (BEP) was developed and discussed.</jats:p>",

The efficiency of each supply chain actor in this study was measured using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. Performance measurement was done through the DEA approach and the performance attributes were input and output variables. The respondents observed were 50 farmers and 13 supply chain actors working in institutions. The samples of farmers were taken using purposive sampling technique, while the samples of supply chain actors were obtained using snowball sampling. The results have shown that the most efficient supply chain actors were retailers with an efficiency value of 1 (100%), while inefficient supply chain actors were farmers with an average efficiency value of 0.709. From a total of 50 Decision Making Unit (DMU) of total farmers, 13 DMU (26%) were efficient, while 37 DMU (74%) were inefficient and further need improvements, like using certified seeds and suitable fertilizer recommendations, as well as reducing external labor during the process of maintenance, harvesting and post-harvest. Farmers are expected to have the desire to learn from referral farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The proposed conceptual model takes into account actors starting from the upstream to the downstream of the rice supply chain. Since it is developed based on real situations, it is highly relevant for supporting the local policymakers to address problems, such as lack of integration, unclear division of role, and lack of competitiveness within this supply chain.

In some cases, we are talking about creating new approaches and replacing existing technologies aimed at achieving the set results in terms of speed and flexibility in choosing options to meet consumer demand. Thus, the analysis allows us to state that logistics mediation as a special sphere of business activity has passed the stage of formation. The prerequisites for its improvement are primarily related to the implementation of the strategy of innovative balanced development of the national economy and further development of the logistics services market. Starting with the 3PL model, all logistics service providers actively use information and communication technologies, work in both retail and e-Commerce formats, and develop on the principle of system outsourcing, creating significant added value for their customers by saving time and resources, sharing responsibilities, and responding quickly to changes in consumer preferences. We can state with confidence that if earlier logistics was considered as a function of providing business, now it determines the system way of doing business and its innovative technologies.</jats:p>",

Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis corresponding with total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals in each operating condition were performed. Results showed that DO of 0.3 mg/L at 20 °C achieved over 60.7% and over 97.9% of TN and COD removal, respectively, suggesting that such condition achieved effective nitrite-oxidizing bacteria inhibition and efficient denitrification. An unexpected finding was that sulfur-reducing Haematobacter and nitrogen-fixing Geofilum and Shinella were highly abundant with the copredominance of ammonia-oxidizing Comamonas and Nitrosomonas, nitrite-oxidizing Limnohabitans, and denitrifying Simplicispira, Castellaniella, and Nitratireductor. Further, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with respect to the operating conditions associated with phenotype prediction via R-based tool Tax4Fun was performed for a preliminary diagnosis of microbial functionality. The effects of DO, temperature, nitrite, and nitrate in various extents toward each predominant microbe were discussed.

One view is that buyers benefit from having dependent suppliers as this provides buyers the ability to dictate terms in the relationship. An alternative perspective is that buyers are worse off from having dependent suppliers in that this dependence can lead to conditions that harm value creation. In this manuscript, supply chain management theory is extended by evaluating these differing predictions. This is accomplished by analyzing a database from Bloomberg of objective, secondary data for more than 3,000 supplier relationships for 49 firms independently recognized as possessing exemplar supply chains and 530 of these firms’ largest industry rivals based on GICS industry codes. These data are utilized to develop a portfolio‐level measure of buyer–supplier dependence that incorporates the bilateral nature of dependence. The findings indicate that, relative to their industry rivals, firms with exemplar supply chains have suppliers with a lower level of dependency. These results contribute to theory, inform management practice, and suggest avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

The change of energy conversion equipment operation and demand response measures implementation are all need costs. Integrated optimization of the production side and demand side of energy products such as cold, heat, electricity, and steam have the potential to reduce the total energy cost of IES. To this end, this article combines cases to establish a mathematical model for the various types of energy production and demand response costs of cold and heat electricity, with the goal of minimizing the overall cost of energy supply and use as a comprehensive control and optimization of energy supply and demand in IES. The results show that compared with simply adjusting the output of energy stations, the coordinated regulation of energy production and demand side of the integrated energy system has the potential to further reduce the cost of integrated energy supply and utilization system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>After the Great East Japan Earthquake, energy security and vulnerability have become critical issues facing the Japanese energy system. The integration of renewable energy sources to meet specific regional energy demand is a promising scenario to overcome these challenges. To this aim, this paper proposes a novel hydrogen-based hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), in which hydrogen fuel can be produced using both the methods of solar electrolysis and supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass feedstock. The produced hydrogen is considered to function as an energy storage medium by storing renewable energy until the fuel cell converts it to electricity. The proposed HRES is used to meet the electricity demand load requirements for a typical household in a selected residential area located in Shinchi-machi in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. The techno-economic assessment of deploying the proposed systems was conducted, using an integrated simulation-optimization modeling framework, considering two scenarios: (1) minimization of the total cost of the system in an off-grid mode and (2) maximization of the total profit obtained from using renewable electricity and selling surplus solar electricity to the grid, considering the feed-in-tariff (FiT) scheme in a grid-tied mode. As indicated by the model results, the proposed HRES can generate about 47.3 MWh of electricity in all scenarios, which is needed to meet the external load requirement in the selected study area. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the system in scenarios 1 and 2 was estimated at 55.92 JPY/kWh and 56.47 JPY/kWh, respectively.</jats:p>"

According to the variance of the error between the expected output and the actual output of the training sample, the momentum term is adjusted; The adaptive learning rate is increased according to the change direction of the back propagation error.

For sections 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3, water can only cover less than 50% of the pipeline cross section when the exhaust valves were not set, and various backflow zones can be observed in these sections, which can increase the resistance of the water flow.

It investigates how supplier and customer collaborations help firms to enhance product eco‐innovations, and/or process eco‐innovations, and how the institutional context (i.e., regulatory, market, and community pressures) influences these relationships. The structural equation modeling approach is used to analyze the data captured from medium and large manufacturing enterprises in three major sectors: automotive, electronics, and textiles. The results show that community pressure has a positive effect on supplier collaboration, which further leads to enhanced process eco‐innovation. On the other hand, the findings indicate that while market pressure enhances customer collaboration, this does not reinforce product eco‐innovation. Contrary to our expectation, regulatory pressures do not impact supplier or customer collaboration for innovation. Overall, different institutional factors indicate divergent effects on supply chain collaboration and product/process eco‐innovation. The importance of normative pressures, such as those applied through the local community and interest groups, for eco‐innovations in production processes is further discussed as a typical feature of the institutional environment of Chinese supplier firms.</jats:p>",

FAs often decide to manage a second‐tier supplier in a reactive way when the first‐tier supplier is unable to control the former. In our model, an FA proactively looks upstream to its first‐tier (S1) and second‐tier (S2) suppliers in a three‐tier supply chain. We develop four proactive strategies with incentives and one reactive strategy with no incentive. We find that, first, proactive strategies are better at improving quality, demand, and profit than reactive strategies are. Second, among proactive strategies, the parallel incentive strategy, centrally controlling both the S1 and S2, imposes the fewest restrictions. It yields superior quality and profit performance for the entire supply chain as well as for individual suppliers. Third, when the tiers are sequentially controlled, proactive incentive strategies promise superior profits for the FA if its unit profitability is not sufficiently high. Finally, the reactive strategy may be more appropriate if the FA's profitability is lower than that of the S1 or S2.</jats:p>",

Conventional reference circuits have demonstrated a weak performance over wide supply ranges. Channel-length modulation in the transistors causes the circuit to be sensitive to power supply variation. To solve this inherent problem, this paper proposes a new output-voltage-line-regulation controller circuit. When a variation occurs in the power supply, the controller promptly responds to the supply deviation and removes unwanted current in the output path of the reference circuit. The proposed circuit was implemented in a 0.35-μm SK Hynix CMOS standard process. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed reference circuit could generate a reference voltage of 0.895 V under a power supply voltage of 3.3 V, line regulation of 1.85 mV/V in the supply range of 2.3 to 5 V, maximum power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of −54 dB, and temperature coefficient of 11.9 ppm/°C in the temperature range of 25 to 100 °C.</jats:p>"

In the presence of the target analyte (geosmin), the target analyte occupies the detection site and the detection signal will attenuate. As the concentration of the target analyte increases, the attenuation of the electrical signal becomes more pronounced. This sensor can quantitatively detect geosmin at concentrations as low as 5 ng/L, which is currently the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for GSM detection by an electrochemical sensor in reported studies. The modified GCE provided an analytical curve for GSM detection in the range of 5–200 ng/L.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a novel storage technology for excess electricity consisting of a heat pump, a heat storage and an organic rankine cycle is investigated with regards to its environmental impact. Waste heat is exergetically upgraded, stored in a hot water storage unit and afterwards reconverted to electricity when needed. Such a pilot plant on a lab scale is currently built in Germany. The first part of this paper focuses on geothermal energy as a potential heat source for the storage system and its environmental impact. For a large scale application, geothermal hotspots in Germany are further investigated. The second part analyzes the storage technology itself and compares it to the impacts of commonly used battery storage technologies. Especially during the manufacturing process, significantly better global warming potential values are shown compared to lithium-ion and lead batteries. The least environmental impact while operating the system is with wind power, which suggests an implementation of the storage system into the grid in the northern part of Germany.</jats:p>"

The method is based on an analytical solution that relates the aquifer's transmissivity to the standard deviation of the hydraulic‐head fluctuations in one or more observation wells that are due to the periodic pumping of the production well. We analyzed the resulting analytical solution and demonstrated that when the observation wells are located near the pumping well, the solution has a simple, Dupuit like form. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the analytical solution can also be used for a quasi‐periodic pumping of the supply well. Simulation of cyclic pumping in a statistically heterogeneous medium confirms that the method is suitable for analyzing the transmissivity of weakly or moderately heterogeneous aquifers. If only one observation well is available, and the shift in the phase of hydraulic‐head oscillations between the pumping well and the observation well is not identifiable. Prior knowledge of aquifer's hydraulic diffusivity is required to obtain the value of the aquifer transmissivity.</jats:p>",

Se encontró que entre los productos que conforman el abasto alimentario, los producidos localmente tienen poca relevancia. El prevalenciente consumo de maíz y sus derivados, indica la persistencia de una cultura alimentaria tradicional a través del tiempo. También privilegia el consumo de productos lácteos y leguminosas sobre los productos cárnicos. Limitaciones: Al privilegiar la perspectiva cuantitativa, solo tenemos un acercamiento parcial a las prácticas alimentarias. No obstante, es posible adelantar que, junto a la persistencia protagónica del maíz, se identifica un cambio en las prácticas de alimentación de la comunidad a la par de transformaciones de actividades económicas de la población.</jats:p>"

Crops were exposed to ambient [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] (200 μmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> above ambient) at two levels of N: control (0N) and 22.5 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> (normal N, NN), and they were sampled at 82 days after transplanting (DAT), 99 DAT, and maturity, respectively.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Under FACE, significant declines of N concentration in all tissues and the whole plants were observed with the greater decrease in leaves and stems at three stages. Positive responses of N use efficiency (NUE) to elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] were recorded over the study period. The total N accumulation remained unchanged, while a large amount of N was partitioned to panicles at the expense of leaves and stems. As compared to WYJ23, greater N transportation from roots to aboveground, especially the panicles, was observed on IIY084 accompanied by higher panicle biomass (82 DAT and 99 DAT), N concentrations (maturity), and greater NUE for leaves through the study season. Across all [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and cultivars, N fertilization increased N partitioning to leaves and stems while decreasing that to panicles. Additionally, N supply decreased NUE while stimulating N concentrations and N amounts of rice plants. Among all treatments, IIY084 had the highest N accumulation and allocation in panicles under elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] in combination with N fertilizer at maturity.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Data from this study were helpful for understanding the temporal N uptake and utilization of different rice genotypes as affected by N availability and suggest that IIY084 promises a considerable prospect for its grain yield and quality under future elevated atmospheric [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>].</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

After destruction products quality study did not reveal defects of a metallographic nature or rejects in manufacture. Therefore, the hypothesis that the destruction cause is low-cycle material fatigue under the dynamic loads influence, arising due to temperature deformations in the pipeline, was proposed. In this paper, we consider a pipeline scheme in which a temperature gradient arises in the fluid flow direction. At different temperature strains of the pipeline parts bending stresses emerge. These stresses cyclic nature is determined by the hot- and cold-water consumption frequency. The pipeline model where the locking equipment was installed is a beam with pinched ends. The bending stresses calculation for this beam was performed using the initial parameter method. Plots of moments and transverse forces in the beam section are plotted. The permissible stress calculation under the dynamic loads action was made. The pipeline section size, within which shut-off equipment can be installed without destruction, was determined.</jats:p>",

At the same time, the replacement of old equipment is carried out annually at a rate of 2%. Such unsatisfactory rates of renovation are due to the lack of adequate funding and their irrational allocation to the construction of new ones, reconstruction and development of existing pipelines and structures. Obviously, to solve this problem, new and integrated approaches, new technologies for the design, construction and operation of water supply and sanitation systems are needed. One of such approaches is proposed in the work, based on digital technologies using electronic models of water supply and sanitation systems, on the basis of which methods for modeling operating modes and optimization methods for design solutions for the development of networks and structures have been developed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a new mathematical approach to design an asynchronous pulse width modulation (APWM) for the switched mode power supply (SMPS). Unlike the conventional APWM that utilises a Hysteretic comparator based Asynchronous Pulse Width Modulation (HAPWM) to provide the self‐oscillating property, the proposed APWM is based on a Binary comparator based Asynchronous Pulse Width Modulation (BAPWM) and a delay cell. This way, compared to the HAPWM, the mathematical analysis of the modulator is significantly simplified. This was achieved by replacing the describing function (DF) ‐based graphical method with a ?linearised mathematical model. The introduced mathematical approach is extended to study the behaviour of the higher order self‐oscillating modulators in terms of the harmonic distortion. To confirm the effectiveness of the analytical derivations, the BAPWMs are employed in a classic DC–DC buck converter and the system‐level simulation results are provided. It is concluded that there is an acceptable degree of similarity between the simulation results and the deployed analytical calculations for different orders of the modulators. Finally, to validate these analytical and simulation results and also to compare the BAPWM performance with its HAPWM counterpart, both modulators are implemented using off‐the‐shelf components and their measurement results are presented.</jats:p>",

A ‘predictable' and constant food supply was provided to birds in one area of a forest, while birds in another area did not have access to a reliable supplementary food source. We found that predictability of food affected the extent of nocturnal hypothermia, but the response differed between the sexes. Whereas male nocturnal body temperature was similar regardless of food availability, females exposed to a naturally ‘unpredictable' food supply entered deeper hypothermia at night, compared with females that had access to predictable food and compared with males in both treatment groups. We suggest that this response is likely a consequence of dominance, and subdominant females subject to unpredictable food resources cannot maintain sufficient energy intake, resulting in a higher demand for energy conservation at night.</jats:p>",

Over the past thirty years, the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco have experienced severe droughts, which causes a decrease in water supply that affects both agriculture and the urban water system. In this paper, we assess the impact of climate change and socio-economic activities on water supply and demand in the Ourika watershed (High Atlas of Morocco), then we evaluate the efficiency and sustainability of regional adaptation strategies for water supply management. For this, we simulate and analyze the future water situation using the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and the water assessment and planning tool (WEAP). After the model’s calibration and validation, the precipitation, minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures, water demand and unmet water demand were projected for 2100 horizon, using different climate change scenarios. The results revealed that the model’s performance, calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory. The analysis shows that the mean precipitation will decrease by 49.25% and 34.61% by 2100, under A2 and B2 emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The projected mean Tmax and Tmin will be warmer than the baseline period, with Tmax increasing by 4.2 °C (A2) and 3.6 °C (B2), and Tmin by 3.5 °C (A2) and 2.9 °C (B2) by 2100. The results also show that water demand and the unmet water demand will increase in all scenarios, the pressure on water resources will increase, leading to water scarcity. The results reveal that, under the influence of climate change, future unmet water demand is expected to reach 64 million cubic meters (MCM) by 2100. The results demonstrate that the assessments of the proposed adaptation strategies are effective, but not sufficient to ensure water sustainability for the Ourika watershed.</jats:p>"

We conducted numerical experiments of fluvio‐deltaic system evolution by simulating the accommodation‐to‐sediment‐supply (A/S) cycles of varying wavelength and amplitude with the objective to produce synthetic 3‐D stratigraphic records. Post‐processing routines were developed in order to investigate delta lobe architecture in relation to channel‐network evolution throughout A/S cycles, estimate net sediment accumulation rates in 3‐D space, and extract chronostratigraphically constrained lithosomes (or chronosomes) to quantify large‐scale connectivity, that is, the spatial distribution of high net‐to‐gross lithologies. Chronosomes formed under the conditions of channel‐belt aggradation are separated by laterally continuous abandonment surfaces associated with major avulsions and delta‐lobe switches. Chronosomes corresponding to periods in which sea level drops below the inherited shelf break, that is, the youngest portions of the late falling stage systems tract (FSST), form in the virtual absence of major avulsions, owing to the incision in their upstream parts, and thus display purely degradational architecture. Detailed investigation of chronosomes within the late FSST showed that their spatial continuity may be disrupted by higher‐frequency A/S cycles to produce “stranded” sand‐rich bodies encased in shales. Chronosomes formed during early and late falling stage (FSST) demonstrate the highest large‐scale connectivity in their proximal and distal areas, respectively. Lower‐amplitude base level changes, representative of greenhouse periods during which the shelf break is not exposed, increase the magnitude of delta‐lobe switching and favour the development of system‐wide abandonment surfaces, whose expression in real‐world stratigraphy is likely to reflect the intertwined effects of high‐frequency allogenic forcing and differential subsidence.</jats:p>",

Following this a digestibility study was carried out with eight castrates for determining digestibilities of gross energy, crude protein, crude fibre, crude fat and crude ash. Additionally, a practical feeding experiment during gestation was performed with 96 sows of Danish genetics. Two supplements for sows with different fibre sources were composed, namely a control diet (based on wheat bran and lignocellulose) and a test diet containing sugar beet pulp, alfalfa, rapeseed meal, soybean hulls, grape pomace and lignocellulose. Six pens with eight sows each were video-monitored for 2 weeks (evaluation of interactions and fights). Furthermore, the animals were subjected to weekly scoring to count skin injuries. To check the fibre effect on reproductive performance and piglet development, the body condition development of the sows as well as the number and weight of live and stillborn piglets, litter weight- and weaning weight of the litters were recorded.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Digestibility of crude fibre increased significantly in the experimental group (58.8% ± 3.3 vs. 49.0% ± 4.3, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.01).

Using the stochastic programming approach, the stochastic constraints are converted into an equivalent deterministic one.

An exponential function-based, probability density estimation method was used to analyze the spatial supply of and demand for shelters under an earthquake scenario. The results show that even if all potential available shelters are considered, they still cannot satisfy the demand of the existing population for evacuation and sheltering, especially in the northern region of Pudong, under both the daytime and the nighttime scenarios. The proposed method can reveal the spatiotemporal imbalance between shelter supply and demand. We also conducted a preliminary location selection analysis of shelters based on the supply–demand analysis results. The location selection results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. It can be applied to identify the areas where the supply of shelters is seriously inadequate, and provide effective decision support for the planning of urban emergency shelters.</jats:p>",

Our objective is to complement this by examining contractual challenges in the context of bilateral dependency. Our specific empirical focus is on how Indian Railways, one of the largest railroads in the world, manages warranty claims related to engine failures. Warranty resolution is complex, because failures typically involve the simultaneous failure of several engine subsystems provided by different suppliers, giving rise to supplier performance ambiguity. Through a combination of theoretical reflection rooted in transaction cost economics and an empirical analysis of Indian Railways' supply chain, we argue that in the case of bilateral dependency, “the benign approach” is more efficient than “the muscular approach,” to use Oliver Williamson's terminology. Specifically, while the latter is founded on unilateral decisions by the comparatively more powerful party, the former is based on voluntary long‐term cooperation, and calls for mutual credible commitments and joint problem‐solving. Additionally, we highlight that even if dependency is asymmetric at the outset, it can develop bilateral features over time. Theoretically, our research offers an enhanced understanding of trust in buyer–supplier relationships, emphasizing its organizational as opposed to personal basis.</jats:p>",

Dealing with food security requires more attention to how to protect peri-urban organic farming systems from urban pressures while strengthening the sustainability of local food systems. Given that short food supply chains (SFSCs) have been proven to be effective at reconnecting people with food production, this study focuses on identifying the barriers that hinder their development and the opportunities derived from the comparative advantage provided by their urban proximity. This study is based on documentary and empirical research addressing food supply chain characteristics in the organic sector. This study is focused on Mediterranean peri-urban agriculture, where, historically, there have been close relationships between the city and the countryside. These relationships are based on the fact that many cities are traditionally located next to areas of high agricultural activity, where a wide variety of vegetables is produced almost continuously due to the relatively mild winter climate. This study deals with two medium-sized metropolitan areas in Andalucía in the south of the Iberian Peninsula—the coastal city of Málaga, which is of a tourist-residential nature, and the inland urban agglomeration of Granada. Our research shows, when compared with other studies, that the local organic food sector seems to have great potential to find innovative solutions based on a collective approach, local embeddedness, and collective knowledge and by prioritizing horizontal and sustainable processes at the local/regional scale.</jats:p>"

A wastewater treatment plant is proposed based. The required number of complex mobile stations for life support systems, namely for wastewater treatment and hot water supply of the sports and recreation camp «Polytechnic», which is located at 17 km of the Baikal Highway, has been calculated. The calculations took into account the number of residents per season, water consumption and wastewater rate, the geographic location of the camp, the average number of cloudy days in the area and the number of sunny hours. The developed complex mobile station will ensure energy supply and disposal of wastewater from facilities located in recreational and protected areas without environmental consequences and violation of environmental and sanitary requirements.

Gate recurrent unit is the basic unit of time sequential neural network. Firstly, multi-wavelet transform is used to decompose the signal of the X-ray high-voltage power signal to obtain the coefficients of each frequency band. Secondly, signal waveform reconstructed for each layer of wavelet coefficients is as the input of the gate recurrent unit network to predict signals at different frequencies. Finally, each gate recurrent unit performs multi-step prediction on the reconstructed waveform in this frequency band for sudden fault and all band prediction outputs are composed to obtain the final prediction results. The simulation experiment shows that our method has better performance than the Kalman filter, recurrent neural network and long-short term memory prediction methods, and can accurately predict sudden fault of X-ray high-voltage power supplies.</jats:p>",

These new data call for the development of innovant analysis and interpretation methods. Here we combine a forward prism computation with a Bayesian resolution approach to invert for these gravity gradient data configuration. We apply and test our new method on satellite data configuration, that is 225 km height with a global and homogeneous geographic distribution. We first quantify the resolution of our method according to both data and parametrization characteristics. It appears that for reasonable density contrast values (0.1 g cm−3) crustal structures have to be wider than ∼28 km to be detectable in the GOCE signal. Deeper bodies are distinguishable for greater size (35 km size at 50 km depth, ∼80 km at 300 km depth). We invert the six tensor components, among which five are independent. By carefully testing each of them and their different combinations, we enlighten a trade off between the recovery of data and the sensitivity to inversion parameters. We particularly discussed this characteristic in terms of geometry of the synthetic model tested (structures orientation, 3-D geometry, etc.). In terms of RMS value, each component is always better explained if inverted solely, but the result is strongly affected by the inversion parametrization (smoothing, variances, etc.). On the contrary, the simultaneous inversion of several components displays a significant improvement for the global tensor recovery, more dependent on data than on density variance or on smoothness control. Comparing gravity and gradient inversions, we highlight the superiority of the GG data to better reproduce the structures especially in terms of vertical location. We successfully test our method on a realistic case of a complex subduction case for both gradient and gravity data. While the imaging of small crustal structures requires terrestrial gravity data set, the longest wavelength of the slab is well recovered with both data sets. The precision and homogeneous coverage of GOCE data however, counterbalance the heterogeneous and often quite non-existence coverage of terrestrial gravity data. This is particularly true in large areas which requires a coherent assemblage of heterogeneous data sets, or in high relief, vegetally covered and offshore zones.</jats:p>",

Reservoir operator does not favor storage above a certain level in situations such as the pre-release operation prior to a flood, scheduled engineering constructions or mechanical excavations of sediments in the impoundments, drawdown and empty flushing, etc. This paper selects the last of which as the case study, and a method is presented to promote the feasibility of emptying reservoir storage. The impact of emptying reservoir on water supply is minimized through appropriate joint operation in a multi-reservoir system, where drawdown and empty flushing is carried out in a primary reservoir and the other reservoirs provide backup water for supply. This method prioritizes allocating the storage in the primary reservoir for water supply during specific periods prior to its empty. If the storage of every reservoir achieves its predefined conditions, drawdown of the primary reservoir is activated and followed by empty flushing. Previously preserved storage in the other reservoirs ensures adequate water supply during the periods of emptying the primary reservoir. Flushing of the primary reservoir is continued until either the accumulative released water exceeds the specified volume, storage in the backup reservoirs drops below the pre-defined threshold, or the inflow to the primary reservoir recedes from the flood peak to be below the releasing capacity of outlets. This behavior is simulated and linked with a nonlinear optimization algorithm to calibrate the optimal parameters defining the activation and termination of empty flushing. The optimized strategy limits the incremental water shortage within the acceptable threshold and maximizes the expected benefits of emptying reservoir.\n                        </jats:p>"

Typical multivoltage approaches use level shifters (LSs) to establish communication among voltage domains. The use of commercial standard‐cell and multiple gate oxide MOS LSs implies a nonoptimal place‐and‐route process. Here, we introduce a single gate oxide level shifter (SGOLS) that enables full integration into low‐voltage domains. We tested the proposed idea using a commercial digital‐flow tool for a two‐domain SoC integration, achieving an enhancement in the total integration area occupied by LSs of 54% regarding the conventional LS approaches. The proposed SGOLS was implemented in both 65‐ and 180‐nm CMOS nodes, handling voltage differences between the nominal and I/O domain supplies by using just single gate oxide devices. We validated the circuit performance through process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations for wide frequency and supply voltage ranges, disclosing an energy‐per‐transition of 416 fJ@180 nm and 93 fJ@65 nm. The introduced LS extends the integration of multiple voltage domains into denser SoCs.</jats:p>",

For Russia, the problem of breakdown of heat supply enterprises is especially acute, since the climatic conditions in its larger territory are quite severe, while the level of wear of the housing stock and engineering facilities is high. The relevance of the research topic is due to the increasing level of risk of accidents at heat supply enterprises working with hazardous chemicals. The following factors affect the operational safety of facilities in this industry: the reliability of the protection of workers and employees from the effects of emergencies; protection against secondary damaging factors; reliability of the organization’s supply system with everything necessary for functioning; sustainability and continuity of production and civil defense management; preparedness of the facility for emergency rescue and other emergency operations and more. In the process of the study, basic information about the activities of the district thermal station was studied, an analysis of the causes of emergencies at it was conducted, probable scenarios for the development of possible accidents were developed and characterized, and characteristics of the damaging factors and their negative impact zones were presented. Of all the possible scenarios, the most dangerous scenario associated with the boiler rupture, as well as the most probable scenario, was the complete/partial depressurization of the boiler equipment. The risks of accidents that are possible during the operation of the heat station (boiler room) are analyzed, and a set of measures is proposed to prevent and minimize the consequences of possible emergencies at the livelihood of the population with justification for their economic feasibility.</jats:p>"

Compared with the ordinary linear storage and drainage process of groundwater in the basin, the “equal slope underground sponge reservoir” has a very significant characteristic of “sponge basin” which can adjust peak and relieve dry and prolong the outflow time. The calculation formula of non-linear outflow of underground water in the “sponge basin” is given. The characteristics of this “sponge basin” and its non-linear outflow principle and the coupling relationship among irrigation, water supply and drainage of ancient terraces are demonstrated. An adaptive balance model of water supply and demand in the original ecosystem of ancient terraces is established. The model is applied to simulate a long series of water supply and demand balance in the original ecosystem of the ancient terraced field, and the check results are highly consistent with the Historical Drought Resistance records of the ancient terraced field. It is proved that the principle of non-linear groundwater outflow in sponge basin and its calculation formula are correct and practical. The research results have important guiding significance for the development, utilization and protection of other ancient terraces, and also have important reference value for the development of sloping farmland.</jats:p>",

The technique relies on field data collection including annual surveys of weir pond volumes and suspended sediment measurements, as well as an accounting for settling of suspended sediment and organic matter in the pond. We compared these annual yields to gravel yields predicted by the Wilcock two‐fraction bed load transport model, which we calibrated from measured values at Caspar Creek. We considered three velocity‐discharge relationships and found that values of hydraulic variables measured during storms produced the best fit between reconstructed and predicted annual gravel yields when years with large disturbances were excluded. We also compared predicted gravel transport rates to bed load transport rates measured from 1988 to 1995 with bed load pit samplers. We found that the calibrated model predictions agreed well with the field‐measured bed load transport rates. To investigate the role of supply and storage on gravel transport, we compared the reconstructed gravel yields to predicted gravel yields and found that increased occurrence of landslides and headcut erosion in the 1990s and early 2000s did not lead to an increase in gravel yields. Instead, input of large downed wood in the 1990s created storage space and decreased bed load delivery to the weir pond.</jats:p>",

The application of selenium (Se) can reduce the absorption and transport of Cd in winter wheat.\nResults\n\nThe result showed that increasing Se supply significantly decreased Cd concentration and accumulation in shoots and roots of winter wheat, and the root to shoot translocation of Cd. The Se supply increased the root length, surface area and root volume, but decreased the root average diameter. Increasing Se supply significantly decreased Cd concentration in cell wall, soluble fraction and cell organelle in roots and shoots. An increase of Se supply inhibited Cd distribution in the organelle of shoot and root, but enhanced Cd distribution in the soluble fraction of shoot and the cell wall of root. The Se supply also decreased the proportion of active Cd (ethanol-extractable (FE) Cd and deionized water-extractable (FW) Cd) in roots.

However, input‐output (IO) analysis (IOA) cannot usually consider it, because the Leontief quantity model (LQM) assumes that production is endogenous; the Ghosh quantity model (GQM) is considered implausible; and the Leontief price model (LPM) and the Ghosh price model (GPM) assume that quantity is fixed. This study proposes to consider a supply constraint in the LPM, introducing the price elasticity of demand. This study uses the loss of social surplus (SS) as a damage estimation because production (sales) is less informative as a damage index than profit (margin); that is, production can be any amount if without considering profit, and it does not tell exactly how much profit is lost for each supplier (upstream sector) and buyer (downstream sector). As a model application, this study examines Japan's largest five earthquakes from 1995 to 2017 and the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) in March 2011. The worst earthquake at the peak tends to increase price by 10–20% and decrease SS by 20–30%, when compared with the initial month's prices/production. The worst damage tends to last eight months at most, accumulating 0.5‐month‐production damage (i.e., the sum of [hypothetical] differences in SS with and without an earthquake [for eight months] is 50% of the initial month production). Meanwhile, the GEJE in the five prefectures had cumulatively, a 25‐month‐production damage until the temporal recovery at the 37th month.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Increase in competition and the strategic move of enhanced outsourcing has made supply chain more complex. Various applications and software solutions are available to better manage this complexity. It has been observed that often such initiatives may not provide the excepted benefits. It has also been reported that an unclear understanding of business needs (including perceived risks) is the main reason of supply chain failure. The present study attempts to capture enterprise level supply chain risk in an oil company (case company) in India and explore if perception of a decision maker favours use of blockchain technology project to reduce the supply chain risk. The study adopts the following methodology: in-depth semi-structured interviews and structured survey was carried out with the top management of the case company to identify various enterprise level risks for supply chain management (SCM) projects which were subsequently clustered under Operations, Finance, Human Resources, and Strategic Business Risk categories. Inputs on the probability of occurrence and impacts of the identified risks on the enterprise-wide supply chain was mapped on the risk severity matrix (heat map) to prioritize the risks. Subsequently, the second round of questionnaire was developed and a similar survey carried out again with the same sample show the change in risk perception due to potential application of blockchain technology. Interesting insights could be gained from the practitioner’s perspective on the value contribution of using blockchain for improving management of SCM risks. It could be observed that a number of the high priority risk (in the initial scenario) could now be eliminated or managed due to specific characteristics of blockchain.. One of the major limitations of the present study is the lack of generalizability of the insights as it is based exclusively on the perspective of the case company towards the blockchain. </jats:p>",

The inactivated MDR E. coli did not regrow after light irradiation or in the dark after 24 or 48 h after visible light disinfection, demonstrating that visible light disinfection can prevent MDR E. coli self-repair. The MDR E. coli plasmid electrophoresis band gradually went dark with increase of the light irradiation time and could be completely eliminated by high UVA light intensity treatment, however, simulated sunlight irradiation had minimal influence on both tetracycline and ampicillin resistance of the MDR E. coli strain.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we consider an autonomous power supply system, including a wood biomass gasification power plant (BGPP), a diesel power plant (DPP), one or several wind turbines (WT), and electricity consumers with their load schedule. The mathematical formulation of the problem of optimizing the structure and modes of operation of the power supply system is reduced to minimizing the objective function with a number of additional constrains. The objective function is equal to total discounted costs for the construction and operation of the system or the cost of electricity produced. Additional constrains are balances for power, primary, secondary and final energy. The power supply system was modeled for different values of diesel and wood fuels prices, average long-term wind speed, technical and economic indicators of power plants. According to the results of calculations, the zones of technologies efficiency and the cost of electricity produced are determined. It is shown that biomass gasification power plants with gas storage tanks are much more economical than diesel power plants and can displace them at current diesel fuel prices. In areas with high average annual wind speeds, biomass gasification power plants should be used in conjunction with wind turbines.</jats:p>",

To progress in this direction, we present a systematic analysis of the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on SCs guided by a structured literature review that collated a unique set of publications. The literature review findings suggest that influenza was the most visible epidemic outbreak reported, and that optimization of resource allocation and distribution emerged as the most popular topic. The streamlining of the literature helps us to reveal several new research tensions and novel categorizations/classifications. Most centrally, we propose a framework for operations and supply chain management at the times of COVID-19 pandemic spanning six perspectives, i.e., adaptation, digitalization, preparedness, recovery, ripple effect, and sustainability. Utilizing the outcomes of our analysis, we tease out a series of open research questions that would not be observed otherwise.

Some of these materials are largely produced outside the EU and are flagged as critical in different studies. This paper presents a new and comprehensive methodology to determine the EU resilience to supply of materials used in major low-carbon technologies. It assesses the security of supply across the materials value chain by adopting specific indicators related to upstream and downstream production stages. A case study, i.e. lithium in the context of rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, demonstrates the applicability of the methodology. While the overall issue of lithium availability for electric vehicle batteries is known, an integrated analysis at EU level based on the latest technological/market developments is however not available. This paper reveals that the EU resilience to the roll-out of EV will decrease by 2030 unless specific mitigation measures are undertaken at EU level. Such measures include recycling of waste Li-ion batteries, increasing the production of raw lithium, processed materials and cells/batteries in the EU as well as diversification of the supply of lithium and/or cells/batteries from third countries.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The complexity of today’s integrated circuit (IC) supply chain, organised in several tiers and including many companies located in different countries, makes it challenging to assess the history and integrity of procured ICs. This enables malicious practices like counterfeiting and insertion of back doors, which are extremely dangerous, especially in supply chains of ICs for industrial control systems used in critical infrastructures, where a country and human lives can be put at risk. This paper aims at mitigating these issues by introducing Anti-BlUFf (Anti-counterfeiting Blockchain- and PUF-based infrastructure), an approach where ICs are uniquely identified and tracked along the chain, across multiple sites, to detect tampering. Our solution is based on consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies; hence, it is decentralised, highly available and provides strong guarantees on the integrity of stored data and executed business logic. The unique identification of ICs along the chain is implemented by using physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as tamper-resistant IDs. We first define the threat model of an adversary interested in tampering with ICs along the supply chain and then provide the design of the tracking system that implements the proposed anti-counterfeiting approach. We present a security analysis of the tracking system against the designated threat model and a prototype evaluation to show its technical feasibility and assess its effectiveness in counterfeit mitigation. Finally, we discuss several key practical aspects concerning our solution ad its integration with real IC supply chains.</jats:p>",

We identify both the physical changes in UWSSs, as well as the changes in the attributes of the system, both of which contribute to the changing nature of the water–energy nexus. We provide an overview of responses to this change in the water–energy nexus through the lens of four application areas, namely long-term planning, system design, system operation and system rehabilitation, based on the review of 52 papers. Ten responses in three categories are found to be commonly considered in each of the four application areas. The three categories are energy or greenhouse gas reduction, integrated modelling and planning, and improving social benefits. The main drivers of these responses may vary with the application area. Based on the review outcomes, we outline the gaps in the responses in relation to the changing nature of the water–energy nexus in UWSSs, providing directions for future research on improving UWSS efficiency considering the long-term drivers.</jats:p>",

The characteristics of the enterprise, its mission, strategic goals are described, and the architectural and process model of the enterprise is constructed. During a pre-project survey, an architectural and process model of the system for taking inventory on charge to the warehouse (“AS-IS”) was formed. The developed solutions include three aspects: practical significance, scientific and technical novelty, and commercial feasibility. Practical significance means that this system will allow the company to reduce warehouse costs, reduce the time for taking inventory on charge, for drafting and processing documents, and improve the reliability of information. Scientific and technical novelty reflects the identified problems in the process of taking inventory on charge to the warehouse and solutions to eliminate these problems.

One potential source of electrical energy comes from geothermal energy, where Indonesia has enormous potential. According to data from the Geological Agency, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, until the end of 2016 there were at least 331 geothermal energy source locations throughout Indonesia, where most of the potential was on a volcanic track with a potential of 28,579 MW and this is the largest geothermal energy in the world. In its operation, power plants need energy to supply their own needs (house load) which amounts up to 10 % of the electrical energy produced. Own electricity needs are used to drive brine and condensate pumps, fan drive motors in cooling towers, lamps and electronic appliances in well pad and offices. The use of this energy can be minimized to increase electricity production which is distributed to users. The methodology used in this research is lean sigma process through the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve (DMAI) steps. The first step is to define the problems regarding opportunity from electricity use for own needs that can be saved and constraints faced, the next step is to measure the electrical usage as baseline data, then analyze to find the causes of inefficiencies in electricity use and the last make improvement programs. From a case study conducted at the Gunung Salak geothermal power plant in West Java, the energy efficiency of house load can be minimized by up to 7.5%-10% in 2018-2019. Greater energy supply to the community will have an impact on improving the economy of the community to support production activities that require electrical energy.</jats:p>",

Leather industry (leather, leather products, and footwear) is the second export earning sector of Bangladesh which is scrambling to implement SSCM in its working cycle. There are lot of challenges that are creating barriers for this industry owners in establishing sustainability practices in their supply chain management. There is lack of enough research in identifying the challenges of SSCM for leather industry of Bangladesh. That’s why, it is very imperative to identify the challenges of SSCM for leather industry in Bangladesh which will guide the industry owners to combat these challenges. In this research, we have not only identified the challenges of SSCM for leather industry but also evaluated the relationship among them. Besides, a priority list of identified challenges is depicted through which the industry owners can easily find out the major and minor challenges. Five industrial experts were selected from export-oriented leather and footwear factories in order to sort out the appropriate challenges. Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique was applied to assess the relationship among identified 18 challenges and divided them into two groups such as cause and effect. The casual challenges are lack of knowledge and experience, lack of technical expertise, corruption, social unawareness, lack of acceptance of new technology, lack of training on SSCM, poor organizational culture, market competition and uncertainty, lack of commitment from top management and lack of integration of IT system. On the other hand, lack of eco-literacy among supply chain stakeholders, financial constraints, lack of government rules and regulations, cost of sustainability, limitations of capacity, lack of management initiatives for reverse logistics, demand for lower price and lack of energy and waste management policy were identified as effect group challenges. This study will help the decision-makers of leather industry in formulating strategic policies to address these challenges for in implementing SSCM in leather industry that will drive these sectors toward sustainable development. </jats:p>",

Given manufacturers' financial constraints, this paper studies and compares the optimal green decisions and profits under single‐channel or dual‐channel strategies with and without green investment. Therefore, the main contribution of the paper is determining the optimal channel strategy of supply chains under advance payment financing. The results indicate that the retailer's optimal channel strategy is to provide advance payment financing to the manufacturer who introduces online channel and produces green products, which are beneficial to the economic and environmental performance. Besides, green investment can facilitate a win‐win scenario if the price elasticity of the demand for the retail channel is smaller than a threshold. Furthermore, green investment increases the retailer's acceptance of online channel. The results of our research can provide decision support for decision makers under the advance payment financing.</jats:p>",

To do so, it first presents a theoretical framework drawing on regulationist economics and constructivist political science which guides research to examine the entire range of actors, processes, institutions and power relations which structure agri‐food sectors. It then applies this framework to the case of <jats:italic>foie gras</jats:italic> in South‐West France to target the relationship between ‘short’ and ‘long’ supply chains. Based on thirty interviews with farmers and public officials, it finds that a commonly heard discourse that both chains ‘complement each other’ masks the political domination of ‘the long’ over ‘the short’. Through tracing this domination across two policy issues, namely product labelling and ‘biosecurity’ hygiene measures, and the way actors have worked politically to deal with them, the article demonstrates that this power asymmetry has been the principal cause of policy outcomes and, therefore, institutional reproduction.</jats:p>",

Renal cell carcinoma is extremely rare in a horseshoe kidney; once it occurs, however, it is intractable because of vascular abnormalities. This is especially true in laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery, even for tumors of &lt;4 cm in diameter. We herein report a case involving an asymptomatic 65-year-old man with an incidental finding of a 4-cm solid mass near the isthmus of a horseshoe kidney on B-mode ultrasonography. Preoperative computed tomography of the renal artery revealed six arterial vessels supplying the affected kidney. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed. The outcome of this case suggests that laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery might be a successful treatment method for a horseshoe kidney but that preoperative vessel evaluation and experienced laparoscopic skills are needed. </jats:p>",

The filament supply system is equipped with a relative humidity and temperature sensor and a photo interrupter in order to obtain data; a server is implemented using a Raspberry Pi to remotely monitor the temperature and humidity inside the filament supply and to monitor its state. In addition, a humidity control system (manufactured using a Peltier module) allows users to remotely control the humidity level inside the supply system. In conclusion, an integrated monitoring system was constructed with a filament supply system and the abovementioned functions, and was then integrated into an existing 3D printer monitoring system.

A research study was carried out in southern Italy to determine the effects of the combined inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and biofortification with Se and I on plant growth, seed yield, quality, and antioxidant and elemental status, as well as residual biomass chemical composition of chickpea grown in two different planting times (14 January and 28 February). The AMF application improved the intensity of I and Se accumulation both in single and joint supply of these elements, resulting in higher seed yield and number as well as dry weight, and was also beneficial for increasing the content of antioxidants, protein, and macro- and microelements. Earlier planting time resulted in higher values of seed yield, as well as Se, I, N, P, Ca, protein, and antioxidant levels. Se and I showed a synergistic effect, stimulating the accumulation of each other in chickpea seeds. The AMF inoculation elicited a higher protein and cellulose synthesis, as well as glucose production in the residual biomass, compared to the single iodine application and the untreated control. From the present research, it can be inferred that the plant biostimulation through the soil inoculation with AMF and the biofortification with Se and I, applied singly or jointly, proved to be effective sustainable farming tools for improving the chickpea seed yield and/or quality, as well as the residual biomass chemical composition for energy production or beneficial metabolite extraction.</jats:p>"

These error evaluation techniques are: Mean Percentage Error (MPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) and Mean Absolute Arctangent Percentage Error (MAAPE). Forecasts for chemical product sales, to which error evaluation techniques are applied, are those obtained and reported by Castillo, et. al. (2016 &amp; 2020).The error measuring techniques whose calculation yields adequate and convenient results, for the six prediction techniques handled in this article, as long as its interpretation is intuitive, are SMAPE and MAAPE. In this case, the most adequate technique to measure the error presented by the sales prediction system turned out to be SMAPE.</jats:p>"

Using efflux mutants of the purple bacterium <jats:italic>Rubrivivax gelatinosus,</jats:italic> we showed that Cu<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and Cd<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> resistance relies on the expression of the Fur‐regulated FbpABC and Ftr iron transporters. To support this conclusion, inactivation of these Fe‐importers in the Cu<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> or Cd<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>‐ATPase efflux mutants gave rise to hypersensitivity towards these ions. Moreover, in metal overloaded cells the expression of FbpA, the periplasmic iron‐binding component of the ferric ion transport FbpABC system was induced, suggesting that cells perceived an ‘iron‐starvation’ situation and responded to it by inducing Fe‐importers. In this context, the Fe‐Sod activity increased in response to Fe homoeostasis dysregulation. Similar results were obtained for <jats:italic>Vibrio cholerae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Escherichia coli,</jats:italic> suggesting that perturbation of Fe‐homoeostasis by metal excess appeared as an adaptive response commonly used by a variety of bacteria. The presented data support a model in which metal excess induces Fe‐uptake to support [4Fe‐4S] synthesis and thereby induce ROS detoxification system.</jats:p>",

In this study, taking the Fenghe River watershed (FRW) as a case, based on the status and the change trend of the supply–demand ratio of ES, and the ES supply change trend, the supply–demand risk level of food provision (FP), water yield (WY), soil retention (SR), and climate regulation (CR) are evaluated, and the risk management zones of the FRW are divided using spatial superposition. The results show that: (1) The supply and demand of SR are spatially matched, while the other three ES are spatially mismatched. (2) From 2000 to 2015, the supply amount of FP, WY, and SR increases by 11.59%, 1.25% and 55%, respectively, while the supply amount of CR decreases by 5.15%. At the same time, the demand amount of FP, WY, SR and CR increases by 39.97%, 53.88%, 36.3% and 215.5%, respectively. (3) The supply–demand ratio means of four ES in the FRW are all greater than 0, but there are some areas within that are less than 0. (4) In terms of sub-watershed scale, except for SR, there are critically endangered areas for the other three ES. Moreover, the FRW is divided into 11 supply–demand risk management zones, such as FS-WY-CR critically endangered zone, WY-CR critically endangered and FS vulnerable zone. The supply–demand risk management zones based on multiple ES can identify the risk level of each ES in each zone. These results and conclusions can provide the basis for rational allocation of resources and sustainable management of ES.</jats:p>"

By combining risk analysis with cost-benefit analysis, additional information is provided on measures for leveraging investments in managing and reducing the risks. This enables the identification of the most economically profitable risk reduction alternatives and enables decision makers to build strategic capacity for operating in difficult and uncertain futures.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) have been steadily increasing the share of total trips in metropolitan areas across the world. Micro-modeling TNC operation is essential for large-scale transportation systems simulation. In this study, an agent-based approach for analyzing supply and demand aspects of ride-sourcing operation is done using POLARIS, a high-performance simulation tool. On the demand side, a mode-choice model for the agent and a vehicle-ownership model that informs this choice are developed. On the supply side, TNC vehicle-assignment strategies, pick-up and drop-off operations, and vehicle repositioning are modeled with congestion feedback, an outcome of the mesoscopic traffic simulation. Two case studies of Bloomington and Chicago in Illinois are used to study the framework’s computational speed for large-scale operations and the effect of TNC fleets on a region’s congestion patterns. Simulation results show that a zone-based vehicle-assignment strategy scales better than relying on matching closest vehicles to requests. For large regions like Chicago, large fleets are seen to be detrimental to congestion, especially in a future in which more travelers will use TNCs. From an operational point of view, an efficient relocation strategy is critical for large regions with concentrated demand, but not regulating repositioning can worsen empty travel and, consequently, congestion. The TNC simulation framework developed in this study is of special interest to cities and regions, since it can be used to model both demand and supply aspects for large regions at scale, and in reasonably low computational time. </jats:p>",

Closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) models integrate the forward and reverse flow of products. Since the optimization of these CLSC models is known to be NP-Hard, competition on optimization quality in terms of solution quality and computational time becomes one of the main focuses in the literature in this area. A typical six-level closed-loop supply chain network is examined in this paper, which has great complexity due to the high level of echelons. The proposed solution uses a multi-agent and priority based approach which is embedded within a two-stage Genetic Algorithm (GA), decomposing the problem into (i) product flow, (ii) demand allocation and (iii) pricing bidding process. To test and demonstrate the optimization quality of the proposed algorithm, numerical experiments have been carried out based on the well-known benchmarking network. The results prove the reliability and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to LINGO and the benchmarking algorithm discussed in the literature.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The combustion process in the working space of a heat installation is simulated. The static characteristic of the dependence of fuel consumption on air consumption in the conditions of stabilization of heat generated as a result of the combustion process is shown, therefore, the possibility of optimizing this process is proved. A block diagram, mathematical model and algorithm for calculating energy-saving fuzzy control of the combustion process in the working space of a thermal installation are developed. Combustion Membership functions of fuzzy sets for input linguistic variables are compiled. The rule bases are formulated taking into account the static characteristics of the control object. Examples of technological and linguistic justification of fuzzy controller rules are given. The dynamics of changing the controlled parameter is determined by solving two differential equations. The search for levels of \"cut-offs\" for the prerequisites of each of the rules using the \"minimum\" operation in accordance with the compiled database of rules is performed. The defuzzification procedure was performed (bringing it to clarity). The advantages of this system over traditional stabilizing control systems under the action of a set of random factors and a significantly nonlinear relationship between input and output values are shown. Optimal values of scaling factors for the developed automatic control system are determined. Let's consider an example of the formation of a control effect when implementing fuzzy energy-saving control of the combustion process in the working space of the boiler unit No. 3 of the GKP-1A UGPU of Gazprom dobycha Urengoy LLC. The calculations of the amount of inleakage of atmospheric air, excess air flow, the sectional area of the pipe supplying air, the total air flow in the working space of the thermal installation, the volume of natural gas participating in the combustion process, heat resulting from the combustion, the amount of air that did not participate in the combustion process, the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of excess air until the average temperature of the flue gas remaining heat of the combustion reaction, changes in the oxygen concentration in the exhaust flue gases depending on the air flow to the burner. The functional dependence of the flue gas temperature on the natural gas consumption is constructed by approximating the initial data of the regime map of the steam boiler. The dynamic properties of an inertia-delayed controlled process are taken into account when using the Euler method. The combustion control mode influence on the specific fuel consumption is estimated. The effects of using a system with fuzzy control in terms of saving natural gas and electricity over the entire range of performance of a thermal installation are estimated.</jats:p>",

Countries with diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems will see diverging feedstock opportunities to develop these new value chains. Understanding the sources, composition, and regional availability of these biomass feedstocks is an essential first step in developing new sustainable bio-based value chains. In this paper, an assessment and analysis of regional biomass availability was conducted in the diverse regions of Andalusia and Ireland using a bioresource mapping model. The model provides regional stakeholders with a first glance at the regional opportunities with regards to feedstock availability and an estimate of the transportation costs associated with moving the feedstock to a different modelled location/region for the envisioned biorefinery plant. The analysis found that there were more than 30 million tonnes of (wet weight) biomass arisings from Ireland (84,000 km2) with only around 4.8 million tonnes from the Andalusian region (87,000 km2). The study found that Cork in Ireland stood out as the main contributor of biomass feedstock in the Irish region, with animal manures making the largest contribution. Meanwhile, the areas of Almería, Jaén, and Córdoba were the main contributors of biomass in the Andalusia region, with olive residues identified as the most abundant biomass resource. This analysis also found that, while considerable feedstock divergence existed within the regions, the mapping model could act as an effective tool for collecting and interpreting the regional data on a transnational basis.</jats:p>"

An analytical framework is presented, based on a critical assessment with respect to issues related to new types of cyber risk and the integration of supply chains with new technologies. This paper identifies a dynamic and self-adapting supply chain system supported with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and real-time intelligence for predictive cyber risk analytics. The system is integrated into a cognition engine that enables predictive cyber risk analytics with real-time intelligence from IoT networks at the edge. This enhances capacities and assist in the creation of a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and threats that arise when edge computing nodes are deployed, and when AI/ML technologies are migrated to the periphery of IoT networks.</jats:p>",

Here we present an inexpensive production method for 3-ethylphenol (3-EP) and 3-propylphenol (3-PP) by microbial fermentation of sugars. Heterologous expression in the yeast <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic> of phosphopantetheinyltransferase-activated 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthase (MSAS) and 6-MSA decarboxylase converted acetyl-CoA as a priming unit via 6-MSA into 3-methylphenol (3-MP). We exploited the substrate promiscuity of MSAS to utilize propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA as alternative priming units and the substrate promiscuity of 6-MSA decarboxylase to produce 3-EP and 3-PP in yeast fermentations. Increasing the formation of propionyl-CoA by expression of a bacterial propionyl-CoA synthetase, feeding of propionate and blocking propionyl-CoA degradation led to the production of up to 12.5 mg/L 3-EP. Introduction of a heterologous ‘reverse ß-oxidation’ pathway provided enough butyryl-CoA for the production of 3-PP, reaching titers of up to 2.6 mg/L. As the concentrations of 3-alkylphenols are close to the range of the concentrations deployed in tsetse fly traps, the yeast broths might become promising and inexpensive sources for attractants, producible on site by rural communities in Africa.</jats:p>"

Here, we first provide a brief tutorial highlighting key elements of LCA. Methods to fill data gaps in LCA are discussed, as capturing the full life cycle is data intensive. On this basis, we review recent methods for integrating LCA into the design of chemical processes, products, and supply chains. Whereas adding LCA as a posteriori tool for decision support can be regarded as established, the integration of LCA into the design process is an active field of research.

The management of sustainable supply chain has been created to emphasize on the importance of social and environmental concerns along with the economic factors in planning the supply chain. The present research aims to recognize and study the indexes effective on the supply chain sustainability; for this purpose, the qualitative and quantitative methods were applied. At first, the qualitative data were extracted by the use of the meta-synthesis method and then, the quantitative data were collected by using the connoisseurs’ opinions and Delphi method. In this research, the procedure of researches done during 15 years in case of supply chain sustainability was studied and 26 factors effective on this matter were recognized. The present research is novel in terms of identification of indexes and dimensions of a sustainable supply chain that, for the first time, the qualitative meta-synthesis and Delphi methods were applied. The results reveal that the efficiency of using the recourses, competitive advantage, product quality, product maintenance in life circle, profitability, market share and reduction of costs of economic group and also the social responsibilities of company, business transparency, and the beneficiaries’ coordination with the social group with very near scores have the most importance and effect on the sustainability. The costumers’ satisfaction, production flexibility, capital return speed, logistic optimization, and suppliers are of the economic group and the environmental management system, designing consistent with the environment are of the environmental group. Furthermore, respecting the rights and equality among the employees and public awareness are of the social group and ultimately, bounding to social disciplines and norms are of social group and the reduction of greenhouse gasses emission, wastes, and environmental standards were of the environmental group.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the topology and configuration modes of four‐terminal SOPs are studied, and their control modes are investigated in normal operation and supply restoration conditions. Then, using the feeder partition method, the effects of four‐terminal SOPs on the power outage duration of different load areas after a fault are studied, and the reliability evaluation process for ADNs with four‐terminal SOPs is developed based on the quasi‐Monte Carlo method.

A principal component analysis (PCA) carried out with plasticity indexes highlighted four physiotypes of accessions differing in relationships between seedling elongation and seed biomass partitioning traits in response to the absence of nitrate.

Furthermore, its main aim is to represent graphically these areas throughout of digital surface by using measured depths. The detailing of these surfaces is affected by the bathymetric data spatial-distribution and the single-beam echo-sounder standard specifications. Therefore, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) accuracy is related to these precepts and so infers to the surface-volume precision. During the bathymetric survey, held in the pre-reservoir of Passaúna which is located in the Curitiba’s metropolitan region (Brazil), we planned an offset of 15 meters between the Regular Bathymetric Sections (RBS) and, during the post-processing, this offset was increased every 15 meters until reach up to 300 meters. For each dataset, many models were determined by using interpolators such as Kriging method (KRG) and the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and, from them, we computed the residuals by comparing the probed (obtained on the check lines) and the interpolated depths (from DEM). Also, the residuals Root Mean Square (RMS), an average value of 0.18 m was found on DEM generated using the RBS spaced from 15 to 105 meters and interpolated using the IDW method; its bathymetric data was positioned using the single-frequency GPS receptor (WS3910). By comparison between surface-volumes, we found a volumetric discrepancy up to -4.76% on DEM with RBS spaced from 30 meters to 180 meters; as the reference model, we used all surface model generated by using data from RBS spaced in 15 m due to its greatest accuracy.</jats:p>"

Industry 4.0 strategy does not only revolutionize the manufacturing system and processes but also lead to the formation of the intelligent supply chain. Currently, Industry 4.0‐based intelligent supply chain has attracted a lot of attention from academia; however, studies on performance measurement indicator of intelligent supply chain are still lacking. To fill this gap, this paper first introduces the impact of Industry 4.0 on supply chain management. After analysing key characteristics of intelligent supply chain, the paper proposes a performance measurement indicator framework consisting of seven indicators. This indicator framework enriches the theoretical knowledge of supply chain performance evaluation and provides an efficient way to improve the operational performance of intelligent supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the basic information of distributed PV system is introduced, and the main influence factors affecting the power output of distributed PV system are determined. Secondly, the influence factors with higher correlation with PV output are selected by Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) analysis in multiple timescales. Then, based on the multimodel univariate extreme learning machine (ELM) submodel and the single-model multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) submodel, the ELM-LSTM model is established.

The final design of the larval cradle was cylindrical, a nylon mesh structure with a volume of 9 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, suspended in the sea and extending vertically toward the seabed. We found three key design features that improved the efficiency of the apparatus: (1) an open area of sea surface and mesh size of less than 100 μm produced high fertilization and optimal survival (&gt;90%), (2) a special skirt‐shaped net (3 m in diameter) with a connection hose for attaching the cradle to collect bundles from many adult colonies over a wide area and at various depths, and (3) adding short square tube pieces, called square hollow sections, as a substrate for enhancing larval settlement and survival, to a larval cradle at 4 days after spawning was optimal for uniform settlement. This system allowed not only the collection of several million eggs, but also subsequent production of several thousand settled juvenile corals, without land facilities.

The agricultural complex is the main biomass producing industry. The transition of the heat supply system to a new basis, namely, to the use of biomass energy for the needs of communal and household facilities of farms, requires new methods for calculating the volume of the energy yield of an alternative source of heat supply based on crop waste, will ensure their more rational use.  One of the problems for the effective use of an alternative source of heat supply based on crop waste is the development of a methodological approach to determine its volume for the heating season, taking into account the calorific properties. The purpose of the work is the effective use of an alternative source of heat supply based on crop waste by developing a methodological approach to determine the potential of energy harvest from crop waste, their volumes for the heating season, taking into account the calorific properties and the selection of technological equipment.  The effective use of an alternative source of heat supply was carried out due to the rational use of the structure of the cultivated areas of the farm and the determination of the volume of fuel for the heating period, taking into account its calorific value according to ISO 1928: 1995 IDT, DSTU ISO 1928: 2006 \"Solid mineral fuels. Determination of the highest calorific value by the method of combustion in a calorimetric bomb and the calculation of the net calorific value\".  According to the research results, one of the promising and relevant directions for the effective use of the potential of an alternative source of heat supply is proposed, namely the combination of the use of straw and gas compressed into bales. The structure of the fields from which you can harvest 2 crops - food and energy - is presented. With the calorific value of straw 10501 kJ/kg and the volume of its combustion 12.130 centners, the heating period is 162 days, which leads to the replacement of natural gas in the amount of 42 thousand m3/year.</jats:p>",

Optimal land use and land management requires explicit spatial mapping of ESs supply and demand under alternative land use scenarios. In this study, we applied spatially explicit models to predict changes in ESs supply and demand, and their coupling mechanisms, under one baseline scenario and three stakeholder‐defined LULC change scenarios (developed, planning, policy) in Shanghai municipality, China. The results suggest that the policy scenario could significantly increase ESs supply and restore degraded urban areas, but would not guarantee that supply meets demand for four key ESs tested: water retention, particulate matter removal, carbon sequestration, and recreation. However, the policy scenario significantly reduced the shortfalls and spatial mismatches in water retention, particulate matter removal and recreation services, and also greatly restored deficit areas for all four ESs. This is valuable scientific evidence that ESs supply and demand information can be incorporated into urban land management planning in a spatially explicit manner, in order to control or prevent future potential land degradation.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the lateral migration should not be neglected when seepage velocity was high. In addition, the lateral migration was faster in high moisture content areas and the solute was retained for a short time; however, the situation was reversed in low moisture content areas. Moreover, during the initial stage of solute transport, the velocity of the trailing end of the pinnate pollution zone was high under the effect of capillary action, which would lead to expansion of the range of pollution. Furthermore, the relative concentration curve of pollutants presented a single peak state, with the peak value of the curve increasing with the velocity, and the arrival time of the peak value was also gradually advanced. Therefore, this study can provide reference for the prediction and control of groundwater contaminant transport in an unsaturated zone.</jats:p>",

In this study, the effects of hydraulic shear forces (achieved by regulating the shaking table’s rotation speed) on Fe2+ bio-oxidation and Fe3+ hydrolytic mineralization in an acidic 9K medium-FeSO4-Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans system (simulated AMD) are investigated. Results reveal that a higher shaking speed favors a higher oxidation rate of Fe2+, whereas a very low or high shaking speed restricts the removal of Fe3+. Shaking table rotation speeds of 120–180 rpm were preferred for biomineralization treatment in the simulated AMD. As the initial concentration of Fe2+ in the system decreased from 9.67 to 0 g/L in 40 h, the dissolved O2 (DO) in the solution dropped to its lowest concentration after 20 h and then increased to its initial level between 40 and 120 h. However, the corresponding total Fe (TFe) precipitation efficiency increased with the increasing mineralization time after 40 h. The effect of O2 supply time on biomineralization revealed that DO was mainly used in Fe2+ bio-oxidation. After Fe2+ was completely oxidized by A. ferrooxidans, the precipitation efficiency of TFe was independent of the O2 supply.</jats:p>"

Because of the construction of water conservancy projects and agricultural irrigation areas, the groundwater replenishment and drainage conditions there have changed. Groundwater test data were used to analyze the status of groundwater fluoride with this changing hydrodynamic gradient. The paper established a health risk assessment model based on triangular fuzzy number. The results show that the samples of phreatic water and confined water with excessive fluoride content accounted for 68.74% and 29.4%, respectively. Samples that exceeded standards of fluoride content were mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest. The chemistry of phreatic water is more complicated than that of confined water. The water quality categories are mainly poor and very poor. The formation of major anions and cations was mainly controlled by evaporation and rock weathering. It was also found that non-carcinogenic risks of fluoride in phreatic water are greater than those in confined water. The risk indices for children and adults were [1.1, 1.6] and [0.6, 0.9], respectively (α = 0.8). The non-carcinogenic risk assessment model based on triangular fuzzy numbers has a higher reference value than that of traditional models.</jats:p>",

The TIIWO algorithm includes dynamic corridor constraints (in its outer layer) and iterative reciprocating optimization (in its inner layer). The convergence of the TIIWO algorithm is achieved by minimizing the Schaffer function, which is characterized by its strong oscillatory behavior. In addition, the sensitivity of the main TIIWO parameters is analyzed using two methods, namely the revised Morris scheme and the Sobol index method. For experimental assessment, the TIIWO algorithm is firstly applied to a single reservoir. We investigate how the algorithm convergence is affected by four algorithm variants and parameter values. Then, the TIIWO algorithm is used to solve the problem of the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs. The results show that the TIIWO algorithm quickly and efficiently reaches the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs. In addition, this algorithm exhibits superior performance for high-dimensional, nonlinear and multi-constraint problems.</jats:p>",

Because of their relationship to ecohydrological processes, δ18O values in tree rings are potentially useful for deciphering long-term physiological responses and tree adaptation to increasing drought. We therefore analyzed both needle- and stem-level isotope fractionations in mature trees exposed to varying water supply. In a first experiment, we investigated seasonal δ18O variations in soil and needle water of Scots pine in a dry inner Alpine valley in Switzerland, comparing drought-stressed trees with trees that were irrigated for more than 10 years. In a second experiment, we analyzed twentieth-century δ18O variations in tree rings of the same forest, including a group of trees that had recently died. We observed less 18O enrichment in needle water of drought-stressed compared with irrigated trees. We applied different isotope fractionation models to explain these results, including the Péclet and the two-pool correction, which considers the ratio of unenriched xylem water in the needles to total needle water. Based on anatomical measurements, we found this ratio to be unchanged in drought-stressed needles, although they were shorter. The observed lower 18O enrichment in needles of stressed trees was therefore likely caused by increased effective path length for water movement within the leaf lamina. In the tree-ring study, we observed lower δ18O values in tree rings of dead trees compared with survivors during several decades prior to their death. These lower values in declining trees are consistent with the lower needle water 18O enrichment observed for drought-stressed compared with irrigated trees, suggesting that this needle-level signal is reflected in the tree rings, although changes in rooting depth could also play a role. Our study demonstrates that long-term effects of drought are reflected in the tree-ring δ18O values, which helps to provide a better understanding of past tree physiological changes of Scots pine.</jats:p>",

Five specimens of caracaras (three males and two females), and seven great egrets (five males and two females) were used. Barium sulphate and latex suspension were injected into the left ventricle of the birds. The radiographs were taken with the pelvic limbs in the ventrodorsal, dorsoplantar, mediolateral and lateromedial recumbency. Thereafter, the material was fixed in a 10% solution of formaldehyde and dissected. The pelvic limb received its arterial supply from two main vessels, the ischiatic and external iliac arteries. The ischiatic artery presented to be the principal artery of pelvic limb in the caracara and great egret. Several branches arised from the ischiatic and external iliac arteries were described. No gender differences were observed in both species. The caracara and great egret showed arteries similar to those reported for the ostrich and domestic fowl. According to the results of this study, it is suggested that the caracara has a pelvic limb with more arterial branches and larger arterial diameter than the great egret, which is probably related to the specific behaviour of these birds, since the caracara is a bird that exercise more their pelvic limbs to capture its prey when compared with the great egret.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The classical newsvendor problem seeks to minimize the expected inventory cost or maximize the expected profit. But optimizing an expected value alone does not fully capture the stochastic nature of the newsvendor problem. Inspired by the higher‐moment analyses explored in finance literature, we conduct a mean‐variance‐skewness‐kurtosis (MVSK) analysis for the newsvendor problem. We first derive the analytical expressions for the profit’s mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis in the standard newsvendor setting, and reveal their structural properties. We then establish various MVSK optimization problems and find the solution to each of them. We show that kurtosis aversion always induces the newsvendor to order less, while skewness seeking can induce the newsvendor to order either more or less depending on the specific structure of the profit’s skewness, which is affected by the symmetric and asymmetric properties of the demand distribution. Finally, based on the Pareto‐optimality concept, we address the challenge of supply chain coordination (SCC) in the presence of MVSK agents in two specific cases: (i) each agent maximizes its MVSK‐objective‐function and (ii) each agent maximizes its expected profit function, subject to given constraints on the profit’s variance, skewness, and kurtosis. In each case, we explore whether and how the supply chain can be coordinated. We find that considering the MVSK preferences of supply chain agents will affect the achievability of SCC and flexibility of the coordinating contract. We also uncover that if we assume an individual MVSK agent to be an MV one, the achievability of SCC by contracts will be very much negatively affected. </jats:p>",

Just like other sectors, the pharmaceutical sector can also benefit from new methodologies in the supply chain network. More effective supply chain management can benefit the pharmaceutical industry by reducing the risks from the current challenges being faced by the industry. Difficulties like missing interest data, human asset reliance, request of the board, distribution center administration, absence of coordination, shipment perceivability and lapse must be confronted. An important observation from these challenges is their dependence on human resources to come about these changes in the state and process information. Inevitably, blockchain can construct the profitability and straightforwardness of flexible chains and vehemently influence everything from warehousing to movement to portion. The core benefits of the blockchain technology are Immutability, Corruption &amp; tamper proof, Secure and Zero downtime.

The total arsenic (As), total mercury (Hg) and other parameters (temperature, pH, EC, particle size of sediments and organic matter in sediments) were measured. Based on the temporal variations, seasonal comparisons and factor analysis, the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The seasonal characteristics of Hg and As were: summer &amp;gt; spring &amp;gt; autumn &amp;gt; winter, and spring &amp;gt; summer &amp;gt; autumn &amp;gt; winter. (2) The higher concentration of Hg and As during summer was considered to be caused by the higher organic matter and humus content, which made heavy metals strongly adsorbed and complexed, and changes in the organic matter content would enhance the binding state of the less active organic matter then deposit in sediment. (3) The speciation of mercury and arsenic was also the reason, in summer, the Hg0 in the atmosphere was oxidized to Hg2+, entering into water through rainwater washing and dry deposition; then, soluble Hg2+ was quickly adsorbed and fixed in sediment, a series of transformations reduces its activity. The As3+ would be oxidized to As5+ which would form precipitated. Therefore, the content of Hg and As, environmental risk and potential ecological risk of mercury in sediments were higher in summer.</jats:p>",

Results showed that concentrations of 209 PCB congeners ranged up to 20 ng/g, that total PCB concentrations by homolog groups varied from 9.0 to 327 ng/g, and that total PCB mass ranged from 101.0 to 1,476.3 ng with the order of sites 6 &amp;gt; 7 &amp;gt; 3 &amp;gt; 4 &amp;gt; 2 &amp;gt; 1 &amp;gt; 5. Furthermore, higher PCB concentrations were detected for homolog groups including hexa- and hepta-PCBs. More PCBs were associated with sediments at downstream sites possibly due to accumulation and deposition in the estuary, as supported by strong correlations of PCB concentrations between different sampling sites (R2 ≤ 0.96). Comparisons with prior reports showed that all total PCB concentrations were below those reported by the Contamination Assessment and Reduction Project (CARP) and Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), except for sites 6 and 7. Sites 3 and 4 had PCB concentrations exceeding the 22.7 ng/g limit of the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), whereas sites 6 and 7 exceeded the 180 ng/g limit, indicating potential health hazards from PCBs.</jats:p>",

To address this problem, this paper introduces a preventive opportunistic maintenance (POM) method for TPSS based on equipment reliability. Firstly, a POM model is established by considering the equipment reliability degradation process based on Weibull distribution. Then, by considering the total power outage time in the planned operation cycle of TPSS as the optimization objective, the optimal maintenance scheme of TPSS is formulated by iterative method of maintenance strategies. The proposed method is verified by introducing practical maintenance strategies and fault record data of the traction transformer, circuit breaker and disconnector in an actual TPSS of a railway administration. Results show that the presented method can make full use of the existing fault data to develop a POM scheme for TPSS. It can improve maintenance efficiency and reduce power outage time, providing guidance to formulate scientific maintenance strategies for TPSS.</jats:p>",

However, the molecular events that accompanied this emergence remain largely unknown. Here, we describe two MTBC strains isolated from patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis, representing an as-yet-unknown lineage, named Lineage 8 (L8), seemingly restricted to the African Great Lakes region. Using genome-based phylogenetic reconstruction, we show that L8 is a sister clade to the known MTBC lineages. Comparison with other complete mycobacterial genomes indicate that the divergence of L8 preceded the loss of the <jats:italic>cobF</jats:italic> genome region - involved in the cobalamin/vitamin B12 synthesis - and gene interruptions in a subsequent common ancestor shared by all other known MTBC lineages. This discovery further supports an East African origin for the MTBC and provides additional molecular clues on the ancestral genome reduction associated with adaptation to a pathogenic lifestyle.</jats:p>"

Assuming that the retailer’s level of selling effort involved asymmetric information, this study analyzed the impact of different government subsidy strategies on the wholesale price, the product greenness level, retail price, the level of selling effort, the manufacturer’s profit, and the retailer’s profit. The results showed that (1) the government’s subsidy strategy can effectively not only improve the product greenness level but also increase the profits of an enterprise in a green supply chain, which helps the retailer to enhance their selling effort; (2) regardless of whether the retailer’s level of selling effort was high or low, as the government’s subsidy coefficient increased, the wholesale price continued to decrease, and the product greenness level and retailer’s selling effort level also increased.</jats:p>",

To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84/151). Coronaviruses were detected in the majority of wildlife farms (60.7%, 17/28) and in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6/96) that are farmed. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three<jats:italic>Coronaviridae</jats:italic>genera, including the<jats:italic>Alpha</jats:italic>-,<jats:italic>Beta</jats:italic>-, and<jats:italic>Gammacoronaviruses</jats:italic>. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we investigate the equilibrium behavior of a decentralized supply chain with multiple retailers facing a random price-dependent demand in the additive form. Here, we consider two kinds of demand functions: the distribution of the demand depends only on the retailer’s own retail price (noncompeting retailers) and not only on his own retail price but also on that of the other retailers (competing retailers). We present appropriate wholesale price, buy-back, and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts to coordinate the total supply chain, so that when all the retailers adopt their equilibrium response, the supply chain system coordination is also achieved. Furthermore, the coalition formation among retailers is also analyzed. We find that with buy-back and lost-sales cost-sharing contracts and linear price-dependent demand function, retailers always prefer being in the grand coalition to forming any other coalition.</jats:p>",
