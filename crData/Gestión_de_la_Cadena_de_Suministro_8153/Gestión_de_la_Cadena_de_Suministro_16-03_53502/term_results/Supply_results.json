The research inductively builds a theoretical framework from a nested case study, which includes one NGO and six firms implementing supplier development (SD) programs. The framework suggests a set of resources that enhance the social sustainability of the supply chain without creating trade‐offs between economic and social performance. This study has implications for decision‐makers in firms and NGOs about the type of resources they need to develop, and the characteristics they should seek when choosing partners for undertaking collaborative initiatives in social sustainability.</jats:p>",

These simulation tools are required to estimate the impact of the today's decisions on the system performance over the next decades and to compare and rank different intervention strategies. To achieve this, this paper aims to build the metabolism-based modelling of a real water supply system using the recently developed WaterMet2 model in order to evaluate long-term performance metrics for possible intervention strategies. This metabolism-based approach was demonstrated for evaluation of the water supply system of Reggio Emilia, Italy, which is one of the demonstration case studies in the EU TRUST (TRansitions to the Urban water Services of Tomorrow) project. Based on the strains imposed by pressing challenges (here population growth) two intervention strategies were analysed. The results obtained show that the built and calibrated WaterMet2 model allows a broader understanding of the impacts of alternative intervention strategies taking into account multidimensional aspects of the sustainability beside conventional service performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper uses pragmatic findings and lessons learned from three case studies to deduce that community-based rainwater harvesting (CB-RWH) is an innovative solution to develop sustainable drinking water supply systems in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. Taking advantage of traditional community-based activities in African and Asian villages, the water supply system can be significantly improved with the introduction and implementation of CB-RWH systems. Furthermore, sustainable, safe water sources in Africa and Asia can be brought to fruition when transparent self-regulatory management systems are supported through comprehensive design and maintenance guidelines and funded from private and public sources. To this end, the potential for CB-RWH to lead toward greater resilience and sustainability was investigated. Based on case studies of three successful demonstration projects in Africa and Asia, this paper identifies 14 innovative solutions resolving technical, economic, and social problems which have been barriers preventing the wide implementation of CB-RWH in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. It also recommends strategies to promote CB-RWH in African and Asian villages, which include the following: implementation of more pilot projects at local levels; promotion of and education in rainwater preservation and harvesting at all levels of the education system; and innovation in micro-funding systems in cooperation with corporate social responsibility activities. These strategies will promote the implementation of CB-RWH as a mainstream and high-priority technique for national, regional, and global water strategies.</jats:p>",

It explores issues that underpin supply chain innovation, sustainable growth within the supplier base and the benefits that the nation and informed clients gain through adoption of supply chain sustainability. Procurement practices have changed in recent years, and, particularly during the post-2012 Olympics period, there is a greater awareness now of the conditions required to deliver national economic infrastructure and the commercial conditions that promote efficient delivery and enable supply chain innovation. This paper includes some findings in 2015 of the initiative termed the ‘Sustainable Supply Chain’, steered by Robert Mallett (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors), Chris Williams-Lilly (Rail Champions) and Richard Graham (CH2M). This work highlights the need for greater client focus on infrastructure operational requirements and outcomes, for the development of operational asset performance and functional requirements for the underlying projects that then inform the supply chain and its engagement in effective delivery of those outcomes. Within this early definition lies the client establishment of effective vertical supply chain relationships, their promotion of small to medium-sized enterprise investment and capabilities to achieve the clients’ defined end-state requirements. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Investing in education is generally considered as a promising strategy to fight poverty and increase prosperity. This applies to all levels of an economy reaching from individuals to local communities and countries and has a global perspective as well. However, high-quality education is often costly and not available anytime anywhere. Therefore, any promising concept that might help to democratize education is worth pursuing, in a sense that it makes education accessible for everybody without any restrictions. The characteristics attributed to MOOC – Massive Open Online Courses are promising to contribute to this objective. Hence, our objective is to analyse MOOC as it currently operates. Obviously, there is a huge demand for free high-quality education anytime anywhere but a shortage on the supply side. So, we will concentrate on supply-sided effects and study MOOC platforms as well as content providers, particularly universities. We focus our research on some of the leading platforms and universities worldwide. Relative to their size Australia and the Netherlands are very active players in the MOOC sector. Germany is lagging behind and leading universities in the UK seem to virtually refrain from offering MOOC. Our research also shows the leading role of US universities and platform providers.</jats:p>",

In this approach, the synthesized AuNPs solution was stabilized by the citrate anions as their repulsion protected the AuNPs from aggregation. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized morphologically by using transmission electron microscopy technique. Malathion caps the surface of AuNPs and induces the aggregation of AuNPs in Britton–Robinson buffer solution. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease in the plasmon resonance band of the AuNPs at 527 nm after 9 min. The effect of reaction variables on the reaction sensitivity was investigated and furthermore, the interference of common ions was effectively avoided. The calibration curve is linear over the concentration range 3.3 × 10−7 to 3.3 × 10−6 mol/L of malathion with good precision and accuracy and the detection limit was down to 1.5 × 10−7 mol/L. The developed approach does not use complex and expensive instruments. The high sensitivity of the proposed method allowed its successful application to wheat and water samples. Thus, the proposed strategy can serve as a powerful method for the rapid diagnosis of malathion in agriculture products.</jats:p>",

The modeled energy system consists of a concentrating solar tower plant with thermal storage and low-temperature seawater desalination unit as well as an integrated photovoltaic plant and a wind turbine. The low-temperature desalination unit has been newly developed in order to enable the utilization of waste heat from power conversion processes by improved thermal efficiency. In the study, special attention is given to the surplus power handling generated by the photovoltaic and wind power plant. Surplus power is converted into heat and stored in the thermal storage system of the solar power plant in order to increase the capacity factor. A brief estimation of investment costs have been conducted as well in order to outline the economic performance of the modeled energy and water supply system.</jats:p>"

Here, the gross domestic product was considered as dependent variable, and Money supply, Exchange rate, Exports earnings, Imports outflow, the Colombo consumer price index were deemed as independent variables. In the meantime, the multivariate econometric method was used to test the impacts of money supply on economic growth of Sri Lanka. According to the analytical results, the money supply has kept positive impact on the economic growth of Sri Lanka at 1% significant level. The R-squared of the estimated model was 92% which was indicated that the estimated model was desirable. Meanwhile, the Durbin Watson test statistic was 2.43 and also the Breusch –Godfrey serial correlation LM test results was greater than 5%. Therefore, these statistics indicated that, the estimated model was not suffering from serial correlation.</jats:p>"

We assume that innovation and information management are interrelated in supply chains and that the relationship is crucial for their success on the market. Considerable attention was given to the issue of outsourcing which is now a commonplace in supply chain management. In particular, we examined how approaches to managing information and knowledge in the supply chain differ according to ICT outsourcing. The deduction is based on a data set of 426 companies located in Poland, representing a variety of industry sectors. Two stages of the research were realised. The rationale behind this was to identify enterprises that utilise a welldeveloped system of information and knowledge management to determine the scope of possible in-depth analyses. This helped to receive valuable responses. We find what information and knowledge management is mainly driven by. We show the similarities and differences in information and knowledge management between entities that use ICT outsourcing and those that do not. We discuss the research results and draw conclusions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) is a widely used approach through manufacturing environments in a variety of sectors. With a tendency to go to specialized, smaller lot sizes in several industries (e.g., the pharmaceutical sector), companies are dealing with capacity bottlenecks if the planning rhythm wheel is not well calibrated or when production lines are not flexible enough in terms of changeover (C/O) and set-up times (S/U) (OEE is too small). A well-established communication system including other enterprise resources or production factors (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP) is favorable to any extent. More and more questions arise from stakeholder communities and end-users on whether or not supply chains and manufacturing environments are sustainable and safe. Departments such as Environmental Health, Safety &amp; Sustainability (EHS &amp; S) and Product Stewardship are too often at the “blind” side of the ICT interface. When it comes to product and organizational sustainability, data seems to be lacking in order to conduct sustainability assessments proficiently. Years of intensive research and experience proved that primary data to perform sustainability assessments often are measured through equipment control sensors (e.g., flow rates, temperatures, etc.) and sent to PLCs and many other systems. Nevertheless, these data measurements are in many cases simply not penetrating through the Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) because these bottom-up engineering data seems to be of little value to planning, procurement, etc. This communication paper deals with how sustainability assessments can be embedded in business operational management systems. After all, who does not want a “live Carbon Footprint” for process improvements and external sustainability reporting instead of a series of expensive resource consuming studies of 4 to 6 months digging into data logs in traditional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)? This communication paper has taken one step further in coupling business ERP systems with environmental sustainability of products, services and enterprises.</jats:p>"

This approach is that the contamination of cow’s milk should be linked to the quality and supply of pasture forage. Research has found that in most cases reducing the quality and supply of pasture grass the activity of 137Cs in milk decreases, although this fact is less obvious to hospitals with severe particle size and high 137Cs ground deposition.

The first experiment was aimed to create three TMR with different synchronization index. Ingredient feedstuffs of TMR were evaluated for its in situ organic matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) degradation kinetics. On the basis of the OM and N degradation kinetics of feedstuffs, three sugarcane bagasse based TMR were formulated with synchronization indexes of 0.37; 0.50; and 0.63; respectively. The TMR had similar levels of crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). In the second experiment, the three TMR with different synchronization index were evaluated for in situ degradability characteristics of OM, CP, NDF, and sulfur. The in situ degradation of OM in TMR were decreased (P&lt;0.05) with the increasing of synchronization index. The higher synchronization index in TMR increased (P&lt;0.05) CP degradation of CP. The NDF degradation decreased slightly by the alteration of synchronization index in TMR. The higher synchronization index in TMR reduced (P&lt;0.05) in situ sulfur degradation, and this may not support to effects of synchronization of carbohydrate and nitrogen supply.  </jats:p>",

This conceptual paper discusses prolonged PS sequences involving different professionals and different types of professionals. It is framed by the dual concepts of service episodes, representing the client's perspective and experience, and PS supply chains, that is, organized sequences of professional, clerical, and technical services explicitly set up to provide specific results, such as producing a financial product, designing a house, or replacing a hip. Four illustrative, empirically inspired situations are used to characterize episodes and supply chains. Each exemplar, two each from the health and social work sectors, is real and draws on publicly available data. The richness of the public information is a reflection of the fact that each is some form of failure or “disaster” (Altay and Ramirez, 2010). This dual conceptualization leads to a holistic perspective obtained by using the complex adaptive systems framework (Dooley and Van de ven, 1999, Levin, 1998) as a lens. The paper concludes with a discussion of the dynamics of such service systems and some proposals for a research agenda.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Drip irrigation and impulse sprinkling correspond to this principle. Drip irrigation provides optimal water and nutrient regimes directly to the root system of plants. However, this irrigation is not effective enough under conditions of high temperature (over 25–35 °C) as growth processes are known to slow down and photosynthesis to cease, consequently affecting the yielding capacity. Impulse sprinkling provides optimal moisture level in the given layer, improved microclimate in the plant environment and water regime of plants within the whole vegetation period and is most effective within daytime. Through improvement of microclimate and plants' water regime within periods of high temperature and low air humidity under the conditions of South Kazakhstan, the technology of impulse sprinkling enabled increasing productivity of a clonal rootstock mother plantation for the 3 years of research on average by 19.4% compared to regular sprinkling. The applied technology provided optimization of layers' growth and development conditions upon decrease of the moistening of the soil layer of mother plantation bushes for derogation of their water regime after hilling the grown root layers.</jats:p>",

Therefore, different disinfectant concentrations were tested under different operating conditions in close-to-practice experiments. Particular attention was paid to the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state of the pathogens. Legionella pneumophila was able to survive disinfection with ClO2 in a culturable state in the biofilm at 37 °C while successful sanitation could be achieved at 11 °C, however non-culturable cells were still present. Culturable P. aeruginosa outlasted disinfection in biofilms of pipes at elevated nutrient concentrations and in built-in parts at 37 °C. Overall, the VBNC state was not the predominant factor for its survival. Additional experiments showed that the lack of an autochthonous biofilm may promote the growth of P. aeruginosa. This emphasizes the importance of localization and elimination of contamination sources in a plumbing system before disinfection is performed and the need for compliance with operating conditions and construction requirements defined by generally recognized standards of good practice in Germany.</jats:p>",

One of the important role players in alleviating these traits are humanitarian relief supply chains. The increasing number of disasters in our planet earth urges the humanitarian relief supply chains to focus on the assurance of safety of the victims. In order for this to occur, these supply chains should work effectively and efficiently. This can be possible through considerable evaluation of their supply chain performance. In this paper a literature review on supply chain performance evaluation in general and humanitarian relief supply chain performance in particular is presented. Previously conducted researches from the year 2000 until the present time have been reviewed. The works were categorized according to writers, publication year, publishing journal, technique utilized and objective intended. Then an analysis was made on humanitarian relief supply chain literature with respect to the publishing journals and the research technique applied. The result shows that humanitarian relief supply chain evaluation is almost an untouched area which needs further study. Recent supply chain management techniques can be applied for the improved performance of these supply chains. Based on this result, Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR), Fuzzy Logic System, and Artificial Neural Networks are found to be the areas which need further study.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Strategic asset management (AM) of urban water infrastructures faces the challenge of dealing with expensive and long-lasting assets of a very diverse nature and wide-ranging useful lives and costs. Typically, utility managers inherit an infrastructure with assets in assorted conditions and stages in their lifecycle. They are expected to manage their value in order to ensure adequate service, and make sure that what they pass on to their successors is capable of continuing to do so. Long-term vision is needed, and sound transition paths must be sought in order to ensure that urban water services are sustainable, without jeopardizing the quality of the service provided during the transition. Focusing on the transition to more sustainable services, the TRUST project revisited the concept of sustainability, explored pressures and drivers, and developed and tested a roadmapping methodology to cope with the implementation of disruptive solutions. Leading-edge analysis and assessment methods and tools were developed, multiple technologies were tested, scientific and guidance publications were produced. All of this can be explored and absorbed into a coherent management process. This paper describes the TRUST approach for infrastructure AM, addressing strategic, tactical and operational planning, supported by professional-grade software.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The textile industry achieves economic benefits through outsourcing to low cost markets. Today, reshoring is an emerging trend due to rising cost and unemployment concerns. This problem is primarily due to an industry-wide focus on economic benefits only. Cost saving is a basic reason for international outsourcing while domestic outsourcing provides capacity flexibility. Moreover, outsourcing risk has a major impact on strategic location of the production destinations. Therefore, the merging of capacity flexibility and outsourcing risk comprises a sustainable outsourcing strategy. This paper suggests a sustainable outsourcing strategy in which a textile manufacturer outsources to international markets for cost savings and outsources to the domestic market for capacity flexibility. The manufacturer reserves some capacity with domestic suppliers, and pays a unit penalty cost if this capacity flexibility is not utilized. The manufacturer seeks minimum risk in international markets. Operational cost, penalty cost, and outsourcing risk are considered to be objective functions. Decisions include the assignment of contracts to suitable facilities, the quantity of each contract, and allocation of reserved capacity flexibility among domestic suppliers. Multi-objective problem of this research was solved using three variants of goal programming. Several insights are proposed for outsourcing decision making in the current global environment.</jats:p>"

Water systems need to expand because of demographic growth. Therefore, evaluating and increasing system capacity is crucial. Specifically, we analyze network capacity as one of the main features of a system. When the network capacity starts to decrease, there is a risk that continuous supply will become intermittent. This paper discusses how network expansion carried out throughout the network life span typically reduces network capacity, thus transforming a system originally designed to work with continuous supply into a system with intermittent supply. A method is proposed to expand the network capacity in an environment of economic scarcity through a greedy algorithm that enables the definition of a schedule for pipe modification stages, and thus efficiently expands the network capacity. This method is, at the same time, an important step in the process of changing a water system from intermittent back to continuous supply—an achievement that remains one of the main challenges related to water and health in developing countries.</jats:p>"

Two goal functions have been used to solve the underlying optimization problem - the first one that enables direct cost minimization and the second one based on the cost-effectiveness approach used by economists. Such approach is substantially different from solutions proposed by other authors who concentrate rather on theoretical issues and do not take into consideration the economical market-based reality.

Those seven factors condense into four principal components under application of principal component analysis. Comprehensive WUI is calculated by these four components. Then the cluster analysis is applied to get different patterns in WUI. The principal components and the comprehensive intensity are taken as cluster variables. The number of clusters is determined to be three by applying the k-means clustering method and the F-statistic value. Variability in WUI is detected by implementing three clustering algorithms, namely k-means, fuzzy c-means and the Gaussian mixture model. WUI in China is clustered into three clusters by the k-means clustering method. Characteristics of each cluster are analyzed.</jats:p>",

The basis for this paper is research conducted in 2010-2014 on the construction sites of water supply and sewerage systems located in the provinces of Lower Silesia and Opole. The research consisted of direct observations of construction sites and review of construction documentation. It showed that work stoppages on the examined construction sites were frequent. They were caused by violations of work discipline by the production employees, adverse weather conditions, and defects in the project documentation. The study demonstrated that in almost every case, these bad an adverse effect on the completion date and budget of the investment. The analyses show that in such important and expensive investments as water supply and sewerage systems, organizational structures in which a special role is assigned to middle-rank personnel should be adopted.</jats:p>",

The conventional MAP bioassay for drinking water was originally developed by Markku based on the growth potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens P17 (P17). However, the bioassay bears some demerits, such as time-consuming and labor-intensive enumeration. For convenience, an alternative method based on a similar principle was developed to assess the content of MAP in drinking water, in which natural microbial consortium was used as inoculum instead of pure culture P17, cell number was counted using flow cytometry (FCM), and cultivation at 30 °C was adopted. Natural microbial consortium is able to efficiently utilize organic phosphorus and exhibit high sensitivity since more cells are produced per μg P utilized. FCM is a rapid method to count all bacteria growing in drinking water. With incubation temperature increasing up to 30 °C, there is a shorter test period (64 h), excellent sensitivity and better utilization efficiency for organic phosphorus. The results show that the developed bioassay is sensitive, time-saving and easily operated.</jats:p>",

After fungal inoculation, plants were grown in a growth chamber. All plants were effectively mycorrhized, with an average infection of 32% for each root. Mycorrhizal colonization led to increased stem height in pecan plants. On restricted water supply, mycorrhizal pecan seedlings presented a higher number of lateral roots and more stem height and diameter than nonmycorrhizal ones. Besides, nonmycorrhizal plants showed an increase in proline content with regard to mycorrhizal ones.

Moving to prognostic operations allows utilities to optimally schedule and scale resources to meet demand more reliably and economically. Commercial greenhouses are large water consumers. In order to produce effective forecasting models for greenhouse water demand, the factors that drive demand must be enumerated and prioritized. In this study greenhouse water demand was modeled using artificial neural networks trained with a dataset containing eight input factors for a commercial greenhouse growing bell peppers. The dataset contained water usage, climatic and temporal data for the years 2012–2014. This model was then evaluated using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, a global sensitivity analysis, in order to determine the importance, or sensitivity, of each input factor. It was found that time of day, solar radiation, and outdoor temperature (°C) had the largest effects on the model output. These outputs could be used to contribute to the generation of a simplified demand-forecasting model.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to determine redox categories, along with prevailing redox processes, and the differences in groundwater quality between shallow alluvial aquifers of Serbia's major rivers. The research was conducted on public water-supply wells in the alluvial plain of the Velika Morava River, the Danube River, the Tisa River and the alluvial aquifer of the Sava River. The study period is 2010–2014 and the number of collected and analysed samples 243. The redox categories and processes are characterised by concentrations of aqueous redox species (dissolved oxygen, nitrate, dissolved iron, manganese, and sulphate and sulphide concentrations). Parameters such as Eh, total organic carbon, HCO3−, pH, total iron concentrations, temperature and specific conductivity were also analysed. Different geological and hydrogeological settings, groundwater abstraction, distances between the wells and the river, well depths, and anthropogenic impacts result in diverse redox conditions. Groundwater in selected alluvial aquifers is mostly defined as anoxic, with one predominant process, or mixed anoxic, with various redox processes occurring simultaneously.</jats:p>",

Typically they aim to provide something different, to be better, or simply cheaper. In the construction industry, the performance characteristics, quality and cost of the final delivered project will be the outcome of the interplay of capabilities of all the firms involved in the project. Consequently, in order to improve competitiveness, firms must pay attention to not only their own competitive advantage but to those of the firms, both up-stream and down-stream, on whom they depend in delivering their projects. For foreign constructors in China, those competitive considerations will be informed by circumstances different from home.

Third, firms find opportunities to bring in off-shore technology intensive procurements, where that technology is either protected, improved upon, or sold.

Using German microdata, the observed distribution of couples’ earnings is compared to a counterfactual of random matches. In West Germany, marital sorting is found to be disequalizing only after adjusting for labour supply. This means that positive sorting in earnings potential is veiled by low female participation rates. In East Germany, the impact is highly disequalizing even when earnings are taken as given, due to the fact that East German women are more attached to the labour market.</jats:p>",

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy is an effective method which can be used to measure the chemical form of metals. However, when the iron concentration in water samples is extremely low, XAFS measurement and analysis can be difficult due to so much noise in the spectra. In this study, we examined various conditions related to XAFS measurements to analyze the chemical form of iron in water taken from water pipes. To optimize the XAFS measurement conditions, the energy range in pattern fitting was set at 7,100–7,140 eV. Piling up multiple pieces of filter paper was effective for improving the accuracy in the analysis of the XAFS spectra. The XAFS measurement of actual water samples was conducted and a low R factor was obtained from pattern fitting analysis. Differences were observed in the XAFS spectra depending on the chemical form of iron. These results showed that the chemical form of the iron of the actual water samples taken from the water pipes was able to be detected from the XAFS measurement.</jats:p>",

The present study aims to calculate the water quality index (WQI) by the analysis of seven physico-chemical parameters according to the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) to assess the suitability of water for drinking, irrigation purposes and other human uses. In the present investigation, ten groundwater samples were collected from various parts of Seraidi municipality area located in the north-east of Algeria, Physico-chemical parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphates, nitrates, turbidity and fecal coliforms were analyzed. The overall WQI values for all the samples were found to be in the range of 68–86, which reveals the fact that the quality of all the samples is only medium to good and could be used for drinking and other domestic uses only after proper treatment.</jats:p>",

We consider three types of quality improvement: cost consuming, cost identical, and cost saving, which correspond to the cases in which quality improvement leads to an increment, no change, and a decrease in production cost, respectively. We compare the performance of two types of quality contracts: (1)<jats:italic>pay‐before‐performance</jats:italic>contract, under which the supplier receives monetary support from the buyer before exerting quality improvement effort; and (2)<jats:italic>pay‐after‐performance</jats:italic>contract, under which the supplier receives monetary compensation based on the outcome of effort. We find that the performance of each contract depends on the types of quality improvement. Further, the pay‐after‐performance contract leads to close‐to‐perfect contract efficiency and dominates the pay‐before‐performance contract from the supplier's perspective in most cases. However, this result does not apply in two extended cases: when there are multiple competing suppliers, the pay‐before‐performance contract can dominate the pay‐after‐performance contract if quality improvement is cost consuming; and when the buyer can exert sales effort, neither contract can achieve close‐to‐perfect efficiency in most cases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The assembly of a groundwater flow model for the shallow aquifer in Tianjin Municipality is outlined in this paper. Tianjin Municipality was selected because of its complicated hydrogeological conditions and rich data, which could be used to test a refined groundwater flow model for the shallow aquifer. When a shallow groundwater flow model is being assembled its recharge and discharge functions need to represent inflows from rainfall, irrigation return flows, seepage from rivers and reservoirs, and lateral inflows and outflows from evaporation, abstraction of groundwater for irrigation and industrial, and urban use. When abstracting groundwater, the water exchanges between a shallow aquifer and a deep aquifer also need to be considered. The real irrigation areas of Tianjin Municipality were input into the groundwater flow model, and the rivers and reservoirs were refined to the level of secondary tributaries and small scale reservoirs. The model calibration was carried out based on consideration of representative parameter values and their spatial distribution, the groundwater flow fields, the temporal variation in groundwater heads and the water balance for the years 2006–2008. It was concluded from a comparison of the observed and simulated groundwater heads that the precision of the model is high and that the simulated groundwater levels align with the real groundwater conditions. It is also concluded that the groundwater flow model for the shallow aquifer in Tianjin Municipality will be a useful tool for further studies about the relationship between shallow and deep aquifers and the surface environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Wrapped by the Pacific waters and the mist of shipwrecks and pirates stories, one of the rainiest Eastern Pacific islands protects a biodiversity treasure: Isla del Coco. This study presents the analysis of moisture sources linked with contributions to precipitation in the area. The diurnal cycle of precipitation on the island was reviewed from GPS station data previously evaluated using available meteorological data from field campaigns held on the island in 2011 and 2012. Near-surface salinity patterns were also analyzed along with sea surface temperature, evaporation, Ongoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) as well as latent and sensible heat fluxes. Moisture contributions to precipitation on the island are supplied by evaporative sources, and moisture recycling is important. Regional precipitation is a continuous supply of moisture for the atmosphere whereas transport from evaporative sources is seasonally constrained. The analysis of the diurnal cycle of moisture supply suggests that contributions from available moisture linked with precipitation recycling show a slightly delayed response to deep convection in the region. The diurnal cycle of contributions to precipitation from evaporative moisture sources, based on the modeling component of the work, is consistent with the diurnal cycle of precipitation. The trajectory analysis remarks the role of the low level winds, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position and the stability conditions to modulate the supply of moisture. The moisture contributions from the sources present a different sensitivity to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Contributions from precipitation recycling showed a large variability linked to ENSO as increasing contributions were determined to be related with El Niño during boreal summer and autumn months. The variability of the contributions from a North-east evaporative source is modulated by the response of the Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ; Amador, 1998; Amador, 2008) to ENSO. The South-western evaporative source showed sensitivity to El Niño, as transport was found to decrease (increase) from November to March (May to July), meanwhile the response to La Niña was small. Good agreement amongst the ENSO response of the fields and the known dynamics of the region was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

Phytoplankton growth is the foundation for energy transfer into higher trophic levels, influences climate by the uptake of atmospheric CO2, and plays an important role in nutrient cycling. Here we use a novel lagrangian approach to characterize the nitrate supply to the Great Australian Bight, identify episodes of extreme phytoplankton blooms and ascertain the origin of the nitrate sources that fuel them. We find that 55 % of nitrate used by phytoplankton enters the GAB in the upper 100 m and that 88 % originates locally from a region between the GAB and the Sub Antarctic Front, rather than from more remote oceans; thus, most of the nitrate is recycled locally. Our results show extreme phytoplankton blooms have an annual periodicity, peaking in the Austral autumn when the mixed layer deepens. This suggests that stratification erosion is key supplying nutrients into the euphotic zone and triggering these episodes.\n                        </jats:p>"

This topic has been gaining increasing attention within both academia and industry for making the industry competitive. With the ever increasing demand for reducing carbon foot prints and greenhouse gas emission, there is a need to study the various parameters and drivers of sustainable development, especially in supply chain management. The need for developing the sustainable model including the drivers of sustainability needs to be designed.

Within this review framework, the authors also identified GSCM research questions that are worthy of investigation. The study suggests that the main drivers of GSCM include the environmental policy and the green human resource management by providing them training for adopting sustainability practices. Besides this, another key driver is the sustainability criteria in supplier selection which was found to be enhancing the outcomes of sustainability.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The model suggests that we need to have management support for implementing the sustainability strategy in the organization.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The study guides the managers for implementing sustainable supply chain management practices in the organization.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The model including the environment policy (adoption), green human resource management (diffusion), green technology (diffusion), and GSCM.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– Additional organizational theories which are considered valuable for future GSCM research are also identified with a conclusion for this review.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It is based on interviews with seafarers working on board several of these vessels and with representatives of the companies managing and operating the ships.</jats:p><jats:p>As might be anticipated from previous theorizing of supply chain effects on OHS, the study found there to be strong evidence of its influence on OHS management arrangements on tankers. The most significant driver of this effect for both managers and seafarers appeared to be the surveillance of their OHS arrangements instituted by the heads of the supply chain—in this case the oil majors and their inspection systems. Perhaps more surprisingly, despite the more diffuse, transactional and arms-length supply arrangements in the container trade, in the one case study from this sector examined in the paper, supply chain influences on OHS were nevertheless discernable. However, it also demonstrated the positive role played by the framework for maritime regulation in determining the significance of these influences.</jats:p><jats:p>Essentially, the results indicate that, under certain conditions, supply chain relations are useful in helping to support implementation of arrangements for OHS management on merchant vessels. However, it also more broadly demonstrates that such leverage is most likely to be effective when it operates within a wider institutional framework in which public regulation and its surveillance by regulatory authorities remains a key element.</jats:p>"

The numbers in all sampling sites ranged from 5 to 207 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL with a mean value of 53 CFU/100 mL. In total, 859 isolates were identified morphologically, with Aspergillus and Penicillium the most representative genera (37% and 25% respectively), followed by Trichoderma and Fusarium (9% each), Curvularia (5%) and finally the species Pestalotiopsis karstenii (2%). Ramichloridium and Leptodontium were isolated and are black yeasts, a group that include emergent pathogens.

GEV runs solely on power generated by its own battery group, which supplies power to its electric motor. This battery group can be charged from external electric sources. Nowadays, the interaction of GEV with the power grid is unidirectional by the charging process. However, GEV can be operated bi-directionally by modifying its power unit. In such operating conditions, GEV can operate as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and satisfy a portion or the total energy demand of the consumption center independent from utility grid, which is known as vehicle-to-home (V2H). In this paper, a power unit is developed for GEVs in the laboratory to conduct simulation and experimental studies to test the performance of GEVs as a UPS unit in V2H mode at the time of need. The activation and deactivation of the power unit and islanding protection unit are examined when energy is interrupted.</jats:p>"

Data were collected using questionnaires from 152 firms operating in the most industrialized regions of Ghana. Structural equation modelling technique (using LISREL 8.5) was employed in estimating the study’s model. The study finds significant positive associations between formal control and operational efficiency; and between social control and service &amp;amp; market performance. The study also finds that within the research context, social control is antecedent of (adherence to) formal control; and that the effect of social control on operational efficiency is fully channelled via formal control. These findings imply that firms’ ability to institute and implement GMs would present them opportunities to enhance the performance of their SCs. Theoretically, the results suggest the potential mediating role of formal control in the link between social control and SC performance; which means that having in place formal controls is necessary for firms in this part of the world (who mostly rely on social control) to better experience benefits arising out of social relationships.</jats:p>"

It also assesses how bulk water availability may aggravate this situation. We argue that water access-related problems are directly related to several aspects: the way that water and sanitation services are managed, deficiencies in planning, technical choices, and the way in which existing systems are operated. In addition to these current structural problems, the vulnerability of supply systems also tends to increase in terms of lesser water availability as long as no changes are made in management processes to promote greater water security, as the 2014-2015 drought affecting the Piracicaba and Paraíba do Sul river basins.</jats:p>",

While the construction process and the individual tasks of it are determined in the planning stage and encounter only limited changes, the economic environment, the duration of tasks and other outside factors, such as the weather, are subject to strong uncertainty and hence this uncertainty needs to be taken into account in the planning and supply chain management process for oil and gas projects. We present a new framework for the integration of technical and economic uncertainties for optimizing the supply chain and the project schedules. Furthermore, we also integrate the option to establish regional distribution center facilities in order to route equipment and material through these facilities to the projects. The operations decision framework was then examined on a realistic test case in the northern Eurasian region where we performed a scenario based optimization in which certain transport links may break down due to either political, environmental or other reasons, affecting both the links as well as the duration of the project schedules. The results outline the importance of taking into account the uncertainty in order to create a sustainable value generating supply chain and project scheduling methodology. Furthermore, the results indicate that while robustness is critical, the establishment of a larger number of regional distribution center facilities is not necessitated in order to maintain robustness and minimize cost. Finally, given the target completion date, the framework delivers a schedule that with almost certainty leads even in various event scenarios to an in-time schedule.</jats:p>",

For better clustering results, feature selection method is used to select variables thought to be important on model. When examined the trade and bank credit behavior of clusters that have been formed by using these variables with clustering analysis, it has been found that impact of the crisis on firms in the supply chain is important. It is found that due to demand fall for goods generated by crisis, firms are motivated to give trade credits to their customers in order not to lose them. However, firms need financial support either from the previous link in the supply chain through trade credit or from the financial institutions through bank credit.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Relevant strategies or policies can then emerge and be developed such that strategic as well as operational interventions can be prioritised across national, regional or industry level.

The parameters with the greatest influence on limiting-velocity prediction are exploited from the literature in order to present the MLP-DT-based model in this study. The effect of each parameter presented as part of functional relationships in previous studies is first surveyed by means of sensitivity analysis with the MLP-NN. After identifying the most effective parameters, the hybrid MLP-DT method is used to predict the limiting velocity. A comparison between MLP (R2 = 0.957, MARE = 0.072, RMSE = 0.434, SI = 0.107, BIAS = 0.029) and MLP-DT (R2 = 0.975, MARE = 0.063, RMSE = 0.328, SI = 0.081, BIAS = −0.01) shows that the MLP and DT combination leads to increased MLP-NN ability to predict the required limiting velocity and prevent sediment deposition.

The data collected from both the organizations were analyzed using AHP. The pair-wise comparisons of SCPs (usually, alternatives and attributes) are established using a scale indicating the strength with which one SCP dominates another with respect to higher-level SCPs. This scaling process then translated into priority weights. Once the priority weights of the elements/determinants of the module have been calculated, the presence of the corresponding element in the organization was evaluated. An evaluation rating of these elements multiplied by the established priority weights have determined the prediction weight for each SCP. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The application of this procedure is described for the institutionalization module and can be similarly extended to the other SCPs/SCM implementation modules. By establishing the prediction weight for each module, the organizations will be able to evaluate the strength of the corresponding factors present before embarking on the SCPs. The organization can identify and create awareness of the essential elements in the SCPs implementation process and identify the actions necessary before implementing SCPs. The AHP can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation, especially for medium- and large-scale organizations. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The priority weights are subjective and assigned as per the judgment of SCM managers from both the organizations. Further, the priority weights can be obtained from more industry experts through a questionnaire. Second, in this model, only ten practices are taken into consideration for successful SCPs implementation; more practices may be included in future research. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The methodological approach presented can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation in an organization.

The drinking water supply of this community (average system input volume: 20 m3/d) is based on the use of deep anaerobic groundwater with a high ammonium content of geogenic origin (up to 5 mg/l) which must be treated to prevent the formation of nitrites in the drinking water supply system. This paper describes the implementation and operation of biological nitrification despite several constraints including space availability, location and financial and manpower resources. A pilot drinking water treatment plant, including biological nitrification implemented in sand filters, was designed and constructed for a maximum treatment capacity of 1.2 m3/h. Online monitoring of selected physicochemical parameters has provided continuous treatment performance data. Treatment performance of the plant was evaluated under standard operation as well as in the case of selected malfunction events.</jats:p>",

Theoretically, the response of farmers in the supply of any agricultural commodity depends on the ruling price, price expectations and some prevailing non-economic factors evolving round the ecology and biology of agricultural production. It is on this basis that farmers respond and decide on the amount of soybean to produce in a current year using last year’s market prospects as a basis for decision thereby justifying the level of profit accruing to them. In this study, three functions (linear, semi-log and logarithm functions) were specified in the Nerlovian adaptive expectation model in the analysis of the response of soybean supply to price changes in the domestic markets in Nigeria between the period (1975-2009). The study showed that farmers’ responses were not encouraging in the production and supply of soybean in the domestic markets with respect to the dictate of prices, price expectations and price of groundnut as a chosen competitive enterprise.Keywords: Response, soybean supply, price changes, soybean market, Nigeria</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ozonation followed by a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter is a common process of advanced water purification. Ozone can generate formaldehyde (FA) as a harmful by-product, while the subsequent BAC filter is efficient at removing FA. FA adsorption is limited on activated carbon because of its hydrophilic property and low molecular weight. Thus, biological degradation by biofilms associated with the BAC is regarded as the primary treatment mechanism for FA. However, little is known about the microorganisms involved in the removal of FA. To identify specific microorganisms assimilating FA in a BAC filter, this study applied DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. DNA-SIP with NGS clearly revealed that facultative methylotrophs affiliated within the specific taxonomic groups, such as Hyphomicrobium and Methylibium, were suspected to be the key players in FA removal.</jats:p>",

The Singapore General Hospital's Theatre Sterile Supplies Unit (TSSU) has faced many challenges, including increasing demand for instruments and the need to maintain instruments of greater complexity. To address these challenges, stakeholders from key departments at Singapore General Hospital formed a multidisciplinary team to transform operations in the TSSU. The team adopted and implemented the TSSU Instrument Management System (TIMS) in three phases over five years. The project included standardizing instrument‐naming conventions, implementing electronic integration of instrument tracking in the unit, extending traceability of instruments to the major ORs, initiating integrated web‐based instrument ordering, and extending the system management of instruments at ambulatory surgery and specialized OR facilities. The implementation of TIMS has improved inventory, supply, and quality management; reduced instrument repairs; and led to savings through increased productivity and lower expenses.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this paper the effects of different drug supply chain configurations, on the resulting average stock, service level and Bullwhip effect, of the studied supply chain, is quantitatively assessed. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of an Italian district has been studied, taking into account three echelons: suppliers, central stock, and hospitals. A model of the various supply chain configurations has been created with the use of the simulation. Specifically, 24 supply chain configurations have been examined, stemming from the combination of several supply chain design parameters, namely: transshipment policies (Emergency Lateral Transshipment or Total Inventory Equalization); re-order and inventory management policies (Economic Order Quantity or Economic Order Interval); required service levels (90% or 95%); the number of available vans (one or two). For each configuration, hospital average stock, service level and a “Bullwhip effect” analysis are computed. To know which input variables are statistically significant, a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis has been executed. Findings: The output of this paper provides useful insights and suggestions to optimize the healthcare logistic and drug supply chain. According to the developed DoE analysis, it can be stated that the introduction of transshipment policies provides important improvement in terms of service and stock levels. To reduce the Bullwhip effect, which results in a service level decreasing, and in a managing stock costs increasing, it is worth to adopt an EOQ re-order policy. Practical implications: This research gives practical recommendations to the studied system, in order to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study which combination of transshipment policies, re-order/inventory management policies and required service levels, can be the best one to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level, in the specific logistic system.</jats:p>"

The research identified 83 peer‐reviewed articles through a structured review technique, which is based on a three‐stage refinement process. Data reduction procedures using codification, sentence strings and a review of keywords, title, abstract and conclusion were used in the search. The papers identified focused on organizational and supply chain agility and flexibility. The acknowledged gaps in understanding and development of agility and flexibility in supply chains were identified and categorized in terms of conceptual, contextual and methodological gaps. Subsequent to the gap analysis, this paper argues that effective relationship integration with key partners is a fundamental mechanism for mitigating the problem of control dissipation, which has hindered academic understanding with respect to development and application of agile and flexible capabilities in supply chains. The findings in this paper will help academics to gain a better understanding and to develop the concepts of supply chain agility and flexibility. In addition, the findings indicate that supply chain stakeholders need to address the issue of relationship integration when undertaking, or participating in agility and flexibility development programmes, so as to maximize supply chain performance. The paper concludes by highlighting implications for managers and researchers, and proposes a number of areas for future investigation.</jats:p>",

Primarily, these relationships relate to the natural impacts of weather and climate on the variability of the hydrological cycle. Secondary relationships exist between providers and consumers of the services. Services provided by operators of public water supply and sewerage systems are a specific segment of water services. Their sustainability is controlled on the one hand by public regulation and and on the other by a combination of economic, social, and environmental objectives and the means by which they are achieved. The aim of this paper is, based on the parameters of supply and demand, to quantify the most important aspects of sustainable management of water supply and sanitation enterprises in connection with the current model for state regulation. The methodology is based on an examination of consumer behaviour indicators which can be interpreted from ‘water bills’. The comparison of household expenditure on water services in the Czech Republic shows that some are already approaching, and even exceeding, the limit of what is considered social acceptability.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, in term of traceability systems’ characteristics, one out of three companies have a basic system in place (only regulatory compliant), while two out of three have a more sophisticated system, with many companies voluntarily tracing the material during the production process, while chain traceability appears not to be widely implemented. Finally, it is felt that the benefits of traceability outweigh the barriers/disadvantages, with the main benefits found in the area of crisis management.

Pre-hydrolysed AS (PAS) has higher molecular weight, presenting stronger water treatment performance; however, its poor stability has greatly limited its application. Therefore, there is still a need to obtain a stable PAS. In this study, a method for stabilizing PAS product was proposed and a new coagulant, phosphate-aluminum sulphate (PPAS), was prepared. The parameters affecting PPAS performance, such as n(P)/n(Al) and n(OH)/n(Al) molar ratios, and organic stabilizer dose containing a mixture of tartaric acid and sodium potassium tartrate, were examined. The coagulation–flocculation performance of PPAS was assessed by measuring source water treatment efficiency. The results showed that the PPAS at n(P)/n(Al) molar ratio of 0.15, n(OH)/n(Al) molar ratio of 0.2 and the stabilizer dose of 7.5% presented good performance and stability. PPAS was significantly distinct from AS in the morphology and species distribution, which indicated that the distribution of the Alb and Alc in PPAS largely affected the coagulation–flocculation performance, especially the Alb. The coagulation–flocculation examined at an appropriate pH was effective for source water turbidity, ultraviolet adsorption at 254 nm and total dissolved organic nitrogen removal in the investigated range.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the popular clothing market, the garment color is often an important factor in the customer’s determination of purchase. In the fast-changing fashion market, uncertain demand, low predictability and other factors may cause panic buying. Hence, the postponement of clothing dyeing in supply chain management is an important production method for success in the modern clothing fashion market. This study used simulation software to build two virtual clothing supply chain models of cloth dyeing and postponement of clothing dyeing of clothing industry. Moreover, it imported the data of actual factories into the two models for simulation; different situations of output, productivity and delivery date are simulated in multi-color clothing throughput using the same equipment. The postponement of clothing dyeing is applicable to clothing products with changing colors and with slight change in clothing style, whereas the cloth dyeing is applicable to clothing products with uncertain clothing style and slight change in color. The postponement of clothing dyeing is better than the cloth dyeing production mode in the situation of diversified colors and inaccurate forecasting of production. In terms of multi-color inventory carrying cost, the production inventory and carrying cost of postponement of clothing dyeing are lower than cloth dyeing. Therefore, for the changing market, the postponement of clothing dyeing is characterized by low inventory, low carrying cost and low risk. This study provides the forecast management situation for the clothing industries to use capable production modes for clothing manufacturing supply chain. </jats:p>",

Strong visualization is also fundamental to end‐result conveyance and audience interpretation. But how can one ensure that strength? How can one avoid developing representations that are marginal in value, or worse misleading? In this paper, I will discuss theory, evidence, and practical approaches to managing data visualization development, viewing data visualization not simply as an outcome but as a continuous process and facet of organizational culture.</jats:p>",

Such an investigation is important in assessing the role of trade in compensating for domestic shocks. If shortages lead economies to impose trade restrictions, then trade may not be allowed to play an important role in stabilizing consumption. The existing literature has highlighted the importance of these policy shocks in the world rice market and how they have worked to increase the volatility of prices and trade flows. Although trade cannot be expected to play a strong role when the major producing and consuming economies are simultaneously hit by negative yield shocks, such a scenario has occurred in only about 3% of all observed cases. We also find that consumption fails to stabilize even when domestic shocks are negative and foreign shocks are positive; however, imports do peak. Thus, while trade does help in coping with domestic risks, it is unable to achieve full risk sharing. Therefore, no matter the nature of foreign shocks, the principal concern is to stabilize consumption when an economy is hit by negative domestic yield shocks. The frequency of such shocks is about 12% in all observed cases, highlighting the importance of domestic responses. We find that domestic rice stocks have been important in stabilizing consumption. The reliance on domestic policies has, in turn, kept the rice market thin. </jats:p>",

Plus précisément, elle porte sur la phase de pré-adoption, c’est-à-dire l’émergence de l’idée d’un tel système et l’évaluation de son besoin pour l’organisation, en amont de considérations technologiques. La question de recherche est la suivante : quels sont les motivations et les freins qui influencent la pré-adoption d’un SI de VS ? L’objectif est ainsi de contribuer à enrichir les connaissances sur un sujet qui a été peu abordé dans la littérature. L’originalité de l’article est de mobiliser les travaux sur les processus porteurs de changements institutionnels isomorphiques du cadre néo-institutionnel pour étudier la pré-adoption dans le champ de la VS. Sur la base d’une démarche multi-méthodes, qui combine étude exploratoire qualitative et quantitative, dans le contexte spécifique de la logistique durable (LD), nos résultats révèlent 31 motivations et freins à la pré-adoption d’un SI de VS, dont dix nouveaux, et cinq types de pressions. Ils suggèrent ainsi que la pré-adoption d’un SI de VS peut être soumise à la fois à des pressions fonctionnelles et institutionnelles. Elle peut être motivée par des objectifs de compétitivité et de mimétisme, et freinée par des objectifs de performance et par l’absence de pressions coercitives. Ces résultats questionnent finalement la compréhension par les entreprises du caractère stratégique du SI de VS, ainsi que le rôle et la responsabilité de l’Etat dans le développement de la LD et l’adoption de SI de VS dans le contexte de la LD.</jats:p>",

When performances of these services are not measured, efforts to improve these services remain directionless and arbitrary. Urban water supplies in India, therefore, suffer a self‐inflicted fate, wherein city municipalities remain mired in mundane issues, leading to large dissatisfaction and inefficiencies. This paper attempts to evolve a framework for evaluating cost efficiencies of water supply services and applies stochastic frontier analysis to 18 urban centres in India through six models. The results indicate large relative inefficiencies and a scope of savings of 24.5% of average current operating and maintenance costs even with existing levels of resource inputs. The results are discussed from a regulatory and policy‐making perspective.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The continental shelf adjacent to the Río de la Plata (RdlP) exhibits extremely complex hydrographic and ecological characteristics which are of great socioeconomic importance. Since the long-term environmental variations related to the atmospheric (wind fields), hydrologic (freshwater plume), and oceanographic (currents and fronts) regimes are little known, the aim of this study is to reconstruct the changes in the terrigenous input into the inner continental shelf during the late Holocene period (associated with the RdlP sediment discharge) and to unravel the climatic forcing mechanisms behind them. To achieve this, we retrieved a 10 m long sediment core from the RdlP mud depocenter at 57 m water depth (GeoB 13813-4). The radiocarbon age control indicated an extremely high sedimentation rate of 0.8 cm per year, encompassing the past 1200 years (AD 750–2000). We used element ratios (Ti  / Ca, Fe / Ca, Ti / Al, Fe / K) as regional proxies for the fluvial input signal and the variations in relative abundance of salinity-indicative diatom groups (freshwater versus marine-brackish) to assess the variability in terrigenous freshwater and sediment discharges. Ti / Ca, Fe / Ca, Ti /  Al, Fe /  K and the freshwater diatom group showed the lowest values between AD 850 and 1300, while the highest values occurred between AD 1300 and 1850.  The variations in the sedimentary record can be attributed to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA), both of which had a significant impact on rainfall and wind patterns over the region. During the MCA, a weakening of the South American summer monsoon system (SAMS) and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), could explain the lowest element ratios (indicative of a lower terrigenous input) and a marine-dominated diatom record, both indicative of a reduced RdlP freshwater plume. In contrast, during the LIA, a strengthening of SAMS and SACZ may have led to an expansion of the RdlP river plume to the far north, as indicated by higher element ratios and a marked freshwater diatom signal. Furthermore, a possible multidecadal oscillation probably associated with Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) since AD 1300 reflects the variability in both the SAMS and SACZ systems.\n                    </jats:p>"

However, native hypoxic tumoural microenvironment and lacking oxygen supply are the major barriers hindering photodynamic reactions. To solve this problem, we have developed biomimetic artificial red cells by loading complexes of oxygen-carrier (hemoglobin) and photosensitizer (indocyanine green) for boosted photodynamic strategy. Such nanosystem provides a coupling structure with stable self-oxygen supply and acting as an ideal fluorescent/photoacoustic imaging probe, dynamically monitoring the nanoparticle biodistribution and the treatment of PDT. Upon exposure to near-infrared laser, the remote-triggered photosensitizer generates massive cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) with sufficient oxygen supply. Importantly, hemoglobin is simultaneously oxidized into the more active and resident ferryl-hemoglobin leading to persistent cytotoxicity. ROS and ferryl-hemoglobin synergistically trigger the oxidative damage of xenograft tumour resulting in complete suppression. The artificial red cells with self-monitoring and boosted photodynamic efficacy could serve as a versatile theranostic platform.</jats:p>"

Our results support a contagion effect as American-brand automakers experience negative stock reactions when a competitor announces disruptions. The contagion is more pronounced for American-brand automakers in bear markets when disruptions are announced by Japanese-brand automakers.

In this study, three hybrid stochastic models (Markov chain model, unbiased Grey-Markov model and Markov model based on quadratic programming) were developed separately for predicating the available water resources, water demand, and water utilization structure in Urumqi. The novelty of this study arises from the following aspects: (1) compared with other models, the developed models would provide ideal forecasting results with small samples and poor information; (2) this study synthetically took into account water supply and demand, water utilization structure trend; (3) the prediction results were expressed as interval values for reducing the forecasting risk when carrying out water resources system planning and operational decisions. Analysis of water supply and demand in Urumqi under different reuse ratios was also conducted based on the forecasting results. The results would help managers and policy-makers to have a clear understanding of regional water supply and demand trend as well as the water utilization structure in the future.</jats:p>",

We show that while supply managers must consider local development, they cannot lose sight of efficiency in delivering on other objectives. The multifaceted nature of supply, which includes sponsorship, value in kind, and so forth, requires specific supply management approaches for each stage of the OG management lifecycle. Specifically, supply management differs from other business contexts in three main areas: (a) supplier identification and selection; (b) contract negotiation and the process of acquiring goods; (c) supplier relationship management.

With an integrated soft strain gauge and water supply mechanism (WSM), the surface strain of the actuator can be sensed in situ, and providing a continuous water supply maintains the water content inside the IPMC for long-term operation in air. The actuator was fabricated using a micromachining technique and plated with a nickel electrode. The device performance was experimentally characterized and compared with an actuator without a WSM. A large displacement of 1.5 mm was achieved for a 6 mm-long prong with 7-V dc actuation applied for 30 s. The measured current was analyzed using an electrochemical model. The results revealed that the faradaic current plays a crucial role during operation, particularly after 10 s. The measured strain confirms both the bending and axial strain generation during the open-and-close motion of the actuator prongs. Most of the water loss during device operation was due to evaporation rather than hydrolysis. The constructed WSM effectively maintained the water content inside the IPMC for long-term continuous operation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Inventory decisions made at a centralized level often rely on demand forecast information passed from regional managers within a supply chain. Such managers often have unique insights into the demand patterns at their local sites that can help inform how much inventory to order for the system as a whole. Problems can arise with this setup, however, if these managers have incentives to misreport their forecasts and the central planner (CP), in turn, mistrusts this information. The goal of our research is to shed light on the existence, magnitude, and causes of such coordination problems using a combination of analytical models and behavioral experiments. The analytical analysis reveals that incentives are misaligned in this setting and no truth‐telling equilibrium exists in general, unless inventory competition or demand uncertainty is removed. With this theoretical grounding, we conduct a series of controlled laboratory experiments to test the magnitude of these problems and how they are impacted by inventory competition, strategic concerns regarding the other parties, and the demand environment. We find that inventory competition and market uncertainty harm the efficacy of forecast sharing and channel efficiency, while the possibility that untrustworthy reports are detected (identical local demand information) does not deter regional managers from misreporting their forecasts. Removing strategic concerns regarding the CP (automating the central ordering decision) does not improve profit but reduces order variability. Information sharing appears to be a dominant policy as it significantly improves profit in all treatments compared with no information sharing. </jats:p>",

Experimental results and Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that the pre-halo germanium pre-amorphization implant used to contain the short channel effects contribute to GIDL at the drain sidewall in addition to GIDL due to BTBT in SiGe devices. The results are validated by comparing the experimental observations with the numerical simulation and a set of calibrated models are used to describe the GIDL mechanisms for various drain and gate bias.</jats:p>",

In the absence of coordinated global regulatory regimes, it has also made multinational corporations (MNCs) impervious to social concerns in the countries where they operate. There is considerable debate in the academic, political, and business arena as to the causes of the apparently inequitable distribution of benefits between labor and capital. Notwithstanding, the relative merits of this debate, and facing tremendous societal pressure, companies have adopted voluntary codes of conduct to ensure that workers making products for them in poor and developing countries are protected from hazardous working conditions and receive wages that meet local laws and market conditions. These codes, however, suffer from a lack of credibility and proof of substantive compliance. A new type of nongovernmental organization (NGO) has emerged that monitors a company's compliance with prespecified standards and provides assurance to the external stakeholders that the company has fulfilled its voluntary obligations. From an historical perspective, this has been an innovative phenomenon where the monitoring organization purports to act as an honest broker to ensure all concerned that the company/industry has fulfilled its obligations. In this article, we undertake a thorough examination of two such organizations, that is, Fair Labor Association, and Social Accountability International, that have played a pioneering role in bridging the gap between societal expectations and corporate performance. We examine their governance structures, operating procedures, monitoring standards, and public disclosure of findings, and above all, their success in improving the level of corporate compliance with their self‐created codes or standards. Unfortunately, our findings and conclusions are disappointing. In our view, the two groups have mostly failed to meet their avowed goals. Rather than using their NGO status to help companies improve their code compliance, they have suffered from managerial capture and have been reduced to corporate apologists.</jats:p>",

Rechargeable batteries are commonly used to store this energy; however, because of the limited number of charge/discharge cycles, they need to be periodically replaced. A supercapacitor, which has, ideally, a limitless number of charge/discharge cycles, avoids this problem. In this case, it is required for the power management unit to produce a constant output voltage as the supercapacitor discharges. This paper presents a system with a multiratio switched capacitor DC–DC converter, in a 130‐nm technology, with a maximum output power of 2 mW, a maximum efficiency of 79.63% and a maximum output ripple, in the steady state, of 23 mV for an input voltage range of 2.3–0.87 V. The proposed converter has four operation states, to maximize its efficiency, that correspond to the conversion ratios of 1/2, 2/3, 1/1 and 3/2. Its clock frequency is automatically adjusted to produce a stable output voltage of 1 V. These features are implemented through two distinct controller circuits that use two asynchronous time machines to dynamically adjust the clock frequency and to select the active state of the converter. All the theoretical expressions as well as the behaviour of the whole system were verified by using electrical simulations. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Logging residues, which refer to the unused portions of trees cut during logging, are important sources of biomass for the emerging biofuel industry and are critical feedstocks for the first-type biofuel facilities (e.g., corn-ethanol facilities). Logging residues are under-utilized sources of biomass for energetic purposes. To support the scaling-up of the bioenergy industry, it is essential to design cost-effective biofuel supply chains that not only minimize costs, but also consider the biomass quality characteristics. The biomass quality is heavily dependent upon the moisture and the ash contents. Ignoring the biomass quality characteristics and its intrinsic costs may yield substantial economic losses that will only be discovered after operations at a biorefinery have begun. This paper proposes a novel bioenergy supply chain network design model that minimizes operational costs and includes the biomass quality-related costs. The proposed model is unique in the sense that it supports decisions where quality is not unrealistically assumed to be perfect. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is proven by assessing a case study in the state of Tennessee, USA. The results demonstrate that the ash and moisture contents of logging residues affect the performance of the supply chain (in monetary terms). Higher-than-target moisture and ash contents incur in additional quality-related costs. The quality-related costs in the optimal solution (with final ash content of 1% and final moisture of 50%) account for 27% of overall supply chain cost. Based on the numeral experimentation, the total supply chain cost increased 7%, on average, for each additional percent in the final ash content.</jats:p>"

However, most studies in temperate and boreal forests have focused on the effects of N addition on tree growth. By comparison, less is known about the effects of N availability on the cycling of C in understory vegetation despite some evidence that dwarf shrubs, mosses, and lichens play an important role in the forest C balance. In this study, we used an <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> pulse‐labeling technique to examine the short‐term dynamics of C partitioning in understory vegetation in three boreal <jats:italic>Pinus sylvestris</jats:italic> forest stands exposed to different rates of N addition: a low and high N addition that receive annual additions of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NH</jats:styled-content><jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NO</jats:styled-content><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> of 20 and 100 kg N/ha, respectively, and an unfertilized control. Labeling was conducted at two distinct periods (early vs. late growing season), which provided a seasonal picture of how N addition affects C dynamics in understory vegetation. In contrast to what has been found in trees, there was no obvious trend in belowground C partitioning in ericaceous plants in response to N additions or seasonality. Increasing N addition led to a greater percentage of <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C being incorporated into ericaceous leaves with a high turnover, whereas high rates of N addition strongly reduced the incorporation of <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C into less degradable moss tissues. Addition of N also resulted in a greater percentage of the <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C label being respired back to the atmosphere and an overall reduction in total understory carbon use efficiency. Taken together, our results suggest a faster cycling of C in understory vegetation with increasing N additions; yet the magnitude of this general response was strongly dependent on the amount of N added and varied seasonally. These results provide some of the first <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> C and N partitioning estimates for plants growing under the complex web of resource limitations in the boreal understory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In the eastern Pacific, lithogenic input to the ocean responds to variations in the atmospheric and oceanic system and their teleconnections over different timescales. Atmospheric (e.g., wind fields), hydrological (e.g., fresh water plumes) and oceanic (e.g., currents) conditions determine the transport mode and the amount of lithogenic material transported from the continent to the continental shelf. Here, we present the grain size distribution of a composite record of two laminated sediment cores retrieved from the Peruvian continental shelf that record the last ∼ 1000 years at a sub-decadal to centennial time-series resolution. We propose novel grain size indicators of wind intensity and fluvial input that allow reconstructing the oceanic–atmospheric variability modulated by sub-decadal to centennial changes in climatic conditions. Four grain size modes were identified. Two are linked to aeolian inputs (M3: ∼ 54; M4: ∼ 91 µm on average), the third is interpreted as a marker of sediment discharge (M2: ∼ 10 µm on average), and the last is without an associated origin (M1: ∼ 3 µm). The coarsest components (M3 and M4) dominated during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Current Warm Period (CWP) periods, suggesting that aeolian transport increased as a consequence of surface wind stress intensification. In contrast, M2 displays an opposite behavior, exhibiting an increase in fluvial terrigenous input during the Little Ice Age (LIA) in response to more humid conditions associated with El Niño-like conditions. Comparison with other South American paleoclimate records indicates that the observed changes are driven by interactions between meridional displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the South Pacific Subtropical High (SPSH) and Walker circulation at decadal and centennial timescales.\n                    </jats:p>"

The primary goal behind analytic formulation is to investigate the differences between the two financing systems and determine which one performs better, and to examine the impact of target recycling rate and competition between recycling alliances (RAs) on channel decisions. We find that the PAYT system is always more beneficial to customers and the retailer, while the RF system increases the social welfare. If there is no competition between RAs, which system performs better for the RA depends on the baseline of subsidy fee, while which system performs better for manufacturers depends on their shares. However, if there is competition between RAs, the RF system is favored by the disadvantaged RA. Moreover, the restriction on target recycling rate has an effect on channel decisions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study presents a multi‐methodological approach to investigate buyer behavior in quality‐dominated multi‐sourcing recyclable‐material procurement of green supply chains. This work hypothesizes the correlations between buyer perceptions of supply and relational quality, quality attitude, psychological benefits, and willingness to pay. This is followed by conducting a normative analysis, where the postulated hypotheses are incorporated into a buyer behavior model which characterizes buyer decisions regarding multi‐supplier selection and price negotiations using multinomial logit model and Nash bargaining game theory. Through an empirical study, this work demonstrates that the proposed buyer behavior theory and hypotheses hold, and upport the analytical results yielded from the normative analysis. Analytical results indicate that supply‐ and relationship‐quality positively affect buyer quality attitude in the rational and affective cognition domains, and thus jointly determine buyer decisions regarding supplier selection and price negotiations in multiple sourcing green procurement. Nevertheless, the aforementioned effects are moderated by buyer psychological benefits. Additionally, this study demonstrates a phenomenon known as “buyer's supply surplus”, which articulates the negative effect of buyer attitude towards channel relationship quality on willingness to pay. This can also rationalize why a buyer favors choosing suppliers with superior relational quality for the achievement of lower negotiated prices. </jats:p>",

The traditional solutions have several problems, such as the uncontrolled duty ratio, the poor cross-regulation capability and low reliability. In order to solve these problems, a quasi-single-stage solution employing the double resonant tank LLC topology is proposed and developed in this paper. The proposed solution can increase significantly the overall conversion efficiency because of the achieved soft-switching over the entire operation range. Moreover, the low input current ripple, high magnetic utilization and high reliability can be achieved. Experimental results of a 210-W laboratory prototype with 220–380[Formula: see text]V input and four outputs are presented to demonstrate the declared features. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile, it also focuses on the simultaneous disruption on one node or a number of nodes, simultaneous disruption in one chain or a number of chains and the corresponding mathematical models and exemplification in relation to numerous manufacturing centers and diverse products. Robustness of the design of the supply chain network is examined by weighing efficiency against robustness during supply chain disruptions. Efficiency is represented by operating cost; robustness is indicated by the expected disruption cost and the weighing issue is calculated by the multi-objective firefly algorithm for consistency in the results. It has been shown that the total cost achieved by the optimal target function is lower than that at the most effective time of supply chains. In other words, the decrease of expected disruption cost by improving robustness in supply chains is greater than the increase of operating cost by reducing efficiency, thus leading to cost advantage. Consequently, by approximating the Pareto Front Chart of weighing between efficiency and robustness, enterprises can choose appropriate efficiency and robustness for their longer-term development.</jats:p>"

This study examines the role of buyer power in supplier motivation to share knowledge. Applying a multi‐method, sequential research design, case studies followed by a scenario‐based experiment, we find buyer expert power increases supplier motivation to share, while the use of coercive power decreases this motivation. We also find that supplier dependence has a contingent effect; when dependence is high, the effects of buyer expert power and use of coercive power on motivation are weakened. The study makes three key contributions. First, it begins to address the largely unanswered question of supplier motivation to share knowledge and, more specifically, how supplier dependence and buyer use of power impact this motivation. Second, by studying both the direct and interactive effects of power structure (dependence) and power use, the research enriches understanding of the power‐influence process. Third, by adopting a research design that combines case studies and experiments, it provides a novel example of multi‐method research in POM. </jats:p>",

The mathematic model of the new system is built by power transformation analysis. The compensation currents of the PFC are calculated based on the power balance principle. According to the power quality standard in China, the optimised partial compensation algorithm is presented to replace the existing full compensation one. Moreover, the capacity of the PFC adopting the proposed algorithm is much less than those in the previous studies with the same outcome.

One‐dimensional empirical heat and mass transfer correlations are unreliably for deposition modeling in stratified flow, due to non‐uniform deposit across the pipe circumference. A mathematical model has been developed to predict the deposit thickness and the wax fraction of deposit in oil/gas stratified pipe flow using a unidirectional flow analysis of non‐isothermal hydrodynamics and heat/mass transfer. The predictions for wax deposition are found to compare satisfactorily with experimental data with three different oils for single phase and oil/gas stratified pipe flow. In particular, the reason that the deposit forming a crescent shape at the cross section of pipe observed in different experiments is revealed, based on the non‐uniform circumferential distributions of two most important parameters for the wax deposition, diffusivity at oil–deposit interface, and the solubility gradient at the oil–deposit interface at different time. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 62: 2550–2562, 2016</jats:p>",

In summary, recent studies provide strong support that substrate limitation is a powerful therapeutic strategy to effectively, and safely, starve cancer cells to death.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Overhead high voltage power line (HVPL) online monitoring equipment is playing an increasingly important role in smart grids, but the power supply is an obstacle to such systems’ stable and safe operation, so in this work a hybrid wireless power supply system, integrated with inductive energy harvesting and wireless power transmitting, is proposed. The energy harvesting device extracts energy from the HVPL and transfers that from the power line to monitoring equipment on transmission towers by transmitting and receiving coils, which are in a magnetically coupled resonant configuration. In this paper, the optimization design of online energy harvesting devices is analyzed emphatically by taking both HVPL insulation distance and wireless power supply efficiency into account. It is found that essential parameters contributing to more extracted energy include large core inner radius, core radial thickness, core height and small core gap within the threshold constraints. In addition, there is an optimal secondary coil turn that can maximize extracted energy when other parameters remain fixed. A simple and flexible control strategy is then introduced to limit power fluctuations caused by current variations. The optimization methods are finally verified experimentally.</jats:p>"

As <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content> entails high energy demands, particularly during the rapid juvenile growth phase, food supply may play a key role in the response of marine organisms to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content>. We experimentally evaluated the role of food supply in modulating physiological responses and biomineralization processes in juveniles of the Chilean scallop, <jats:italic>Argopecten purpuratus,</jats:italic> that were exposed to control (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content> ~ 8.0) and low <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content> (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content> ~ 7.6) conditions using three food supply treatments (high, intermediate, and low). We found that <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content> and food levels had additive effects on the physiological response of the juvenile scallops. Metabolic rates, shell growth, net calcification, and ingestion rates increased significantly at low <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content> conditions, independent of food. These physiological responses increased significantly in organisms exposed to intermediate and high levels of food supply. Hence, food supply seems to play a major role modulating organismal response by providing the energetic means to bolster the physiological response of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content> stress. On the contrary, the relative expression of chitin synthase, a functional molecule for biomineralization, increased significantly in scallops exposed to low food supply and low <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content>, which resulted in a thicker periostracum enriched with chitin polysaccharides. Under reduced food and low <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">pH</jats:styled-content> conditions, the adaptive organismal response was to trade‐off growth for the expression of biomineralization molecules and altering of the organic composition of shell periostracum, suggesting that the future performance of these calcifiers will depend on the trajectories of both <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content> and food supply. Thus, incorporating a suite of traits and multiple stressors in future studies of the adaptive organismal response may provide key insights on <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content> impacts on marine calcifiers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, increasing interests have arisen in adding product value through the provision of service. This study considers the problem in which a demand‐enhancing service can be provided by different supply chain parties, resulting in four alternative service channels: (a) manufacturer undertaking service, namely M‐channel, (b) retailer undertaking service, namely R‐channel, (c) manufacturer outsourcing service to third‐party (3P), namely M‐3P‐channel, and (d) retailer outsourcing service to 3P, namely R‐3P‐channel. We quantitatively model these service channels and derive the optimal decisions with the following observations: When the service costs are equal for the different parties, there is a conflict in service channel choice since both the manufacturer and the retailer prefer to undertake the service or hire the 3P by themselves, although M‐channel generates the highest market demand and system profit; When the service costs are different among these parties, R‐channel and 3P‐channels are more preferable if the service cost is less sensitive to the service level and if the market demand is more sensitive to the service level. We also conduct an empirical study to test some of the insights developed from the analytical models; our empirical findings support the analytical results. </jats:p>",
