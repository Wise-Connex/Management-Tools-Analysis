Yet often the effectiveness of the supply chain is overlooked and opportunities for improvement to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), cash and growth remain hidden. Continuous maturing of the supply chain can transform it into a competitive weapon for driving continuous improvement in EBITDA, cash release and growth. This effort begins with understanding existing performance and managing the complexity of the many demands, and big data/analytics plays a major role in providing detailed insights. In addition, mature supply chains are marked by cross-functional team interaction and focused governance of ongoing performance; the supplier community must also be fully engaged and seen as a key asset that must be actively managed. Ultimately a higher level of maturity is vital to achieving sustainable improvements. Finding ways to accelerate advancement in maturity is one of the most powerful ways to transform the supply chain into a competitive weapon.</jats:p>"

Small to mid-size companies may not have the resources to operate available software tools; however, this analysis remains critical to their success. This paper discusses Knape &amp; Vogt Manufacturing’s solution to managing its supply chain data. The solution was the creation of a commodity matrix that allows for data from multiple sources to be combined for analysis in key areas. By evaluating the supply base, the company is able to better understand the division of spend within a commodity and begin work to mitigate risk within a commodity supply base. Evaluating suppliers on a macro level provided the ability to make more informed sourcing decisions and identify opportunities for supplier improvement. Furthermore, it provided the ability to review the supply chain at a part level to work to resolve identified issues and develop cost savings opportunities. This micro level of evaluation included analysis of lead time, minimum order quantities (MOQ), economic order quantities (EOQ), safety stock, price breaks and total cost of ownership (TCO) calculations. As a final component to the commodity matrix, a quote evaluation tool was created to bring consistency in how suppliers are being evaluated through the organisation. The commodity matrix resulted in the ability to easily apply the fundamental principles of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

It combines Business process management (BPM), Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR), and the Root cause analysis tree diagram. The chosen case study is the electricity SCC, especially the business process 'management of electricity for residential buildings' of the Moroccan electricity SSC. The paper shows that the suggested approach identifies the discontinuity causes for the studied SSC, improves the business process behavior and manages its control by providing a dashboard that encompasses KPIs for periodically controlling of the SSC \"to-be\" state.</jats:p>"

It focuses on five business processes namely Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, and Return. There are 45 KPIs grouped into 5 main KPI attributes: Reliability, Responsiveness, Agility, Cost, and Asset Management. In order to get a more precise performance value, then weighted by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The final value is obtained from the multiplication of the value of performance by the weight of importance. This study was conducted by taking a case study at one of the sugar company in Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the supply chain performance of the sugar company is in a good category with the final grade of 70.94 from the 0-100 scale. Value of each process consecutively as follows: Plan 18.47, Source 16.12, Make 10.73, Deliver 10.79, and Return 7.1. Some recommendations are given to the company for evaluation and refinement focused on low business process values.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current state of water supply in Ukraine was analyzed and the main problems that arise on the existing water supply systems, related to the lack of efficiency of both water treatment technologies and operation conditions of the water supply system structures, characterized by high energy consumption, excess pressure formation and accident rate increase were studied. It was specified that in agricultural water supply systems additional difficulties can arise due to significant fluctuations of water consumption during the day, therefore, there is a need for the study of the joint work of interacting structures, especially in the towerless schemes. It is shown that to solve the problems of reliable provision of consumers with the required water amounts, water pressures and water quality, is possible taking into account the requirements of economy, reliability and environmental safety, and to identify weaknesses and develop recommendations for ensuring the efficient operation of structures can be fulfilled by mathematical modeling and analysis of various possible variants of system operation. The issue of increasing the efficiency and reliability of agricultural supply systems was considered using the example of the water supply system in Tarasivka village of Kyiv region. The article deals with increasing the efficiency and reliability of agricultural water supply systems. The results of the study of water supply systems operation, based on the utilization of ground water in the village of Tarasivka, Kyiv region are given, which demonstrate that when pumping water from the well directly into the water supply network, excess damage energy for water lift occurs. The reliability of the water supply system, when pumping water from the well, was analyzed and the measures to ensure cost-effective and reliable operation of water supply structures while reducing the specific costs of electricity for supplying water to consumers and improving its quality were proposed.</jats:p>"

Moreover, the current needs of an out most efficient supply chain within this global and highly competitive world, has set the incorporation of the Industry 4.0 into its structure as a crucial element. The aim of the authors is to examine the progress and identify any research gaps with relevance to scholarly outcomes on Industry 4.0 within the framework of the supply chain. Thus, the authors have systematically reviewed the articles regarding the topic that were published from 2013 and onwards. In this paper, the obtained results from both the generic analysis (e.g. year of publication, subject areas) and the specific one corresponding to four subject areas and the three levels of Industry 4.0 are presented, which can be used as a base for future research agenda in related topics.  </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>To attain an ongoing electricity economy, developing novel widespread electricity supply systems based on diverse energy resources are critically important. Several photovoltaic (PV) technologies exist, which cause various pathways to produce electricity from solar energy. This paper evaluates the competition between three influential solar technologies based on photovoltaic technique to find the optimal pathways for satisfying the electricity demand: (1) multicrystalline silicon; (2) copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS); and (3) multijunction. Besides the technical factors, there are other effective parameters such as cost, operability, feasibility, and capacity that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as optimal and viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, a generic optimization-based model was developed for the longrange energy planning and design of future electricity supply system from solar energy. By applying dynamic programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying the optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives. The features and capabilities of the model were shown through application to Iran as a case study.</p>"

Therefore, this study proposes centralized and decentralized versions of the game, comparing their solutions under static and dynamic settings. Moreover, it investigates the decentralized supply chain by evaluating two smart contracts: Revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts. In both cases, the firms use an artificial intelligence system to determine the optimal contract parameters. Numerical and qualitative analyses are used for comparing configurations (centralized, decentralized), settings (static, dynamic), and contract schemes (revenue sharing contract, wholesale price contract). The findings identify the conditions under which smart revenue sharing mechanisms are worth applying.</jats:p>"

However, the technology uncertainty associated with the supplier’s development capability may become a considerable obstacle to new product development projects. In this paper, we further develop an analytical model that has been widely applied in the economics literature and examine two representative supply chain contracts, a revenue-sharing contract and a cost-sharing contract, for new product development through upstream innovation under technology uncertainty. We confirm that the supplier’s development capability has a significant impact on contract feasibility. The revenue-sharing contract helps to attain a higher new product quality level and profit for the supply chain. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between a manufacturer and a supplier concerning the performance of the new product development project. Adopting a Nash bargaining model, we analyze the two supply chain contracts under a cooperative relationship in which the manufacturer and supplier cooperatively determine the sharing portion of the revenue or cost. For both contracts, compared with the unilateral relationship, the cooperative relationship leads to a lower manufacturer profit, but a higher new product quality and a higher supply chain profit.</jats:p>"

This can effectively relieve water supply and demand conflicts in regions with water resource reserves shortages. However, building inter-basin water diversion projects obviously reduces the inflow from upstream, leading to increasingly conspicuous conflicts between water diversion outside a basin and water utilization inside the basin. To relieve this conflict and explore the optimal scheme of water resource allocation across river basins, this paper chooses the Middle Route Project of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project on the Hanjiang River as a case study. A water supply scheduling model of Danjiangkou Reservoir is built using an integrated inter-basin diversion draw water reservoir regulation (IDR) model to balance multiple conflicting water demands. In the IDR model there are two types of objective sets: aggregate indicators and process matching degree functions. Moreover, six evaluation indexes are selected to analyze the water resource allocation effect of the optimal scheme. The simulation results indicate that the proposed IDR model in this paper is practicable and efficient for water resource allocation across river basins.</jats:p>",

In the Nile Basin especially, a region notorious for its poverty, violent instability and lack of industrialisation, states have invested their scarce resources and political capital in a “hydraulic mission” in the belief that they can engineer their way out of international marginalization. Incumbents have bet on large-scale hydro-infrastructure and capital-intensive agriculture to boost food production, strengthen energy security, and deal with water scarcity, despite the woeful track-record of such a supply-side approach to development.</p>\n               <p>While ruling elites in the Nile Basin have portrayed the hydraulic mission as the natural way of developing the region’s resources—supposedly validated by the historical achievements of Pharaonic civilization and its mastery over its tough environment—this is a modern fiction, spun to justify politically expedient projects and the exclusion of broad layers of the population. In the last two hundred years, the hydraulic mission has made three major political contributions that underline its strategic usefulness to centralizing elites: it has enabled the building of modern states and a growing bureaucratic apparatus around a riverain political economy; it has generated new national narratives that have allowed unpopular regimes to rebrand themselves as protectors of the nation; and it has facilitated the forging of external alliances, linking the resources and elites of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan to global markets and centers of influence. Mega-dams, huge canals and irrigation for export are fundamentally about power and the powerful—and the privileging of some interests and social formations over others. The one-sided focus on increasing supply—based on the false premise that this will allow ordinary people to access more food and water—transfers control over livelihoods from one (broad) group of people to (a much narrower) other one by legitimizing top-down interventionism and dislocation. What presents itself as a strategy of water resources and agricultural development is really about (re)constructing hierarchies between people. The mirage of supply-side development continues to seduce elites at the helm of the state because it keeps them in power and others out of it.</p>"

The results showed that the supply chain of broiler egg commodities (layer) in Bungo District had a fairly clear market target, however there was a development target that had to be done in the form of increasing the number of cages and scale of livestock business in increasing production and increasing the quality of the commodity of broiler eggs (layer). The implementation of supply chain management is going well. In addition, government support in the Bungo Regency previously only focused on physical facilities. The supply chain relationship structure consists of layer broiler breeders, PPP, PPB, agents / distributors, PP, and end consumers. Supply chain resources, especially physical and technological resources in Bungo Regency are still simple. The supply chain business process runs well because the flow of products, finances, and information runs smoothly and is well integrated. Keywords: supply chain; egg; laying hens</jats:p>"

GSCM are tested at the second-order construct reflective level and first-order reflective level. Linkages between variables in this study were identified through quantitative explanatory research techniques by testing hypotheses. Non-probability sampling through purposive sampling method from 77 respondents is carried out directly in the two main sectors. The results showed that all hypotheses had a significant effect. Internal environmental orientation and external environmental orientation have a significant effect on GSCM. Interestingly, environmental orientation has become an important predictor affecting the application of GSCM in the hospitality and tourism sector in West Sumatra.</jats:p>",

Global\nsupply chains need worldwide goals, and the key to the success of Green Supply Chain Management is\nto bring the worldwide industry together to decide upon and pledge to work towards reasonable and concrete goals that will\nmake a real difference to the environment. Customers are increasingly demanding to know where products come from, how\nthey are made and distributed and what impact future environmental legislations will have on the products they buy. The aim of\nthis paper is to provide action plans and facilitate knowledge among supply chain practitioner that they need to go green the\nbusiness efciently, and communicate these efforts to their customers, partners, and the public. In fact, the paper discusses the\nkey drivers for green initiatives include government compliance, improved customer and public relations, a decreased fuel bill\nand nancial ROI through various supply chain initiatives such as reverse logistics. Further, increasing supply chain efciency,\nimproving investor relations, decreasing risk and a larger corporate responsibility agenda are identied as important factors\nin the strategic decision to go green. Companies working in India are not properly addressing these measures in supply chain\ndesign and operations. That is why, the paper further elaborates strategic management of green supply chain, which involves\ncollecting and analyzing environmental regulations and customer concerns, discussing the relevant environmental issues with\nthe procurement, manufacturing and quality control departments across the supply chain rms and nally developing and\ncommunicating the green supply chain policies to all members of the supply chain i.e. supplier's supplier to customer's\ncustomer.</jats:p>",

The main directions of efficiency of SCM implementation are highlighted: increase of the number of orders and increase of stability of demand; decrease in insurance stocks; reducing risks and improving the reliability of plans and deliveries. It is suggested to consider the main indicators of evaluation of the supply chain performance by the basic processes of the supply chain according to the SCOR model: planning, inventory purchase, production, sales, returns. For each group of indicators, indices of growth and decline are highlighted separately. An integrated metric of supply chain performance evaluation is proposed. Separation of quantitative and qualitative indicators of evaluation is emphasized. The factors for qualitative evaluation are selected: reliability of the logistics supply chain; fulfillment of conditions for the term of fulfillment on the whole supply chain; level of service; cost control; the interconnection of the logistics process with the sales planning process; loyalty of suppliers. The suggested directions for improving the efficiency of the supply chain are: improving the clarity in the supply chain; competence development; investment in intellectual technologies; developing a project plan.</jats:p>"

Special attention is paid to the study of previous work, to the mechanism of providing rehabilitation services to all servicemen. In the context of the current tasks, the legal base on this issue, the approved and priority initiatives was investigated. The most frequent distribution among the demobilized soldiers of antiterrorist operation is occupied by people with the main characteristics of post-traumatic stress disorder. The percentage correlation with such features in 2015-2017 was investigated and the main aspects of the mechanism of ensuring the full maintenance of social support were formed.Military actions and the conduct of the antiterrorist operation led to increase in the number of psychological stress disorders among the military. In the course of work we managed to find out that since the beginning of the antiterrorist operation and to date, the system of psychological rehabilitation of the military is gradually improving, but the question remains its effective functioning and compliance with world standards.After returning to a peaceful life, soldiers should be involved in rehabilitation activities and receive comprehensive complex rehabilitation in accordance with individual programs.The question was also raised on the issue of soldiers with post-traumatic stress, who had undergone rehabilitation and rehabilitation and required long-term social support. The most effective in reducing the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder is the integration of the soldiers’ negative experience in order to use it for personal growth, self-development, self-realization.</jats:p>"

Performance of these components can be assessed using suitable performance indicators (PIs). Indicators should be cautiously selected based on their relevance, measurability, and comparability for both the inter‐utility benchmarking and Intra‐utility performance assessment. Inter‐utility benchmarking process may generate long documentation presenting the comparisons of several indicators. Conversely, performance indices are generated by aggregating the PIs at the component level, which are more convenient to top‐level utility's management, policy makers, and the general public. Operations managers are more engrossed in the underlying processes. Intra‐utility performance assessment informs about the performance of subcomponents for each water supply system operating in a utility's dominion. Knowledge shared in this article reveals that effective use of PIs can contribute to the overall sustainability of our water supply systems. More recent applications, (i) multilevel performance assessment, (ii) risk‐based benchmarking, and (iii) continuous performance improvement, are also discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ongoing electrification of the heat and transport sectors is expected to lead to a substantial increase in peak electricity demand over the coming decades, which may drive significant investment in network reinforcement in order to maintain a secure supply of electricity to consumers. The traditional way of security provision has been based on conventional investments such as the upgrade of the capacity of electricity transmission or distribution lines. However, the energy storage technology can also provide security of supply, thereby constituting a cost-efficient alternative to expensive conventional reinforcements. In this context, the current paper presents a methodology for the economic quantification of the security contribution of energy storage. This methodology makes use of mathematical optimization for the calculation of the F-factor metric, which reflects the optimal amount of peak demand reduction as compared to the power capability of the energy storage asset. In this context, a case study is presented in which the security contribution of energy storage is analyzed as a function of its power capability, energy capacity and efficiency as well as of characteristics of load patterns.</jats:p>"

The role of the illegal market in the context of food supply of the population in the conditions of military Communist policy is considered on the example of the Ryazan province. Materials and Methods. As a theoretical and methodological strategy of the study, we consider the problem-chronological method, the implementation of which, in conjunction with the method of political psychology, allows us to comprehensively consider the problem of illegal supply of local population with food products during the Civil war. Results. The article analyzes the activities of state bodies aimed at eliminating the system of self-supply, through the implementation of the food dictatorship, the organization of the grain monopoly. Bagging is investigated as part of social history, human behavior in extreme conditions of civil war and famine. Special attention is paid to the complex relationship of illegal suppliers with representatives of the provincial government, employees of food authorities, railway workers. Abuse of barrage detachments in relation to railway employees is investigated. The situation with food in the Ryazan province in the period under review, was a reflection of the overall picture with the supply of bread in the country. The supply of the population was experiencing a serious crisis, which led to the introduction of emergency measures against the illegal market. The state used a monopoly on bread, suppressed attempts to speculate on food. Discussion and Conclusion. Despite the anti-market ideology, the grain monopoly, the Bolsheviks failed to combat the elements of market consciousness among the population in 1918 and 1919. The Market found an opportunity to adapt and exist in the planning and distribution system. Later it transformed into freedom of trade under the NEP.</jats:p>",

In the lighting &lt;br /&gt;field the LED lighting emission diode is the absolutely winner. The low power consumption &lt;br /&gt;and the characteristics of LED made it ideally for most of indoor and outdoor applications. &lt;br /&gt;The dimmability of the LEDs which is between 0% and 100% made it ideally for intelligent &lt;br /&gt;lighting applications. This large dimmability range could be obtained only with &lt;br /&gt;incandescent and halogen bulbs, compare to CFL compact fluorescent lamps where the &lt;br /&gt;maximum dimmability is around of 60%. One of the prices of this positive characteristics of &lt;br /&gt;modern lamps, is the electromagnetic compatibility EMC. It is well known that the modern &lt;br /&gt;lamps have a common part, and this is the electronic ballast. And as all electronics circuits, &lt;br /&gt;the electronic ballasts are an important source of EMC noise emission. The noise emission &lt;br /&gt;of electronic ballast is mainly conducted emission type. Start from construction of &lt;br /&gt;electronic ballast which contains an AC/DC converter and a buffer capacitor the emission &lt;br /&gt;of half harmonics is presented too. The emission of half harmonics is proportionally with &lt;br /&gt;the cost of lamps, because the cost of lamps depends by the methods used for noise &lt;br /&gt;emission rejection too. Typically the cheaper lamps have a higher noise emission than the &lt;br /&gt;expensive lamps. Known of noise emission lamps separately is not enough for &lt;br /&gt;characterization of low noise emission from lighting network. The low frequency noise &lt;br /&gt;emission of a lighting network is lower than in case of a single lamp. The variation of &lt;br /&gt;temperature determines a variation of low frequency noise emission too.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Despite surging growth in extant research, the need for theoretical and conceptual substantiation persists, and large opportunities for further research remain unexploited. This paper responds to the need for a conceptual foundation and, therefore, aims at providing a structured agenda for future research areas in SSCM. Based on an abductive reasoning approach, SSCM constructs and concepts are gathered from existing literature and recombined into a comprehensive conceptual SSCM framework. Areas and directions for future SSCM research, as suggested in earlier studies, are summarized, positioned in the framework, and outlined to stimulate further SSCM research activities. To overcome the lack of holistic research in the field, sophisticated techniques and integrated systems to support decision-making are required to tackle related issues’ complexity. Therefore, this paper’s contribution lies in the synthesis of state-of-the-art literature to provide a more comprehensive view of SSCM. Researchers may find promising recommendations and a suitable foundation for future studies, while practitioners may find helpful orientation and guidance for decision- and policy-making.</jats:p>"

Most GSCM adoption has been discussed in the perspective of logistics management activities such as procurement, manufacturing, transportation, and reverse logistics. Nowadays, the discussion of GSCM adoption in terms of the driving factors affecting a successful GSCM application has led to complexity. In this article, a further review and discussion are conducted in terms of the driving factors dealing with GSCM adoption, including three major points, such as the driving forces of green procurement, green manufacturing, and green distribution and reverse logistics adoption. The driving factors are reviewed to highlight the recent factors affecting GSCM adoption.  In this article, 94 papers from the past study are presented, associating each point of the discussion. </jats:p>"

To enable natural gas delivery from the producer to consumers, natural gas is liquified to enhance transportation efficiency and reliability. The main contribution of this paper is to develop sustainable LNG supply chain through a review of different sustainable supply chain management tools and assessing their applicability in managing LNG supply chains. Energy security has evolved to include the protection of the entire energy supply chain and infrastructure rather than a consideration for the availability of resources alone. There is a particular focus on coupling sustainability and resilience/risk as part of the need to develop integrated approaches to manage energy supply chains to deliver cargo at minimal cost and environmental impact, and to ensure that supply chains can overcome vulnerabilities withstanding potential disruptions to the supply chain. Outcomes of this review demonstrate the possibility to develop multi criteria models, which consider sustainability dimensions within the LNG supply chains and to integrate parameters that form part of the annual delivery plan ensuring day to day LNG supply chain planning consider multiple objectives.</jats:p>"

Menurut makalah ini, sejarah evolusi SCM dapat dibagi menjadi empat tahap: 1) SCM tahap pra, 2) tahap penciptaan, 3) tahap integrasi dan 4) tahap globalisasi. Pada bagian terakhir akan dibahas faktor- faktor yang mempengaruhi proses evolusi SCM. Beberapa faktor tersebut adalah: perusahaan fokus pada pengurangan biaya; meningkatnya persaingan global; perusahaan fokus pada efisiensi peningkatan dan kinerja; konsolidasi kebijakan liberalisasi perdagangan dan gerakan globalisasi; meningkatnya konsentrasi ritel - sentralisasi dan kekuasaan; dan perusahaan meningkat fokus pada kepuasan pelanggan.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe purpose of this paper is to create a better understanding of Supply Chain Management (SCM), how it has evolved and the factors that influence its evolution. Through examining the literature, this paper will highlight the evolutionary history of SCM and the factors that influence it. According to this paper, the evolutionary history of SCM can be divided into four stages: 1) pre-stage SCM, 2) stage of creation, 3) stage of integration and 4) stage of globalization. In the last section we will discuss the factors that influence the evolutionary process of SCM. Some of these factors are: companies focus on reducing costs; increasing global competition; the company focuses on improving efficiency and performance; consolidation of trade liberalization policies and the globalization movement; increasing retail concentration - centralization and power; and companies are increasing focus on customer satisfaction</jats:p>"

Exploring stories within their garment illuminates both positive and negative narratives, whereby the impacts of production methods are explored to examine current practice in industry, manufacturing, and investigate\n innovative models for responsible design. Through a process of reverse engineering the garment from its completed form backward through its creation, back to its base fibres, alternative models of manufacturing, distribution, energy use and design outcomes are explored and suggested. Conceptualizing\n each stage of the production cycle as a series of stories, from initial fibre selection through to final garment purchase and consumption, is done to encourage empathy and connections between the student designer and the people who produced their garment within the complex global textiles\n supply chain.</jats:p>",

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of applying an existing SIoT framework to Supply Community Networks (SCN). a term we use to describe the changing pattern of supply chains whose morphology continues to evolve from traditional linear continuums, into ostensibly mesh-like structures. Specifically, we identify an appropriate SIoT architecture from current literature which was used as a basis for realizing the notion of SCN, where in this case the &amp;lsquo;members&amp;rsquo; are autonomous objects (Supply Community Agents, or SCA) working on behalf of member organizations (suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, etc.) and whose generic object architecture we extended by specifying interfaces to various member functions that all such agents must possess to engage in the exchange of goods/services information and remittance one would expect whether part of a chain or as here, a network (or networks). We substantiate our claims of feasibility using stochastic MATLAB simulation of a baked-goods SCN scenario. Results showed that the modified SIoT framework exhibited the flexibility required by SCAs when operating as part of a Supply Community Network so that they can effectively discharge their responsibilities in delivering the services needed by other member agents of a SCN. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper determines categories of contracts that facilitate vertical information sharing in a supply chain while precluding horizontal information leakage among competing newsvendors. We consider a supply chain in which retailers replenish inventory from a common supplier to satisfy uncertain demand and are engaged in newsvendor competition. Each retailer has imperfect demand information. Yet one of the retailers (the incumbent) has a more accurate demand forecast than the other (the entrant). Information leakage among such competing retailers precludes vertical information sharing and is often the reason for many retailers to abandon collaborative forecast-sharing initiatives, leading to suboptimized supply chains. We show that whether a contract can prevent information leakage depends on how the inventory risk (i.e., cost of supply–demand mismatch) is allocated among the supplier and retailers in conjunction with the allocation of profits. We categorize contracts according to how they allocate inventory risk among firms when compared with a wholesale‐price contract. This comparison yields four mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories of contracts. A downside-protection contract is one that effectively reduces retailers’ cost of excess inventory by shifting some of their overage cost to the supplier. Examples of such contracts include buy-back and revenue-sharing contracts. An upside-protection contract is one that effectively increases retailers’ cost of inventory shortage by shifting some of the supplier’s underage cost to retailers. Examples of such contracts include penalty and rebate contracts. A two-sided protection contract combines the properties of the previous two categories. A no-protection contract is one that fails to shift firms’ cost of inventory shortage or excess from one to the other. Examples of such contracts include wholesale-price and two-part tariff contracts. We show that no-protection contracts, which are extensively used in practice, cannot prevent information leakage, whereas others may do so. We also show that preventing information leakage could be costly for the supply chain (i.e., low channel efficiency). We conclude by illustrating how our unified framework to study a variety of contracts can enable a firm to determine the best-performing contract (among many) that precludes information leakage while almost coordinating the channel. For example, we show why buy‐back contracts perform significantly better than revenue‐sharing or rebate contracts. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

Many digital transformations in supply chain fail to deliver. Operational and financial performance in many manufacturing organisations is not improving. Something is going wrong. This paper explores what it is that is going wrong: namely that supply chains are designed based on a theoretical model that is not matched to reality and that the increase in volatility experienced in today’s environment is bringing supply chains to their breaking points. Digital transformations therefore may often make things worse by accelerating bad practices and the speed at which managers take wrong decisions. To redress things, companies need to redesign and operate their supply chains to reflect how supply chains really work. Then, and only then, can digitisation and automation be successfully used to increase operational performance, cash flow and returns on invested capital (ROIC).</jats:p>"

The maximum As rejection efficiency for MEUF with BCl and DPCl surfactants is 92.8% and 84.1%, respectively. In addition to this, a statistics-based experimental design with response surface methodology was used for the purpose of examining the impact of operating conditions, including initial pH, initial As concentration (ppb), and surfactant concentration (BCl, mM) in As-removal from aqueous solutions. In the analysis of the experimental data, a second-order polynomial model that was validated by statistical analysis for the BCl surfactant was used. On the basis of the response model created, the removal of As ions was acquired at optimum operating parameters, including the initial As concentration of 150 ppb, surfactant concentration of 5 mM and pH 10 for the BCl surfactant with 92.8% As-removal efficiency.</jats:p>",

To reach the goal, the author focuses on the improvement of drugs availability and the minimisation of time delays in drugs supply.\n\n\nResearch methodology – the application of dynamic regression method to minimise shortage. The author suggests a dynamic regression model and accompanies it with autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity tests: Breush-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM Test for autocorrelation and ARCH test for heteroskedasticity.\n\n\nFindings – during analysis author identifies the relationship between lead-time and time delays in drugs supply. The author delivers a specific regression model to estimate the effect of deterministic lead-time on shortage. Probability F and Probability Chi-Square of this testing show that there is no significant autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.\n\n\nResearch limitations – the research is delivered for a one-month time frame. For the future, the study could review other periods. The author has incorporated the lead-time component in shortage reduction study by leaving capacity uncertainty component unresearched. The future studies could incorporate both elements into shortage reduction case analysis.\n\n\nPractical implications – presented framework could be useful for practitioners, which analyse drug shortage reduction cases. The revision of supply time table is recommended for pharmacies aiming to minimise the shortage level.\n\n\nOriginality/Value – the analysis of deterministic lead-time and identification that the periodicity of shortage is evident each eight days. The study contributes to lead-time uncertainty studies where most of the authors analyse the stochastic lead-time impact on shortages.</jats:p>",

As a reservoir situated in Jilin Province, China, Yangshapao Reservoir has been employed for irrigation and urban water use. After 2 years’ observation carried out on water quality and wind speed, it was found that the TN, NH4 and TP are significantly correlated with the bottom shear stress attributed to wind, whereas the dissolved phosphorus (DP) is not. Bottom shear stress is also noticeably associated with dissolved oxygen (DO), thus promoting nutrient release into the water body. In winter, ice can effectively inhibit the wind-induced shear stress, and the TP concentration is evidently lower than in the other seasons. This scenario should be considered in the management of the water quality of the lake and similar lakes.</jats:p>",

Firms decide how much to source from their upstream suppliers so as to maximize their expected profits, and prices of intermediate goods are set so that markets clear. We provide an explicit characterization of (expected) equilibrium profits, which allows us to derive insights into how the network structure—that is, the number of firms in each tier, production costs, and disruption risk—affect firms’ profits. Furthermore, we establish that networks that maximize profits for firms that operate in different stages of the production process—that is, for upstream suppliers and downstream retailers—are structurally different. In particular, the latter have relatively less diversified downstream tiers and generate more variable output than the former. Finally, we consider supply chains that are formed endogenously. Specifically, we study a setting where firms decide whether to engage in production by considering their (expected) postentry profits. We argue that endogenous entry may lead to chains that are inefficient in terms of the number of firms that engage in production. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management. </jats:p>",

The success of an agile manufacturing system relies on multisource data analytics, which provide smart data-driven decision-making strategies to guide manufacturing and the supply chain system. In order to implement rapid manufacturing processes to respond to customer orders, supply–demand gap prediction plays a critical role. In this article, we study the problem of predicting supply–demand gap with respect to product types, categories, and spatiotemporal attributes. To this end, we propose and develop an end-to-end framework using an extendable deep neural network architecture for supply–demand gap reduction. The framework can process multiple customized input factors and automatically discover spatiotemporal supply–demand patterns from historical transaction data. A set of customized features are employed to build a general training model to predict future demand. Embedding layers are used to map high dimensional features into a smaller subspace for input data consolidation. Fully connected layers with activation functions are used to build the training architecture of the model. Customized data attributes can be concatenated from different layers in the deep learning neural network. In this way, multisource input data can be integrated with outputs of internal layers for a comprehensive demand prediction. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the network with real supply and demand data, which were acquired from warehouses of a manufacturing company. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed network was able to reduce supply–demand gap and provide a practical solution to long-term customer demand prediction.</jats:p>",

Aggregation strategy was analyzed in the context of single product and multi-product for a multi-period production problem under demand uncertainty.  Product sourcing between echelons and distribution strategies are considered for the study.  Objective was to use the redistribution strategy to optimize the objective functions for the network.  The objective functions include minimization of total cost, minimization of overage and stock-out conditions, and maximization of the customer service level. The total cost function includes product flow, transportation cost and distance cost.  The mathematical formulation is carried out in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with the help of Generic Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS).  Problem formulation considers three type of demand based on volatility and uncertainty cases as high, medium, and low.

The novelty consists of using two dynamic variables represented by the precipitation and the land use and land cover (LULC) to obtain the effective rainfall and its exceedance probability. The flood risk is determined by using deterministic methods depending on the exceedance probability of effective rainfall. Two time series of precipitation were involved. The first precipitation time series was used to prove the method corresponding to the months of the rainy season obtained from 58 gauging stations during the period 1980–2000. The second precipitation time series was applied for the validation stage of method corresponding to the period 2015–2018. In the validation stage, it has been found that there is a slight difference between the principal component N° 1 in the first time series with respect to the second time series. The method represents a contribution to determine the spatio-temporal distribution of flood risk that allows decisions to be taken to achieve preventive measures that contribute to the protection of human beings and goods.</jats:p>",

Indonesia menjadi negara terbesar yang mengekspor CPO dan menguasai sekitar 62% pangsa pasar dunia. Namun, Indonesia menghadapi hambatan dalam melaksanakan ekspor CPO sehingga menyebabkan pelemahan neraca perdagangan dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk mengetahui hambatan yang terjadi dan memetakan rantai pasok dalam proses produksi CPO, serta menganalisisnya. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metode Food Supply Chain Networking (FSCN) yang dilakukan terhadap 24 perusahaan. Pengumpulan data primer diperoleh melalui informasi secara langsung, sedangkan data sekunder diperoleh dari dokumen/ publikasi/ laporan penelitian dari dinas/instansi maupun sumber data pendukung lainnya. Selanjutnya data diolah dan dilanjutkan dengan metode Porters Diamond. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terdapat beberapa hambatan dari regulasi dan adanya kampanye negatif, serta peningkatan biaya impor. Penyebaran perkebunan dan teknologi yang tidak merata dalam negeri juga berkontribusi terhadap menurunnya ekspor produk ini. Pemerintah Indonesia telah mengambil inisiatif untuk menangani hal tersebut, yaitu dengan memenuhi beberapa syarat yang diajukan oleh negara-negara importir berupa hak paten, sertifikasi dan jaminan, bahkan dengan cara hilirisasi produk minyak sawit.

This research was conducted to determine the obstacles that occur and map the supply chain in the CPO production process, and analyze it. In this study the Food Supply Chain Networking (FSCN) method was conducted on 24 companies. Primary data collection is obtained through direct information, while secondary data is obtained from documents / publications / research reports from agencies / agencies and other supporting data sources. Then the data is processed and continued with the Porters Diamond method. The results showed that there were some obstacles from regulation and the existence of a negative campaign, as well as an increase in import costs. The uneven distribution of plantations and technology in the country also contributed to the decline in exports of these products. The Indonesian government has taken the initiative to deal with this, namely by fulfilling several conditions proposed by importing countries in the form of patents, certifications and guarantees, even by way of downstreaming palm oil products. Based on this and supported by the increasing demand for CPO, it is estimated that CPO will be absorbed in both the domestic and foreign markets. </jats:p>"

In recent years, many methods for the evaluation of energy transformation in water distribution systems have been presented in the literature. The methods vary in terms of the scope and aim of assessment. The main objective of this paper was to give a review and comparative analysis of the methods for assessing the energy efficiency of water supply systems, which are described in the scientific literature and technical standards. Because the energy assessment of water supply systems is performed for different purposes, it is not possible to indicate one universal method. The main aim of the research was to present and analyze the methods currently in use. The review of different performance assessment methodologies provided information on issues related to the classification of methods, energy balancing, determination of reference values for performance assessment, the use of supporting computer tools, and the importance of data reliability.

Design of water supply and sanitation components of the complex (residential part, infrastructure) is based on standards and experience in the design of such facilities located separately and operating independently. At the same time, the design has specific features because many objects are parts of a single complex. For example, such as the duplication or redundancy of individual elements of the system; the device of a separate fire extinguishing system, including a reservoir with a supply of water; the use of additional equipment aimed at saving water; installation of local wastewater treatment facilities of industrial premises; design of rain sewers with closed outlets. The article presents a simplified method for determining the maximum hourly and second water and wastewater flow rates for buildings with a large number of water users.Determination on set of rules30.13330.2016 is conducted only for the most water-intensive consumers, which account for more than 90 % of the daily water consumption of the entire complex and the number of which usually does not exceed three.The expenses of other small water consumers are taken into account additionally as a percentage of consumption of water-intensive facilities. It is determined that the share of small consumers in the maximum hourly consumption of water and wastewater is 6 %, in the maximum second consumption - 4,5 %.

An example of such a system is the supply network, in the general case of an arbitrary structure. For linear supply chains known business game “Beer Game”, which allows to observe and explore the effects that occur in long supply chains. The aim of the work was to develop a model that is a generalization of the original “Beer Game” in the case of a supply network of arbitrary topology and the development of software that allows investigating the resulting model using simulation methods. In this paper the mathematical model of the supply chain is presented. A set of algorithms for estimating and forming the order volume by each network participant is proposed. The developed application that emulates the work of the supply chain is described. Various ways of creating a supply network topology have been proposed, and a description of the parameters for modeling the supply network has been given. The capabilities of the application are demonstrated when generating data and interpreting the obtained results in the form of tables, graphs, and animation. The ways of forming supply chains with different characteristics are studied. Experiments on the study of algorithms for estimating the volume of orders on various topologies of supply chains were carried out. Ways to assess the performance of the supply chain were proposed. The developed software can be used to justify the choice of strategy for managing supply chains in distribution logistics for industrial and commercial enterprises of various sizes, from large networks to retail. In addition, the developed software can be used in the educational process for students of economic specialties.</jats:p>",

Notwithstanding, there are few comparative studies on indoor temperature distribution and system cost evaluations for radiators and floor heating. Furthermore, there are no aligned outcomes in terms of total heat supply for a single-family house with radiators or floor heating. In this study, the effect of building energy efficiency level and construction type, including flooring material, on the supply heating demand and transmission heat losses were studied for both radiator and floor heating systems. For this purpose, a single-family house located in Växjö, Sweden, was modeled as a case study. The heating demand was supplied with a district heating system with a similar supply temperature at 45 °C for both the radiator and floor heating system. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the effect of flooring configurations on the annual supply heating demand for both conventional and passive versions of the case-study building. The results showed that the radiator-integrated building had a lower supply heating demand in comparison with the floor heating-integrated buildings. Based on the sensitivity studies, the flooring material did not have a significant influence on the supply heating demand and on the transmission heat losses in the case of the radiators. The supply heating demand was only reduced up to 3% if the flooring U-value was improved by 60%. The results also showed that refurbishment in a standard conventional building with a radiator heating system based on the passive criteria led to a 58% annual energy savings, while this amount for a building with a floor heating system was approximately 49%.</jats:p>"

However, plant extraction furnishes only limited and unstable R-(-)-linalool yields that do not satisfy market demand. Therefore, a sustainable yet efficient and productive method of R-(-)-linalool synthesis is urgently needed. Results: To induce the R-(-)-linalool biosynthesis pathway in <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> , we expressed heterologous (3R)-linalool synthase (LIS) from Lavandula angustifolia (laLIS). We then enhanced R-(-)-linalool production in the cells using a suitable LIS from Streptomyces clavuligerus (bLIS). The bLIS expression was markedly elevated by using optimized ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and protein fusion tags. R-(-)-linalool output rose from 4.8 mg L -1 to 33.4 mg L -1 . To increase the geranyl diphosphate (GPP) content in <jats:italic>E. coli </jats:italic>, we tested various alterations in geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPSs) and their mutants. The final <jats:italic>E. coli </jats:italic>strain harboring GPPS from Abies grandis ( Ag GPPS) accumulated ≤ 100.1 mg L -1 R-(-)-linalool after 72 h shake-flask fermentation. This yield gain constitutes a 60.7-fold improvement in R-(-)-linalool biosynthesis over the parent strain. Fed-batch cultivation of the engineered strain in a 1.3-L fermenter yielded 1,027.3 mg L -1 R-(-)-linalool. Conclusions: In this study, an efficient R-(-)-linalool production pathway was induced in <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> via the heterologous MVA pathway, AgGPPS, and (3R)-linalool synthase (bLIS). By overexpressing the key enzyme in the engineered <jats:italic>E. coli </jats:italic>strain, R-(-)-linalool production reached 100.1 mg L -1 and 1,027.3 mg L -1 under shake flask- and fed-batch fermentation conditions, respectively. The latter is the highest reported R-(-)-linalool yield to date using an engineered <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> strain. The strategies of key enzyme overexpression and mutation could lay theoretical and empirical foundations for engineering terpenoid pathways and optimizing other metabolic pathways.</jats:p>"

While these studies may help us understand select cases of proliferation, they overshadow the role of nuclear supply in bolstering global nonproliferation efforts. After the risks of nuclear assistance became well-known following India's nuclear explosion in 1974, most major suppliers conditioned their assistance on recipients joining nonproliferation agreements. Case studies of states’ decision-making regarding these agreements illustrate how the provision of nuclear technology has been an effective tool in persuading states to join such agreements, the most important of which is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). By joining the NPT, states strengthen the global nonproliferation regime and increase the costs of any potential future decision to proliferate. The offer of nuclear assistance has done far more to bolster global nuclear nonproliferation efforts than recent research suggests.</jats:p>",

In line with the human capital theory, we consider households as essential in both shaping and providing the labour supply. The subject of the research survey were Slovak households and their members comprising a representative sample of the Slovak population with respect to the size, type and regional distribution of households as well as the age of their adult members. The sample consisted of 1,753 households and 4,855 household members as respondents. We looked at their willingness to make various choices in order to get a job and retain it as well as their family or household life strategies to maintain a work-life balance in view of their attitudes to sharing the family responsibilities. We used nonparametric statistical tests to establish the order of preferences for respective issues and the Spearman coefficient to find out the statistically significant relation between the age  of the respondents and the choices they are most likely to prefer. The results have shown that age is a decisive factor in the responses to several of the questions, which is important to take into consideration as most of the labour demand in the following years will be created by the loss of older workers due to retirement or other reasons. This means that employers need to be prepared for  a generational change and may be motivated to consider age management as one of their strategies to deal with the predicted labour shortage. </jats:p>"

In the lighting field the LED lighting emission diode is the absolutely winner. The low power consumption and the characteristics of LED made it ideally for most of indoor and outdoor applications. The dimmability of the LEDs which is between 0% and 100% made it ideally for intelligent lighting applications. This large dimmability range could be obtained only with incandescent and halogen bulbs, compare to CFL compact fluorescent lamps where the maximum dimmability is around of 60%. One of the prices of this positive characteristics of modern lamps, is the electromagnetic compatibility EMC. It is well known that the modern lamps have a common part, and this is the electronic ballast. And as all electronics circuits, the electronic ballasts are an important source of EMC noise emission. The noise emission of electronic ballast is mainly conducted emission type. Start from construction of electronic ballast which contains an AC/DC converter and a buffer capacitor the emission of half harmonics is presented too. The emission of half harmonics is proportionally with the cost of lamps, because the cost of lamps depends by the methods used for noise emission rejection too. Typically the cheaper lamps have a higher noise emission than the expensive lamps. Known of noise emission lamps separately is not enough for characterization of low noise emission from lighting network. The low frequency noise emission of a lighting network is lower than in case of a single lamp. The variation of temperature determines a variation of low frequency noise emission too.</jats:p>"

Therefore, myopically selecting a product distribution contract can be harmful. We analyze the performance of a number of contracts in the presence of a gray market—primarily wholesale price, revenue sharing, and quantity discounts—and analyze their impact on prices charged, quantity ordered, as well as profits. We also investigate their impact on consumer surplus and social welfare. Our results indicate that selection of an appropriate contract is quite crucial, as different contracts give different results across a variety of operating parameters. Their performance is governed by the relative trade‐offs involving diversion of excess quantity to the gray market at the end of the season, an extension of target market due to lower prices in the alternate channel, and the negative impact on the manufacturer's brand that also affects its revenue. We delineate these characteristics and find that, in general, the quantity discount contract performs the worst. Interestingly, if the blowback suffered by the manufacturer on account of product availability in the gray market is high, the wholesale price contract may outperform the other contracts, including the revenue‐sharing contract with a truthful retailer, which otherwise is a more attractive option. We discuss the implications of our analysis, and also provide strategies and pointers to manage the impact of gray markets.</jats:p>",

Outer synchronization is useful for the supply network to recover to its scheduled state. In this paper, a dynamic model for a supply network is established, and measurement with memory of resilient recovery is proposed based on outer synchronization. An impulsive controller is designed to improve the control effectiveness. Afterwards, an algorithm is adopted to identify the resilient recovery backbone. Based on these factors, an efficient resilient recovery method considering cost is applied in the case study. This study improves the measurement and control of the supply network’s resilient recovery through outer synchronization, and is easily integrated with practical problems to make better control decisions.</jats:p>"

The analysis of food safety presented in the foregoing publication shows that legal and organizational regulations are not alone sufficient to ensure that the quality of products does not pose a health and environmental threat. The results of the study conducted with the participation of 15 subjects make it evident that the issue of food safety is complex and requires continual monitoring because of ever changing conditions. It is increasingly seen that food safety is a key factor in supply chains, becoming the overriding element of production systems. Production companies spend more and more money on control and modernization of the entire production-related system so that food safety is 100% guaranteed. In the last few years, it can be seen that audits in manufacturing companies that deal with the production and sale of food are largely focused on food safety, process monitoring systems and employee access controls to individual production zones. Not without significance is the fact that additional departments are created in manufacturing companies, whose main task is to control production processes in terms of food safety, both from the side of the safe use of raw materials, packaging and the interference of unauthorized persons. It is absolutely necessary to emphasize that the paper also shows some examples that can already be treated as the first symptoms of food terrorism, which is becoming a deadly tool for current and future food terrorists. The publication emphasizes that food safety in the market reality of that time may be of paramount importance in the supply chains, given the importance and consequences of possible mass contamination of food.</jats:p>",

Hence, it becomes inappropriate to generalise the existing dimension and components of trustbased relationships to trust-based relationships among the building information modelling (BIM) supply chain members because of the multiple structures of relationship and the numerous interpersonal and inter-organisations that participate on BIM-based construction projects. This article investigates the nature of trust-based relationships among the BIM supply chain members and establishes whether the requirements of  the BIM process influence trust-based relationships among the BIM supply chain members. A five-stage PRISMA was adopted for systematic reviews and meta analysis. The systematic review enabled the development of a theoretical model of trustbased relationships in BIM supply chain which was subjected to meta-analysis for validation. The findings revealed that trust-based relationships among the BIM supply chain members entail trusting and trustworthy behaviours, positive expectations, and positive reputations, under which twenty-seven components were identified and classified appropriately. The article concludes that the nature of trustbased relationships among the BIM supply chain members, as influenced by the requirements of the BIM process, can be explained as trusting and trustworthy behaviours, positive expectations, and positive reputations. The article advances the understanding of trust-based relationships among the BIM supply chain members and recommends a first-hand investigation into the nature of trust-based relationships among the BIM supply chain members in future studies. </jats:p>"

The proposed circuit is unique in terms of autonomous power supply switch between harvester and storage device (battery), as well as self-start and control of the operation mode (between active and sleep modes). The self-start controller saves power during an inactive period and the impedance matching concept enables maximum power transfer to the storage device. The proposed circuit is prototyped and tested with an intermittent vibration energy harvester. Test results found that the daily energy consumption of the proposed circuit is smaller than that of the resistive matching circuit: 0.75 J less in sleep mode and 0.04 J less in active mode with self-start.</jats:p>"

The topics examined include: the responsiveness of labour supply to changes in wages, regulation and other incentives; factors that determine the wide variation in physician practice and style; and the effect of teams and management quality on patient outcomes. This literature reveals that while labour supply is relatively unresponsive to changes in wages, medical personnel do react strongly to other incentives, even in the short run. This is likely to have consequences for the quality of care provided to patients. We set out a series of unanswered questions in the UK setting, including: the importance of non‐financial incentives in recruiting and retaining medical staff; how individuals can be incentivised to work in particular specialties and regions; and how medical teams can be best organised to improve care.</jats:p>",

Based on a brief review of rational expectation, this paper puts forward the proposition of failure of rational expectation. The so-called failure of rational expectation means that when the market entity predicts future events, it is impossible to form a completely accurate expectation and then adjust its actions accordingly due to incomplete information and other reasons. On the contrary, due to various irrational factors, the actions of the market entities based on individual ration sometimes may be mad and loss of control, producing devastating effects on the economic system. This paper expounds the concept and formation mechanism of the failure of rational expectation, and conducts a preliminary empirical analysis on this in combination with China&amp;rsquo;s economic practice. On this basis, it proposes that rational supply management, which the government can play a role in, should be combined to correct the failure of rational expectation and realize the dynamic balance and stability of the economic system.</jats:p>"

This paper addresses the need for a common tool and set of criteria governing organizations’ actions. Such a tool and set of criteria are essential in not only combating modern slavery within corporations, but also throughout global supply chain tiers. Application of consistent tools and criteria will move the private sector forward in eradicating modern slavery by ensuring transparent reporting and effective action. The final deliverable consists of recommendations for adoption of publications and individual criterion—adaptable for all supply chain levels—for corporations to use in implementing, expanding, and improving their modern slavery and transparency initiatives.</jats:p>"

High reliability of supply volume forecasting of building materials per unit time is required to reduce non-production fault times. Based on the equality intensity of the work performance and the structural materials supply intensity, the goal is to develop a generating forecast method of the demand for building materials, taking into account a given level of organizational and technological reliability. The use of classical methods of probability theory made it possible to develop a non-complex mathematical apparatus, which use reliably ensures high confidence of demand forecasts for building materials. The study results can be used in relation to building materials for which it is impossible to create a stock on the construction site, for example, a concrete mix.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Amongst the power quality problems faced in Nigeria, interruption and voltage fluctuation seem to be foremost. Thus, household electrical and electronic appliances are most times under the threat of outages and low voltage supply which cause them to malfunction or in extreme cases, get damaged. To address these problems, the use of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and automatic voltage regulator commonly refer to as “stabilizer” has become very popular. The objective of this work is to examine the quality of these devices when powering other nonlinear devices. The experimental study was carried out by using a power harmonic analyzer to display the output parameters and waveform from each device under test when powering nonlinear loads. Parameters measured for each device were voltage, current, frequency, peak-to-peak voltage, total harmonic distortion (THD) and crest factor. The results showed that for the measured parameters, while other parameters relatively remain within the standards, the THD took an exemption as it was relatively higher with a range of 9.9 to 19.9 % for various combination of loads. Though the outputs from the UPS were relatively higher than that of stabilizer (except for THD and crest factor where those of the stabilizer were higher), there was no significant difference between the parameter values measured.  The implication of this was that increasing utilization of UPS and stabilizer will invariably continue to contribute more to the pollution of the existing weak network. Adequate measures were suggested to mitigate this. This research can be useful for the stakeholders in power industry for power quality improvement.</jats:p>"

The inclusion of peasant farm enterprises, private subsidiary farms, agricultural consumer cooperatives and agricultural cooperative markets into short supply food chains has been observed. The study was conducted on the basis of Rosstat data across the subjects of the Russian Federation. The polling survey was carried out in Vologda, Leningrad and Novgorod regions. The methods of correlation and socio-economic analysis were used. Groups of regions with a high share (60-70%; 71-80%; &gt; 80%) of peasant farms and private subsidiary farms in food production as territories with prerequisites for the formation of short supply food chains were identified. The tendencies of decreasing the number of agricultural consumer cooperatives and their localization in a limited number of regions have been established. In ten regions of Russia 52.6% of agricultural consumer cooperatives are concentrated and 49.2% of peasant farms as their members are located. Cooperatives in Russia as a whole cover only 5.2% of all peasant farms. Operating agricultural consumer cooperatives provide their services only to 4% of private subsidiary farms. Based on the correlation of Spearman's ranks, a moderate tightness of the direct relationship between the number of agricultural consumer cooperatives and the number of peasant farms - members of the agricultural consumer cooperatives (correlation coefficient is 0.56) and a weak relationship between the number of agricultural consumer cooperatives and the number of private subsidiary farms served by them (0.08) has been established. It is concluded that agricultural consumer cooperatives can have a significant impact on the formation of short supply food chains only in certain regions with a developed cooperative network. The results of the questionnaire of agricultural consumer cooperatives have revealed a number of interrelated problems concerning the sale of products, the need for the development of agricultural cooperative markets and other retail markets. It was proposed to manage markets and food chains in general on the basis of a corporate social responsibility model using rural web networks (Rural web).</jats:p><jats:p>Conflict of interest: the authors stated that there was no conflict of interest.</jats:p>"

The authors develop a mathematical model for a tourism supply chain under three scenarios: (i) a decentralized scenario, (ii) an integrated-channel scenario, and (iii) a global scenario. The results show that the tourism supply chain generates more profit when there is competition compared with when there is no competition.

When the installation requires water pumping, it is key for the operational costs to know how well the pump can perform. So far, pump efficiency has been considered using conservative values, in the absence of a better estimation. The aim of this paper was to improve determining the energy costs by clarifying what the value of the pump performance should be. For this, 226 commercial pumps were studied, registering the efficiency at the optimum operating point, as well as other variables such as the flow rate, height, and pump type. As a result, a strong relationship between the pump performance and the discharge flow was spotted. That allowed the generation of an empirical curve, which can be used by designers to anticipate what pump efficiency can be expected. The results are used in a simple case study using the Granados Optimization System. These achievements can be implemented in design policies for a better energy assessment in the optimization of water supply systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A plants’ fitness to a large extent depends on its capacity to adapt to spatio-temporally varying environmental conditions. One such environmental condition to which plants display extensive phenotypic plasticity is soil nitrate levels and patterns. In response to heterogeneous nitrate distribution, plants show a preferential foraging response, enhancing root growth in high nitrate patches and repressing root growth in low nitrate locations beyond a level that can be explained from local nitrate sensing. Although various molecular players involved in this preferential foraging behavior have been identified, how these together shape root system adaptation has remained unresolved. Here we use a simple modeling approach in which we incrementally incorporate the various known molecular pathways to investigate the combination of regulatory mechanisms that underly preferential root nitrate foraging. Our model suggests that instead of a thus far not discovered growth suppressing supply signal, growth reduction on the low nitrate side may simply arise from a reduced root foraging and increased competition for carbon. Additionally, our work suggests that the long distance CK signaling involved in root growth increase in high nitrate patches may represent a supply signal specifically functioning in modulating demand signaling strength. We illustrate how this integration of demand and supply signals prevents excessive preferential foraging under conditions in which demand is not met by sufficient supply and a more generic foraging in search of nitrate should be maintained.</jats:p>"

In this study, multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques are used for the estimation of monthly pan evaporation. The modelling approach includes the various combination of six measured climate parameters consisting of maximum and minimum air temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, sunshine hours and wind speed of two stations, namely Gangtok in Sikkim and Imphal in the Manipur states of the northeast hill region of India. Average monthly evaporation varies from 0.62 to 2.68 mm/day for Gangtok, whereas it varies from 1.4 to 4.3 mm/day for Imphal during January and June, respectively. Performance of the developed MLR and ANN models was compared using statistical indices such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with measured pan evaporation values. Correlation analysis revealed that temperature, wind speed and sunshine hour had positive correlation, whereas relative humidity had a negative correlation with pan evaporation. Results showed a slightly better performance of the ANN models over the MLR models for the prediction of monthly pan evaporation in the study area.</jats:p>",

The study employed a combination of complementary techniques to ascertain the analytical procedures and the occurrence of TiO2 NPs in water. Characterization, identification and quantification of TiO2 NPs in surface water samples from five sampled dams was performed using several techniques including scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (FEEM) and single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (SP-ICP-MS). The SP-ICP-MS technique was able to simultaneously determine the size and concentration of both the dissolved and particulate titanium (Ti) in water samples. The Ti-containing NPs were found at concentrations ranging from 8.3 × 104 parts/mL to 1.4 × 105 parts/mL in the presence of 14.9 μg/L to 243 μg/L dissolved Ti. The TiO2 nanoparticles were mostly composed of small agglomerates ranging from 102.9 nm to 158.9 nm in size.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years the urbanization to affect many countries of the world has made the significant changes to the material flow at all levels of the supply chain. The last mile logistics operating in the urban area has also changed notably. An increase in the volume of material flow within cities has led to a growth in the number of deliveries and the freight turnover, accordingly. The above-stated processes greatly reduce the sustainability of cities, which while keeping the urbanization trend, can lead to the serious negative results of the social and environmental nature not only for the cities, but also for the countries. One way to solve this problem is to create the green supply chains from the multi-echeloning principles. In the paper, the authors have presented a two-echelon green supply chain using the zero transport emissions within the second echelon. A multi-criteria function has been developed to assess the rational location of a transfer point in order to reduce the negative environmental impact from the transportation system. With the PTV Visum software product, a simulation has been conducted to evaluate the alternative scenarios for generating a green supply chain.<jats:bold /></jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance of research. The research is aimed at improving the energy efficiency of automated water supply in irrigation systems. The purpose and objectives of research. The purpose of the research is to reduce the specific energy consumption for pumping water by pumping stations (PS) in closed irrigation systems (CIS). The task is to substantiate the efficiency of the method of automated control of water supply to the CIS when regulating the pressure at the outlet of the pumping station, which is set by the sum of hydraulic losses in the network from the pumping station to irrigation equipment (IE), static and free pressure at the dictating hydrant of CIS. The logical-mathematical model and technological conditions of energy-efficient water supply management \"when it need\" in CIS are given. The technical requirements for pumping units (PU) and auxiliary technological equipment of PS are presented in the application of automated water supply control with the use of frequency converters (FC).Research methods: experimental, mathematical modeling. Substantiation of the feasibility of introduction of automated electric drive with FC, as one of the measures of energy efficiency improvement, was carried out based on the results of energy audits of the PU and the CIS with the use of measuring equipment on the request of inter-district water management administration. The object of the energy audit is the CIS, which has been in operation since 1979. The PS is equipped with four PU with centrifugal section pumps 150-CVE-350-23/3 (D = 350 mm) and drive motors of the brand MAF315SK-4 with a rated power of 132 kW. During the period of operation the reconstruction and restoration of the CIS took place. “Dnepr” sprinkling machines have been replaced by modern low pressure SM and drip irrigation systems. With the replacement of irrigation equipment, asbestos-cement field pipelines with diameters D = 400 mm were replaced too with the plastic ones of D = 200 mm. The configuration, hydraulic characteristics of the CIS and modes of operation of the PU were changed. The efficiency of the pumps 150-CVE-350-23/3 decreased by 10-15% during the long-term operation of the PU. Research results. For energy efficient water supply management, it is proposed to: replace four worn pumps 150-CVE-350-23/3 with three pumps of domestic production ЦН400-105б; implement a system of automated water supply management at the CIS with the use of FC. Conclusions. The effectiveness of the application of a new method of water supply control in the CIS, which provides for automatic control of the pressure at the outlet of the PS, is given by the sum of hydraulic losses in the network from the PS to the IE, static and free pressure at the dictating inlet of the operating IE, using the proven FC. Introduction of automated electric drive with the FC on the PS-4 of the “Repin” CIS enables to reduce the daily power consumption from 12% to 25%.</jats:p>"

Currently, Chief Purchasing Officers (CPOs) and supply managers face opportunities as well as challenges that have been unknown so far — at least to such an extent. They are often uncertain about the potentially disruptive impact of these developments on their daily business and require support also from the scientific community. Therefore, this paper consolidates current scientific discussions on purchasing trends and provides a first indication on how they support current problem sets of the purchasing practice. Do the two perspectives match or differ? Does the scholarly debate also cover current practical problems? The topics identified include traditionally established ones, such as new product involvement of suppliers and green supply management, as well as initial publications on customer-centricity and creative methods; however, there is an evident gap. Comprehensive answers and concrete solutions to questions around the impact of digitisation on purchasing are not yet provided by the scholarly debate, but the discussion of current trends becomes noticeable. Therefore, the scope of research should be further widened in order to generate applicable and relevant knowledge, thereby achieving business impact.</jats:p>"

However, collecting and disclosing such information is not only costly but also does not provide clear benefits. While the terminology is not yet standard in the literature, this study distinguishes supply chain transparency from visibility. Here, visibility refers to managers’ efforts to learn more about operations upstream in their supply chains. In contrast, by transparency, we mean a company disclosing information to consumers, investors, and other stakeholders about compliance with consumer‐expected norms in its supply chain operations and products. To motivate further research on supply chain transparency, we first report recent examples of companies providing supply chain transparency. Then we present potential benefits of supply chain visibility and supply chain transparency, respectively, for the company. Finally, we propose topics for research on supply chain transparency arranged by stakeholder. </jats:p>",

The convention aims to protect the marine environment from oil and its derivatives. Special areas, where extraordinary measures have been taken to prevent sea pollution, due to the intensity of ship traffic and the greater threat of damage to the marine environment have also been presented. In the further part of the article, the applicability of various pro-ecological solutions, i.e. the use of catalysts, low-sulphur fuels, and in the case of using residual fuels – exhaust gas scrubbers were described. In the main part of the article, a technical and ecological analysis was made. In addition, difficulties resulting from the use of pro-ecological solutions were described. The costs of using low-sulphur fuel meeting the emission standards, installing the scrubber and modification of the natural gas combustion unit were compared with the assumption of ten years of passenger-car ferry sailing. Then the problems that individual solutions create were shown. In the final part of the article, alternatives to those described, i.e. the liquefied natural gas (LNG) power supply, electric and hydrogen drives were presented.</jats:p>",

In particular, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) forecasting methodology is applied to model and forecast the daily water levels. This technique combines the autoregression and the moving average approaches, with the possibility to differentiate the data, to make the series stationary. In order to better describe the trend, over time, of the water levels in the reservoir, three ARIMA models are calibrated, validated and compared: ARIMA (2,0,2), ARIMA (3,1,3), ARIMA (6,1,6). After a preliminary statistical characterization of the series, the models' parameters are calibrated on the data related to the first 11 months of 2014, in order to keep the last month of data for validating the results. For each model, a graphical comparison with the observed data is presented, together with the calculation of the summary statistics of the residuals and of some error metrics. The results are discussed and some further possible applications are highlighted in the conclusions.</jats:p>",

The understanding and full application of these techniques are yet to be fully grasped, especially as it pertains to different organizations culture’ operational structure and business goals. The diversity in Cyber-physical systems (CPS), autonomous vehicles, robotics, additive technologies, and alternative energy systems, in the manufacturing sector, have received extensive research over the last decade, with the promise to replace humans in future supply chain. The present paper is an exploratory assessment that evaluates sustainable technology initiatives in alignment with Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). Our inferences are based on viable implementation strategy, impacts, challenges, and the scope of applicability for increased productivity in the near future. In conclusion, we share on how the promulgation and proper management of new and developing industrial technologies are essential to maximize time, minimize cost, and improve the value of employee commitment, and customer contentment.</jats:p>",

The present research was conducted to identify the relative contribution of drought and overexploitation to groundwater budget deficit in an unconfined aquifer system. In order to simulate groundwater, the simulated recharge from WetSpass-M model was applied in the MODFLOW model along with other required packages. Moreover, the groundwater budget deficit caused by stressors was quantified through the use of calibrated groundwater model predictions. In order to better understand how the stressors affect the groundwater deficit, the aquifer was divided into Clusters 1, 2, and 3. Locally, the results showed that the contribution of stressors to groundwater budget deficit was the highest in Cluster 1 due to the groundwater overexploitation and quick reaction of the groundwater level to the droughts. Overall, this research showed that both drought and overexploitation, with an average of 2.44 and 3.32 million cubic meters, respectively, played a significant role in groundwater storage deficit. Furthermore, the effect of groundwater overexploitation was approximately 36% more than droughts.</jats:p>",

Both strategies use the Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique in order to control the matrix converter accordingly to the input and output constraints. Strategy A modulates the input currents keeping the corresponding space vector in phase with the input voltage vector. Strategy B operates in order to keep the input current vector in phase with the positive sequence fundamental component of the input voltage vector. A comparison between the two strategies is made in terms of the reduction of the input current disturbances due to the unbalanced and non sinusoidal voltage on the grid. It is found that a dynamic current modulation strategy, independent of the voltage disturbances such as Strategy B, is more effective for the reduction of the RMS value of input current disturbances. The validity of the theoretical investigation i.e. the effectiveness of the current modulation strategy conforms to experimental tests result carried out on a matrix converter prototype.</jats:p>"

In this paper, based on the canal pool conditions from the Fenzhuanghe sluice to the Beijumahe sluice of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fault tree principle (FTP) for frazil jam risk assessment are proposed. The risk factors of frazil jams are then identified based on the AHP. Then the probability and consequence severity of frazil jams induced by each risk factor are scored by experts, and the weights of each risk factor are proposed. Finally, risk level and prevention measures are proposed. The results show that there are 20 risk factors for canal frazil jams and the possibility of risk factors is positively correlated with the consequence severity. As yet, experts have not formed a unified view on the frazil jam mechanism of water diversion projects, and the scoring results are highly dependent on expert positions. This paper recommends the FTP as the frazil jam risk evaluation method, and the corresponding frazil jam level of the project is level III.</jats:p>",

This study compares the outcomes of three government policies under manufacturer-Stackelberg (MS) and retailer-Stackelberg (RS), namely (i) direct subsidy to the consumer, (ii) subsidy to the manufacturer to stimulate used product collection, and (iii) subsidy to the manufacturer to improve product quality. Results demonstrate that the greening level, used product collection, and SW are always higher under the RS game, but the rate of a subsidy granted by the government is always higher under the MS game. Profits for the CLSC members and SW are always higher if the government provides a subsidy directly to the consumer, but productivity of investment in the perspective of the manufacturer or government are less. In a second policy, the government organizations grant a subsidy to the manufacturer to stimulate used product collection, but it does not necessarily yield the desired outcome compared to others. In a third policy, the manufacturer receives a subsidy on a research and development (R&amp;D) investment, but it yields a sub-optimal greening level. This study reveals that the outcomes of subsidy policies can bring benefit to consumers and add a degree of complication for CLSC members; government organizations need to inspect carefully among attributes, mainly product type, power of CLSC members, and investment efficiency for the manufacturer, before implementing any subsidy policies so that it can lead to an environmentally and economically viable outcome.</jats:p>"

Sebelum melakukan kolaborasi dengan pihak eksternal, suatu perusahaan harus memiliki internal kolaborasi yang baik terlebih dahulu karena kolaborasi internal yang baik merupakan dasar bagaimana kolaborasi eksternal nantinya terbangun. Penelitian ini mengambil studi kasus di PT X yang merupakan perusahaan manufaktur wiring harness atau perakitan kabel. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah menganalisis dan memberikan usulan peningkatan internal supply chain collaboration index. Pengambilan data dilakukan dari bulan Februari hingga April 2019. Data diambil menggunakan kuesioner dimana kuesioner tersebut disusun berdasarkan teori, tugas dan wewenang setiap divisi dan wawancara.  Kuesioner disebarkan kepada setiap divisi di PT X. Data yang diperoleh dari kuesioner diolah untuk mendapatkan index dari setiap variabel kolaborasi dan dilakukan perhitungan collaboration index. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa range nilai collaboration index PT X sudah yaitu 3,66 hingga 4,94, sehingga dapat dikatakan bahwa hubungan kolaborasi di PT X sudah baik. Akan tetapi, masih terdapat hubungan kolaborasi yang kurang sesuai sehingga diberikan beberapa usulan agarhubungan kolaborasi bisa meningkat.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Hence, Industry 4.0 opens a wide avenue for researchers to explore possibilities in the field of the supply chain. This project focuses on building a decision framework for a supply chain system with disruptions. The impact of strategic decisions under the condition of unprecedented events for a vehicle routing problem (VRP) using simulation models is studied here. Those results help the supply chain managers in making sound decisions regarding different scenarios of disruption in VRP. To achieve this, multiple cases under different scenarios of facility disruption are considered. For all cases, the dependent parameter, namely, retailer service level and lost revenue, form the basis of the decision framework. The concept of live data is implemented by making retailer demand, current inventory at the depot, the position of the vehicle in the network and the current number of units in transit as the input data.</jats:p>"

This paper analyses three different heating systems which focus on a pellet boiler and solar collector combined system. The performance of existing solar collectors is analysed and the solar collector system performance ratio is determined. Costs including investments, fuel and maintenance have been analysed and a comparison between systems is made using the indicator – costs per produced energy. Results show that the performance of the solar collector system should be increased or investments should decrease to meet the cost effectiveness of other analysed heating systems.</jats:p>",

Data collection in this research was by identifying the company's GSCM activities, then compiling performance indicators that refer to the green SCOR method. Weighting performance indicators are conducted to determine the importance of each performance indicator by using the AHP method.

The situation is expected to be sharpened in the future due to the intensity of extreme meteorological phenomena, and socio-economic changes affecting water demand. In the city of Volos, Greece, the number of water counters has been tripled during the last four decades. This study attempts to simulate the city's network, supply system and water demand through a forecasting model. The forecast was examined under several situations, based on climate change and socio-economic observations of the city, using meteorological, water pricing, users' income, level of education, family members, floor and residence size variables. The most interesting outputs are: (a) the impact of each variable in the water consumption and (b) water balance under four management scenarios, indicating the future water management conditions of the broader area, including demand and supply management. The results proved that rational water management can lead to remarkable water conservation. The simulation of real scenarios and future situations in the city's water demand and balance, is the innovative element of the study, making it capable of supporting the local water utility.</jats:p>",

In all matrices studied and pH 11.0, more than 99% of the drugs were degraded with the highest applied ozone dose (65 mg L−1), when compared with other pH values. Also, comparing the three aqueous matrices, the ultrapure water was the one that required the lowest ozone dosage (6.4 mg L−1) to reach the same degradation efficiency of the sulfonamides. Caffeine is known as an environment contamination indicator. Therefore, this does not intend to totally remove this compound, but to verify its degradation level compared with the sulfonamides.</jats:p>",

In any case, it appears to be practically unavoidable that our public, manufactures, industrial businesses etc. produces waste whereas only can be minimized hence the point of this rationale thesis has been to explore how to recover the material assets by rethinking waste as an asset. The study mainly focuses on pharmaceutical companies in Sri Lanka who produces numerous waste per month with compared to other industries whereas don’t have much focus on degree of treating those waste at disposing where companies spend millions of money on the process of disposing. This paper investigates a way of sustainably disposing those product wastes of pharmaceutical companies and the determinants of waste disposal cost and ways of optimizing. Thus, questionnaire survey was distributed focusing on pharmaceutical players within Sri Lanka to measure factors affecting to waste disposal cost as well as to prove that concluded strategy can aid to generate profits from the previously used cost generative process of direct disposing the pharmaceutical wastage and also the researcher apply that strategy on a PQR company to evaluate the degree of successfulness of the strategy. Thus, the outcomes are included here under 3 main objective analysis with six major factors named as “Effective operational process”, “Standard procedures”, “Quality of storage/operation”, “Regulatory awareness”, “Traceability” and “Knowledge” which were identified as factors affecting waste disposal cost as well as the study concluded a successful waste disposal strategy as sorting and recycling where can change the current game play of the pharmaceutical companies to a new direction.</jats:p>"

Показано, что в контрольном варианте два стандартизованных метода определения калия по-разному отражали направленность изменения почвенной калийной обеспеченности. Результаты, полученные методом Чирикова, показали снижение степени калийной обеспеченности почвы этого варианта на одну градацию, в то время как по данным метода Масловой обеспеченность почвы обменным калием, несмотря на некоторое увеличение, не выходила за пределы исходного высокого уровня. При внесении азотных и фосфорных удобрений наблюдалось увеличение количества и обменного, и подвижного калия в почве при сохранении исходного уровня калийной обеспеченности. Внесение возрастающих доз калийных удобрений не привело к существенному изменению почвенных запасов элемента в связи с потреблением калия сахарной свеклой. При интенсивных технологиях возделывания сахарной свеклы на черноземах с повышенным и высоким и содержанием доступных для растений форм калия наблюдается высокая отзывчивость этой культуры на внесение калийных удобрений. При выращивании сахарной свеклы на почве с исходно повышенной (по градациям Чирикова) и высокой (по градациям Масловой) обеспеченностью калием наибольшая прибавка урожая корнеплодов относительно фона (9,2 т/га) получена при дозе 140 кг/га.

This condition will make the sales of chili decrease dramatically if the price rises. In addition, the margins felt by farmers to sellers of chili in the traditional market are uneven. this is also felt by other vegetable sellers. This research aims to identify the supply chain network of chili in Bekasi Regency. The margin of each stage in the supply chain network is also identified. This research employs descriptive analytical. Descriptive analytics is a preliminary stage of data processing that creates a summary of historical data to yield useful information and possibly prepare the data for further analysis. Data collection method used is by direct observation in Bekasi regency and other locations associated with suppliers of chili, then we employ direct and a phone interview with respondents. The finding shows that there are three main stages in supply chain of chili in Bekasi Regency, namely producer, distributor and consumer. The consumers can buy the product from three channels, that shows the flows of product from producer to consumer. The share of margin in the producer stage for the second flow is lower than the first flow, with the value 56.25% from 75%, then, the third flow is higher than the second flow but still lower than the first flow, with the value 64.29%.</jats:p>"

To optimize the throughput of the railway section, it is possible to use auto block system with a variable number of block sections on the railway haul. This leads to additional significant hardware and finance costs, including for providing electric power to additional equipment. To use of a low power, autonomous power supply allows the elimination high-voltage power lines for microprocessor optional equipment of block system with a variable number of block sections. The principle of operation of an autonomous power supply uses the mechanical energy of the moving wheelsets of the train cars, which move on section of the railway. Moving the ferromagnetic material of the wheelsets above the permanent magnet of an autonomous power source converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

In this study, we assess the surplus agricultural residues availability for bioelectricity in six least developed countries (LDCs) in Asia and Africa, namely Bangladesh, Lao-PDR, and Nepal in Asia; and Ethiopia, Malawi, and Zambia in Africa, respectively. The surplus agricultural residues have been estimated using residue-to-product ratio (RPR), agricultural residues lost in the collection, transportation and storage, and their alternative applications. We use a linear regression model to project the economic potential of bioelectricity. The contribution of bioelectricity for meeting the LDCs’ electricity requirements is estimated in a time frame between 2017 and 2030. Our results reveal that the surplus biomass feedstock available from the agriculture sector could provide the total current electricity demand in Malawi alone, followed by Nepal (45%), Bangladesh (29%), Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao-PDR) (29%), Ethiopia (27%), and Zambia (13%). This study also explores the complementarity and synergies of bioelectricity, SDG7, and their interlinkages with other SDGs. Findings from the study show that providing access to sustainable energy in the LDCs to meet the SDG7 by 2030 might be a challenge due to limited access to technology, infrastructure, and finance. Site-specific investigations on how much agricultural residues could be extracted in an environmentally benign manner for bioelectricity and increased investment in the bioenergy sector are key potential solutions in a myriad of options required to harness the full energy potential in the LDCs.</jats:p>"

In a tough competitive environment, you can survive and develop only by orienting your business activities to a logistic approach. The gold mining industry plays a key role in the global economy. This industry has a high asset value, large-scale production lines and large infrastructure. One of the main tasks of strategic planning of gold mining enterprises is the choice of a rational marketing system. Planning and selection of schemes for the supply of precious metals is an important condition for the effective functioning of the marketing activities of gold mining enterprises. For these purposes, the need for improving logistics flows and creating an information system for sales planning is growing. The article explores the planning and selection of precious metals supply schemes using the example of PJSC “Vysochaishy”. Much attention paid to the construction of the company’s logistics flows. The main problems in the supply chain of PJSC “Vysochaishy” are identify. The algorithm of the process of introducing a new supply chain planning system for Vysochaishy PJSC is considered, and an improved strategic planning process for PJSC “Vysochaishy” is present. A new scheme of operation of the transport and logistics system for the direction of logistics flows of PJSC “Vysochaishy” proposed.</jats:p>",

In this study, we investigate whether a greater supply of physicians in given administrative areas is associated with lowers rates of amenable mortality, defined as deaths that can be delayed with appropriate and timely medical treatment or public health measures.<jats:bold>Methods.</jats:bold> We use Taiwan’s population-level National Death Certification Registry data spanning nearly four decades to study the trend in age-standardized amenable mortality rates by area physician supply quartiles. We also conducted multivariate panel data regression analyses of the association between age-standardized amenable mortality rates and physician supply, controlling for mean household income, education attainment, urbanization levels, decade fixed effects, and the implementation of universal health care.<jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> The trend analyses (adjusted for age and sex only) show that Taiwanese townships in the top quartile of physician supply consistently had the lowest age-standardized amenable mortality rates. However, in the panel data regression analyses, after controlling for at least mean household income, the negative association between physician supply and overall amenable mortality loses statistical significance, although it remains statistically significant for ischemic heart disease.<jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold> These findings suggest that physician supply, while important, is but one input that contributes to population health and is likely confounded with other socioeconomic factors correlated with better health. Physician supply levels are not randomly distributed, and doctors likely choose to practice in higher income areas and areas with demonstrated medical need. More research is needed, but policy makers should consider broader social policies, not just healthcare resources, as means to promote population health once a critical mass of physicians is achieved.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a holistic approach for risk management that considers the impact on multiple performance objectives, the relation between risk agents, and the risk event interdependencies. An aggregated risk score is proposed to capture the cascading effects of common risk triggers and quantify the aggregated score by risk agent and objective. The approach also uses fuzzy logic to allow for the treatment of vague and ambiguity data as input parameters to the model from different domains and scales, according to knowledge and criteria nature. The integration of the balanced scorecard tool improves the analysis and prioritization of mitigation strategies in decision-making, both by risk agent and by strategic objective. A case study of a telecommunication company is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.</jats:p>"

The highest mortality (28%) was seen in a diet with protein level 25% and lowest (Nil) in a diet with protein level 50%. The highest average weight gain (13.65g) was observed in first fifteen days at diet 40% protein level and lowest (4.01g) was seen in 16th to 30th days at diet with 25% protein level. There was no significance difference between average body weight gain and physico-chemical factors (pH, DO and temperature). The better growth performance of C. carpio was seen in a diet with 40% protein level. So, it is recommended for fishermen to obtain maximum production in aquaculture. Further study especially about growth in relation to formulated diet up to table size and effects of micronutrients in diet on growth performance of C. carpio is recommended for other researchers.</jats:p>"

Damage to heat networks can lead to disconnection of consumers, disruption of internal engineering systems, and reduction of their operation parameters, which can be dangerous, especially during the heating period at low outdoor temperatures. To ensure the reliability and efficiency of the heat supply system, it is necessary to fulfill all the requirements of the technical operation rules, conduct timely rounds and inspections and identify damage to the heating network at an early stage. It is also necessary to identify factors affecting the reliability and, consequently, the efficiency of the heating system, identifying “risk zones” by the magnitude of damage, based on the results of the calculation.

We take advantage of a quasi-natural experiment in Germany, in which one blood donation site changes its payment scheme from remunerated to non-remunerated. All other donation sites maintain their payment schemes. We show that donation volumes drop significantly after the pay drop and do not recuperate. At the same time, donation volumes increase at other paid donation sites, which is partly due to donor migration to these sites. We do not find any impact of the changed payment scheme on blood quality. Our results offer additional insight into the complex question whether it is efficient to ensure blood supply by paying donors a direct monetary compensation.</jats:p>",

This paper considers a manufacturer with irresponsibility risk in a centralized and decentralized socially responsible supply chain, and uses a Stackelberg game to investigate the optimal policies on price and CSR investment level. This paper also examines the influence of consumer responsibility awareness and CSR investment efficiency on the decision behaviors of the manufacturer and retailer. Moreover, we developed a new mechanism to coordinate the decentralized supply chain system, which consists of the retailer participating in CSR and revenue sharing. Our results indicate that the manufacturer’s and retailer’s optimal decisions may not be significantly influenced by consumer responsibility awareness, but the effect of CSR investment efficiency is significant. Our results also show that if the degree of retailer participation and the proportion of revenue sharing are of moderate size, then not only can the contract mechanism coordinate the decentralized socially responsible supply chain, but it can ensure that a win–win situation can be achieved by the supply chain members.</jats:p>"

In addition, 68% of the world's population is projected to be living in urban areas by 2050. With these projected large population increases and shifts, demand for food, water, and energy is projected to grow by approximately 35, 40, and 50%, respectively, between 2010 and 2030. In addition, between 1970 and 2014 there was an estimated 60% reduction in the number of wildlife in the world and an estimated net loss of 2.9 billion birds, or 29%, in North America between 1970 and 2018. Loss of species populations and number of species is interconnected with reduced health of biodiversity and ecosystems. Human activity has been the main catalyst for these substantial declines primarily through impacts on habitats. These losses are accelerating. Since a company's supply chain environmental impacts are often as great or greater than its own direct environmental impacts, it may be prudent for companies to engage with their supply chains to protect and enhance habitats and biodiversity and protect rare, threatened, and endangered species. As one example, companies may have opportunities and strategic reasons to include requirements in their supplier codes of conduct and supplier standards for suppliers to protect biodiversity and rare, threatened, and endangered species, as well as additional requirements to expand or enhance habitats and ecosystems to increase biodiversity. This article follows one pathway that companies could pursue further and with greater speed—to engage with their supply chains to strengthen supplier codes of conduct to protect biodiversity and rare, threatened, and endangered species. The importance of forests, private land, and landscape partnerships is discussed as means to protect much more of the planet's biodiversity and rare, threatened, and endangered species. Lastly, the article identifies examples of opportunities for companies to more formally incorporate biodiversity into their business, supply chain, and sustainability strategies.</jats:p>",

The use of precision technologies in agriculture belongs to this topic. The use of precision technologies is increasingly widespread in the cultivation of various agricultural crops, including maize. Sensing is an important part of these techniques. In our experiment we compared two methods: measuring relative chlorophyll content and the method of determine the extractable chlorophylls. The experimental plant was maize (Zea mays L.) and the measurements were performed at an early development stage (V8) of three genotypes. Three levels of nitrogen (0; 80; 160 kg ha-1) were applied during the experiment. The relative chlorophyll content was measured by SPAD-502 (Minolta, Japan) and a handheld GreenSeeker (Trimble, USA) device. The extractable total chlorophyll content decreased in parallel with the increased nitrogen level. The obtained SPAD values were diversified furthermore the NDVI values have not been changed for the effect of different nitrogen fertilization. In the early stages of development of maize, these parameters need to be complemented with other measurements to provide reliable information about the crops nitrogen status.</jats:p>"

In this research, integrated modeling was carried out under multipurpose scenarios using six reservoir dams with a capacity of 10,500 MW (megawatt) to reduce the greenhouse gas productions. The simulation and development of the integrated water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model within a 50-year period, along with the development of the MODFLOW model in alluvial deposits that interacts with the river, allowed for the analysis of the integrated water resources management system of the Great Karun basin. Several scenarios were implemented following the calibration and validation of the linked integrated model. The components covered by these scenarios included the satisfaction of the in-basin and off-basin demands, the effect of the integrated consumption of water resources, and the effect of increased efficiency of irrigation networks with maximum clean hydroelectricity production and minimum aquifer level decline under drought-induced water shortage conditions. The second scenario, which generates 15,282 GWh (gigawatt-hour) of power, not only optimally meets the future and environmental demands as the best operating scenario but also minimizes the emission of the greenhouse gases in the basin.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the continuous optimisation of the energy structure, the proportion of natural gas consumption in China increases annually, the urban gas pipeline network continues to extend outward, and the supply range continues to expand. Although an increasing number of users can use natural gas, the coverage of the natural gas pipeline network remains low in some areas in China. A “point supply” pattern, which provides gas through liquefied natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply stations, has been developed to solve the problem of gas unavailability in areas not covered by the pipeline network. This pattern flexibly supplies gas, whose cost is low and market determined. Thus, the substantial development of these gas supply stations has been promoted. This pattern will continue to play an important role in the future. However, no unified standards for the construction of these gas supply stations have been provided, resulting in various problems, such as unreasonable location, inadequate management, potential risk and imbalance between supply and demand. On the basis of these concerns, this research attempts to study the urban bearing capacity of gas supply stations, provide some new ideas for the construction and planning of urban gas supply stations, and help promote sustainable urban development. The pressure–state–response model is adjusted to the pressure–state–capability model, which is used as a basis for proposing an evaluation index system and calculation models for the comprehensive evaluation of the urban bearing capacity of gas supply stations on city and country scales. The proposed methodology is used in a case study of urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Delta.</jats:p>"

Another consideration also included is the prevalence of forward-buying contracts with locked-in prices. The dragon fruit supply chain faces several difficulties as yield, price, and demand are highly sensitive to weather conditions and global uncertainty factors. The risk factors in the dragon fruit supply chain also depend on species—for example, the red varieties, while more profitable than the white varieties, also have higher export risk because they are subject to global prices and adverse geopolitical conditions.</jats:p>"

Despite significant advances in modern gynecology, endometritis is often unrecognized, being the main reason leading to persistent infertility or repeated pregnancy loss. There are 3 morphological types of chronic endometritis: hyperplastic, hypoplastic and mixed. The aim of the study was to develop ultrasound signs and hemodynamic features of various morphological types of chronic endometritis. Matherials and Methods. A retrospective analysis of 162 patients of reproductive age (22-50 years old) diagnosed with endometritis was carried out. The comparison group consisted of 96 women 17-42 years old without gynecological pathology (P &gt; 0.05). The study was conducted in the proliferative phase of the cycle up to 10 days. The hemodynamics of the uterus and endometrium was evaluated on the basis of Doppler blood flow parameters in the uterine arteries, the calculation of arterial perfusion index (API), vascularization index (VI) and flow index (FI) of the uterus and endometrium obtained by 3D Doppler. Results. Depending on the morphotype of endometritis, hemodynamic features were evaluated. It was revealed that in the hypoplastic type, to which patients are related with the ratio of the endometrial volume to the volume of the uterus less than 2.5%, there is a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease API, as well as hypovascularization of the uterus. Hypervascularization of the uterus and endometrium was observed both with a mixed morphotype, when the ratio of the endometrial volume to the volume of the uterus was from 2.5 to 9.0%, and in the case of a hyperplastic morphotype, when the volume of the endometrium to the volume of the uterus exceeded 9.0%. AIP was no different from healthy women. Conclusions. Diagnosis of impaired blood supply to the uterus will allow reasonable treatment and restore the reproductive function of women.</jats:p>"

The volume of water loss expressed as Non-Revenue Water at the global level shows a high number. Every year more than 32 billion m3 of treated water is lost due to leakage from the distribution network. There are four pillars in the network leakage management strategy include management of pressure, speed of recovery, active leakage control, and asset management. These components influence how leakage is managed and affect the volume and value of economic leakage - in a distribution network of water companies. The current annual volume of physical losses tends to increase along with the expansion service area of the distribution network. The rate of increase can be inhibited by the right strategy combining the four components into an effective leakage management strategy. This study analyzes the distribution pattern of leakage points in water distribution pipelines in Malang City, and how much they affect the speed of recovery. The data in this study consist of 5449 pipeline leakage points which include spatial and attributes data. The method used in this study is the Spatial Point Process. The results of the analysis show that the distribution pattern of leakage is an inhomogeneous pattern. It is found that the parameters of the model -with Euclidean distance- the leakage pattern affects the occurrence of leakage and the Geographical Weighted Regression model -with fixed Gaussian Kernel Weight Function with Manhattan distance- the leakage pattern affects the speed of recovery.</jats:p>",

Firstly, starting from the concept and mechanism of biological immunization, combined with the risk analysis of the prefabricated construction supply chain, the similarity between the risk management of the prefabricated construction supply chain and the biological immune system is discussed, and a risk management model based on the immune principle is established. Further, the corresponding recommendations for risk prevention of prefabricated construction node enterprises are also proposed, which provides new ideas for enterprise risk management activities.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of demand and supply-side factors associated with the use of contraceptive measures in Pakistan.Method Secondary data analysis of four data series of the Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHS 1990–91, 2006–07, 2012–13, and 2017–18) were used. The data includes ever-married women aged 15–49 years who had given birth in the previous five years and participated in the family-planning module of the PDHS. A total number of 25,318 women were included in the analysis. Data was analysed by investigating the associations between independent variables (demand and supply-side factors) and the use of contraceptive measures through unadjusted Odds Ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR).Results A majority of the women were illiterate and not in employment. There was an increase in the number of women who did not use contraceptive methods in rural areas over time. Among demand-side factors, the results indicated that, in 2012–13, women without media exposure were less likely to use contraceptives (OR 0.396, 95% CI 0.353–0.442), and the trend remains almost constant for 2017–18 (OR 0.432, 95% CI 0.391–0.477). These findings change slightly in the adjusted analysis (AOR 0.664, 95% CI 0.562–0.784) in 2012–13 and (AOR 0.654, 95% CI 0.483–0.885) in 2017–18; however, they still show a lower likelihood of using contraceptives without media exposure. Among supply-side factors, the results indicated that absence of transport (2012–13) and limited visits by family-planning workers over the previous 12 months (2006–07, 2012–13, and 2017–18) remained significant factors for not using contraceptive methods.Conclusion The results of the study indicate that certain demand and supply-side factors are associated with the use of contraceptive measures in Pakistan. It highlights the need for the provision of family-planning resources and further structural factors, particularly in remote areas.</jats:p>"

It outlines what the problems are, based on Oxfam’s experience and recent research. It discusses growing inequalities and highlights evidence that farmers and workers in supply chains that produce the food we eat are often unable to put food on the table for their own families. Women predominate in jobs that are more precarious, lower paid and lack effective representation. The paper outlines reasons for companies to act, highlighting the shortcomings of traditional compliance and audit approaches adequately to identify and mitigate risks. It explains why and how investors are scrutinising companies’ management of risks and opportunities associated with their workforce, including in the supply chain. And it alerts readers to a ratcheting up of legislation putting a duty on companies to take their responsibility to respect human rights in their operations and supply chain more seriously. Increasing awareness of social and human rights risks, opportunities and incentives can open new avenues to improve business effectiveness. Drawing on Oxfam’s experience of working with companies to address these challenges, the paper concludes with suggestions for the role of procurement professionals in ensuring good practice. It highlights the importance of understanding and support for these developments from C-suite and suggests ways that supply chain professionals can tackle these issues proactively.</jats:p>"

In line with the Paris Agreement, the European Union has set an agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by means of energy efficiency in buildings. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 80% of Europe’s population will be living in buildings that already exist. This means it is important for the European Union to renovate buildings to improve energy efficiency. In this study, eight renovation scenarios, using six different Northern European electricity mixes, were analyzed using the standard of the European Committee for Standardization for life cycle assessment of buildings. This study covers all life cycle steps from cradle to grave. The renovation scenarios include combinations of photovoltaics, geothermal heat pumps, heat recovery ventilation, and improvement of the building envelope. The results show that while in some electricity mixes a reduction in the global warming potential can be achieved, it can be at the expense of an increase in radioactive waste production, and, in mixes with a high share of fossil fuels, the global warming potential of the scenarios increases with time, compared with that of the original building. It also shows that in most electricity mixes, scenarios that reduce the active heat demand of the building end up in reducing both the global warming potential and radioactive waste, making them less sensitive to changes in the energy system.</jats:p>"

Issues related to governance in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sectors are globally significant, with the consideration of the functionality of WASH services in rural Nepal. This article explores the relationship between distinct cases and the underlying causes of governance issues in Nepal's WASH sector, emphasizing the need for more effective delivery and response mechanisms. Additionally, this article analyses existing issues related to inclusive governance and the role of community people to ensure inclusive and appropriate WASH governance. The governance framework is shaped by historical practices, existing policies, and socio-cultural values within society. The article also provides a perspective on historical and socio-cultural transformations, policy analysis, and shared learning based on published articles on WASH, governance, sustainability, and development theories. Furthermore, it addresses issues of inclusive participation, decision-making, and financial transparency as integral components of good governance, which play a significant role in ensuring the sustainability of WASH services in communities. In conclusion, this paper asserts that the functionality of WASH services often fails due to inadequate governance, whereas governance is directed by the history of the places and applied development theories and approaches up to the timeframe.</jats:p>"

In Russia, historically, a qualitative method of regulation has been adopted, which consists in changing the temperature of the fluid depending on the change in the temperature of the outside air at a constant flow rate of the fluid. An analysis of the heat supply schemes of a number of Russian cities revealed that central quality regulation at heat sources has practically ceased everywhere. In modern methods of calculating the qualitative and quantitative regulation, the main load is heating, and the load of hot water is taken into account only by increasing the flow rate of network water and the variable modes of joint operation of heating and hot water systems are not calculated. Thus, at present, there are no methods for calculating the qualitative and quantitative regulation, allowing to fully taking into account the effect of the load of hot water on the operation of heating systems. Therefore, in modern conditions, the previously developed methods and technological methods of controlling the combined heat load are characterized by a decrease in efficiency, and, accordingly, the problem of their optimization arises. For different temperatures of outdoor air, the calculation of variable operating modes of the heat supply system was carried out, which showed that the existing schedules of qualitative and quantitative regulation cannot provide a comfortable temperature condition of the premises. Under the conditions of a connected supply of heat, simply adding up the flows of network water for heating and hot water supply fails to achieve optimal thermal conditions for the premises. Therefore, further improvement of the technology of the central qualitative and quantitative regulation of the heat load taking into account hot water supply is required.</jats:p>"

Using the ARDL bounds testing approach, the study reveals the existence of a long-run equilibrium relation among inflation, money supply, and exchange rates. Furthermore, money supply and exchange rate also have a short-run dynamic causal effect on inflation. The estimated error correction coefficient of -0.73 suggests about 73 percent of the disequilibrium is corrected within a year. This speed of adjustment towards the equilibrium is quite high. Study’s findings support the contention that inflation is a monetary phenomenon in Tanzania. Similarly, the exchange rate pass-through is also a very notable phenomenon. In light of the findings, proper monetary policies such as tightening money supply is required to continue keeping inflation low and stable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, how to deal with the water pollution has become a worldwide problem. More and more people are focusing on how to disinfect and reuse water resources. In daily life, people often use chlorine gas to disinfect, but chlorine gas disinfection has low efficiency and it will take a long time to be effective. It is also easy to form secondary pollution. Therefore, ultraviolet disinfection technology is more and more popular. At present, ultraviolet disinfection technology generally adopts fixed output frequency and voltage, and the effect is not good. This is because VBNC is a common state of water organisms, in which water organisms are in a special state of dormancy. When the external environment is restored properly, they can still recover their activity. Here, a programmable power supply based on DSP is designed to solve this problem. If the ultraviolet lamp is powered by this power supply, the output voltage and frequency can be variable. The system greatly improves the sterilisation efficiency, and the effective sterilisation can reach 99.99%.</jats:p>",

However, extant research still lacks deep insights into how companies design and manage supply chains according to the resilience principles. With this premise, this paper aims at conducting a state of the art review on supply chain resilience (SCR) considering 125 relevant papers collected from Scopus and Web of Science academic search engine. Starting from the results of the literature review, this study proposes a systemic framework of SCR assessment and contributes to improve the understanding of the impact of different empirically tested constructs on the development of the resilience concept. Further, the findings are summarized in several areas including barriers in developing resilience, metrics to measure the resilience performance, and effective strategies to foster the SCR. Finally, this study outlines promising future research directions for scholars and practitioners.</jats:p>",

The causes of insufficient pressure in the gas networks of settlements are analyzed in the article. There is also developed an algorithm for calculating the change in the efficiency of gas appliances depending on the operational parameters of the gas network. It has been found that the most efficient operation of gas appliances is observed at an overpressure at the inlet of gas appliances of about 1200 Pa.To ensure the required quality of natural gas combustion among consumers and minimize gas consumption there are justified the following measures in the article: coordinating a domestic regulatory framework for assessing the quality of natural gas with international norms and standards; improving the preparation of gas coming from local wells before supplying it to gas distribution networks; auditing low pressure gas pipelines and reconstructing areas affected by corrosion; ensuring standard gas pressure in the network for the normal operation of domestic gas appliances; stating quality indicators of natural gas combustion by gas sales organizations.</jats:p>"

The benefits of cucurbits fruits are very important in terms of human health, purification of blood, removal of constipation, digestion and supplying energy. The mutant styrian oil-pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L. convar. Pepo var. styriaca Greb.) exposes a complete lack of lignification of the seed testa. For this reason, this kind of naked pumpkin seed is more consumable as snack than other seeds. The vegetative growth of plants is crucial for fruit production. Nitrogen is the most imperative element for the proper vegetative growth and development of plants which significantly increases and enhances yield and its quality by playing a vital role in the biochemical and physiological functions of plants.&#x0D;\nField studies were conducted to study the effect of nitrogen nutrition on certain physiological parameters and their differences between the styrian oil pumpkin hybrid and cultivar (Gleisdorfi Classic cultivar and GL Rustical hybrid). The small block experiment was carried out based on a factorial experiment with a completely randomised block design and four replications in the Research Institute of Nyíregyháza during the summer period of 2017 and 2018. Three different concentrations of nitrogen fertiliser was applied at sowing. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll-a, -b and carotenoids) were analysed as one of the basic factor of efficient photosynthesis. The yields of two genotypes were also measured in all treatments as seed-weight. The contents of photosynthetic pigments were higher in the oil-pumpkin hybrid, mainly the carotenoids in 2018. The vegetation period of 2018 was drier than in 2017, the hybrid oil-pupmkin was more efficient in stress tolerance than the cultivar with higher carotenoids pool. The obtained yield was more pronounced in the oil-pumpkin hybrid than the cultivar in all examined years.

It focuses on reducing the adverse impact of business processes on the environment. These business processes include product design, material sourcing and selection, manufacturing processes, product delivery and end-of-life management of the product. The research studying interactions between environment and businesses in Pakistan has been scarce. This study is conducted to set a platform for GrSCM research in Pakistan as it aims to investigate the perceptions of the manufacturers and consumers regarding their understanding about GrSCM and green products. A qualitative research design including indepth interviews from senior managers of three manufacturing firms and a focus group of customers has been conducted for this purpose. A list of critical factors of GrSCM has been developed based on survey of the literature. The comparison between the GrSCM literature, manufacturer perception about GrSCM and consumer perception about green products lead towards the conclusions regarding; how consumers perceive green products? Do they really demand such products? Do the manufacturers think there is a need for GrSCM? How do they think GrSCM can lead to competitiveness and better economic performance? Basic understanding regarding these issues leads to the future direction for research and practice in this area.  </jats:p>"

To achieve this, a supply chain was designed for a fictitious company located in the City of Celaya, Guanajuato and a set of suppliers located in different cities within the same State. It was used as a google tool to define the distances between each of the companies. As a final result, a representative model of a supply chain was obtained, as well as a methodology that allows the construction of lean supply chains regardless of the number of companies that comprise it. The effect of the variability in the delivery times between suppliers was incorporated into the simulation model, as well as an equation that calculates the pollution emissions of the vehicles that integrate the network that moves the products between the companies. With this work it is possible to represent networks of supply chains of real world companies, where the variability and contamination factor is included, to facilitate the decision making regarding the number of vehicles, inventory levels, quantities to be shipped, frequency in the shipments, etc. with the purpose of contaminating as little as possible and at the same time preventing interruptions in the supply chain using the least amount of resources possible.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to provide a theory-based explanation for the generation of competitive advantage from Analytics and to examine this explanation with evidence from confirmatory case studies. A theoretical argumentation for achieving sustainable competitive advantage from knowledge unfolding in the knowledge-based view forms the foundation for this explanation. Literature about the process of Analytics initiatives, surrounding factors, and conditions, and benefits from Analytics are mapped onto the knowledge-based view to derive propositions. Eight confirmatory case studies of organizations mature in Analytics were collected, focused on Logistics and Supply Chain Management. A theoretical framework explaining the creation of competitive advantage from Analytics is derived and presented with an extensive description and rationale. This highlights various aspects outside of the analytical methods contributing to impactful and successful Analytics initiatives. Thereby, the relevance of a problem focus and iterative solving of the problem, especially with incorporation of user feedback, is justified and compared to other approaches. Regarding expertise, the advantage of cross-functional teams over data scientist centric initiatives is discussed, as well as modes and reasons of incorporating external expertise. Regarding the deployment of Analytics solutions, the importance of consumability, users assuming responsibility of incorporating solutions into their processes, and an innovation promoting culture (as opposed to a data-driven culture) are described and rationalized. Further, this study presents a practical manifestation of the knowledge-based view.</jats:p>",

The model shows that increasing excess reserves have no or even a contractionary impact on bank loan supply. As the newly created excess reserves are heterogeneously distributed across euro area countries, the impact of QE on bank loan supply may differ across countries. Moreover, we derive implications for monetary policy implementation. Increases in the central bank’s main refinancing rate as well as in the minimum reserve ratio and decreases in the central bank’s deposit rate develop expansionary effects on loan supply – contrary to the case in which banks face a structural liquidity deficit.</jats:p>",

It can be noted that such a problem solution is related with the new materials and technologies use in practice. These include textile terminals made of 100% polyester woven with carbon fiber. This material has the following properties: high strength and wear resistance, minimal particles entrainment from the surface. Unlike steel galvanized air ducts, in the textile air duct it is possible to laser-cut precise holes with melted edges with the necessary pitch and diameter. A diagram of the personalized ventilation organization in the office space is presented on the basis of the developed air-distributing device with a micro-perforated textile liner. This device allows to adjust the air flow depending on the individual needs of the person up to shutting down the system in the absence of an employee. Reducing the flow of fresh air contributes to the ventilation system energy efficiency.</jats:p>",

We develop a model of a buyer, a supplier, and an NGO; when a violation of the supplier occurs, the buyer and the supplier both incur penalties. Given that the disclosure influences the NGO's perception of the supplier and results in a different level of NGO scrutiny, the buyer decides whether to reveal her supplier. Our model characterizes the buyer's optimal revelation strategy and provides the equilibrium efforts of the supplier and the NGO. The results show that an increase in the penalty for the supplier or an increase in the NGO's auditing efficiency always gives the buyer an incentive to reveal the supplier and has a beneficial effect on supply chain sustainability. However, an increase in the penalty for the buyer acts as a deterrent to the revelation, and thus it often has a detrimental effect on sustainability, except when the increase is modest and the buyer makes an individual effort to monitor her supplier. Moreover, although an increase in the NGO's gain in utility from targeting a revealed supplier acts as a deterrent to the revelation, it can have either a beneficial or detrimental effect on sustainability, depending on the extent of the increase and the efficiency of the NGO's auditing. Last, if the buyer can invest in improving the supplier's capability, the above‐mentioned factors that have beneficial (detrimental) impacts on sustainability also make the investment more (less) worthwhile. </jats:p>",

The springs were classified using Meinzer method and evaluated the relative performance for rejuvenation strategy. It was found that most of springs fall in sixth and seventh class order with flow rate 6.5 to 65.5 and 0.8 to 6.5 m3·day−1, respectively. The relative performance of springs were analyzed based on four methods: (i) spring flow variability, (ii) normalized spring flow (short and long duration), (iii) rainfall spring flow lag and (iv) spring flow gradient. The relative results of springs were analyzed on a scale of 0–5. The Chandrabhaga springs 01, 03, 4B, 05, 06 and 13 were found to be relatively good on a scale value of 4 out of 5 as compared to springs 4A, 07, and 10A with a scale value of 1. For the Danda watershed, the relative performance of springs 4A and 28 found on scale value of 5 and springs 4B, 11 and 20 with a scale value of 4 are relatively good compared to springs 02, 06, 07, 15 and 17. The cumulative flow of spring showed a linear response with cumulative rainfall for the period of June to September (monsoon period). The spring-shed was delineated and evaluated for optimization for the maximum efficiency, spring flow, ratio of area and relief versus maximum spring flow yield. The results revealed that the quantification of water fluxes for water balances, storage of groundwater and development of mathematical models can be used for sustainable water resources development and to revive the mountain springs which helped the adverse impacts of climate change.</jats:p>",

To this end, we adapted and validated a previously developed UTAUT model. A survey of 152 supply chain respondents revealed that facilitating conditions (e.g., IT infrastructure) have a high influence on their intention to adopt big data. However, social influence and performance expectancy showed no significant effect.

The monoecious cucumber plant was used in this study to assess the responses of sex differentiation and the breeding process to nutrient supply and the degree of artificial pollination using pollen solutions of different concentrations. Results: We found that the nutrient supply significantly increased the number of female flowers, although the number of female flowers did not increase with the strength of the pollination. The number of male flowers did not decrease even under the low nutrient concentration; consequently, the matching pattern of male and female flowers reflects the response of plants to nutrients and nutrient resources during flowering stage. Pollination treatment affected the fruit growth, seed set, and fruit yield. However, the number of fruit, fruit set percentage, and total seeds per plant did not increase with the pollination level, although individual fruit weight and seed number in one fruit did increase. Conclusions: It is concluded that the response of cucumber flowering to external factors is direct and instantaneous, and this matching pattern of male and female flowers may not be optimal for fruit development and seed formation.

This paper proposes an event-based model which lists the events related with all phases of cooperation with partners and puts events into a dynamic supply chain network in order to understand factors that affect supply chain partnership integration. We develop a multi-objective supply chain partnership integration problem by maximizing trustworthiness, supplier service, qualified products rate and minimizing cost, and then, apply a hybrid algorithm (PSACO) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) that aims to efficiently solve the problem. It combines the advantages of PSO with reliable global searching capability and ACO with great evolutionary ability and positive feedback. By using the actual data from 1688.com, experimental studies are carried out. The parameter optimizing of the hybrid algorithm is firstly deployed and then we compare the problem solution results of PSACO with the original PSO, ACO. By studying the partnership integration results and implementing analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis, it shows that the event based model with PSACO approach has validity and superiority over PSO and ACO, and can be served as a tool of decision making for supply chain coordination management in business.</jats:p>"

The aim of the project completed in 2018 is to support ‘more sustainable chemistry’ in the textile supply chain and to broaden the view from the ‘reactive’ compliance position to a ‘proactive’ – beyond compliance perspective. Strategically, this approach is based on the following consideration: those who still want to be ‘compliant’ tomorrow have to act ‘beyond compliance’ today. Such a strategy not only guarantees legal compliance, but also opens up new market opportunities. Relevant actors participating in the transdisciplinary research project are mainly manufacturers of textile chemicals (organised in Germany in the TEGEWA association, partner in the SuSport project) as well as companies that manufacture and sell textile products, such as clothing and sporting goods (for sporting goods in Germany organised in the BSI, also project partner). However, since the project’s subject addresses a transformation process of the global textile supply chains, all other actors involved in the production processes must also be taken into account.</jats:p>",

Background and Objectives: This work analyses the supply cost of chipped logging residues and small-diameter trees, from chipping at roadside storages to delivery to the end-user. Factors considered include demand curves (based on the requirements of a theoretical combined heat and power plant or biorefinery); demand volume; and mode of supply (direct or combined via terminal). The impact of longer trucking distances from the sites, and supply integration between forest and other land (varying relocation distances) was also assessed. Materials and Methods: The operational environment and work of a theoretical chip supplier in northern Sweden were modelled and simulated in ExtendSim®. Results: The mean supply cost of chips was 9% higher on average for combined chains than for direct chains. Given a high demand, 8% of the annual demand could not be delivered on time without using a terminal. High supply integration of forest and other land reduced supply costs by 2%. Contractors’ annual workloads were evened out by direct supply to the biorefinery (which has a relatively steady demand) or supply via-terminal independently of the end-user. Keeping distinct chips from different sites (implying that trucks were not always fully loaded) instead of mixing chips from different sites until the trucks were fully loaded increased supply costs by 12%. Conclusions: Terminals increase supply costs, but can enable demand to be met on time when direct supply chains alone might fail. Integrated supply planning could reduce supply costs by increasing the utilization of residual biomass from other land.</jats:p>"

A greater speed of organochlorine compound formation in comparison with the rising concentration of residual chlorine associated with a bigger dose of chlorine agent was documented. The influence of such factors as pH medium, permanganate oxidizability, chlorine absorbing capacity, temperature and residual chlorine concentration on the concentration of chloroform in drinking water was experimentally established. A neural network model that predicts the chloroform concentration in drinking chlorine treated water was used. The chlorine agent dosage control organization chart was proposed on the basis of fuzzy logic that can be used in design of water-supply systems taking into account the health risks for the population.</jats:p>",

Four channel structures (i.e., no-promotion, a direct online channel, a retail offline channel, and dual channels introduced in the promotion sales period) are considered. At the beginning of the paper, the original demand functions of a dual-channel supply chain incorporating the consumers’ utility has been introduced. The results indicate that despite improved consumer patience, all promotional prices do not fall as expected. When sales channels are provided by online retailers rather than offline retailers during the promotion period, offline retailers can achieve higher profits. We also find that in most cases, a dual-channel model in a single-period is more beneficial to both online and offline retailers than a dual-channel model in two periods, which is, to a certain extent, contrary to the existing literature of single sales channel.</jats:p>"

A sudden increase or decrease in air temperature, increasingly frequent, extreme weather phenomena can cause enormous economic damage to countries and cities. The occurrence of random weather phenomena and their negative impact on technical infrastructure nowadays are the basic problem related to ensuring the safety of the functioning of each system. Climate changes and significant air temperature amplitudes have a direct impact on the functioning of the critical infrastructure of cities, which includes collective water supply systems (CWSS). The paper presents the impact of climate change on the failure of a water supply network. Correlation between failure rate and air temperature was determined. This was used to determine the number of failures for the near 2036–2050 and distant 2086–2100 future in terms of climate change (temperature increase). The results confirm the thesis known from the literature that the failure rate decreases as the temperature increases. For forecasted periods as a result of temperature rise due to climate change, the reduction of the number of water pipe failures is expected in the range of 1.22% to 2.35% for the 2036–2050 period and from 2.96% to 8.66% for the 2086–2100 period, depending on the development of Representative CO2 Concentration Scenarios (RCP). The decrease in the total number of failures will have an impact on the increase in the reliability and safety of water supply to consumers.</jats:p>"

The data of the study were collected through a questionnaire form developed by the researchers. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; It was found that the mothers who received breast milk increasing training the most were in eastern region, while mothers in western region fed their babies with formula since they thought their milk was not enough and this result was found to be statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). In our study, it was found that 42.1% of the mothers resorted to some plants and foods to increase breast milk. When the mothers were asked about how they weaned their babies, it was found that 38.2% pasted things like hair and wool or put tomato paste on the breast, 26.9% applied bitter food on the nipple while 27.7% stated that the babies stopped breastfeeding spontaneously. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; It was found that mothers resorted to traditional methods to increase breast milk and to wean and that there were regional differences.\n\n</jats:p>",

Continuous performance measurement is the key to all types of business success, so the purpose of this paper is to review the impact of the entire supply chain on the total effort undertaken, where performance measurement systems in the context of supply chains generate potential avenues for future research especially for new business people to be able to see what things need to be considered when starting a red brick press business. The author has found and classified the supply chain performance measurement system as one method of approach and systematic decision-making techniques. This study reveals that the SCOR Model approach as an indicator of red brick supply chain performance measurement and Analyst Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a decision-making tool can make a real indicator in the implementation of the current red brick business along with the impact on the market so that it is expected to get a solution to declare the effect of the red brick supply chain.</jats:p>",

Choosing the most suitable alliance partner is also critical for manufacturers. In regard to product greenness and recycling competition, this paper considers the CLSC comprised of a dominant manufacturer, a retailer, and a third-party recycler. Based on the Stackelberg game and equilibrium analysis, we discuss the optimal supply chain decision-making under four different models. Then, in order to ensure supply chain (SC) members’ enthusiasm to participate in the alliance, we design a profit distribution method to distribute the total profit to SC members. The results show that manufacturer’s optimal alliance decision is related to the degree of recycling competition. When less than the threshold, C alliance(the manufacturer make an alliance with the retailer and the third-party recycler at the same time) is optimal, otherwise, MR alliance(the manufacturer and the retailer make an alliance ) is more beneficial for the manufacturer.</jats:p>"

The work has the characteristics of simple structure, low cost and strong pertinence, and achieves energy conservation and reduction of air pollution caused by exhaust emissions. The main body of this work consists of an energy conversion system and an exhaust gas circulatory system. Energy conversion system: The heat of the exhaust cylinder wall is reused by the thermoelectric power generation sheet. In order to convert thermal energy into electrical energy with higher efficiency, a heat sink is used to increase the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the thermoelectric power generation chip. The secondary energy utilization can realize the autonomous operation of the exhaust gas circulation system. Exhaust gas circulation system: The system is automatically controlled by single-chip microcomputer STM32F10XX. When the vehicle starts, the automobile exhaust gas would not meet the emission standard. At this time, the exhaust gas is passed into the exhaust gas storage bag, and the temperature of the three-way catalytic converter is monitored by the temperature sensor. When the operating temperature of the three-way catalytic converter is reached, the exhaust passage will be converted by the single-chip microcomputer, and the automobile exhaust gas will be discharged into the air. At the same time, the non- standard exhaust gas in the exhaust gas storage bag is again introduced into the three- way catalytic converter for secondary catalysis by using a micro-extractor. This avoids the situation that the temperature of the three-way catalyst is low and the catalytic efficiency is low, resulting in substandard exhaust emissions.</jats:p>",

These alternative water supply systems are not efficient and viable enough for water supply systems especially in a country with large population. The country is characterized by irregular water supply and water management laws are also weak and mostly not in conformity with today's standard and needs. Proper management and conservation of the water supply services and resource has not given adequate attention by the government. It is, therefore, important to identify such factor that inhibits the implementation of water regulations and proffer a solution to these. In a bid to provide an understanding of the effect of implementing and enforcing stringent water regulation and providing adequate water supply, we compare forecasted population with investment capital expenditure (CAPEX) for water supply by Millennium Development Goal (MDG+) targets. The result shows that in year to come, the country will significantly benefit from investing and providing regular water supply through employment availability and revenue generated through utility water bills, spending less on epidemic of water-borne diseases thereby improving the lives and health of its citizen.</jats:p>"

Micro-algae can be an efficient source of biofuel energy, since it significantly reduces air pollution. In this paper, we develop a micro-algae biofuel supply chain through a two-stage approach. This study aims to commercialize micro-algae as a new source of energy. In the first stage, we utilize the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to determine the best cultivation system, and in the second stage, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented which simultaneously optimizes the economic and environmental objectives. We also propose a robust optimization model to deal with the uncertain nature of the biofuel supply chain. Our analysis on the trade-off between the supply chain’s total cost and unfulfillment demand arrives at interesting managerial insights. Furthermore, to show the effectiveness of the robust optimization model, we compare the performance of the robust and deterministic models, and the results show that the robust model dominates over the deterministic model in all scenarios. Finally, sensitivity analysis on critical parameters is conducted to help decision-makers find the optimal trade-off between investment and its benefits.</jats:p>",

Drawing on resource dependence theory, we explore how environmental orientation affects firm performance via green supply chain integration and the moderating effect of technology turbulence. We test hypotheses using hierarchical regression analysis by collecting data from 264 Chinese firms. The results reveal that both external environmental orientation and internal environmental orientation are positively related to green supply chain integration. Furthermore, green supply chain integration partially mediates the relationships between external environmental orientation and two types of firm performance and fully mediates the relationships between internal environmental orientation and two types of firm performance. The results also indicate that technology turbulence negatively moderates the relationship between internal environmental orientation and green supply chain integration and positively moderates that between external environmental orientation and green supply chain integration.

The research process was conducted in 2018. It was preceded by an extensive literature review of sustainable development and quality management as well as the supply chain. The research tool was a questionnaire sent to top management representatives of organisations operating in  south-eastern Poland and Slovakia who possess a certified system according to ISO 14001. However, analysis of the results does not allow to give clear answers to the research questions. Although the majority of respondents noted a positive impact of the implementation of ISO 14001 on improving environmental actions in the supply chain, its impact on the creation of sustainable supply chains is not so obvious. Based on our research, organisations will be able to more consciously decide on the implementation of the ISO 14001 standard requirements.\n\n</jats:p>",

It necessitates them to install repeaters and communication towers powered by standalone Photovoltaic system in remote rural areas. This paper presents optimization of standalone photovoltaic system maximizing reliability in one of such remotely located Palethar Repeater Station of Nepal Telecom situated in Dadeldhura district of Far-western region. The optimization is carried out using Genetic Algorithm in MATLAB software for given load profile enhancing reliability of the system with maximum reduction of overall system cost. The loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is considered for reflecting the reliability of the system. The paper discusses different optimal configuration of standalone PV system under various values of LPSP after optimization.</jats:p>"

Therefore, conceptual study for two bus test system in MESI involving four generators around Peninsular Malaysia is conducted to perform the economic analysis in term of generation revenue and demand assessment considering existing single buyer model and pool based market model, i.e., pool model, spot market model and the proposed model, in order to identify which market model is superior. As a result, the proposed model managed to decrease the demand payment as it is proportional to generation revenue, even though the generation revenue is at intermediate value and succeed to increase the low and medium generator’s revenue.</jats:p>"

The dynamics of intermittent infrared heating of a cylindrical body was modeled on the basis of an analytical solution of the problem, which takes into account the irregularity of irradiation using a unit Heaviside function and the absorption of electromagnetic energy exponentially, as well as convective heat and mass transfer of the body surface with the environment of constant parameters. The kinetics of body drying has been calculated by analytically solving the problem of moisture diffusion in the material with the third type mass transfer boundary condition provided that phase transformations occur at the surface of the body. An internal mass transfer analysis has been performed with deep drying of granular polymers, on the basis of which the diffusion mechanism of moisture transfer inside the material was substantiated, for which PA-6 polyamide in the form of a cylindrical rod has been chosen. The analysis showed that the drying process of the specified polyamide rod occurs in the intra-diffusion region, characterized by the condition that the moisture content of the rod near its surface immediately after the process starts takes an equilibrium value, which was calculated during the analysis of the drying temperature regime. A numerical simulation of the interconnected process of drying and heating a cylindrical rod of polyamide PA-6 under conditions of a combined convective-infrared power supply was conducted, on the basis of which conclusions were made about the choice of the temperature mode of the process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>In most cases, any abnormal mode in the distribution electrical network is eliminated by the action of relay protection and automation devices (RPA), i.e. - there is a shutdown of the damaged item. It is much more difficult to constantly maintain the normal key indicators of the quality of electrical energy in the network. With the advent of controlled voltage converters based on transistors IGCT and IGBT, static synchronous compensators STATCOM were developed. The main disadvantage of this kind of device is that the control output generated by them is static. Under conditions of increased likelihood of abnormal conditions, their dynamic compensation will be much more effective. In the process of research, the methods of dynamic continuous action of voltage on a sinusoid in a distribution electric network were used. The development of a theoretical approach was accompanied by constant monitoring of existing and developed technical solutions associated with the task set in the work. The object of the study was the distribution electrical network of industrial enterprises with a sharply alternating nature of negative network perturbations. A method has been developed for dynamic suppression of amplitude-phase voltage distortions on the basis of restoring the voltage curve due to the continuous introduction of a compensation voltage curve into the network via a booster transformer. A faster formation of the control action in comparison with analogues allows us to more effectively respond to negative network perturbations in distribution networks, especially if the nature of their occurrence changes dramatically. The proposed method is designed to maintain the quality of electricity within acceptable limits in accordance with the requirements of Russian State Standard 32144-2013.<jats:bold /></jats:italic></jats:p>"

In order to improve currently available products, one needs to understand the underlying cause for the over-prevalence and identify leverage points and methods to selectively reduce the aldehydes in alcohol-free beers. This work gives a short overview on relevant flavour-active wort flavours identified in alcohol-free beer and on their involved chemical formation pathways. Consequently, aldehyde removal technologies in general and in brewing industry are presented. Adsorptive removal of off-flavours by aldehyde-scavenging groups is already widely exploited in the packaging industry and may achieve reduction of these components to near depletion, depending on the process conditions. Its principles are adaptable to recovering off-flavours before filling. Also, supercritical CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>extraction has been successfully applied to separate flavours from food matrices. In brewing, the focus has been set to biologic conversion by restricted fermentation steps, but the reduction of key components of more than 70% is not achieved. Newer developments focus on thermal separation techniques that not only include non-specific physical dealcoholisation but also more selective technologies such as pervaporation, where aldehydes are reduced to near depletion. However, for most unit operations, selectivity and capacity are not yet investigated. Future research should explore the shortcomings of current techniques and overcome bottlenecks either by developing more specific methods for aldehyde removal and/or a clever combination of unit operations to optimise the separation and process integration.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the present researchers assumed that the present state of scarcity of electricity may reveal their higher level of willingness to pay for higher energy efficient ratio as a pay-off of their improved industrial productivity. It is a proven fact that as one of the dominant indicators of national economic development and prosperity, effective electricity management procedures for industry increases significantly the productivity and operational efficiency.&#x0D;\nObjectives: The present paper attempts to explore the willingness of industrialists to pay more for adequate electricity supply for the industrial purpose in the present context of Nepal.&#x0D;\nMethods: Extensive desk review was carried out with a directed intension to develop insights on effective management of energy supply-related activities in industrial sector by analyzing the advances and trends as well as synergies in different intervention areas.&#x0D;\nFindings: A large number of academic and professional research works are carried out by different researchers on electricity management, with focus on identification of energy management models, corresponding to the industrial sector that shows individual attributes, social contexts, as well as participation and knowledge, which can have cumulative effect on WTP.WTP for adequate electricity is one of the key measures for sustainable economic growth for reliable and sensible management of forecasted energy demand.&#x0D;\nConclusions: In spite of plethora of literature on electricity management and WTP, the solutions presented by different researchers are limited in scope. Still many researchers are working on tool contributions, but most of them are only providing solutions for specific regions and communities. There is a need to develop a generic electricity management system with tracing the industrialists’ willingness to pay for adequate electricity supply in a customized manner as a generic solution. The present researcher is hopeful that this work accomplishes this need.&#x0D;\nImplications: Required strict policy regulations at governing level and effective programming at implementation at industry level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Crowdfunding platforms are peer-to-peer two-sided markets that enable amateur entrepreneurs to raise money online for their ventures. However, in allowing practically anyone to enter, such platforms enable opportunistic suppliers to flood the market with offerings, many of which are of low quality. This situation creates choice overload for potential backers and may thus influence their investment decisions. To empirically study the implications of this phenomenon for crowdfunding performance, we use a quasi-natural experiment in the form of an exogenous media shock that occurred on Kickstarter.com. The shock was followed by a sharp increase in the number of campaigns, particularly low-quality ones, offered on the supply side of the market; no such increase was observed on the demand side of the market. These unique conditions enable us to estimate how crowdfunding platforms are affected by the presence of an atypically large number of low-quality campaigns, while controlling for fluctuations in demand. We use two identification strategies, which enable us to control for changes in quality, to show that an increase in low-quality supply significantly decreases the performance of the average crowdfunding campaign, manifested in a lower likelihood of success (reaching funding goals) and less money raised per campaign. We also offer a new measure to estimate campaign quality and study the moderating role of campaign quality in the observed effects. We find that high-quality campaigns are less affected than low-quality campaigns by the influx of low-quality offerings. We discuss theoretical implications as well as managerial implications for entrepreneurs and platform designers.</jats:p>",

The methods of linear algebra, numerical optimization methods, methods of modeling and analysis of established and transient modes are used. Results. A mathematical model is proposed in the form of a circuit diagram of an induction motor with a double-circuit rotor, which allows to take into account the effect of displacement of current and saturation of the steel of the motor magnetic circuit. A technique for determining the parameters of the induction circuit of an induction motor is proposed, which allowsto improve the accuracy of modeling in steady state and transient modes. The mathematical model isreduced to a three-phase coordinate system a, b, c. The results of mathematical modeling have shown that the induction motor asynchronous activation, which takes place in the case of automatic input of the reserve and in other cases, leads to dangerous values of the shock currents and shock torque of the induction motor. Shock currents can also be dangerous to other power supply equipment. Thus, induction motors, when the rotor's own field has not yet gone out, require synchronization before being connected to the network, as well as synchronous machines. Scientific novelty. The mathematical model of the asynchronous motor was improved, taking into account the displacement of current and saturation of the magnetic circuit, the method of determining the parameters of the mathematical model was improved, which allowed to increase the accuracy of the simulation and the reliability of the simulation results. The modes of switching to backup power are simulated and the values of shock current and shock torque of the engine are obtained. Practical meaning. The mathematical model of an induction motor allows to analyze the behavior of induction motors in interaction in the power supply system and to identify the dangerous states of asynchronous motors. The proposed model allows to improve the accuracy of determination of the limits of dangerous states and to increase the reliability of operation of induction motors and power supply systems</jats:p>",

This study investigates the use of streamflows to indicate seasonal hydrological droughts in the Northern Region of Peninsular Malaysia. The seasonal 3-month Streamflow Drought Index (SDI-3) was used to analyse drought characteristics in 2003–2017. The occurrences of all three reported droughts were successfully identified with the SDI-3, with the identified events having a 3-month earlier onset with a 6-month longer duration; a 1-month delayed onset with a 5-month longer duration; and a 1-month delayed onset with a 1-month shorter duration, respectively compared to their actual onset and duration. Along with justifications such as the increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration due to temperature increase, losses for groundwater replenishment and human factors, the SDI-3 was concluded to be suitable for hydrological drought monitoring. Drought characteristics were spatially interpolated using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method, which was cross-validated for applicability with average root mean squared error (RMSE) and R equal to 0.630 and 0.586, respectively. It was found that most of the areas are more prone to short-term droughts with mean severity up to the mild category, except for the central zone which showed more severe droughts, albeit being less likely to occur.</jats:p>",

Resource analysis of solar and wind energy on the Russian Federation territory shows that the use of the hybrid solar-wind power plants is most appropriate. In the case, it is advisable to use batteries and diesel generators to ensure reliable and uninterrupted power supply. Herein is offered a version of making up a structural diagram of power supply system for a small farm with combined power supply from centralized power grids and renewable energy sources. It is shown that the use of such a system can significantly save due to the power not consumed from the grid, and also allows selling excess energy to the power system. Herein is offered a version of building up a structural diagram of an autonomous power supply system based on a hybrid solar-wind power plant and a diesel generator for those regions, where there is no distributive electrical network. A design of a vortex wind power installation has been developed for practical use as part of the considered options for power supply schemes, which allows using small winds and low-potential thermal upward flows, reducing low-frequency vibration and noise, placing it on the top of industrial buildings with ease of installation, maintenance and repair.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The traditional urban water management systems of Bombay (Mumbai) city consisted of tanks and wells constructed by charitable people of all creeds. But the entry of hydraulic engineering techniques, via the construction of Vihar Lake in 1860, ostensibly to supply pure and plentiful water heralded their doom. The modern but intrinsically flawed water supply system, unplanned urban development and the ensuing insanitation aggravated cholera and malaria epidemics, endemic to the city, threatening its imperial trade. This, and the desire to create sanitized colonies through town planning, encouraged Bombay municipality to attack the city’s tanks and wells, vilified as sources of pollution, despite protests of the local people. Based on an examination of archival sources, this article traces the history of colonial Bombay’s water management policy from 1860 and examines its impact on the city’s water inheritance, up to Indian independence in 1947. It aims to raise awareness levels about the potential importance of the surviving heritage, at a time when the spectre of insanitation and water scarcity haunts Mumbai. </jats:p>",

Kilang dibangun untuk mengolah minyak mentah dengan variasi jenis dan harga minyak mentah serta pergeseran permintaan yang terjadi untuk produk refinery.

To settle the problem of untimely collection of rainfall runoff caused by the uncertainty of rainfall, an unattended rainfall runoff collector with remote control was developed. According to the whole system, when the trigger device detects rainfall runoff, an energy-saving circuit connects, and the sampler is powered. At the same time, state and position information are sent to the mobile phone through the communication module. Then, the mobile phone sends instructions and starts an order back to the sampler through texts based on different requirements. The instructions and start order are then passed to the single-chip micyoco (SCM) control system, which also occurs via the communication module. A disconnected signal will be sent to the energy-saving circuit after the rainfall runoff collection. This signal will power off the sampler at the end. Test experiments showed that the maximum sampling error of the sampler developed in this paper was 1′02″, and the minimum sampling error was 22″.</jats:p>",

The “Monday Effect,” that is lower productivity and higher error rates on Mondays compared with other days of the week, has been demonstrated in the finance and industrial relations literature. Using a database of 12 months of purchases from the General Services Administration (GSA) of the U.S. government (a key distributor of goods to government purchasers), we show that, indeed, performance is lower on Mondays compared with other weekdays in terms of order fulfillment and order cycle time. However, when purchasers use the GSA’s internet-based electronic market instead of using manual ordering procedures, the fulfillment gap between Mondays and other weekdays narrows considerably, demonstrating the value of information technology in smoothing distribution flows. By acknowledging the Monday Effect, distributors can thus plan for these weekly fluctuations and use information technology to improve service levels. </jats:p>",

A potential disruption could lead to supply shortages with severe consequences for the European economy and society.

A dedicated large-scale dataset of the European natural gas network from publicly available information sources is assembled first. The spatial coverage, completeness and resolution allows analyzing the behavior of this geospatial infrastructure network (including consumption) and its components under likely disruptive events, such as earthquakes, and/or technical failures. Using the developed system state simulation engine, the disruption impact is mapped. The results show that storage facilities cannot in all cases compensate for a pipeline disruption. Moreover, critical pipelines, such as the Transitgas pipeline crossing the Alps and the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline bringing natural gas from Northern Africa, are identified. To analyze the pipelines with high impact on the system performance, a detailed scenario analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation resulting in supply grade mapping is conducted and presented for the case of Italy. Overall, it can be concluded that locations with a dead-end, sole supply, and without storage facility nearby, are remarkably exposed to natural gas supply losses.</jats:p>"

This research was designed to assess the efficiency of nanoadsorbent for removal of fluoride levels from water. For this purpose, calcium carbonate nanoparticles (average particle size 14.6 nm) were prepared and later applied for effective removal of fluoride from simulated as well as real drinking water (DW) samples collected from different areas of Lahore, Pakistan. The particles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Physico-chemical parameters were studied in batch mode which revealed high adsorption capacity (i.e. 754.36 mg g−1) at room temperature and neutral pH within 10 min. The kinetic isotherms (general, pseudo-first, and pseudo-second order), diffusion studies (intra-particle diffusion and particle diffusion models), and adsorption models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Liu, and Redlich–Peterson) were also applied to evaluate the suitability of adsorption process. The applicability of nanoadsorbent to fluoride-contaminated real DW samples led to 98–100% efficacy of defluoridation.</jats:p>",

The use of this method allows the management of biogas power plants based on internal combustion engines, depending on changes in the load without power reserve for the time of possible displacement of technological operations. Unlike the power backup method, there is no additional power loss at the time of the reservation, the possible incorrect switches of electrical equipment that do not correspond to the normalized schedule are excluded, there is work in changing the order of operations and the order of switching on the equipment. The use of the method improves the energy efficiency of the biogas plant and also increases the reliability of the livestock farm's autonomous electricity supply system. The calculations of the use of this method for the cattle farm prove its energy efficiency in the conditions of autonomous electricity supply.\nDeveloped approaches to tracking the load schedule of the livestock farm allow for the management of biogas power plants depending on changes in the magnitude of the load without power reserve for the time of possible displacement of technological operations. The use of the proposed method is especially relevant for autonomous power systems. The calculations of using this method for a cattle farm testify to its effectiveness, in particular for a small cattle farm with a herd of 60 valid cows, 11 dry and 29 heads of young animals kept in the winter-stall period, the total saving is 82.8 kW ∙ h day.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background Rapid control of cholera outbreaks is a significant challenge in overpopulated urban areas. During late-2017, Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, experienced an increase in cholera cases that showed potential to spread throughout the city. A novel targeted water and hygiene response strategy was implemented to quickly stem the outbreak. Methods We describe the first implementation of the cluster grid response strategy carried out in the community during the cholera outbreak in Kinshasa, in which water and hygiene response activities targeted cholera case clusters. Interventions, which focused on emergency water supply, household water treatment and safe storage, home disinfection and hygiene promotion, were organized using a grid approach. We also performed a preliminary community trial study to assess the temporal pattern of the outbreak, before and after response interventions were implemented. Cholera surveillance databases from the Ministry of Health were analyzed to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the outbreak using epidemic curves and cartography. Results From January 2017 to November 2018, a total of 1,712 suspected cholera cases were reported in Kinshasa. During this period, the health zones most affected included Binza Météo, Limeté, Kokolo, Kintambo and Kingabwa. Following implementation of the response strategy, the weekly cholera case numbers in Binza Météo, Kintambo and Limeté decreased by an average of 57% in two weeks and 86% in four weeks. The total weekly case numbers throughout Kinshasa Province dropped by 71% at four weeks after the outbreak peak. Conclusion During the 2017-2018 period, Kinshasa experienced a sharp increase in cholera cases that showed potential to rapidly spread throughout the city. To contain the outbreak, water and hygiene response interventions targeted case households, nearby neighbors and public areas in case clusters using a grid approach. Following implementation of the response, the outbreak in Kinshasa was quickly brought under control. A similar approach may be useful to quickly interrupt cholera transmission in other urban settings.</jats:p>"

Intensity of rainstorms is expected to increase in Northern Europe, and sealing off surfaces reduces natural stormwater management. Both trends increase stormwater peak runoff volume that urban stormwater systems (UDS) have to tackle. Pipeline systems have typically limited capacity, therefore measures must be foreseen to reduce runoff from new developed areas to existing UDS in order to avoid surcharge. There are several solutions available to tackle this challenge, e.g. low impact development (LID), best management practices (BMP) or stormwater real time control measures (RTC). In our study, a new concept of a smart in-line storage system is developed and evaluated on the background of traditional in-line and off-line detention solutions. The system is operated by real time controlled actuators with an ability to predict rainfall dynamics. This solution does not need an advanced and expensive centralised control system; it is easy to implement and install. The concept has been successfully tested in a 12.5 ha urban development area in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. Our analysis results show a significant potential and economic feasibility in the reduction of peak flow from dense urban areas with limited free construction space.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Scientific support for measures aimed at providing centralized water supply to rural settlements has been entrusted to the Department of Agricultural Water Supply of UkrNIIGiM (now the Institute of Water Problems and Land Reclamation of NAAS) since 1991.\r\nThe main task of this department of the institute was to develop scientific and technical solutions for reliable supply of all consumers in rural areas with water in the required quantity, of the proper quality and with the necessary free pressure while minimizing capital and operating costs, rational and economic use of water resources and environmental protection from pollution by the wastewaters.\r\nSuggested scientific approaches:\r\n- decentralization of the withdraw processes, purification, supply and distribution of water with the splitting into drinking and technological water;\r\n- reliable supply of high quality drinking water and technological water with low cost;\r\n- creation of closed water supply systems at agricultural enterprises with minimal consumption of fresh water and use of treated wastewater for technical needs or irrigation of agricultural crops, and sludge - for soils fertilizing;\r\n- development of new water treatment technologies based on the reproduction of intensified factors of the biogeochemical cycle of water in the course of its natural self-purification in order to reduce the cost of the water treatment process and increase the barrier capacity of existing structures.\r\n- reliable protection of territories against flooding by filtrated waters from reservoirs using these waters for agricultural water supply and irrigation;\r\n- optimization of the interoperability of all interacting structures with systems to minimize the per unit energy consumption for water transportation.\r\nProspects. One of the main fundamental theoretical questions that need further development is new approaches to filtering theory. Since the time of D.M. Mintz this research direction have been stagnated. This is especially felt in domestic developments, despite the fact that there has been a significant breakthrough in the creation of filter materials (mainly in the case of filter materials that are lighter than water, which were not used at the time of D.M. Mintz). A breakthrough in the development of measuring apparatus has also taken place, and it now allows measuring the electrokinetic and dimensional characteristics of colloids in water source and filter loading grains, which makes it possible to consider the filtration process and especially the adsorption of colloids on the surface of filter loading grains from a different angle.\r\nConclusions. The results of scientific researches carried out in the laboratory of agricultural water supply for 28 years of its existence, and were implemented at the existing local and group agricultural water supply systems. Materials of scientific researchers are published in 4 monographs and more than 100 articles and conference materials in domestic and foreign scientific journals. The proposed solutions are patented in 46 patents for inventions. Using the research of the laboratory staff, 3 doctoral dissertations (V.P. Khoruzhyi, V.G. Novokhatnii, and D.V. Charnyi) and 14 PhD theses were defended.\r\n </jats:p>"

Groundwater investigated in the present study is from the Albian formations which are considered as a major source for drinking and irrigation water. The objective of this study is to identify the different hydrochemical processes controlling the groundwater mineralization. For this purpose, chemical analyses were performed on 31 wells sampled during May 2014. The chemical study (total dissolved solids (TDS), Piper, chemical correlation) allowed the origins of groundwater mineralization to be identified. The dissolution of evaporate minerals, precipitation of carbonate minerals, and ion exchange reactions have been identified as major sources of mineralization processes. Anthropogenic processes due to human activities (sewage efﬂuents and agricultural fertilizers) also contribute to the mineralization of the water. The results of principal component analysis also confirm that both natural and anthropogenic processes contribute to the chemical composition of groundwater in the study area.</jats:p>",

Purchase cost for the manufacturer is dependent on inventory lot size, production cost of the manufacturer is dependent on production rate. Purchase cost of the retailer is dependent on demand rate of the customer. Idle time cost has been considered. Multi-item has been considered in this supply chain inventory model. Average cost in integrated inventory model has been calculated per unit time. The formulated problem has been solved by various techniques like as Fuzzy programming technique with hyperbolic membership functions (FPTHMF), Fuzzy non-linear programming technique (FNLP) and Fuzzy additive goal programming technique (FAGP),  weighted Fuzzy non-linear programming technique (WFNLP) and weighted Fuzzy additive goal programming technique (WFAGP). A numerical example is provided to justify the proposed model. Finally graphical illustrations are considered and its sensitivity analysis is provided to test feasibility of the model.</jats:p>"

There are methodologies developed to assist companies assessing their SCS performance. They are usually applied to large-sized companies, where there is a well-defined structure. Nevertheless, this scenario is generally not observed in micro and small-size enterprises (MSEs), where a limited number of employees accumulates functions, and there is no clear division of departments. Therefore, the main aim of this work was to adapt a SCS evaluation methodology to MSE. A case study was analysed to demonstrate the proposed adaptation. The proposed methodology allowed the manager to identify and understand the relationships between the objectives in a logical way. In addition, it allowed a better assessment of the context, acting as a guide in the strategy formulation process.</jats:p>"

The current study was carried out to find proper composition of filter media using locally available materials, which acclimate to the special/local climate, environmental and geographical conditions in Yangtze River Delta region. Results revealed that sand with discontinuous gradation and containing a certain amount of clay led to unsatisfactory hydraulic performance (hydraulic conductivity ranged from 423 mm/h to 1,054 mm/h, and 1,500 mm/h to 29 mm/h). In contrast, a mixture of locally available sand, which consisted of continuous gradation of coarse sand (40–70%, by mass), fine sand (0–40%, by mass), very fine sand (10–60%, by mass) and nutrient soil (0–3%, by mass), had a hydraulic conductivity ranging from 200 to 400 mm/h and relatively stable structure. During the 70 days' flooding test, the hydraulic conductivity changed in the first 20 days due to the migration of particles (mainly &amp;lt;0.6 mm) and then became stable; the stable value was close to the initial. Moreover, easy access and simple production processes made it easier to promote. Findings could be used as a guideline for implementation of bioretention systems and selection of locally available and effective filter material.</jats:p>",

The findings draw upon interview data of 179 married couples in rural Rwanda. Of 138 women who experienced side effects at the time of the survey, 54 women reported that such side effects impacted their agricultural labour supply and housework from 4.96 to 2.23 hours and 3.12 to 2.19 hours, respectively. The decrease in the women’s labour supply altered the intrahousehold labour allocation. On average, their husbands engaged in farming for 5.54 hours and housework for 0.80 hours per day. When the women were unable to supply labour, their husbands tended to allocate more time to housework and less time to farming. These findings infer that side effects could lead to the loss of women’s bargaining power in their family and access to resources by reducing their labour supply and contribution to the household economy, and these outcomes need to be further investigated in the future. Additionally, this study emphasizes/highlights the imperious need for contraceptive switching and side effect counselling for couples to mitigate potential side effects.Key Words: Hormonal contraceptive, women’s labour supply, family planning, household economy</jats:p>"

These organizations cannot usually respond to the disaster on their own, and therefore, all actors involved in relief efforts should have end-to-end synchronization in order to provide relief effectively and efficiently. Consequently, to smoothen the flow of relief operation, a shared understanding of critical success factors in humanitarian supply chain serves as a pre-requisite for successful relief operation. Therefore, any member of the humanitarian supply chain might disrupt this synchronization by neglecting one or several of these critical success factors. However, in this study, we try to investigate how faith-based and non-faith-based relief organizations treat these critical success factors. Moreover, we also try to identify any differences between Islamic and Christian relief organizations in identifying and prioritizing these factors. To achieve the objective of this study, we used a two-stage approach; in the first stage, we collected the critical success factors from existing humanitarian literature. Whereas, in the second stage, using an online questionnaire, we collected data on the importance of selected factors from humanitarian relief organizations from around the world in collaboration with World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (WANGO). Later, responses were analyzed to answer the research questions using non-parametric Binomial and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests. Test results indicate that for RQ1, two but all factors are significant for successful relief operation. For RQ2, we found significant differences for some CSF among faith-based and non-faith-based relief organizations. Similarly for RQ3, we found significant differences for some CSF among Islamic and Christian relief organizations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the last 30 years Romania has experienced a revival of church attendance, and a significant increase in the number of houses of worship, having the highest rate of construction in Europe. The paper provides theoretical arguments that support the idea that the increase in church attendance has roots in the fast growth in the number of houses of worship, which provide easier access to religious services, and help the development of parish communities, which are highly relevant for Eastern Orthodoxy. This growth is the outcome of the privileged position of the Romanian Orthodox Church (ROC), which received funding from the central government and in-kind support from local authorities to extend the ROC's infrastructure, in exchange for active support in the political arena granted by the ROC to the party in power. Different from other religious organizations in Romania or other Orthodox churches in post-communist societies, the ROC is a powerful organization, and played its cards to get privileges from the political power during the communist and post-communist eras, which made the ROC more visible and attractive to the Romanian public. The research uses a composition of pooled datasets derived from 18 national and international surveys in Romania, covering a time span of 27 years, from 1991 to 2018, and employs multilevel logistic regression. The hypothesis regarding the relationship between the growth in church attendance and the increasing number of houses of worship is supported by the empirical data. Data have shown that growth in the number of houses of worship may fuel religious revivals, even if the offer is homogenous, and comes from nearly only one religious provider. </jats:p>",

The hydrological scenarios were developed from the literature on climate change projections. This paper recommends adaptations for community members, service providers, and the municipality based on the impact assessment. Chorkor and Shiabu are vulnerable to an increase in rainfall because of the lack of adequate solid waste management and hydrological sound drains. Shiabu's topography and the indiscriminate sand mining along its beach make it vulnerable to an increase in sea level. Looking beyond Chorkor and Shiabu's community boundaries, the urban water utility which supplies water vendors in both communities may be severely impacted by a decrease in rainfall, which would lead to water scarcity and a shortage in hydroelectricity. Regardless of which climate change scenario emerges, many of the recommended adaptations are good water management practice, for example, increasing the number of household connections and reducing non-revenue water. Putting climate change high on the agenda has the potential to generate additional funding to help address Chorkor and Shiabu's water and sanitation problems, and climate-proof services for the future. However, the study method does not address the governance of these adaptations.</jats:p>",

This essay summarizes the contributions of the special issue articles, highlighting their focus on additive manufacturing and the encapsulation of design and production information in a digital artifact. We conceptualize the digital artifact as containing the digital genes of the associated physical object. Digital encapsulation thus involves the integration of product design information with additional information on how that design is to be translated into a physical object, delivered to the customer, and used. Building on insights from the special issue articles, we identify three pathways by which digital encapsulation affects OSCM practice, as well as theory elaboration and extension. First, digital encapsulation allows each unique digitally encapsulated artifact to be acted on independently by OSCM systems. Second, digital encapsulation enables the redistribution of activities across organizational and geographic landscapes. Third, digital encapsulation facilitates interactivity of the digital artifact with external environment inputs. We conclude with a number of directions for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Resumo Cada vez mais têm sido estudadas formas de minimizar gastos com energia e/ou de obter formas alternativas de geração, principalmente pela diminuição de oferta hídrica em diversos locais. Nos sistemas de abastecimento de água, são altos os gastos com energia, principalmente nas estações elevatórias. Em sistemas que fazem a distribuição de água por gravidade, não é rara a utilização de válvulas redutoras de pressão em pontos especí- ficos em que é necessária essa redução para garantir condições favoráveis de transporte de água na tubulação. Nesse sentido, ocorre dissipação de energia que poderia ser aproveitada no próprio sistema. Tendo em vista esse aproveitamento energético, esse estudo tem como objetivo determinar de forma teórica a potência gerada por uma bomba funcionando como turbina em locais onde há excedente de pressão, tomando por base dados de um sistema teórico de abastecimento de água de município de pequeno porte. Os resultados mostram que a alternativa é tecnicamente viável, gerando 2,2 KW de potência e 16,4 MW/ano de energia, que poderia ser uti- lizada no próprio sistema, em pontos onde seria necessário bombeamento, seja na captação ou na própria rede de abastecimento, em transição de zonas baixas para altas. Palavras-chave: Eficiência energética. Bomba funcionando como turbina (BFT). Abstract It has increasingly been studied ways to minimize energy costs and to obtain alternative forms of generation, mainly by the reduction of water supply in various locations. In water supply systems, energy costs are high, especially in pumping stations. In systems that make the distribution of water using gravity, it is not uncommon to use pres- sure reducing valves at specific points at which this reduction is necessary to ensure favorable conditions of water transport in the pipe. In this sense, there is dissipation of energy that could be used in the system itself. In view of this energy use, this study aims to determine theoretically the power generated by a pump functioning as turbine in places where there is excess pressure, based on data from a theoretical system of a small town water supply. From the results, the alternative proved to be technically feasible, with power generated at 2.2 KW and energy at 16.4 MW/year, which could be used in the system itself, at points where pumping would be required, either on capture or in the supply network, in transition from low to high areas.

Universally both forms of energy are often described as key elements of a transition to a cleaner and more secure energy future (low-carbon economy), but regionally much of the current discourse considers each in isolation or concentrates on the competitive impacts of one on the other. The paper outlines several potential avenues and further research trends of synergies between the natural gas, a proven fast-reacting fossil fuel, and RES as seen from viewpoints of the Baltic energy sector sustainability and security of energy supply.</jats:p>",

The influence of aquifer conditions on the degradation processes of pesticides and nitrates is considered as a potential removal mechanism of compound residues in alluvial groundwater. Nitrate concentration was analyzed in 144 groundwater samples in the Kovin-Dubovac drainage system and 63 samples at the Ključ groundwater source. The occurrence of 15 pesticides was monitored in groundwater in a total of 34 samples in the Kovin-Dubovac area and 14 samples at the Ključ groundwater source. Concentrations of selected pesticides and nitrates were monitored in eight samples from the Danube in the Kovin-Dubovac area and 15 samples from Velika Morava at the Ključ groundwater source. Both selected locations are agricultural areas. Results show that concentrations of nitrates (NO3−) are much higher in oxic groundwater conditions compared with concentrations in typical anoxic conditions. The opposite is the case for the concentration of pesticides that occurred in surface and groundwater samples. These results are very important for a better understanding of the self-purification potential of alluvial aquifers and assessment of aquifer condition influence, especially oxic or anoxic conditions, on the occurrence and mitigation of selected agrochemical residues in groundwaters.</jats:p>",

Six ruminally-cannulated crossbred heifers were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 28 d periods. Dietary treatments were either corn (73% of diet DM; CON), 53:20 corn:wheat blend (20W) or 33:40 corn:wheat blend (40W) as the major fermentable carbohydrate source. Diets were isonitrogenous (12% CP; DM basis). Feed intake was measured daily. Indwelling pH logger were used to measure ruminal pH (d 22 to 28) and ruminal fluid was collected from d 26 to 28 to determine fermentation characteristics, as were feces and urine to measure N excretion. Data was analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS. Dry matter and N intake tended to be lower (P ≤ 0.07) for heifers fed the 40W compared to the CON and 20W diets. There was no diet effect (P = 0.15) on total VFA concentration; however, the duration and area for pH &amp;lt; 5.5 tended to be longer (P = 0.07) and greater (P = 0.096), respectively, for heifers fed the 20W and 40W compared to the CON diet. There was no diet effect (P ≥ 0.44) on ruminal ammonia concentration and total urine N excretion (g and % of N intake). However, urine urea N (UUN) excretion as a percentage of total urine N tended to be lower (P = 0.05) in heifers fed the 20W and 40W compared to the CON diet. In summary, although altering RFC supply by feeding increasing amounts of wheat resulted in a decrease in UUN excretion, it also caused a decrease in ruminal pH that possibly compromised DM intake.</jats:p>",

The watershed and streamlines were delineated in ArcGIS, and the hydrologic analyses were performed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The sensitivity analysis on runoff parameters was performed, using the Sequential Uncertainties FItting Ver. 2 algorithm, in the SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) program. The results indicated that the sensitivity of runoff parameters, watershed surface area, and elevations changed under different DEM resolutions. As the distribution of slopes changed using different DEMs, surface parameters were most affected. Furthermore, higher amounts of runoff were generated when DEMs with finer resolutions were implemented. In comparison with the observed value of 8 m3/s at the watershed outlet, the 12.5 m DEM showed more realistic results (6.77 m3/s). Comparatively, the 12.5 m DEM generated 0.74% and 2.73% more runoff compared with the 30 and 90 m DEMs, respectively. The findings of this study indicate that in order to reduce computation time, researchers may use DEMs with coarser resolutions at the expense of minor decreases in accuracy.</jats:p>",

Considering the main capacity of the substation, a weighted Voronoi diagram is generated, which makes the result of the power supply area division more scientific and reasonable.

These substances are stable and not easily biodegradable, resulting in very high detection values of chemical oxygen demand. However, under natural conditions, the dissolved oxygen demand is not as high. Using experimental values to evaluate river water quality and the impact of human activities on water quality is thus unscientific and does not meet national development goals. In this study, the potential sources of high-concentration chemical oxygen demand in river water in two areas exposed to virtually no anthropogenic activities and strongly affected by humic substances, were analysed. The chemical oxygen demand contributed by humic substances (COD-HSs) was quantified using three methods. The results of water quality monitoring in 2017 and 2018 revealed that the chemical oxygen demand concentrations (5–44 mg/L) predominantly exceeded the standard (15 mg/L). The study results suggest that COD-HSs should be considered separately for objective evaluation and management of water quality, particularly in areas that are seriously affected by COD-HSs, to provide a scientific basis for formulating sustainable water quality management policies.</jats:p>",

A two-dimensional water environment model for Poyang Lake was developed in the framework of the Finite Volume Method and calibrated against the field investigated data. Four typical months in a common-water year were determined for numerical experiments to investigate the temporal and spatial water quality driving mechanisms in Poyang Lake. The results suggested that boundary input and self-purification have the greatest effect on dominating the water quality in Poyang Lake, followed by atmospheric deposition and sediment release. The driving weights of these four factors are 57.2%, 26.5%, 9.3%, and 7.0%, respectively. However, the impact on lake water quality of external water quality, aquatic ecosystem structure, precipitation distribution, and meteorological conditions, which are attributed to the disparities in geographical situation, varied significantly with seasons and locations.</jats:p>",

In 2014, the World Health Organization issued “Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Household Fuel Combustion”, which recommended a shift to cleaner fuels rather than promotion of technologies that more efficiently combust solid fuels. This study fills an important gap in the literature on transitions to household use of clean cooking energy by reviewing supply chain considerations for clean fuel options in low‐ and middle‐income countries. For the purpose of this study, we consider electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), alcohol fuels, biogas, and compressed biomass pellets burned in high performing gasifier stoves to be clean fuel options. Each of the clean fuels reviewed in this study, as well as the supply of electricity, presents both constraints and opportunities for enhanced production, supply, delivery, and long‐term sustainability and scalability in resource‐poor settings. These options are reviewed and discussed together with policy and regulatory considerations to help in making these fuel and energy choices available and affordable. Our hope is that researchers, government officials and policy makers, and development agencies and investors will be aided by our comparative analysis of these clean household energy choices.</jats:p>",

The problem of clean water is one of the most important places in the solution of this problem because surface waters are the most sensitive natural environment link. Without careful monitoring of the state indicated by the latter, it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of adverse environmental situations, maintain the health of the nation and ensure the quality of life. Based on the results of the analysis of indicators of the quality of the water source, the required volumes of water for the consumer and the requirements of the consumer for the produced water, a decision is made on the technology for purifying the required water. Special climatic conditions (sharply continental climate, high summer temperatures, low water levels, etc.) negatively affect the quality indicators of the water source. The article presents the results of a study of surface water by microbiological indicators and phytoplankton. Water was investigated in the area of the channel-type surface water intake structure located in the Astrakhan region on the Volga. It is revealed that the river belongs to the category of dirty. Moreover, there is a positive trend in the development of this process. Applied water treatment technologies are not able to fulfill the tasks to ensure a safe drinking regime. It is known that chlorination of water during water treatment does not affect the removal of metabolites secreted by massively developing species of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The recommendations for improving water treatment facilities are made.</jats:p>",

The highest ubiquitous organizing principles in infrastructure design are modular idea and symmetry, both of which are of the utmost importance. Symmetry is a substantial principle in the manufacturing industry. Symmetrical procedures act as the structural apparatus for manufacturing design. The rapid growth of population needs outstrip infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railway lines, commercial, residential buildings, etc. Numerous underground facilities are also installed to fulfill different requirements of the people. In these facilities one of the most important facility is water supply pipelines. Therefore, it is essential to regularly analyze the water supply pipelines’ risk index in order to escape from economic and human losses. In this paper, we proposed a simplified hierarchical fuzzy logic (SHFL) model to reduce the set of rules. To this end, we have considered four essential factors of water supply pipelines as input to the proposed SHFL model that are: leakage, depth, length and age. Different numbers of membership functions are defined for each factor according to its distribution. The proposed SHFL model takes only 95 rules as compared to the traditional mamdani fuzzy logic method that requires 1225 rules. It is very hard and time consuming for experts to design 1225 rules accurately and precisely. Further, we proposed a Do-it-Yourself (DIY) system for the proposed SHFL method. The purpose of the DIY system is that one can design the FIS model according to his or her need.</jats:p>"

Currently, cascade water supply systems are mainly designed based on practical experiences or requirements of existing standards/guidelines that, in fact, are not specifically for skyscrapers. However, thorough studies on cascade water supply system designs are still limited in the literature. This study proposes mathematical models and uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the design flow rate of a typical cascade water supply system that feeds various appliances in a residential skyscraper in Hong Kong. Graphs that showed the correlations between the inflow rate in the supply pipe and water volume in the tank are obtained. While tank storage volume is confirmed, the design flow rate of the cascade water supply system can be determined from these graphs. The proposed mathematical models can also be applied to evaluate the design flow rate of cascade water supply systems in other types of skyscrapers (e.g., office, commercial building) as well as with the changes in water demand patterns in the models.</jats:p>"

However, this power supply mode has the disadvantage of the 10kV side three-phase unbalance problem. In response to this problem, the paper proposes a new 220V single-phase low-voltage power supply system based on a three-input single-phase transformer. The power supply system consists of a three-phase transformer and a two-phase transformer and a phase-to-phase power controller. The three-phase to two-phase transformer is used to realize two low-voltage single-phase power supply, and the phase-to-phase power controller is used to realize the negative sequence and harmonic control of the low voltage side. This power supply mode is suitable for large-capacity low-voltage power supply systems with single-phase load intensive. The paper analyzes the transformation theory and control strategy of the power supply mode. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed technical scheme and control strategy are verified by simulation analysis.</jats:p>",

Methods. 6 patients who underwent pancreas transplantation with isolated splenic artery blood supply were examined. The recipients were 3 men and 3 women, the median age was 36.5 [31; 42] years. To evaluate the state, quality of transplant perfusion and their function, the laboratory data, doppler ultrasound, measurement of blood flow volume (CT-perfusion) and treatment outcomes were assessed. Results. Based on the results of investigations, adequate pancreatic graft blood supply through the splenic artery alone was detected. Pancreatic transplant function in all patients was satisfactory, blood glucose levels remained within normal values. Hospital mortality was 0%. Conclusion. Successful transplantation of pancreaticoduodenal complex with isolated splenic artery supply is technically possible due to the presence of intraorganic arterial collaterals.</jats:p>"

Although the relationship between the supply network structure and innovation has been investigated, the link between supply network complexity and a firm's innovation remains unexplored. By employing transaction cost economics and the concept of a recombinatory search, we propose that the complexity dimensions (horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity) of a supply network impact the innovation performance of a firm and that such relationships are moderated by a strategic emphasis on value creation and the influence of the firm over the supply network. With a large‐scale network data of 201 firms across six industries and 20 countries, we take a robust empirical approach that accounts for endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity and intrafirm error correlation to test our theory. We find strong support for a nonlinear relationship (with diminishing growth) between both horizontal and vertical complexity with respect to innovation performance. We find that spatial complexity is negatively related to innovation performance. Additionally, we find that a firm's strategic emphasis and its influence indeed moderates the link between the complexity dimensions and innovation performance. Based on our findings, we offer specific managerial guidance for the effective implementation of sourcing practices.</jats:p>",

Among the measures aimed at improving the quality of drying, the productivity of drying plants while reducing energy consumption, we can single out the direction associated with improving the design of chambers and their heat supply systems. Thus, the relevant areas of improving the energy efficiency of drying lumber is the use of the heat engineering method to improve the functional characteristics of the heat supply systems of the chambers.

The main findings from the study are lead time changes on the entire system directly impact the inventory of the entire stages in the system. Furthermore, the disruption occurence produces an adverse effect on supply chain performance for a period longer than the actual period of the disruption and likewise, influence system performance. The study further identifies that by incorporating safety stock as a mitigation strategy in the event of a supply disruption, will significantly reduce the disruption impact.

After analyzing the hot water system operation in a residential apartment building, being previously a hostel, the reason for the temperature regime violation was determined. In connection with the building status change, the residents number has significantly decreased, the service block, which led to a change in water consumption conditions has been eliminated. In addition, the requirements for minimum water temperature in centralized hot water systems have changed. The question of using a dead-end hot water supply system possibility, provided by the project or its reconstruction into the circulation network, was considered. The studies were conducted in accordance with the methodology described in MIC 4.3.2900-11 “The centralized hot water supply systems hot water temperature measurement”. There was a discrepancy in the temperature coolant standard indicators at the dismantling points on different floors of the building. The difference in temperature at the input (the heat meter and thermometer readings) and at the end user is associated with additional water cooling in the supply pipes of the domestic hot water heating system. When transferring the public buildings to housing stock, it is necessary to revise not only water consumption rates, but also the hot water supply scheme in general. The lack of circulation leads to waste of hot water and increases the cost to the consumer. To ensure the required temperature standards for a full day in a dead-end hot water supply system, which is provided for by the project, continuous dismantling of the water is required, which is difficult to achieve with a changed building status. The resolution of the problem is possible only when the domestic hot water heating system is switched to the circulation mode with the circulation piping and the circulation pump installation.</jats:p>",

An assessment of age uncertainties resulting from analytical errors using a Monte Carlo approach and an analytical solution for error propagation shows good agreement. We also investigate errors due to a violation of model assumptions by variable focusing of deep‐sea sediments by means of a simulated core. Finally, we use real examples from independently dated sediment cores containing carbonate, using previously existing <jats:sup>230</jats:sup>Th data, to test the approach. The consideration of the systematic errors and the examples suggests that the uncertainties are smallest in the central part of the record and that the variability of focusing conditions controls the accuracy of the <jats:sup>230</jats:sup>Th CRS dates. Our own example demonstrates an excellent agreement of the <jats:sup>230</jats:sup>Th CRS method with independent age constraints, adding an important tool for dating marine records that does not depend on the presence of carbonate.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the use of supply chain mapping by actors in the UK food system to anticipate problematic futures. Supply chain mapping as an anticipatory practice is a response to a recent food scare that has reinforced concerns about the safety, quality, and authenticity of foodstuffs circulating within supply chains. Our analysis of this novel set of mapping practices is based around the visibility of the supply chain that they offer and the ways in which this is generated or made to relate to future problems as both objects and processes. Supply chain maps as objects can induce surprise and uncertainty over the future, but they can also demonstrate responsibility for risk or be a means of allocating and assuring accountability for future problems. Looking at mapping as a process highlights both the difficulty of mapping supply chains and what is actually involved in using supply chain maps to give form to potential future problems. We characterise both of these processes as navigational, based on creating and reading “signposts” that allow risky food futures to be plotted as trajectories in space and time. Supply chain maps describe a process as well as a set of spatial relations, and navigating futures with these maps is a skilled task involving accumulated knowledge about food risks and learning to recognise supply chain maps as encompassing time and space. Our analysis highlights how things not made visible by the map, but present through those involved in the mapping, are as important in its anticipatory use as the things made visible. Maps are part of a wider process of making sense of risky food chain futures that is filled with uncertainty and power relations.</jats:p>",

The reservoirs are made of traditional building materials that require large capital expenditures, and most important, they are ineffective in protecting alluvial stations from the indication of various species young fish and in the distribution of the heated water on the water surface of the cooler reservoir. Based on the results of innovative and constructive studies of lightweight water intake structures and jet distribution structures made of high-strength synthetic fabric materials of domestic production, the soft floating structures (SFSs) have been developed. They provide protection of pumping units from young fish with an efficiency up to 90% as well as the environmentally necessary management of the distribution of heated waters on the surface of the reservoir-cooler.

In this study, six enhanced submerged media together with four HRTs were designed for bioretention cells to treat the highly nitrogenous river water in Tai lake basin in Yangtze River delta, China. Results revealed that bioretention with activated carbon has the highest removal of nitrate (NO3−-N) (93–96%) compared with surfactant-modified activated carbon (SMAC), surfactant-modified zeolite (SMZ), zeolite, fly ash and ceramsite. Although the SMAC had the best absorption for NO3−-N and could desorb NO3−-N when its concentration was low in the submerged layer, the desorbed surfactant could inhibit the growth of denitrifying bacteria, which leads to low removal efficiency (49–66%). The dynamic balancing of NO3−-N desorption and denitrifying system restrain in the SMAC device was observed and explained. The best activated carbon-gravel proportion in the submerged layer was 1:1 (150 mm). Such design could ensure the stable and efficient NO3−-N removal rate (93–94%) under high inflow concentration (28.9 mg/L) and high hydraulic loading (8.2 cm/h).</jats:p>",

China is a big agricultural country, especially the three eastern provinces, which has driven the growth of agricultural economy and also demanded energy consumption demand. So far, the energy constraints of the agricultural industry have approached from the “flow constraint” state to the “stock constraint” state. Based on this, the paper takes Changchun City as an example, implements the rural revitalization strategy, gives play to the driving role of the central city, insists on coordinating urban and rural development, continuously increases the investment in modern agriculture, strengthens the agricultural industrial policy support system, and accelerates the construction of the three major systems of modern agriculture. At the same time, the energy diversification supply strategy is analyzed to achieve agricultural modernization and promote the development of a resource-saving and environment-friendly new agricultural industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The food supply chain in Malaysia plays a significant function in the nation’s economy. Since the industry is dominated by small and medium sized enterprises (SME), the local food supply chain must satisfy consumer demand. In order to help Malaysia to become more self-sufficient, improvements in the supply chain in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs) are important. However, it is common that strategic and operational KPIs are different and a disparity often exists between them. To be more successful for measuring the entire supply chain, the linkage of strategic objectives to operational objectives must be aligned to ensure the appropriate KPIs measure a proper connection between what they do and what the business achieves. The objective of this article is to propose a preliminary key indicator to measure sustainable performance within the perspective of Malaysian food supply chain. Key indicators have been summarized based on the previous researches focusing on the issue between 2007 until 2018. An overall of nine perspectives on sustainable performance measures in the food supply chain involved employee, supplier, health and safety, community, customer, cost effectiveness, quality, compliance and efficiency. These perspectives can be classified into three hierarchies; namely, strategic, tactical and operational. This paper proposes integration of key indicators as a starting point to evaluate the generic performance of Malaysia food supply chain.</jats:p>",

The decrease in the quality of electricity can be caused by many different factors that manifest themselves under certain circumstances, and therefore have different solutions for their elimination. The most acute problem is the impact of the electricity quality on the energy parameters of electrical equipment and power receivers in the metallurgical industry and on the railway. The article discusses the features of calculating the asymmetry of currents in a traction AC network. The main moments of calculating the settings of balancing devices are determined. The initial calculation data for balancing devices were taken from the dynamic parameters of one of the operating modes of a power transformer TDTNZh 40 MVA, to which two single-phase loads with a capacity of 17 MVA are connected to terminals AB and 10 MVA to terminals BC. The current of the negative sequence and the coefficient of the negative sequence are calculated, and the filter compensating device is also calculated using the parameters of the balancing device. Based on the calculations, the magnitude of the negative sequence current asymmetry was established and the calculation procedure for the balancing device connected to the traction winding of the transformer with the connection group Y/Δ-11 was implemented.</jats:p>",

It is unclear whether the greater CP deposition rate in the finisher period results from the restricted CP supply in the grower phase. To elucidate this, a growth performance study (22.1–110.0 kg BW) was performed with 48 Large-White pigs. They were assigned within litter to 3 dietary treatments: C, LP-F, LP-GF. The grower-finisher diets of treatment C were formulated based on the Swiss feeding recommendations whereas those for the LP-GF treatment contained 20% lower digestible CP and essential amino acids levels than the C diets. Pigs of the LP-GF group were offered in the grower and finisher period the standard and the low CP diets, respectively. The pigs were reared in one large pen, equipped with 6 automatic feeders, which allowed measuring the individual ad-libitum feed intake per visit. The BW was determined weekly. Growth performance and feed behaviour data were analysed with a linear mixed model using treatment as fixed and litter, litter size and farrowing series as random effects. Despite total CP intake was 6 and 16% lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in the LP-GF than the LP-F and C groups, respectively, overall ADG from 22.1 to 110.0 kg BW did not differ. Accordingly, gain-to-CP-intake ratio was 9 and 20% greater (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in the LP-GF than the LP-F and C group. In the grower, but not the finisher period, LP-GF pigs visited 1.6-times more (P &amp;lt; 0.05) the feeder and ingested 12% less (P &amp;lt; 0.05) feed per visit than C and LP-F pigs. These data suggest that lowering the CP supply by 20% in the grower and finisher compared to solely the finisher period or not at all has no detrimental effect on growth performance and markedly improves CP utilization for growth.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, the results for pH parameters, total coliforms, and coliforms Escherichia coli type termotolerantes showed disagreement in accordance with the laws concerning the limits established for water bodies of water intended for human consumption. The infrastructural conditions of water supply systems, as well as the physical and chemical parameters of untreated water, were considered unsatisfactory.</jats:p>"

With the advent of electrochemical energy sources, significant progress has been made in the development of a number of high technologies, namely, in the newest fields of technology - portable electronics and power electromechanics. Power sources such as lithium-ion batteries have proven to be much lighter and more compact than other types of batteries. Therefore, electrochemical lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in military robotics, ranging from small UAVs and multicopters to portable ground combat robots and marine robotic vehicles.\nRecent achievements in enhancing the specific performance of batteries of this type make it possible to use them in the electromechanical motors of modular transport platforms of modern ground robots for covert combat operations with a carrying capacity of up to 500 kg and above.\nThe analytical purpose of the materials in this article is to compare the potential sources of electricity in terms of their practical use in military robotics, namely, in the transport platforms of modern GRC for covert warfare.\nFrame-modular platforms with a capacity of 50, 150 and 500 kg were adopted for the real objects with installed sources of electricity. The principal feature of these platforms is the presence of rigid tubular modular horizontal frame made of precision steel or composite tubes. In the internal cavities of these pipes it is proposed to install power sources made in the form of cylindrical functional blocks-modules.</jats:p>",

Construction waste is not only associated with energy use and waste of materials in the construction process but also other activities that do not add value such as repair, waiting time and delays. Concepts such as waste and value are not well understood by construction personnel. They often do not realize that many activities they carry out do not add value to the work. These issues contribute to a reduction in the value of construction productivity and could reduce company performance. The aims of this GSCM study on the construction sector are to identify: (i) the drivers of stakeholders to implement green practices and (ii) the barriers faced by stakeholders in the implementation of these practices. The research methods are literature study and fields observation, where the experts were asked about their opinions related to barriers and drivers to implement the Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) in construction. The results showed that each phase of GSCM has barriers and drivers. The barriers and drivers are involved in Green Initiation, Green Design, Green Material Management, Green Construction and Green Operation and Maintenance.</jats:p>",

However, the groundwater quality has degraded due to the increase and expansion of agricultural and industrial development. It is urgent to acquire groundwater characteristics and distinguish impacts of natural factors and anthropogenic activities on the groundwater quality. Forty-six groundwater samples collected from different wells showed a great variation of chemical components across the study area. Most wells with higher total dissolved solids, total hardness, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl− and SO42− concentrations were located relatively close to the coastal zone. The factor analysis (FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis results displayed that seawater intrusion was the primary mechanism controlling the groundwater quality in the coastal areas. A three-factor model was proposed based on the FA and explained over 85% of the total groundwater quality variation: Factor 1, the seawater intrusion; Factor 2, the water–rock interaction and Factor 3 (NO3−), the human activities. Furthermore, the geographical maps of the factor scores clearly described the spatial distributions of wells affected by natural processes or human activities. The study indicated that both natural processes and human activities are the major factors affecting the chemical compositions of groundwater.</jats:p>",

The increasing technogenesis-related pollution causes increases the concentrations of many metallic elements (MEs) throughout the biosphere. The syngenetic bio-incorporation of MEs changes the biomass's chemical and physical composition and impacts the quality of products, e.g. biochar (BC). This has impacts upon BCs potential for adsorption of water pollutants. While direct, engineered modification of BC can improve its adsorption characteristics, the more indirect alterations of BC composition, based on syngenetic elements, also modifies BCs adsorption functionality. The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of syngenetically accumulated MEs in ligneous biomass on the adsorptive properties of the BCs derived from such modified biomasses. The authors of this paper investigated the syngenetic pathway of MEs into the ligneous biomass and provided an overview of the forms and quantities of MEs in the biomass and their transformation to BC. The early results of the effects of syngenetic MEs on the adsorptive properties of BC from ligneous biomass are presented. The results suggest that additional syngenetical MEs result in increases in the adsorptive properties of the resultant biomass-derived BCs.</jats:p>",

On a traditional building project, design consultants are first tier suppliers, working for the client, and the contractor has a supply chain of sub-contractors and specialist suppliers. The problems in the construction industry are that the first and second tier of the supply chain sign up to impartially difficult arrangements but as the chain develops, so the contractual responsibilities decrease until suppliers at the end of the chain are often not locked in at all. The construction of the Diponegoro University Psychology building began September 29, 2017 with a target of 300 days. The deviation between the realization of project work and the planning timeline is -10.37% in the 7th month. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the supply chain process in building construction project. The Supply Chain Operation References (SCOR) is going to be applied to measures the performance of construction projects based on five material planning processes (plan) and project work schedules, material procurement (source), implementation of construction work (make), material delivery (deliver), and the return process if there is a material return (return). The Matrix (OMAX) and Traffic Light method is going to be used to assess the performance of cement and steel structure as the main material on this building project. The results of the assessment with Omax and traffic light obtained that the supply chain performance of cement material is worth 4.3 of the maximum value is 10. Supply chain performance for iron material worth 5.4 from the maximum value is 10. This shows that supply chain performance is quite good but needs repaired.</jats:p>",

However, the effect of maternal nutrition on offspring’s intestine is not well documented. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of maternal supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids, methionine or both during late-gestation on offspring’s intestine amino acids transporters and global DNA methylation. Twenty ewes were used in a randomized block design and treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial design. Treatments were: 1) control diet (CTR) without polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or methionine (MET) supplementation; or supplemented with 2) Ca salts of PUFA (1% DMI; Strata G113®, Virtus Nutrition); rumen-protected MET (0.1% DMI; Smartamine®, Adisseo); and 4) PUFA and MET (PUFA+MET). Treatments were fed from day 100 to 145 of gestation. On day 145, ewes were euthanized and fetuses’ intestines were sampled. Protein quantification of amino acid transporters was measured using Simple Western System and global DNA methylation was determined using a commercial kit. No interactions between PUFA×MET were observed for the variables analyzed. PUFA increased (P ≤ 0.03) global DNA methylation and protein expression of SLC7A5, SLC38A2, and SLC38A10 compared with CTR. Furthermore, PUFA tended to increase (P = 0.07) SLC38A1 protein expression compared with CTR, whereas no difference (P &amp;gt; 0.05) was observed for SLC6A9. Compared with CTR, MET increased (P ≤ 0.05) global DNA methylation and SLC38A10 protein expression, and tented to increase (P ≤ 0.10) SLC6A19 and SLC38A2. MET did not affect SLC7A5 and SLC38A1 compared with CTR. Maternal supply of PUFA and MET led to greater protein expression of amino acid transporters and global DNA methylation on offspring’ intestine; however, the effects of these nutrients were not additive. Further research is necessary to better understand the role of DNA methylation on intestine’s amino acid transporters.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the issue of joint online reviews on crowdsourcing in a dual‐channel supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer makes customized products of two types: crowdsourcing products (CPs) and noncrowdsourcing products (NCPs), designed by crowdsourcees and the interfirm employees, respectively. We formulate a utility model composed of a pool of consumers who make utility maximizing choices. Utilizing this model, a supply chain framework related to <jats:italic>ex ante</jats:italic> joint online reviews is developed under the decentralized and centralized setting, to find the joint online review conditions under which the crowdsourcing solutions are accepted prior to putting into production, then derive the CP's and NCP's optimal demand and price and review level. Furthermore, comparison study is conducted concerning the three scenarios: without any online reviews, with only online reviews from consumers, and with joint online reviews from manufacturer and consumers, to examine the impacts of crowdsourcing, online reviews, and both interactions on supply chain performance. The results show, although public opinion suggests that increase in crowdsourcing customized degree facilitates widespread adoption of crowdsourcing design, we find some conditions impede firms from implementing it. Meanwhile, among different combinations of online reviews and decision‐making settings, only in joint online reviews and centralized setting, the objective of selecting crowdsourcing design is aligned to maximizing the total supply chain's profit. Additionally, when the customized degree ratio is at a medium level, even if the CP demand is less than NCP, the manufacturer and the retailer gain more payoffs from CPs than from NCPs.</jats:p>",

Consumer preferences and pricing could interact in influencing green innovation. This situation is especially vital in industries that are characterized with many safety concerns that urge collaborative development between consumers and companies, such as the food industry. The aim of this paper is to explore the influence of the change in consumer preference characteristics on the green innovation efforts of the food supply chain, introducing the green preference of consumers and the reference price effect. A differential game model of green innovation in the food supply chain is constructed in this paper and solved. It was found that the change in consumer preference characteristics is an important factor to motivate supply chain members to make green innovation efforts. With the enhancement of consumer preference characteristics, the Pareto improvement effect of cost-sharing contracts on the profits of supply chain enterprises is clearer. Further, manufacturers can stimulate suppliers’ green innovation efforts through cost-sharing contracts. When the marginal profit ratio of food supply chain members reaches a certain threshold, the incentive effect of this cost-sharing contract is more significant, and it is more likely to realize the optimal profit of the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, locating high quality drinking water is a major challenge in such areas. Against this background, this study proceeds to utilize and compare five decision tree-based data mining algorithms including Ordinary Decision Tree (ODT), Random Forest (RF), Random Tree (RT), Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), and Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) for rule induction in order to identify high quality groundwater zones for drinking purposes. The proposed methodology works by initially extracting key relevant variables affecting water quality (electrical conductivity, pH, hardness and chloride) out of a total of eight existing parameters, and using them as inputs for the rule induction process. The algorithms were evaluated with reference to both continuous and discrete datasets. The findings were speculative of the superiority, performance-wise, of rule induction using the continuous dataset as opposed to the discrete dataset. Based on validation results, in continuous dataset, RF and ODT showed higher and RT showed acceptable performance. The groundwater quality maps were generated by combining the effective parameters distribution maps using inducted rules from RF, ODT, and RT, in GIS environment. A quick glance at the generated maps reveals a drop in the quality of groundwater from south to north as well as from east to west in the study area. The RF showed the highest performance (accuracy of 97.10%) among its counterparts; and so the generated map based on rules inducted from RF is more reliable. The RF and ODT methods are more suitable in the case of continuous dataset and can be applied for rule induction to determine water quality with higher accuracy compared to other tested algorithms.</jats:p>",

The increase in magnetic field induction of the converter is limited by the capabilities of modern powerful permanent magnets. In addition, there are significant difficulties in monitoring ferromagnetic control samples, due to the large pressing force between the sample and the transducer and sticking of scale to the transducer. Usage of modern processing methods significantly complicates and increases the cost of electromagnetic-acoustic testing devices. Of the selected sensitivityincreasingmethods, the most acceptable way is to increase the power of high-frequency current generators under the condition of excitation of packet pulses. Power supply process of the converter is carried out in two stages. Meander type powerful high-frequency current pulses are excited, which ensures operation of the output transistors in key mode. Isolation of a powerful sinusoidal high-frequency packet current pulse is carried out directly on the electromagnetic - acoustic transducer, the elements of which are included in the resonant circuit with low quality factor. Based on the transistors switched in the push-pull circuit in the key mode, a small-sized generator design has been created that excites a peak current of up to 800 A in the electromagnetic-acoustic transducer and a voltage of up to 3 kV in the transducer in the frequency range 0.3 ... 8 MHz. It was experimentally determined that the new design of the probe pulse generator made it possible to increase the amplitude of pulses reflected from a flat-bottom reflector with a diameter of 2 mm with respect to the interference amplitude by more than 2 times.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies a dual-channel apparel supply chain faced with strategic consumers and uncertain demands, where the dominant retailer decides its service level and offline price first, and the manufacturer decides the online price later on. This paper develops a framework to examine the impacts of quick response on the system’s short-term profitability and long-term stability. To make comparisons, two scenarios are considered, in which the supply chain system adopts and does not adopt quick response, respectively. The optimal decisions and profits of the firms are first analyzed in two scenarios, and dynamic game models are then developed to study the complex characteristics. Comparisons in supply chain outputs and system stability are further made between these two scenarios. The results show that the imbalance of risks in two channels affects the performance of quick response that tends to benefit the retailer more, while it benefits the manufacturer only when the return rate is extremely high and consumers care much about the purchase channels. However, quick response certainly contributes to the system stability, which not only provides a larger stable region for firms to adjust their decisions, but also makes the system less sensitive to the consumers’ valuation for the product. Along with this, it is easier for the chaotic system with quick response to restore the stability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental concerns make enterprises pay more attention to green manufacturing. The emerging green supply chain inevitably will compete with the traditional supply chain. In order to evaluate the competitiveness of supply chains and the impact on channel structure strategy, we develop four game models for two competing supply chains according to their channel structure strategies. Green marginal manufacturing cost, demand sensitivity of green level, and governmental interventions are considered. We study how retail prices, green levels, and profits are influenced by channel structure choice and governmental interventions. Analytical results indicate that the substitutability of products affects channel structure strategy. When the substitutability of products is relatively low, centralization–centralization is the unique Nash equilibrium. However, when the substitutability of products is relatively high, both centralization–centralization and decentralization–decentralization are the Nash equilibriums. Centralization–centralization is a prisoner dilemma, while decentralization–decentralization can make the green supply chain achieve optimal profit. Then, the green marginal manufacturing cost and demand sensitivities of the green level play important but different roles in channel structure strategy of the competing supply chains. Further, whether Nash equilibriums are the optimal strategy depends on governmental intervention. Relatively severe governmental intervention might realize a relatively higher green level, but may not always achieve the lowest retail price for the green supply chain. However, a relatively moderate governmental intervention might achieve a relatively lower green level.</jats:p>"

All information from the respondents has been collected using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The locations for this study have been held in Kedah, Penang and Kuala Lumpur. Notably, there are two main factors where people become refugees, government persecution and ethnic discrimination. Furthermore, Dalal as human traffickers have taken this opportunity to do business by smuggling Rohingya refugees into Malaysia using an illegal route. The Dalals have also played a vital role in this supply chain of human trafficking and has exploited the Rohingya refugees for their own profit.

AMD is a complex and multi-factor neurodegenerative disease, which leads to death of photoreceptor cells, underlying retinal pigment epithelium cells, and alteration of the macular part of the Bruch’s membrane and choriocapillaries, all culminating in the loss of central vision. Age-related disruption of retinal neurotrophic supply has been suggested to play a significant role in the development of AMD similarly to other neurodegenerative diseases. Neurotrophic factors participate in maintenance of structural integrity and functional activity of neurons during their development and in maturity to promote survival and regeneration during aging and age-related diseases. An optimal balance of neurotrophins ensures a proper interaction of neurons, microglia, and Müller cells. Notably, an amazingly broad range of critical functions of neurotrophins is achieved through various mechanisms of signal transduction. The neuroprotective potential of neurotrophins has been demonstrated in animals; however, development of effective drugs for AMD requires solving the issues of efficient neurotrophins delivery to the retina and maintenance of their optimal balance. Future basic studies will specify this balance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water for oil pump stations and compressor stations of the main hydrocarbon carriers transmission systems, as well as for most other production facilities of the oil and gas complex is usually supplied from the underground sources. In this case, the function of water intake structures is performed by the bored wells or special wells. As most of them are located in quick ground, they require the use of filters of various designs. In the process of water supply systems operation, wells filters and pre-filter zones of aquifers are contaminated with mechanical particles as well as with the depositions of calcium salt, magnesium salt, silicon salt and other elements dissolved in under-ground waters. It inevitably leads to the increase in hydraulic resistance and, accordingly, to the decrease in wa-ter flow and water intakes productivity. The construction of new buildings requires additional substantial capital investments; therefore it is considered to be economically impracticable and is used very rarely. The more rational way to restore the well flow rate is to clean the filters and the aquifers pre-filter zones off the clogging. It gives a possibility to get a significant economic effect. The analysis of the existing methods and means of water supply wells recovery shows that despite the urgent need to improve water supply and to use groundwater rationally, the search for the most effective methods of regeneration of water take systems is still ongoing. Nowadays, the devel-opment of treatment modes for filters and the prefilter zone of aquifers implies the use of approaches that summa-rize the experience of previous methods which need further theoretical and experimental justification. The authors offer a more effective method for the destruction and dispergation of colmatation deposits. It requires the creation of the vibrational impact inside the filter as well as the creation of a powerful filtration flow of alternating direc-tion by implementing a multi-regulated explosion of the steam-and-gas mixture. It gives an opportunity to use it under a wide range of hydrogeological conditions, as well as in the wells equipped with filters of different types. The suggested method is simple and cost-efficient. In order to find scientifically substantiated criteria for the se-lection of optimal modes of wells treatment using this method, the authors have made a series of research. One of the main purposes of the studies is to determine the nature of the distribution and the parameters of elastic hydro-dynamic oscillations in the aquifer which are caused by the explosion of steam-and-gas mixture in the filter area of the water supply well.</jats:p>"

In this study, silver-diatomite nanocomposite ceramic filters were developed by an easy and effective method. The ceramic filters have a three-dimensional interconnected pore structure and porosity of 50.85%. Characterizations of the silver-diatomite nanocomposite ceramic filters were performed using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Silver nanoparticles were confirmed to be formed in situ in the ceramic filter. The highest silver concentration in water was 0.24 μg/L and 2.1 μg/L in short- and long-term experiments, indicating very low silver-release properties of silver-diatomite nanocomposite ceramic filter. The nanocomposite ceramics show strong bactericidal activity. When contact time with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) of 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL exceeded 3 h, the bactericidal rates of the four different silver content ceramics against E. coli and S. aureus were all 100%. Strong bactericidal effect against E. coli with initial concentration of 109 CFU/mL were also observed in ceramic newly obtained and ceramic immersed in water for 270 days, demonstrating its high stability. The silver-diatomite nanocomposite ceramic filters could be a promising candidate for point-of-use water treatment.</jats:p>",

Future climate change scenarios were obtained from five general circulation models (GCMs) of CMIP5 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios for the time periods, 2021–2040, 2041–2060 and 2061–2080. Statistical downscaling was applied using LARS-WG. The GR2M hydrological model was calibrated, validated and used as input to the WEAP model to assess future water availability. Expected crop growth cycle lengths were estimated using a growing degree days model. By means of the WEAP-MABIA method, projected crop and irrigation water requirements were estimated. Results show an average increase in annual ETo of 6.1% and a decrease in annual rainfall of 11.4%, leading to a 24% decrease in inflow. Also, crops' growing cycles will decrease from 5.4% for wheat to 31% for citrus trees. The same tendency is observed for ETc. Concerning irrigation requirement, variations are more moderated depending on RCPs and time periods, and is explained by rainfall and crop cycle duration variations. As for demand and supply, results currently show that supply does not meet the system demand. Climate change could worsen the situation unless better planning of water surface use is done.</jats:p>",

However, high CO2 supply may cause inorganic carbon accumulation and pH reduction, which could result in low CO2 recovery and reduced algal growth. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of medium recycling and high CO2 supply through carbon mass balance analysis in Arthrospira culture. In all CO2 supply conditions, carbon supply was higher than Arthrospira carbon assimilation, which accounted for 30–58% of supply. However, CO2 recovery of nearly 100% and 63% for lower (0.20 and 0.39 gC L−1 d−1) and higher (0.59 gC L−1 d−1) CO2 supply rates were achieved, respectively, because of the high concentration of the alkaline agent. The excess carbon accumulated in the medium and ultimately escaped from the system in a form of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contributed to 16–24% of the total photosynthetically assimilated carbon, and the final concentration reached 260–367 mgC L−1, but there was no significant growth reduction caused by DIC and DOC accumulation. This study demonstrated the stability of the medium-recycling process even at high CO2 supply rates although a balanced supply is recommended for longer operations.</jats:p>"

Besides, the stability and transient response are enhanced by dynamic load technique (DLT). An embedded overcurrent feedback loop is also adopted to protect the presented VR from damage under overload situations. The proposed VR is implemented in a standard 350 nm BCD technology, whose results indicate the VR can steadily work with 5.5–30 V input voltage, 0–30 mA load range, and 0.1–3.3 μF output capacitor. A 2.98 μV/V line regulation and a 0.233 mV/mA load regulation are achieved with a 40 mA current limiting. The PSR is better than − 64 dB up to 10 MHz with a 0.1 μF output capacitor.</jats:p>",

If one considers power supplies with a period of more than 10 years, and even up to 50 years of service life, then it is necessary to pay attention to the Nickel-63 radioisotope. The given isotope is safe from the point of view of radiation, but it can generate energy up to 50 years. The article shows that it is necessary to analyze semiconductor materials suitable for its development in the manufacture of a power source based on Nickel-63. Such an analysis is also important for the estimation economic requirements taking into account the increasing miniaturization of electronic equipment. A current level analysis was performed for each semiconductor material.</jats:p>",

However, the reliability of public water supplies can also be influenced by the quality of water bodies. In this study, we proposed a framework that integrates the analysis of risks of inadequate water quality and risks of insufficient water availability. We have developed a coupled modeling system that combines hydrological modeling of river water quantity and quality, rules for water withdrawals from rivers into storage reservoirs, and dynamical simulation of harmful algal blooms in storage reservoirs. We use this framework to assess the impact of climate change, demand growth, and land‐use change on the reliability of public water supplies. The proposed method is tested on the River Thames catchment in the south of England. The results show that alongside the well‐known risks of rising water demand in the south of England and uncertain impacts of climate change, diffuse pollution from agriculture and effluent from upstream waste water treatment works potentially represent a threat to the reliability of public water supplies in London. We quantify the steps that could be taken to ameliorate these threats, though even a vigorous pollution‐prevention strategy would not be sufficient to offset the projected effects of climate change on water quality and the reliability of public water supplies. The proposed method can help water utilities to recognize their system vulnerability and evaluate the potential solutions to achieve more reliable water supplies.</jats:p>",

For further improving the efficiency of the system and realizing the stability of the output voltage under different load conditions, the digital synchronous rectification (DSR) based on the phase shift control strategy is proposed. The prototype of the LLC DC-DC converter based on SiC MOSFET is implemented, which can realize zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS). Then, the thermal image of DSR is presented, which proves that the power loss of SiC MOSFET with DSR is relatively low. Additionally, the system efficiency among the Si IGBT, SiC MOSFET, and SiC MOSFET with DSR is analyzed and the prototype demonstrates 98% peak efficiency. Finally, simulations, experiments, and data analysis prove the superiority of the proposed DSR strategy for the new auxiliary power supply system of magnetic levitation.</jats:p>"

Most important is a need to understand the crucial role of supply chain management (SCM) in developing better access to maternal and pediatric surgery in limited resource settings. We evaluate the role of SCM in global surgery and global health, and the current landscape of inefficiency. We outline specific findings and takeaways from recent solutions developed in pediatric and maternal surgery to address SCM inefficiencies.

This study aims to study and measure the severity of poor  communication in causingcost  and  time  overruns  in  construction  projects.  The  study adopted two consecutive approaches to study the effect of poor communication in causingcost and time overruns. The first approach was to conduct an extensive literature review to extract causative factors from diverse construction industries that consider poor communication as a causative factor,then to determineits severity percentage,among other factors for each study.  From  the  analysis,  it  can  be  concluded  that  developed  countries  that  apply  information communication   technology   and   advanced   communication   systems   have lowerseverity percentages compared to other countries. The second approach was to conduct a qualitative study by interviewing construction experts and to examine their commentsand criticisms ofthe results obtained from the literature. Experts were asked to highlight their views on the severity of  poor  communication  in  the  construction  industry.  The  outcome  of  these  interviews  was thematically analysed.

Sustainable supply chain can be achieved by taking into account three pillars of sustainable development, namely, economy, social, and environment. Passion fruit agro-industry supply chain actors consist of farmers, collectors, agro-industries, and retailers. This study aims at identifying factors affecting the passion fruit agro-industry supply chain performance for sustainable micro, small, and medium enterprises and designing a supply chain performance measurement model of MSME passion fruit agro-industry with system dynamics. This research used a survey method through observations, in-depth interviews, and expert opinions. Data were processed using a combination of the hard system (system dynamics analysis) and soft system (expert opinions).The feedback structure along the passion fruit syrup agro-industry system was modeled in a causal loop diagram using system dynamics through version 10 of Powersim Studio software. It was then translated into a stock-flow diagram as the implementation of the simulation model. The model was verified using a computerized statistical analysis (Absolute Means Error) technique. To formulate recommendations and development strategy scenarios for sustainable MSME passion fruit agro-industry supply chain, a system approach method was used and expected to produce an effective and operational decision in accordance with the objectives previously set. The results obtained through expert opinions and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which have the highest weight with various conditions for each variable. Seven key variables were proven to influence the performance of passion fruit agro-industry supply chain, which were also used to design a sustainable MSME supply chain development scenario. The behavior of the sustainable passion fruit agro-industry supply chain model took the form of positive growth and the error rate of 7.43. Developing a sustainable MSMEPFASCPM can be carried out with a moderate strategy by developing: 1) pattern of good relationships among the actors, 2) gradual increase in the availability of raw materials, 3) environmental support capability, 4) gradual increase of profits, 5) moderate skills, 6) employment opportunities, and 7) land availability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The reliable operation of the primary distribution of refined products supply chains is crucial in guaranteeing the demand for retail markets. The uncertainties such as demand, production, and inventory will affect the supply chain operation. However, there lacks literature that studies the reliability of demand‐side management of refined products supply chains. This reliability assessment can help define the weak points and boost the performance of the supply chain. And it can help decision‐makers to improve the satisfaction of retail markets. In this paper, a systematic method for comprehensively assessing the reliability of refined products supply chains is proposed. At first, a mathematical programming model is developed to get the distribution plan of refined products. Then, several scenarios such as increasing demand, decreasing production, refineries disruption, and pipeline interruption relevant to the real situations of refined products supply chains are defined. Besides, indices including satisfaction rate, number of dissatisfied retail markets, refined products shortage, shortage of a single retail market, and average shortage duration are proposed to evaluate the reliability of the demand‐side management in primary distribution processes. At last, the Monte Carlo simulation is adopted for a comprehensive analysis combining all the scenarios. This analysis shows a clear picture of the influence of uncertainties. This method is applied to assess the reliability of demand‐side management of a real refined products supply chain. After analyzing different scenarios, the average probability of dissatisfaction under the reference scenario came as 1.93 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>/day that means one day in around 14.2 years could have refined products shortage. This method can also help decision‐makers to assess other primary distribution of refined products supply chains.</jats:p>",

The benefits of introducing real-time pricing can accordingly be relatively low at relatively high carbon taxes and vice versa. The non-monotonous change in welfare gains can be explained by corresponding changes in the inefficiency arising from “under-consumption” during low-price periods rather than by changes in wholesale price volatility. Our results may cast doubt on the efficiency of ongoing roll-outs of advanced meters in many electricity markets, since net benefits might only materialize at relatively high carbon tax levels and renewable supply shares.</jats:p>",

This study applied a post-test-only non-equivalent group design to evaluate the resulting influence on the social empowerment of farmers and on consumer diets. The method included conducting a survey of PROVE farmers (n = 36) and a survey of PROVE consumers (n = 294) that were compared against matched samples of Portuguese respondents of international surveys (European Social Survey, n = 36 and the INHERIT Five-Country Survey, n = 571, respectively). PROVE farmers reported higher scores for perceived influence on the work environment than the national sample. PROVE consumers were more likely to eat five or more portions of fruits and vegetables a day in comparison to the matched sample of Portuguese citizens (average odds ratio: 3.05, p &lt; 0.05). Being a PROVE consumer also generated an impact on the likelihood of consuming no more than two portions of red meat a week (average odds ratio: 1.56, p &lt; 0.05). The evaluation study suggests that the promotion of short supply chains of fruits and vegetables can make a positive contribution to a healthier, more sustainable, and fairer future in food consumption.</jats:p>"

However, the literature that discusses different structures of environmental extensions (EEs), that is, the scope of physical flows and their attribution to sectors in the monetary input–output table (MIOT), remains fragmented. This article investigates the conceptual and empirical implications of applying two different but frequently used designs of EEs, using the case of energy accounting, where one represents energy supply while the other energy use in the economy. We derive both extensions from an official energy supply–use dataset and apply them to the same single‐region input–output (SRIO) model of Austria, thereby isolating the effect that stems from the decision for the extension design. We also crosscheck the SRIO results with energy footprints from the global multi‐regional input–output (GMRIO) dataset EXIOBASE. Our results show that the ranking of footprints of final demand categories (e.g., household and export) is sensitive to the extension design and that product‐level results can vary by several orders of magnitude. The GMRIO‐based comparison further reveals that for a few countries the supply‐extension result can be twice the size of the use‐extension footprint (e.g., Australia and Norway). We propose a graph approach to provide a generalized framework to disclosing the design of EEs. We discuss the conceptual differences between the two extension designs by applying analogies to hybrid life‐cycle assessment and conclude that our findings are relevant for monitoring of energy efficiency and emission reduction targets and corporate footprint accounting.</jats:p>",

Many of these regulations concern the reduction of air pollution of vessels both globally and in particular in so-called Emission Control Areas (ECA’s).</jats:p><jats:p>In this research, the economic impact of alternative technologies in order to reduce the Sulphur emissions in existing ECA zones is analyzed both from the perspective of the vessel owner, as well as for the evaluation of generalized chain cost, hence from the shipper point of view.</jats:p><jats:p>The container carriers can choose different methods to comply with the new regulations, such as switching fuel types (Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Marine Diesel Oil (MDO)) or opting for innovative technologies like installing scrubber systems.</jats:p><jats:p>The goal of this research is twofold: first, to discover alternative available technologies to mitigate Sulphur emissions according to the literature; second, to evaluate economically the selected technologies both from vessel owners and shippers perspectives.</jats:p><jats:p>In order to study this, an update of an existing model is used. The added value of the extended model is threefold: calculating the generalized chain cost of transporting a container from the origin (US and Asia) to a destination in the EU, incorporating in the model the different ECA zones in the world and integrating more detailed fuel cost calculations and capital cost for different engine types or technologies used.</jats:p><jats:p>The methodology used in this research is an extension of an existing model which is updated for the purpose of this research. This update includes a new functionality to allow calculating the vessel owner cost for different fuel types and propulsion systems (Heavy Fuel Oil or HFO, MDO and LNG). Next to that, more maritime distance data is collected containing the distance sailed in ECA zones. This means that for each port-to-port combination, in the total maritime distance database in the model, this additional information is added. Based on this information, the fuel cost can be calculated when a vessel is sailing in ECA zones using either MDO, LNG or HFO (including a scrubber).</jats:p><jats:p>The research is particularly interesting for logistics operators, legislation regulators and academia. The extended model allows calculating the best economic solutions for selected routes. For logistics operators and in particular for shippers, the results allow making the most rewarding investments from an economic point of view and affirm the importance of different technologies on the generalized chain cost. The results indicate that the price of the different fuels (and the spread between them) displays an important factor in the overall outcome.</jats:p>",

Motor neuron (MN) diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), specifically target MNs and the NMJs. However, little is known about the reasons for MN-selective neuronal and synaptic vulnerability in MN diseases. Here, utilizing a compartmental microfluidic in vitro co-culture system, we provide a possible explanation for why the NMJ, other than its unusual dimensions, differs from other synapses. By using live-imaging techniques, we discovered that cultured MNs display higher axonal and synaptic mitochondrial immobility compared with sympathetic neurons (SNs), leading to a profound enrichment of mitochondria only in the MN NMJ. Furthermore, by employing a synaptic ATP sensor, we show that mitochondrial respiration is the key contributor to ATP production in MN NMJs but not in SN synapses. Taken together, our data suggest that mitochondrial localization underlies the unique and specific qualities of MN NMJs. Our findings shed light on the role of mitochondria in MN and NMJ maintenance, and possibly indicate how mitochondria may serve as a source for selective MN vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.</jats:p>",

At the present stage of IESP development, priority is given to the creation of advanced systems of defeat, control and communication, protection, life support and energy supply, as well as increased soldier maneuverability in combat at the turn of 2020. A generalized analysis of the main tasks of creating a combat equipment complex (CEC) for the serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine makes it possible to state that the fulfillment of all the intended goals and tasks should be ensured and accompanied by a highly effective system of scientific research and scientific support of the state programs of development of all systems and elements of the CEC. The power supply system and its components (chargers, power supplies, power converters and transmitters, means of controlling the system components) are one of the most important components of equipment.\nThe most important stage of substantiation of the perspective composition of the energy supply system (chargers, power sources, means of transformation and transmission of electricity, means of controlling the performance of system components) in the complexes of combat equipment of military intelligence units is a complex assessment of the contribution to the effectiveness of combat based on mathematical modeling of fighting.

After the successful validation under laboratory conditions, the applicability of the time temperature indicator (TTI) as shelf life indicator was tested in a national poultry chain. The TTI accurately reflected the temperature fluctuations occurring under real chain conditions. Shelf life predictions based on the discolouration of the TTIs were in accordance with the microbial shelf life of the product. The models were integrated in an online software tool to check for the compliance of the cold chain and predict the remaining shelf life of the product. The implementation of TTI and the software result in a valuable tool to support the decision-making process in the cold chain. The application of flexible shelf life enables the reduction of food waste in the meat supply chain.</jats:p>",

The main physical supply pathways to the surface layer are via eddy advection and winter convective mixing in equal proportions. The associated subsurface loss of DFe is restocked via net remineralization (75%) and eddy advection (25%). Summer storms resulted in weak DFe supplies relative to the seasonal supplies (&lt;7.6%). However, in situations of deep summer mixed layers and when interacting with underlying ocean fronts, summer storms resulted in enhanced diffusive and advective DFe supplies and raised summer primary production by 20% for several days.</jats:p>",

A new tap water isotopes data set based on dense sampling sites was established, which was reliable for the analysis of tap water isotope features, tap water supply management, and tap water sources. The main conclusions are: (1) The local tap water lines in Gannan and Longnan are δ2H = (7.06 ± 0.17) δ18O + (3.24 ± 1.75) (r2 = 0.81, p &lt; 0.01) and δ2H = (5.66 ± 0.09) δ18O + (−8.12 ± 0.82) (r2 = 0.82, p &lt; 0.01), respectively. (2) The annual mean δ2H and δ18O in tap water show an increasing trend from southwest to northeast. The seasonal differences of δ2H and δ18O in tap water in Gannan and Longnan are small. (3) The correlation of tap water isotopes with those in main source water is high, while that of isotopes in tap water with those in non-water source is low. Under the central water supply mode by local tap water company, tap water isotopes in Gannan where groundwater is the direct water source show weak connection with those in surface water and precipitation, and those in tap water in Longnan with surface water as main source water reveal good connection with isotopes in surface water. Under mixed water supply modes, tap water isotopes indicate that surface water is the main tap water source in Gannan and Longnan with multiple water sources.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims at identifying and assessing supply chain risks and developing criteria for managing these risks. Supply chain (SC) risks consist of complex, uncertain, and vague information, but risk assessment techniques in the literature have been unable to handle complexity, uncertainty, and vagueness. Therefore, this study presents a holistic approach to supply chain risk management. In this paper, neutrosophic (N) theory is merged with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to deal with complexity, uncertainty, and vagueness. Then the proposed methodology is practically implemented through a case study on the automotive industry. SC resilience, SC agility, and SC robustness were selected as criteria for managing supply chain risks and analyzed using N-AHP. Furthermore, seventeen risks were identified and assessed by using N-TOPSIS. Results suggest supply chain resilience is the most important criterion for managing supply chain risks. Moreover, supplier delivery delays, supplier quality problems, supplier communication failures, and forecasting errors are the most vulnerable risks that occur in supply chains of the automotive industry in Pakistan.</jats:p>"

The raw water samples undergo water quality characteristics tests to determine their class of water quality based on national water quality standards. Both raw water samples have been characterized and belong to class II of water quality. Subsequently, both raw water samples are used in water purification experiments with two types of filtration configuration, cross-flow and dead-end. Results show that water purification using the PES hollow fiber membrane can obtain water quality of class I for both samples. However, the presence of Escherichia coli can still be detected in both purified water samples. From the results obtained, the fabricated PES membrane is able to filter raw water samples of WQI Class II to WQI Class I quality and adhere to drinking water standards, and the dead-end filtration configuration provides the best filtration performance.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to quantify N mineralization in soil amended with different peanut residue components under simulated conventional and conservation tillage practices. A 252‐day microlysimeter incubation was conducted in which peanut leaves, stems and a 1:1 mixture of leaves:stems from three varieties were incorporated or placed on the soil surface to simulate conventional or conservation tillage, respectively. Soils were periodically leached to assess N mineralization compared with a soil‐only control. Nitrogen mineralization was only affected by residue component. Averaged over variety and residue placement, soil amended with leaves mineralized 10% more N relative to the control or soil containing stems. It was estimated that leaves supplied 25 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> over 252 days at 0–15 cm soil depth, which would likely be insufficient to induce a yield response by a subsequent crop.

Thus, it has been hypothesized that tree species with isohydric stomatal control (i.e., trees that close stomata rapidly in response to drought) rely heavily on NSC pools to sustain metabolism, which can lead to negative physiological consequences such as C depletion. Here, we seek to use a species’ degree of isohydry or anisohydry as a conceptual framework for understanding the interrelations between photosynthetic C supply, hydraulic damage and fluctuations in NSC pools. We conducted a 6-week experimental drought, followed by a 6-week recovery period, in a greenhouse on seven tree species that span the spectrum from isohydric to anisohydric. Throughout the experiment, we measured photosynthesis, hydraulic damage and NSC pools. Non-structural carbohydrate pools were remarkably stable across species and tissues—even highly isohydric species that drastically reduced C assimilation were able to maintain stored C. Despite these static NSC pools, we still inferred an important role for stored C during drought, as most species converted starches into sugars during water stress (and back again post-drought). Finally, we did not observe any linkages between C supply, hydraulic damage and NSC pools, indicating that NSC was maintained independent of variation in photosynthesis and hydraulic function. Our results advance the idea that C depletion is a rare phenomenon due to either active maintenance of NSC pools or sink limitation, and thus question the hypothesis that reductions in C assimilation necessarily lead to C depletion.</jats:p>",

For reasons of practical feasibility and cost-effectiveness, adsorption has been widely used in the water treatment and reuse community, with rapid development of adsorbents. However, the precise control of the electronic configuration of the adsorbents' sites to enhance adsorption performance is largely unexplored. In this study, to demonstrate the effect of electronic configuration on adsorption performance, we synthesized granular activated carbon (GAC) supported Fe-based hydroxides adsorbents by varying the valence state in transition metals. Furthermore, the adsorbents are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify surface structure and morphological properties. Adsorptive performance studies show that the adsorption capacity and arsenic removal efficiency of Fe(II)-GAC are twice those of Fe(III)-GAC, as a matter of charge transfer between adsorbents and cationic pollution (such as Fe-O and As species). Finally, PO43− was selected as a control sample to confirm the rationality of the removal mechanism. Collectively, fine-tuning of the electronic configuration from charge transfer will not only benefit heavy metal removal channels, but also supply fundamental information for adsorbents design for organics removal.</jats:p>",

The Compatibility of the Dutch National Contact Point’s Decisions With the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in the Light of Decisions Made by the UK, German, Danish and Norwegian National Contact Points</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Since the introduction of a human rights chapter in the 2011 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, National Contact Points (NCPs) have been increasingly dealing with specific instances referring to human rights violations by companies. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the human rights provisions are the most cited provisions of the Guidelines. Specific instances include allegations such as a company’s failure to implement human rights due diligence, to apply the principles of free, prior and informed consent, to take supply chain responsibility, and/or to comply with the right to cultural heritage. Of all topics, human rights due diligence and human rights supply chain responsibilities are most commonly referred to in complaints based on the Guidelines. This article focuses on how NCPs have handled these topics of human rights due diligence and supply chain responsibility in specific instances. The Dutch NCP has been selected because it is celebrated in literature as the ‘gold standard’ because of its composition including independent members, its forward-looking approach, and because it is one of the most active NCPs in the world. All decisions of the Dutch NCP concerning these two topics are analysed in the light of the decisions of four other NCPs (UK, Denmark, Germany and Norway). A doctrinal methodology is used to analyse similarities and differences between the argumentations of the five NCPs.</jats:p>",

In this paper, hydrophobic lithiated titania was synthesized by lithium reaction with amorphous titania followed by surface modification with a thin 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane (PFOTS) monolayer. The hydrophobic lithiated titania was used as a photothermal material for seawater evaporation based on this new process. A thin lithiated titania floating film was assembled under simulated solar light irradiance due to the combined actions of water surface tension and the water molecules' thermal motion. The formation of the thin floating film significantly promoted water evaporation. The water evaporation rate by the lithiated titania floating film was 0.87 kg·m−2·h−1 under 2.0 sun solar irradiance, which was 2.4 times higher than that of pure water. Parameters affecting the solar evaporation process such as lithiated titania dose, solar light intensity, and storage time were investigated. Finally, the quality of the condensed fresh water was tested to evaluate the potential application of the lithiated titania floating film in practical settings of seawater desalinization.</jats:p>",

Based on the economics theory of health and healthcare, their non-farm labor supply behavior could be affected by health insurance policies. The work presented in this paper focuses on the impact of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) on farmers’ non-farm labor supply behavior in China. A four-part model regression approach was used to examine the relationship. Our dataset comprised of 8273 people, aged 45 or above, from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) conducted in 2011 and 2013. The empirical results showed that NRCMS significantly reduced non-farm labor force participation and employment. Compared to non-participants of the NRCMS, the non-farmer labor time of these participants reduced, but the supplementary medical insurance and immediate reimbursement of the NRCMS increased the participants’ non-farm labor time. Our results have contributed to the reform of China’s public health insurance and farms’ income growth, and it would be necessary to actively promote immediate reimbursement, gradually simplify reimbursement procedures for medical treatment in non-registered places, and eliminate the non-portability of NRCMS.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this manuscript proposes a generalized index of socio-economic consumption level of water resources. The definition of the index is the ratio of water consumption change for GDP growth per unit, and the potential of water resources exploitation and utilization. The theoretical curve of this index has a rise period, a high value period, and a decline period, which correspond to the take-off period, bottleneck period and maturity period of the regional economic development, respectively. This index can help us find the turning point of water resources restricting economy. The indexes of each year are calculated respectively from 1994 to 2010 of Beijing and Hebei province of China as example. The result shows that both two provinces are in the transitional period from high value period to the decline period. This example shows the universality of Generalized Index of Regional Socio-economic Consumption Level of Water Resources. Setting a target Generalized Index of Regional Socio-economic Consumption Level of Water Resources is consistent with the sustainable development level of regional economy which could promote both regional economic development and water resources protection.</jats:p>",

Trees were subjected to experimental thinning within a low-elevation stand (1200 m), and carbon and water balances were compared to control plots at low and high elevation (1700 m). The hydraulic conductivity and the resistance to cavitation were also characterized, showing relatively high values and no significant differences among treatments. Trees growing at higher elevations presented the highest SFD, photosynthetic rates, and secondary growth, mainly because their growing season was extended until summer. Trees growing at low elevation reduced SFD during late spring and summer while SFD and secondary growth were significantly higher in the thinned stands. Declining NSC concentrations in needles, branches, and sapwood suggest drought-induced control of the carbon supply status.

The results of FTIR and XRD confirmed the presence of ZnO NPs in the polymer matrix. The membrane performance demonstrated the significance of hydrophilic nanoparticles towards the enhancement of membrane properties. The optimum amount of ZnO NPs was 1.5 wt% with a lower contact angle as well as highest flux and lowest filtration resistance. The presence of ZnO NPs in the membrane matrix exhibited a strong antibacterial activity increased with the increasing ZnO NPs' content. Incorporation of ZnO NPs into PVDF membranes may have great potential in developing high-performance antifouling membranes for separation process.</jats:p>",

Energy harvesting technology is expected to realize the sustainable self-power supply for the WSN. Low amplitude and broadband vibration energy harvesting performance are the key points in train application. In this study, two piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters (PVEHs) are designed and simulated via COMSOL. Their low resonant frequencies and high electromechanical sensitivities are realized by big L-shaped mass blocks with different material densities. Their broadband vibration energy harvesting performance is achieved by the stopper and series connection. Experimental data are shown at an acceleration of 0.5 m/s2; PVEH-1 and PVEH-2 have maximum powers of 0.24 mW and 0.1 mW when excited at the resonant frequencies of 13.1 Hz and 18.8 Hz, respectively, and they both have the optimal load resistance of 40 kΩ. Two circuit design styles of two PVEHs, independent and series styles, are proposed for broadband vibration energy harvesting. Experimental results show that the series style has a wider operating frequency bandwidth and shorter charging time. Two PVEHs in series style can be effectively used for power supply of the temperature and humidity WSN in the broadband frequency range of 8.7–22.0 Hz above charging root mean square voltage of 5 V at the acceleration of 3.0 m/s2. This scheme is promised to be applied to the cold chain logistics train container.</jats:p>",

The effect of pH value, H2O2 concentration, Fe(III)-AO PAN amount, and coexisting anions on the As(III) oxidation and removal were investigated in detail. Dynamic adsorption on fixed column was also studied. Arsenic removal efficiency including As(III) and As(V) could be achieved (95.2%) by the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption process at the following optimal conditions: pH = 6.5, dosage of Fe(III)-AO PAN = 2.5 g/L, H2O2 = 100 mg/L, initial concentration of As(III) = 5 mg/L.

We develop six game theory-based models to explore the members’ operational decisions in a supply chain taking into account three vertical power structures (<jats:italic>Manufacturer Stackelberg</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Retailer Stackelberg</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>and Vertical Nash</jats:italic>) as well as two retailers’ horizontal power structure (Bertrand or Stackelberg competition). Then, we design a two-part tariff contract which can encourage the supply chain members to promote cooperation and eventually coordinate the decentralized green supply chain under each power structure. Lastly, to further discuss the impact of the green awareness of consumers and the greening cost on supply chain players’ operational decisions and profits, we employ some numerical examples to conduct sensitivity analysis. The main conclusions are as follows. Firstly, the impact of power structure on the supply chain players’ operational decisions and profits mainly depends on the substitutability of the green products, the green awareness of consumers, and the greening cost for the manufacturer. Secondly, the more power the manufacturer has, the lower product greenness will be set. Thirdly, the consumer’s environmental awareness (the greening cost) positively (negatively) influences the manufacturer’s product greenness and wholesale price, the retailers’ sales prices, and the player’s profits under each power structure. Finally, the developed two-part tariff contract is practicable and beneficial for both the manufacturer and the two retailers.</jats:p>",

We show that a common ancestor of bony fishes likely had a thin retina without additional retinal oxygen supply mechanisms and that three different types of retinal capillaries were gained and lost independently multiple times during the radiation of vertebrates, and that these were invariably associated with parallel changes in retinal thickness. Since retinal thickness confers multiple advantages to vision, we propose that insufficient retinal oxygen supply constrained the functional evolution of the eye in early vertebrates, and that recurrent origins of additional retinal oxygen supply mechanisms facilitated the phenotypic evolution of improved functional eye morphology.</jats:p>"

Additionally, we explored which soil variables may be responsible for shifts in microbial communities. Generally, cultivation in desert soil increased microbial community abundance and diversity; however, bacterial abundance and diversity increased along the cultivation chronosequence, whereas fungal abundance and diversity initially increased and then decreased. Continuous crop cultivation also resulted in a shift in microbial community composition, notably with a decrease in nitrogen (N)‐fixing microbes (<jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Cyanobacteria</jats:italic>) and an increase in ammonia‐oxidizing (<jats:italic>Nitrosomonadales</jats:italic>) and nitrite‐oxidizing microbes (<jats:italic>Nitrospirae</jats:italic>).
