The decision to outsource the production of goods and services, however, has inherent risk. The purposes of this article are to describe characteristics of inbound supply that affect managerial perceptions of supply risk and to create a classification of those supply risk sources. An analysis of case study data suggests that supply risk is perceived by the effect that purchased items and services have on corporate profitability, market factors, and supplier characteristics. By understanding the characteristics of supply risk, supply management professionals can implement strategies for better managing that risk.</jats:p>",

The primary research question was: What are the reasons (drivers) for major changes in supply chain responsibilities? Over 200 such changes, comprising 158 additions and 44 deletions, were documented in the research. The findings are based on 10 case studies in large multi‐business unit companies, seven head quartered in the United States and three in Europe, representing a variety of industries. Findings indicated three drivers of change for supply chain responsibilities. The chief purchasing officer and his or her staff members had a great deal of influence, particularly in additions to category 1 (acquisition of specific organizational needs) and category 2 (activities within the total supply chain).</jats:p>",

While the prices paid to farmers are ultimately determined by supply and demand, the price farmers receive from traders and collector agents is influenced by tuber quality and the costs of transportation. Farmers are seldom dependent on their preferred trading partner and indicate that numerous alternative traders are available to purchase the potatoes they have harvested. While the traders similarly enjoy a strong positive relationship both with farmers and collector agents and their down‐stream customers, wholesalers report that they are much less satisfied in their exchange relationship with both the traders and the retailers. Wholesalers are more dependent on both their up‐stream and down‐stream trading partners and are more dissatisfied and less trusting of their exchange partners.</jats:p>",

The test program involved testing select inhibitors/dispersants, feed water pH, and operating recovery as part of a full-scale retrofit from a hollow fiber to spiral-wound reverse osmosis membrane facility. The test results indicated the facility could be operated at elevated recovery, but was sensitive to conditioning with sulfuric acid. Use of sulfuric acid addition to control calcium carbonate scaling was determined to increase calcium sulfate scaling. Membrane autopsy data confirmed calcium sulfate scaling onto the membrane surface with minimal biological and organic content. It was determined that recovery could be increased from 65 to 75 percent by discontinuing sulfuric acid addition and feeding only scale inhibitor. Scale inhibitors with dispersant properties were recommended for full-scale implementation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The last four years had been witnessing dramatic developments and large cost reduction in the cost of desalinated water produced by large seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants. First in the Eilat 10,000 m3/day plant, followed by the Tampa Bay, Florida project and more recently, by the Larnaca, Cyprus project. The real dramatic decrease relates to the Ashkelon large SWRO plant (in erection phase) where a sensational cost of about “half a US dollar” was reported. The reduced cost has become possible thanks to many factors: improved technology in pretreatment and reverse osmosis membranes, reduced energy consumption, lower interest rates and economics of scale. In this paper the evolution of water cost reduction in SWRO systems in the last decade is analyzed and is used as a basis for projection of further developments and cost reduction. Special attention is given to the new desalinated water standards such as reduced chloride and boron content, imposing an additional cost that can eventually be reduced by using more efficient reverse osmosis membranes and by implementing an improved boron removal technology. Due to these and to other developments a further 20% reduction in desalinated water cost will eventually be realized in the current decade.</jats:p>",

A wide range of endocrine disrupters were found in sewage and effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants. Toxicological evaluations indicate that conventional wastewater treatment plants are not able to remove these substances sufficiently before disposing effluent into the environment. Membrane technology, which is proving to be an effective barrier to these substances, is the subject of this research. Nanofiltration provides high quality permeates in water and wastewater treatment. Eleven different nanofiltration membranes were tested in the laboratory set-up. The observed retention for nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) ranged between 70% and 100%. The contact angle is an indicator for the hydrophobicity of a membrane, whose influence on the permeability and retention of NP was evident. The retention of BPA was found to be inversely proportional to the membrane permeability.</jats:p>",

Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis (RO) have been tested to clean the water streams from a dyeing bath and a reductive bath. It was shown that only the RO-process guaranteed a high rejection of salts under the process conditions. Furthermore, fouling could be analysed and reduced. The second case study is a manufacturer of functional proteins. An ultrafiltration system was used to concentrate the proteins from pig rind. It could be proved that the declining flux was caused by the adsorption of proteins on the membrane surface. To control fouling, a concept involving operation below the critical flux and a cleaning strategy is presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last five years over 100 microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) drinking water plants have been installed in Europe with a combined output of some 1,500 ML/day. The impetus behind this growth is concern over drinking water quality, regulatory pressure, the rapidly declining costs of membrane systems, and consumer pressures for non-chemical treatment. Although the principal justification for membrane plants is their capacity to remove human pathogens more effectively than conventional treatment, the ability of large plants to retain an integral barrier is not well understood. Currently available technology can monitor a full-scale membrane plant for integrity against passage of bacteria and parasites but not viruses. In essence the plant operator has to rely on the membrane manufacturer – on an assumption that if the membrane is not compromised at a level of 1 to 2 μm (the current practical level of measurement) it is also not compromised for virus removal. This paper quantifies the loss of integrity that can occur from membrane fiber failure. It explains the mathematical models used to describe bypass flow through compromised fibers and correlates the results with laboratory tests. Both are compared with artificially compromised fibers in a large full-scale operating plant. Under the worst case scenario where a fiber breaks close to the pot (collection end of the filtration module or element) the relative loss of integrity between alternative process designs from a single broken fiber can differ by as much as 2 log reduction values. The analysis demonstrates the need for monitoring methodology that that can track incremental changes in integrity to allow scheduled rather than emergency maintenance. It highlights the need for regulatory authorities to approve membrane systems based on actual operating performance in preference to laboratory data.</jats:p>",

At the EurOMA Conference in Copenhagen in 2002 many papers focused on SCM as a research topic. Similarly, an increasing number of companies are establishing positions as supply chain managers. SCM is also a popular theme for trade journals and management conferences. The quest for integration is an explicit or implicit assumption in most literature within SCM. The basic hypothesis is “the more integration – the better the management of the chain”. This article discusses what the term “management” in the concept of SCM stands for. The integration assumption as a “cure all” prescription for SCM is challenged, and questions raised as to when it is possible and desirable to exercise management in supply chains. The main thesis is that it depends very much on the “environment” of the supply chain and the power relations between the participants in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this research were to understand the nature of the fouling mechanisms for ultrafiltration when used for waters that either require softening or have been softened, and to use that understanding to determine promising options for the use of softening as a pretreatment before ultrafiltration (UF). Several characteristics of softening, including extent of softening, precipitation kinetics, and hydrophobicity of membrane materials, were investigated as independent variables. Because of softening, both the organic matter concentration and the particle concentration of feed water to ultrafiltration were reduced, thus reducing the degree of fouling. The slow kinetics of softening had little effect on membrane fouling although precipitation directly occurred on the membrane surface in the system during the operation. Detailed images of the membrane surface obtained by scanning electron microscopy confirmed substantial amounts of the precipitates on the surface. In contrast, the hydrophobicity of the membrane material showed a significant effect on the flux decline behavior. Overall, the integrated water treatment of softening and ultrafiltration is shown to be a promising option for hard waters.</jats:p>",

The SBR achieved low ammonium and nitrogen removal rates and COD removal values close to 90%, which decreased dramatically during the last 30 days of operation. An important washout of microorganisms in the SBR was noticed due to the proliferation of filamentous bacteria.

It utilises ultrafiltration membranes constructed as hollow fibres with a number of membrane elements in a pressure housing. The plant has been operating since spring 2001. The decision to install the system was made in anticipation of the introduction of tighter regulations on Cryptosporidium in water supplies in the UK. Once a decision was made to proceed with a membrane system the ability to monitor the integrity of the system and to repair problems became a crucial design parameter that was a critical part of membrane selection. The need to include a system affected the design of the filtration units offered by manufacturers. The available systems for integrity testing are reviewed and the reasons for selecting the system adopted are discussed. These include particle counting and the dosing of test particulate loads. The different forms of air passage integrity tests are discussed and the displaced air flow system used is described. Once a failure has been detected it must be traced so that the fault can be repaired. This procedure is described together with the techniques of pin repair of damaged fibres. At Clay Lane and other membrane filtration sites the backwash water from membrane cleaning is recovered using a secondary membrane system. Currently the secondary system operates in the same integrity testing regime as the primary system and the secondary filtrate is returned ahead of the primary membrane system. The relative merits of this system, or the alternative of adding the recovered water to the filtrate are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Surface water such as aquifers, recreational waters and rivers are often loaded by inflows with low quality, so that drinking water production, swimming or ground water charging must be restricted. To ensure the long-term use it is necessary to treat the influents or the water used for ground water charging. The current treatment process for phosphorus and turbidity removal is a combination of precipitation/coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and sand filtration. By using this conventional method it is possible to reduce the dissolved ortho-phosphate and the turbidity (particulate phosphorus) as well as the amounts of algae and pathogenic organisms to very low concentrations. The high degree of reduction in this process is only achieved by a relatively high dosage of coagulants and flocculants. Such a process has been used for nearly 20 years by the Berliner Wasserbetriebe. In this study a comparison will be made between this process, which represents the state-of-the-art, and the combination of precipitation/coagulation with dead-end membrane filtration (micro-/ultrafiltration) concerning water quality and costs. The results show that it is possible to reach similar levels of phosphorus removal as with floc filtration. However, floc filtration requires significantly higher amounts of chemicals (coagulants and flocculants). No flocculants are used for membrane filtration. But the estimated costs for the membrane based process are at 0.17 €/m3 probably a little more expensive. However, the excellent permeate quality is much better at the values of suspended solids and micro-biological organisms.</jats:p>",

These conditions are favourable for the use of solar energy as the driving force for water treatment systems. Especially in remote rural areas with low infrastructure and without connection to a grid, smallscale, stand-alone operating systems for the desalination of brackish water from wells or salt water from the sea are desirable to provide settlements with clean potable water. Fraunhofer Institut für Solare Energiesysteme is currently developing a solar thermally driven stand alone desalination system. The aim is to develop systems for a capacity range of 0.2 to 10 m3/day. Technical simplicity, long maintenance-free operation periods and high quality potable water output are very important aims for successful applications of the systems. The separation technique that the system is based on is membrane distillation. The implemented heat source is a corrosion-free, sea water resistant thermal collector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we present a canonical setting that illustrates the need for explicitly modeling interactions between manufacturing and marketing/sales decisions in a firm. We consider a firm that sells an innovative product with a given market potential. The firm may not be able to meet demand due to capacity constraints. For such firms, we present a new model of demand, modified from the original model of Bass, to capture the effect of unmet past demand on future demand. We use this model to find production and sales plans that maximize profit during the lifetime of the product in a firm with a fixed production capacity. We conduct an extensive numerical study to establish that the trivial, myopic sales plan that sells the maximal amount possible at each time instant is not necessarily optimal. We show that a heuristic “build-up” policy, in which the firm does not sell at all for a period of time and builds up enough inventory to never lose sales once it begins selling, is a robust approximation to the optimal policy. Specializing to a lost-sales setting, we prove that the optimal sales plan is indeed of the “build-up” type. We explicitly characterize the optimal build-up period and analytically derive the optimal initial inventory and roll-out delay. Finally, we show that the insights obtained in the fixed capacity case continue to hold when the firm is able to dynamically change capacity. </jats:p>",

The particle size distribution in the retentate tank was not affected by the frequency of backwashing.

Experimental results show that, for this module, concentration polarisation and heat transfer limitations are not significant and do not modify the permeate flux. This is a great advantage over reverse osmosis (RO). Energy consumption was then studied using computations based on modelling. Two different industrial plants were considered: the first one consisted of hollow fibre modules arranged in series and operated in a single-pass.

The fouling of different nanofiltration membranes by pre-treated surface waters was investigated in a laboratory-scale filtration unit in this study. The results indicate that the traditional chemical treatment does not remove membrane foulants from the surface water. No correlation was found between the feed water constituents and nanofiltration performance, but most feed water components are expected to interact in membrane fouling.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This analysis presents the results of a study carried out on 6 alternative options for the disposal of membrane reject (concentrate) from a Danish polyester dyehouse. The options analysed comprise: discharge to sewer (reference option and current practice), transport to biogas followed by sludge incineration, wet air oxidation, activated carbon, transport to hazardous waste treatment facility, and drying for zero-discharge. In most disposal scenarios considered it is advantageous to dewater the concentrate further from 2.5%DS (dry solids) to 20%DS in order to reduce its volume and thereby diminish the transport costs. Membrane filtration is a technology competitive to evaporation for dewatering at moderate DS contents that avoid the effects of fouling. The results obtained help concluding that discharge to sewer and biogas treatment are the less expensive options, as long as the concentrate is free of pollutants that may disturb the treatment process or jeopardize further applications of the biodegraded residue. Total dewatering of the concentrate for zero liquid discharge is still the most expensive solution. The results obtained confirm that concentrate disposal is a major cost of industrial water recycling projects where the concentrate has low or no commercial value. In the scenarios analyzed, concentrate disposal costs represent between 10% and 70% of the total treatment costs per m3 of water recycled. It is therefore recommended to analyze in detail the available alternatives for concentrate disposal in order to identify these costs at an early stage of the projects.</jats:p>",

The permeation rate of chlorinated hydrocarbons increased at higher temperature and water flow rate. On the other hand, the effects of the operational conditions in the permeate side were complex. When the permeate side was kept at low pressure without sweeping air (pervaporation), the removal efficiency of chlorinated hydrocarbon, as well as water permeation rate, was low probably due to lower level of membrane swelling on the permeate side. But when a very small amount of air was swept on the membrane (air perstripping) under a low pressure, it showed a higher efficiency than in any other conditions. Three factors affecting the permeation rate are: 1) reduction of diffusional boundary layer within the microporous support membrane, 2) air/vapour flow regime and short cutting, and 3) the extent of membrane swelling on the permeate side. A higher air flow, in general, reduces the diffusional boundary layer, but at the same time disrupts the flow regime, causes short cutting, and makes the membrane dryer. Due to these multiple effects on gas permeation, there is an optimum operational condition concerning the vacuum pressure and the air flow rate. Under the optimum operational condition, the residence time within the hollow-fibre membrane to achieve 99% removal of TCE was 5.25 minutes. The log (removal rate) was linearly correlated with the average hydraulic residence time within the membrane, and 1 mg/L of TCE can be reduced to 1 μg/L (99.9% removal).</jats:p>",

The backwash procedure consisted of two steps: in a first step (phase A), air was added to the feed water inside the fibre lumen at the bottom of the module. In a second step (phase B), cleaned water backwash was performed. Different air velocities were used and the kinetics of particle removal were studied with turbidity measurements of backwash waters. The experimental results showed that using an air–fluid mixing allows one to increase the quantity of particles removed from the hollow fibres. For the phase A, the removed mass is higher when the air velocity and duration of air injection increased. But, even at very low air velocity (0.08 m/s), a high backwash efficiency was observed. Experiments with filtration/air-sparging backwash cycles concluded that using air–fluid mixing in the backwash sequence allowed prevention of long-term fouling and reduced the rate of fouling during the filtration period.</jats:p>",

Several natural organic matter (NOM) fractions isolated from Ribou Reservoir have been ultrafiltered with two different 100 KD membranes (regenerated cellulose and polyethersulfone) using a non-stirred cell unit. Results have shown that the organic colloidal fraction (bacterial peptidoglycan residue) shows the most significant fouling. The dissolved fraction (&amp;lt;0.45 μm) of NOM, which contains solutes larger and smaller than the pore size of 100 KD membranes, contributes to fouling through pore blockage and/or adsorption mechanisms. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) examination reveals morphological changes during membrane fouling. The polyethersulfone and regenerated cellulose membranes are relatively smooth. However, based on AFM, some of the fouled membrane surfaces appear rougher than the corresponding clean membrane surface. These results demonstrate the role of surface coverage in ultrafiltration membranes. It appears that membrane roughness is a key physical parameter in membrane fouling. More analysis is being undertaken with scanning electron microscopy images to determine pore size distribution for the clean and the fouled membranes, providing more information in terms of fouling mechanisms.</jats:p>",

Most mixing‐rate estimates as well as numerical turbulence closure schemes commonly employed in numerical models have, however, neglected salt‐finger induced mixing. Here we examine the potential contribution of salt‐finger induced mixing to nutrient fluxes. Our model results suggest that salt‐fingering instabilities generate substantial nutrient fluxes (on average 0.03 mol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) which are of similar magnitude as fluxes associated with mechanically induced turbulence or with mesoscale eddies. Because salt‐fingering activity depends on the proportion of temperature versus salinity effects on stratification rather than on the stability of stratification itself, its sensitivity to climate change will differ from that of “ordinary” mixing processes and needs to be considered in the context of global change.</jats:p>",

Especially where membrane filtration is used in potable water production for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms, the integrity of such a system is of the utmost importance. Membrane integrity testing can be performed in a number of ways, where the pressure-hold or vacuum-hold test and the diffusive airflow test are well known. Although relatively widely applied in membrane plants worldwide, all of these methods exhibit major drawbacks like off-line testing and the lack of a direct relationship between the measured data and the removal efficiency (log-removal). To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of conventional integrity testing systems, a new kind of integrity test, the Spiked Integrity Monitoring System or SIM®-System was developed by NORIT Membrane Technology in close co-operation with Water Supply Company North Holland and IWW Rhenish-Westphalian Institute for Water Research, which combines the accuracy of a challenge test with the speed of a pressure test, while keeping the system under test in operation.</jats:p>",

This new nanofiltration membrane was developed to selectively remove organic material with molecular weight greater than 1,000 daltons, while passing most salts. This characteristic is ideal for applications which have low salinity, but high color or other organic compounds. This membrane differs from traditional polyamide RO membranes as it is chlorine tolerant and has a large negative surface charge. This makes it ideal for waters containing high organic levels. This membrane has been extensively pilot tested with other traditional nanofiltration membranes. The membrane had the best combination of high flux, high color removal and minimal hardness removal. As a result of these features the membrane was selected for a 27.8 ML (7.35 mgd) water treatment plant at the Irvine Ranch Water District. The full-scale plant contains about 1,300 pieces of 33.9 square metres (365 sq feet) spiral wound elements. The full-scale plant has been completed and start-up of the first train has been completed. The feed color units (CU) were in excess of 200 CU, while the permeate was less than 5 CU, which meets the requirement of the plant. This is one of the largest membrane plants designed to only remove color from the water.</jats:p>",

Based on the results of the ScaleGuard the conversion of both the reverse osmosis plant and the nanofiltration plant has been increased from 80% to 82%. The interpretation of the results of the ScaleGuard which was connected with the reverse osmosis plant was not unambiguous. This was due to the mass transfer coefficient decline in the ScaleGuard which could not be attributed to scaling. Results in the nanofiltration plant did not give room for any doubt. In addition, safe supersaturation ratios were derived from experience in pilot- and full-scale plants using anti-scalants for seven sparingly soluble inorganic compounds.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a thermophilic aerobic treatment (55°C) combined with ultrafiltration is tested, this combination reaches mesophilic COD removal rates.

Time-averaged shear stress values were approximately double the water flow induced shear stress values in all experimental conditions. Histograms of the shear stress variation data were fitted well to the normal distribution curve and mean plus three times of standard deviation was chosen as “maximum” shear stress value, which means “effective” shear stress for the detachment of substances off the membrane surface. The “effective” shear stress value increased with the increase of air flow flux and increased also with the increase of viscosity. Especially in the highest viscosity condition (15 mPa s), the value showed quite large values probably due to the interacting force between the wall surface and large bubbles that were produced by the effect of highly viscous liquid.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dead-end ultrafiltration has proved itself as a technique for reclamation of backwash water of sand filters and as a pretreatment step before spiral wound reverse osmosis. A direct result of dead-end filtration is a flux decrease in time caused by the accumulation of material in the membrane pores and on the membrane surface. Different cleaning techniques are used to remove this accumulated material. Recently a new technique has been introduced, the AirFlush®. This technique makes use of air to create higher turbulence as compared to a water flush. At Delft University of Technology in co-operation with X-flow and Norit Membrane Technology research has been started into the fundamentals of the combined air and water flush. As in many industrial processes, an equal division of water and air over an installation is very important. To check the distribution of water and air over the cross-sectional area of tubular and capillary membrane modules two different test installations have been built. The results from the experiments show that for tubular membrane modules the water and air distribution over the cross-sectional area of the module is not always equally divided. Improvements have to be obtained by a better air distribution system. For capillary membrane modules the distribution of water and air over the cross-sectional area is more equally divided. The results from the experiments are discussed taking into account the theory of two-phase flow. It is shown that from the theory of two-phase flow the good distribution for the capillary membrane module can be explained by the large frictional pressure drop compared to the hydrostatic pressure drop.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1999 the Mery-sur-Oise plant has operated using two processes in parallel: one, a membrane process using nanofiltration, and the other, a conventional biological process. For operational flexibility, it is desired to be able to transfer some of the sand-filtered ozonated water from the biological process to the membranes. Before carrying out this transfer, it was important to assess the role of ozonation on membrane fouling, by comparing the effects of ozonated water (SFOW) with non-ozonated water (SFW). Tests were performed, in spring and fall 2001, in a pilot unit comprising two nanofiltration lines in parallel. The first test emphasized the essential role of the pre-filter placed upstream of the membranes. This latter - supplied with ozonated water – released particles when saturated, linked to changes in the feed water quality. Despite very frequent pre-filter replacements, fouling proved to be greater for the membranes supplied by ozonated water. Even though the silt density index and total cell counts levels of SFOW were lower than SFW, ozonated water could increase membrane fouling. The action of ozone on the nature of organic matter appeared to be the main cause. Ozone modified the composition of natural organic matter, on one hand by reducing the hydrophobic fraction in favour of the hydrophilic fraction, which is harder for the membrane NF 200B to reject, and on the other hand by acting on the lyses of algal cells and the release of extracellular organic matter. The membrane autopsies confirmed that the deposit is essentially composed of organic matter. Images taken with a scanning electron microscope showed a more significant deposit for membranes fouled with SFOW. For the membrane fouled in spring, the images also revealed the presence of algae; for some, cells were lysed upon ozonation. HPSEC-UVA-DOC enabled the types of molecules to be identified according to size. Humic substances (1,000 to 5,000 daltons) and other low molecular weight components (400 to 600 daltons) represented a minor part of the fouling material with the major components being proteins (21,000 to 24,000 daltons). Also, humic substances were relatively more abundant in the membrane fouled with ozonated water in spring.</jats:p>",

If this is the case, countermeasures are taken. However, conventional antifouling strategies are hampered by some intrinsic problems which can identified as follows: (1) there are no early warning systems, (2) detection of biofouling is not performed on surfaces but by analysis of water samples which will not indicate site or extent of biofilms, (3) disinfection is misunderstood as cleaning, (4) nutrients are not limited although they must be considered as potential fouling biomass, and (5) the efficacy of countermeasures is performed by process performance or product quality. Avoiding mistakes 1–3 and 5 requires monitoring systems which provide relevant information on line, in situ, in real time, non-destructively and suitable for computer-aided automatization. Sample removal, staining or other secondary procedures should not be necessary. A suitable monitoring device is the fibre optical sensor. It consists of a measuring head integrated into the surface to be monitored and contains a sending and a reading optical fibre. If material is deposited on the tip of the fibres, light emitted from the sending fibre will be scattered back by particles and collected by the reading fibre. Increasing deposit accumulation results in an increasing signal of backscattered light. This sensor has been successfully integrated into a water piping system and responded quantitatively to build up and removal of deposits. Under conditions in which the particles were represented by bacteria, a calibration was performed. A stable signal could be acquired above a cell density of 105 cells cm-2. The system is, in principle, suitable to be integrated into membrane modules at representative locations.</jats:p>",

The objective of the study was to assess the potential of ultrafiltration (UF) pre-treatment prior to RO for desalting seawater with high-fouling tendency. A UF pilot plant equipped with an Aquasource membrane was directly operated on Gibraltar surface seawater in dead-end mode. The competitiveness of UF pre-treatment towards conventional pre-treatment was assessed by looking at the impact on RO hydraulic performances. The study showed that UF provided permeate water with higher quality than with a conventional pre-treatment. The main seawater compounds responsible for UF fouling were organic matter released by phytoplanktonic organisms. The combination of UF with a pre-coagulation at low dose helped in controlling this fouling and providing water in steady state conditions. The performance of RO membranes downstream of UF exceeded the usual operating conditions encountered in seawater desalination. The combined effect of higher recovery and higher flux rate promises to significantly reduce the RO plant costs.</jats:p>",

AOM extracted in water as a solvent showed a high hydrophilic fraction (57.3%) with a low SUVA (1.0 L/m-mg). The molecular weight (MW) distribution showed a significant heterogeneity (high value of polydispersivity) and high protein content (as indicated by specific fluorescence). A significant amount of proteinaceous components such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs, UV-screening components) and phycobilins (light-harvesting pigment) was detected by UV/visible absorption. The confirmation of proteins was proven by FTIR (at 1,661 cm-1 and 1,552 cm-1) and EEM spectra (EX: 278-282 nm and EM: 304-353 nm). A bench-scale cross-flow unit, employing a flat-sheet membrane specimen, was used to examine nanofiltration (NF) membrane fouling and removal of natural organic matter (NOM) derived from different blends of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and AOM. The flux decline and organic matter rejection as a function of delivered DOC showed significantly different results depending on the organic matter composition of samples even though the test conditions were the same (organic matter concentration, pH, temperature, inorganic salt composition and concentration, and recovery). A higher flux decline was observed with increasing proportions of AOM. Organic matter rejections also decreased with higher AOM contributions to the samples, indicating that lower MW AOM components were not well rejected by the NF 200 membrane having a 360 dalton molecular weight cutoff (MWCO). However, SRHA that shows a relatively high MW (5,000-1,000 daltons) and high SUVA (7.4 L/m-mg) was preferentially rejected through electrostatic repulsion/size exclusion by the NF 200 membrane, having a high negative charge (zeta potential: -15.6 mV), low MWCO, and relatively low hydrophobicity. Even though the DOC concentration of feed water is a decisive factor for membrane fouling along with membrane properties and operating conditions, the characteristics of organic matter are more influential in fouling potential. Protein-like and polysaccharide-like substances were found as major foulants by FTIR.</jats:p>",

Beginning in 1999 the industry started experiencing a sharp decline, which cost jobs and closed factories on both sides of the border. This study applies grounded theory to develop an initial understanding of the factors contributing to the success (and failure) of maquiladora realized strategies, that is, performed operating behaviors and the role of culture in the results these operations achieve. Broadly, these factors include internal relationships (with both management and line employees) and external relationships (both organizational and governmental).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although numerous ultra- and microfiltration dead-end plants with capillary membranes are already operative, some phenomena are still unexplained. Therefore, the fundamental processes taking place inside a capillary membrane were observed. Initially, the flow field depending on axial and radial position inside the capillary was determined. Then, particle transport and deposition were theoretically studied by determination of particle trajectories considering influences of particle concentration and walleffects on hydrodynamics, DLVO-forces, buoyancy, gravitation, diffusion and interparticular forces. Following these calculations, incoming particles with a diameter smaller than the so-called “limiting diameter”, which depends on operational and geometrical boundary conditions, due to depositions are widely and evenly distributed. Larger particles do not deposit until they are at a certain distance from the water inlet. The larger the particle size, the longer the distance. If the particle is larger than the so-called “corkforming diameter” then the particles are transported to the dead-end of the capillary which may cause a clogging of the capillary. This “corkforming diameter” depends on operational as well on geometrical boundary conditions. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results from investigations with spherical latex and non-spherical walnut particles. To avoid this clogging, the deposition of the particles should be evenly distributed, which means that the “corkforming diameter” should be as large as possible. That goal could be achieved by operating the membrane plant with short and/or wide capillaries. However, a small permeate flux, a small membrane resistance and/or a small membrane surface potential succeed as well. Another possibility could be to operate the capillaries with a very small cross flow.</jats:p>",

A competitive price means low capital and operating cost, which are inversely proportional to membrane hydraulic performance (permeate flux). Porous membranes lose their hydraulic performance as materials accumulate on their surfaces and/or within their pores, a process called membrane fouling. Although a significant effort has been devoted to elucidating the fouling mechanisms of polymeric membranes by natural organic matter (NOM), no single model has yet been accepted. In fact, most of the existing literature is contradictory, showing that membrane fouling is far from being fully understood. This article reviews over a decade of Ondeo's experience on characterizing and preventing fouling of polymeric membranes by natural organic matter and inorganic compounds. The review focuses on the role of NOM size and hydrophobicity, of membrane chemistry, and of solution pretreatment (coagulation and/or adsorption). In addition, the efficacy of some currently used strategies to minimize membrane fouling is also discussed.</jats:p>",

The sharp decline in permeate flux in the first 10-20 minutes of filtration was largely due to a combination of the blocking filtration mechanisms. However, a distinction between “complete”, “standard” and “intermediate blocking” mechanisms was not possible as a large degree of overlap existed between the mechanisms and the transition from one type of blocking to another was very smooth. Coagulation appeared to retard blocking and consequently, the duration of the “blocking phase” was twice as long for coagulated water compared with non-coagulated water. The “transition phase”, where both blocking and cake filtration occurred simultaneously, was also extended in the case of coagulated water as continuous blocking of the membrane through the pores of the cake was observed. The modified fouling index-ultrafiltration (MFI-UF) was employed to examine the impact of coagulation on filter cake properties. Coagulation reduced the specific resistance of the filter cake by 50% at a TMP of 1.5 bar, and 35% at a TMP of 0.5 bar. Depth filtration was hardly evident at a TMP of 0.5 bar, but was very pronounced at a TMP of 1.5 bar as the specific resistance of the filter cake increased continuously, particularly in the absence of coagulant. The filter cake was sensitive to the applied TMP and the MFI-UF value increased by 130% for non-coagulated surface water and 55% for coagulated water due to compression of the cake, when the TMP increased from 0.5 to 1.5 bar.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last four years a new cushion module has been commercialised for dead-end ultrafiltration in water treatment. However, system and operation mode optimisation is still subject to research and development activities. For dead-end ultrafiltration one of the key issues is the module flushing procedure. So far, analytical methods for the investigation of particular steps during module flushing are rare and optimisation in most cases relies on operating experience. This paper presents the optimisation of the airpulsing step as part of the module flushing procedure with an approach, which combines lab-scale experiments and analysis of full-scale plant operation. For this purpose a novel method for shear stress measurement has been developed and applied. The results have been utilised for the optimisation of a fullscale ultrafiltration unit for wastewater treatment plant effluent upgrade. After changing the module flushing parameters and thus enhancing the flushing efficiency it was possible to increase filtration performance.</jats:p>",

The experiments indicated almost complete removal of these solutes by the tight NF membranes, while the rejection obtained by the loose membranes was dependent on solute species. Compounds with flat-shaped structure like 2-H-benzothiazol and dimethyl phthalate were more permeable than other target solutes within the same molecular size range. Of the four methods of size determination used, there was no significant difference in the accuracy of prediction of rejection from the solute sizes. The size configurations of molecules have been identified to greatly influence the permeation or retention, yet the size parameter was thought to be incomplete as a single parameter in describing rejection of organic solutes. The logarithm of octanol-water partitioning coefficients of solutes appears not to be an effective parameter in modelling rejections as its contribution was only slight or minor. We obtained better correlations with structural configuration of molecules (by molecular width and length) and polarity of the molecules.</jats:p>",

A value‐gap analysis is performed from the perspectives of facilitating supply chain activities and connecting chain partners, revealing that gaps and limitations do exist in existing e‐hubs.

Controlling this phenomenon is a challenge due to the difficulty of cleaning biofouling in spiral wound membrane elements. It is assumed that cleaning can be more efficient when biofouling is in an early stage of colonisation. Therefore a sensitive method has to be available for an early identification of biofouling. The present method, the measurement of the normalised pressure drop (NPD) is not specific for biofouling and is not very sensitive. In this research the feasibility of the specific oxygen consumption rate for detection of the activity of biofilms was investigated in membrane systems. The method has the advantages to be specific for active biomass, applicable in situ, non-destructive and more sensitive than NPD. Three experiments demonstrated that the measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption is potentially a simple, reliable method for the measurement of the active biomass in membrane systems. During one of the experiments the method illustrated the effect of cleaning and the regrowth of bacteria afterwards. The method will be further evaluated and standardized. The relation between the specific oxygen consumption rate and the condition of the biofilm, measured by autopsy of membrane elements, will be further explored. The ongoing research will result in an apparatus and procedure, to be used for biofouling identification during the operation of full-scale and pilot plants.</jats:p>",

The efficiency of deposition will depend on the supersaturation and the condition of seeds, i.e. their reactivity. Poisoning of seeds by adsorption of natural organic matter and/or added commercial antiscalant will hinder the desupersaturation efficiency by blocking centres available for crystallisation. Barium sulphate precipitation in a laboratory scale DU was examined from natural reverse osmosis (RO) concentrates from surface water treatment pilot plant. Tests indicated similar effects on poisoning the barite seed grains by commercial antiscalant and natural organic matter from surface water (the Rhine River) treatment RO pilot plant (80% conversion) while no effect was observed from supersaturated synthetic (no organic matter) concentrate. An attempt was made to relate the effects of organic matter and the RO system conversion (50-85%). The rate of barite seed grain poisoning was attributed to the relative barium supersaturation in the concentrate. The efficiency of natural organic compounds started to decline above the supersaturation ratio of 3.3. Addition of commercial antiscalant enhanced the effect of natural organic matter. If the effects of organic matter in membrane systems are quantified and related to the RO system conversion, a laboratory DU can practically be used to control scaling.</jats:p>",

Virus removals by both systems were more than 7 logs, although the size of the tested Qβ virus (23 nm) was much smaller than the membrane nominal pore size of 100 nm. The virus inactivation by the addition of the coagulant (PACl) and the virus adsorption onto the floc retained on the membrane surface mainly contributed the virus removal.

Air bubbling, and above all adding ferric chloride, allowed an actual enhancement of the filtering conditions.

Under the operating conditions in place, neither solids content, particle size distribution nor addition of nutrient significantly affected the permeate flux which was considerably lower than expected (based on municipal wastewater treatment with MBRs).

As is common in these industries, prior to receiving a firm purchase order from the customer, the supplier receives a series of shared forecasts, which are called “soft orders.” Facing a stochastic internal manufacturing lead time, the supplier must decide at what time to begin the fulfillment of the order. This decision requires a trade-off between starting too early, leading to potential holding or cancellation costs, and starting too late, leading to potential delay costs. We collect detailed data of shared forecasts, actual purchase orders, production lead times, and delivery dates for a supplier-buyer dyad in the semiconductor equipment supply chain. Under the assumption that the supplier acts rationally, optimally balancing the cancellation, holding, and delay costs, we are able to estimate the corresponding imputed cost parameters based on the observed data. Our estimation results reveal that the supplier perceives the cost of cancellation to be about two times higher and the holding costs to be about three times higher than the delay cost. In other words, the supplier is very conservative when commencing the order fulfillment, which undermines the effectiveness of the overall forecast-sharing mechanism. </jats:p>",

In this study in-line coagulation with ferric chloride and polyaluminium chloride and EPCE are compared on pilot scale using capillary membranes with IJssel Lake water as feed water. The in-line coagulation experiments resulted in relatively low flux rates and irreversible fouling, whereas EPCE enabled us to achieve a flux rate of 100 l/(h.m2) and a dosage of less than 25 g/m3. However, a couple of technical questions need to be answered before fullscale application can be implemented with all types of ultrafiltration systems.</jats:p>",

The evolution of the gaps between retailers’ expectations and manufacturers’ perceived distribution performance was investigated, as well as a trend in terms of an increase or decrease in customer satisfaction with service provided by suppliers in such dimensions. Results indicate that retailers typically tend to be satisfied with the service provided by their suppliers. In addition, there may be an adjustment of distribution performance to expectations of retailers and to the provision, in some cases, of service above customer expectations.</jats:p>",

Five scenarios were run through the integrated SRTS-ATLAS model to project long-run effects on timber inventory (growing stock) and price. Besides reflecting differing assumptions about demand and supply, these scenarios defined different markets, thus affecting how the wood harvest was allowed to move across the region in response to demand. Regionally, at the end of the 50 yr projection period, cubic-foot growth and harvest were approximately in balance in the Reference Case, the scenario that we felt was most likely. Initial inventory on all timberland was 66.7 billion ft3. By 2050, inventory volume increased 13% to 75.4 billion ft3. Net growth declined over the 50 yr period from 35.3 to 32.1 ft3 ac-1 yr-1, while harvest increased from 26.6 to 31.9 ft3 ac-1 yr-1. Regional real price increased approximately 1.1% yr-1 over the period. Changes in the resource situation in one state affect the situation in the other states. There is a mutual dependence in markets that policy makers need to recognize. The integration of a market module into the NEFA modeling process added the interplay of market forces and improved upon the policy information available from the model.</jats:p>",

This paper describes the results of a survey conducted in the province of British Columbia aimed at uncovering the impediments to wood supply relationships between secondary and primary manufacturers. The study looks at the raw material needs of different categories of secondary manufacturers pertaining to wood quality, price and service and highlights similarities and differences between these groups. In general, the study found that the majority of secondary manufacturers are experiencing lumber procurement problems. Lumber grading issues are the biggest overall concern of manufacturers, and manufacturers of engineering building components were found to experience the most difficulties. The paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations to improve synergies between primary and secondary wood producers in British Columbia.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the results of research focussed on the different effects of in-line coagulation (FeCl3), towards the operation of semi-dead-end UF for drinking water and process water production starting from surface water. In this research, firstly the effects of the use of FeCl3 on the formed cake were studied, by both direct and indirect measurements. Using the ESEM technique (environmental scanning electron microscopy), which enables one to make pictures of wet samples, we observed that cake thickness was much higher upon use of FeCl3 (20 instead of 2 μm). As a result, the cake porosity was calculated to be much higher with than without coagulant use (93% instead of 37%). From the stability (nonincreasing) of the starting transmembrane pressure (TMP) in the successive filtration cycles, upon semidead-end operation, it was concluded that cake layer was less prone to adhere to the membrane surface when using coagulant. This is even more emphasized once the dosing is stopped, as a consequence the TMP rises very steeply under difficult circumstances, such as; high flux rates, high water recovery rates, and the use of membranes made from polymers with high adsorption properties. Secondly, indirect effects of the use of coagulant on filtration behaviour were investigated. Thus, it was found that TMP increase in the filtration cycle was much lower, due to depth filtration in the formed high-volume cake, and TMP was much more stable over a long time. These observations were in good agreement with found higher cake porosity. Moreover, it was observed that due to the use of a coagulant, the influences of membrane polymer nature and membrane structure disappeared, cleaning action could be postponed and cleaning aggressiveness could be lowered. In addition, water recovery and flux rate could be increased, and influence of seasonal water quality variations could be better faced. Finally, it was found that the treatment of surface water with high DOC content (e.g. 10 mg DOC/l) was enabled.</jats:p>",

The objective of this paper is to describe how the system dynamics (SD) methodology can help the re-formulation processes of economic and productive systems, while also evaluating new interventionist policies. The SD methodology seeks to model each of the casual links explicitly, and to track the resulting system behavior over time. In this paper, a network of companies in the Brazilian milk supply chain is defined in terms of an SD model. In particular, it shows that before actions are taken, their impacts on the agent's production costs can be forecasted, giving more consistency to the study. Three scenarios are developed to study the system behavior over the simulation time by varying the expected performance of the technical assistance service introduced in the network. The network is composed of three representative groups of rural producers and a dairy company. Input data are based on a network in the central region of the state of São Paulo. The agents' unit costs are forecasted to decrease after coordinated actions are taken throughout the network over the simulation time. As a result, non-negative operational profit margins can be reached giving more stability to the whole system. </jats:p>",

This article redresses significant deficiencies in these studies by providing new data on long-run apprentice training rates by broad occupational group. This data confirms the existence of a sustained break in the long-run apprentice training rate from the early 1990s to the present. The article also provides an overview and critical assessment of the key explanations of this decline and policy recommendations to redress the decline. It is argued that these explanations may be classified into supply-side and demand-side approaches. The article concludes firstly, that, in general, demand-side explanations provide a superior understanding of declining training rates. Secondly, given the potential importance of trade skill shortages additional research is required both to quantify the effect of the various demand-side contributions to reduced training rates and to reorient current policies to better address these demand-side causes. </jats:p>",

In the case of UF membranes, flux decline may be caused by sequential or simultaneous processes such as cake/gel formation with large (macromolecular) molecules and pore blockage with relatively smaller molecules during filtration. The flux decline tests with representative macromolecules showed that fouling was affected more by the physical characteristics (e.g. size and structure (shape)) of foulants than the characteristics (e.g. hydrophilicity) of foulants.</jats:p>",

This evolving shift in the basis of rivalry among firms puts increasing demands on corporate strategy. A future challenge for agrifood firms is to embrace strategy that includes, at least conceptually, knowledge as a strategic asset of a firm. Knowledge and its management are emerging in contemporary thought as a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage. This analysis begins by examining the next evolutionary phase in supply chain integration as a learning supply chain. Conceptually a learning supply chain offers the significant benefits of a truly agile, dynamic response capability for end-users and a fair distribution of returns to all chain participants. The focus then turns to the relationships between network embeddedness and the strategic mix between exploitation and exploration, using knowledge management logic. Managing knowledge for agrifood firms implies the creation and commercialization of intangible assets. The analysis indicates that significant intangibles in the form of brand equity may influence supply chain characteristics to strong ties and close networks. Some specific characteristics would be relatively high embeddedness, high social capital, more easily exchanged tacit knowledge, and higher levels of trust.</jats:p>",

In contrast, nineteen states provided little or no subsidy. Since states invest in dental education, in part, to ensure an adequate supply of dentists, we examined the factors that explain dentist variation among states. We found that population size, per capita income, and the number of students from the state enrolled in dental school had a significant and positive impact. The level of state support for dental education and the presence of a dental school had a negative or nonsignificant effect, respectively. Apparently, dentists locate based primarily on the demand for their services and, to a lesser extent, on where they were raised. The states' investment in dental education had little impact on number of dentists because some states had many dentists but invested little in dental education. We identified two states that collectively account for 15 percent of enrolled students even though they provide minimal subsidy for dental education. We discuss the implications of these findings for states that do not have dental schools and need more dentists.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Conventional arsenic removal processes have difficulty removing low concentrations of arsenic ion from water. Therefore, it is very hard to comply with stringent low levels of arsenic, such as below 10 μg/L. So, we have developed two arsenic removal processes which are able to comply with more stringent arsenic regulations. They are the MF membrane process combined with chemical sludge adsorption and NF membrane process equipped with the vibratory shear enhanced process (VSEP). In this paper, we examine the performance of these new processes for the removal of arsenic ion of a low concentration from water. We found that chemical sludge produced in the conventional rapid sand filtration plants can effectively remove As (V) ions of H2AsO4- and HAsO42- through anion exchange reaction. The removal efficiency of MF membrane process combined with chemical sludge adsorption increased to about 36%, compared to MF membrane alone. The strong shear force on the NF membrane surface produced by vibration on the VSEP causes the concentration polarization layer to thin through increased back transport velocity of particles. So, it can remove even dissolved constituents effectively. Therefore, As (V) ions such as H2AsO4- and HAsO42- can be removed. The concentration of As (V) ions decreased from 50 μg/L to below 10 μg/L and condensation factor in recirculating water increased up to 7 times by using NF membrane equipped with VSEP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Most gravel‐bed streams exhibit a surface armour in which the median grain size of the surface particles is coarser than that of the subsurface particles. This armour has been interpreted to result when the supply of sediment is less than the ability of the stream to move sediment. While there may be certain sizes in the bed for which the supply is less than the ability of the stream to transport these sizes, for other sizes of particles the supply may match or even exceed the ability of the channel to transport these particles. These sizes of particles are called ‘supply‐limited’ and ‘hydraulically limited’ in their transport, respectively, and can be differentiated in dimensionless sediment transport rating curves by size fractions. The supply‐ and hydraulically limited sizes can be distinguished also by comparing the size of particles of the surface and subsurface. Those sizes that are supply‐limited are winnowed from the bed and are under‐represented in the surface layer. Progressive truncation of the surface and subsurface size distributions from the ﬁne end and recalculation until the size distributions are similar (collapse), establishes the break between supply‐ and hydraulically limited sizes. At sites along 12 streams in Idaho ranging in drainage area from about 100 to 4900 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, sediment transport rating curves by size class and surface and subsurface size distributions were examined. The break between sizes that were supply‐ and hydraulically limited as determined by examination of the transport rate and surface and subsurface size distributions was similar. The collapse size as described by its percentile in the cumulative size distribution averaged D<jats:sub>36</jats:sub> of the surface and D<jats:sub>73</jats:sub> of the subsurface. The discharge at which the collapse size began to move averaged 88 per cent of bankfull discharge. The collapse size decreased as bed load yield increased and increased with the degree of selective transport. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The three methods evaluated included one biologic type (MS-2 phage), that has been employed previously; and two, new non-biologic types (24-nanometre polystyrene fluorescent dyed microspheres and fluorescent Rhodamine WT [R-WT] dye, molecular mass 496 daltons). All three surrogates were employed in a manner intended to show a minimum of 4-logs removal by the NF and RO membranes selected for test. Methods of compromisation included a pinhole induced through one membrane leaf in the spiral wound NF/RO element, and both cracking of and removal of sections from one of the permeate tube o-rings. Testing was conducted on two source waters, representing brackish surface water and effluent categories: a microfiltered secondary effluent and a river water. The river water is characterized by low to moderate TDS and high TOC and was treated with conventional alum coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and granular media filtration for subsequent membrane processing.</jats:p>",

From various analyses of a NOM-fouled ultrafiltration membrane surface, large amounts of colloidal NOM were found in the analyzed foulants. From FTIR spectra and pyrolysis analyses, colloidal NOMs were found to include amino sugars and polysaccharides, as indicated by N-acetyl groups in the FTIR spectra and from pyrolysis GC-mass analyses. Colloidal NOMs have two problematic aspects for membrane applications, which may induce bio-fouling due to their low biostabilities, and relatively high DBPs reactivities. The amino sugars and polysaccharides can be utilized by heterotrophic bacteria, and are identified as colloidal NOM with high fractions of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (approximately 39%), so, their removal is expected to involve some form of biological pre-treatment process. Colloidal NOM also exhibit relatively high formation potentials of DBPs, especially haloacetic acids.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the deposits on the membrane cannot be eliminated extensively by conventional backwashing. An extensive detachment of the formed layers while backwashing is desired to achieve cost advantages when using the process combination flocculation/ultrafiltration for the direct treatment of surface waters. Hence, pilot and laboratory plant experiments were carried out while dosing different coagulants at different pH-values with different concentrations of the coagulant to investigate their influence on the build-up of the coating layers. The experiments described here were focused on the following questions. Firstly, how do coagulation and flocculation conditions influence the performance of the treatment combination flocculation/ultrafiltration and which coagulant is best? Secondly, does a good operational performance of the combination flocculation/ultrafiltration at laboratory scale coincide with good operational performances at the pilot plant or does the presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the raw water decrease the performance significantly? Thirdly, does a good operational performance coincide with an extensive reduction of DOC, or humic substances, respectively?</jats:p>",

The research design covers multiple layers of one supply chain and provides empirical evidence obtained from a multiplecase study and an electronic mail survey. Results point to the intrinsic relationships between supply chain structure and the deployment of e-collaboration tools. Further, results indicate that the level of perceived efficiency of e-collaboration tools is lower at the upstream end of the supply chain and that supply chain execution (SCE) e-collaboration tools are more efficient than the supply chain planning (SCP) tools. The overall findings also suggest that e-collaboration tools can improve supply chain members' ability to innovate in terms of processes and relationships but not yet in terms of products. </jats:p>",

The main challenge remains the fouling of membrane surface/pores by organic matter which prevents efficient operation. The extent of this fouling strongly depends on feed water quality as well as membrane properties. The aim of this study is to characterize wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) and to describe its fouling behavior in relation to various membrane properties (pore size, charge, material, hydrophobicity) through evaluation with stirred cell experiments, elemental analysis, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, and atomic force spectroscopy. Four membranes are tested - one ultrafiltration (UF) membrane and three microfiltration (MF) membranes - with bulk EfOM, derived from the Boulder, Colorado, USA, wastewater treatment plant, as well as with EfOM isolates. The hydrophobic microfiltration membrane is most seriously fouled by bulk Boulder EfOM, while the two hydrophilic membranes (MF, UF) made of cellulose acetate are the least fouled. Differences between the flux decline curves of various membranes are less distinct with isolates than with bulk EfOM. The transphilic isolate (TPIA-Bld) exhibited a higher fouling potential than the hydrophobic isolate (HPOA-Bld). This behaviour is due to the different chemical characteristics of the isolates, namely the higher percentage of hetero-atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) of the transphilic isolate compared to the hydrophobic isolate. Finally, atomic force microscope (AFM) images present clear evidence of fouling. AFM is clearly able to detect the fouling layer, although it has not been possible to distinguish between pore blockage and surface fouling thus far.</jats:p>",

The physical system consists of a sequence of pumping stations that deliver water through pipelines to intermediate storage reservoirs. The nonlinear model is obtained using dominant system variables that represent active and passive dynamical elements. The hydraulic models include nonlinear coupling between flow rates and reservoir heads. Validation of the nonlinear model is accomplished through comparing with system observations and using data validation and face validity approaches. The results demonstrate the dynamical behaviour of the system regarding flow stability, water heads in the reservoirs, head losses and measure of the friction at different sections of the water supply system. </jats:p>",

Even though the theory of supply and demand chain management suggests that lead time reduction is an antecedent to the use of market mediation (i.e., adjusting production to fit actual customer demand as it materializes) [Harvard Business Rev. 75 (2) (1997) 105] to reduce transaction uncertainty in the chain, which can be conceptualized as the primary goal of supply chain management [J. Operat. Manage. 11 (3) (1993) 289], demand chain parties often are observed in practice to begin with information transfer improvement, ignoring the problem of long lead times. In this paper, we propose a framework for prioritizing lead time reduction in a demand chain improvement project, using a typology of demand chains to identify and recommend trajectories to achieve desirable levels of market mediation performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The guiding hypothesis is that reduced supply will result in positive health and social outcomes.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Design </jats:bold> Standard time‐series methods are employed to analyse official data from local law‐enforcement and heroin supply indicators and several health and social outcome indicators within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), spanning the late 1990s to early 2002. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are estimated to remove autocorrelation from these series. Cross‐correlation and autoregression models are then employed to identify the best predictive models.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Findings </jats:bold> When autocorrelation has been removed, a reduction in heroin purity predicts a large decline in heroin‐related ambulance callouts and an increase in methadone treatment programme enrolments. There is little evidence of an increase in negative outcomes due to heroin users switching to other drugs. A reduction in purity also predicts declines in robbery and burglary but not in theft.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion </jats:bold> The overall evidence indicates modest links between the declines in heroin supply and increases in positive health outcomes and decreases in crime, as predicted by a simple economic model. Due to the shortness of some of the series and consequent limitations in statistical power, these conclusions should be regarded as tentative.</jats:p>",

The plants were grown in a greenhouse in large root containers and supplied either with suboptimal or optimal rates of N fertilizer. Suboptimal N supply reduced total plant biomass at maturity (47 days (d) after flowering) by 29 % for the efficient genotype and by 36 % for the inefficient genotype. Suboptimal N supply reduced leaf growth of both genotypes. The reduction of leaf area was less severe in the N‐efficient genotype, despite of lower N content in the leaves. This indicates lower sensitivity of leaf growth towards internal N limitation in the efficient genotype. At low N supply, the green leaf area per plant gradually decreased after flowering in both genotypes, because of loss of chlorophyll during leaf senescence. The rate of net photosynthesis per unit leaf area (<jats:italic>A</jats:italic>) was reduced at low in comparison with high N supply. The ratio of <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>/leaf N content or leaf chlorophyll content was higher in the efficient genotype, indicating more efficient utilization of internal N for photosynthesis. At the end of grain filling, low N supply led to enhanced intercelluar CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations (Ci) in the leaves, indicating limitation of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation by carboxylation rather than by stomatal resistance. The N deficiency‐induced increase of Ci was less pronounced in the efficient genotype. Furthermore, higher photosynthetic rate of the efficient genotype at suboptimal N supply was associated with lower contents of reducing sugars and sucrose in the leaves, whereas starch content was higher than in the inefficient genotype. The ability to avoid excessive sugar accumulation in the leaves under N deficiency might be related to higher photosynthetic N efficiency.</jats:p>",

Two hundred and fifty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. The rats were fed a normal diet, but groups 3, 4, and 5 received a daily supplement in their drinking water of 20 mg vitamin E, 0.3 mg Se, and a combination of vitamin E and Se, respectively, for 30 days. For 3 days subsequently, the control group (group 1) was treated with a placebo, and the remaining four groups were injected intramuscularly with 100 mg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> body weight (bw) prednisolone. After the last administration of prednisolone, 10 rats from each group were killed at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px) and catalase (CAT) enzymes, and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and TBARS in their kidneys were measured. GSH‐Px and CAT enzyme activities and GSH levels in the prednisolone treatment group (group 2) began to decrease gradually at 4 h, falling respectively to 48 and 65% of the control levels by 24 h, and recovering to the control levels at 48 h. In contrast, prednisolone administration caused an increase in TBARS in the kidneys, reaching up to twice the levels of the control group at 24 h. However, supplementation with vitamin E and Se had a preventive effect on the elevation of kidney TBARS and improved the diminished activities of the antioxidative enzymes and the levels of GSH. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the effectiveness of vitamin E and Se in reducing kidney damage in glucocorticoid‐treated rats and suggests that reductions in increased TBARS due to prednisolone may be an important factor in the action of vitamin E and Se.
