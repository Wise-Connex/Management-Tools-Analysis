All grain yield components were operative in the determination of inter‐hybrid differences under moderate competition. The expression of components was suppressed by increased competition, and at the highest plant density grain yield was determined only through the interaction between the number of grains per panicle and the weight per grain. The superiority of the early maturing hybrid at the highest density was attained through its ability to maintain larger grains in spite of increased interplant competition for water.</jats:p><jats:p>In a second experiment an early maturing hybrid used less water than a later maturing hybrid, at all stages of growth, beginning on 30 days from emergence.

As a consequence of the “pool of entrants” problem, dificulties arise both in estimating the required transition probabilities and in forecasting producer numbers. Solutions to these, and to other problems concerned with obtaining prediction of milk output, from those of producer numbers, are proposed. It is forecast that producer numbers will decline by 18 per cent and 33 per cent by 1970/71 and 1975/76 respectively, with the largest proportional decline occurring among smaller producers. Two forecasts are made of milk supply and these are compared with estimates made by the Milk Morltetiiic Board.</jats:p>",

This paper reports an empirical application of industrial dynamics to a problem of an industry system. A second generation model was developed and used to appraise alternative supply control policies designed to reduce fluctuations in marketings of frozen concentrated orange juice and grower profits. Policies that controlled long‐run supplies by constraining tree plantings appeared to have the most potential for success. Policies designed to control market supplies on a year‐to‐year basis actually encouraged new tree plantings which created long‐run supply problems.</jats:p>",
