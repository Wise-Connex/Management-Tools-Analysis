The method is based on the combined use of UV spectrophotometric measurements in the wavelength from 190–230 nm, and multivariate data analysis using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) chemometric method. From the differences in the organic matter content of the different water sources and of their corresponding UV spectral features, PLS was able to determine the relative amounts of the two main river water sources in samples of tap water from the different locations of the Barcelona city water distribution system. The extension of the method to determine the relative amounts in water blends, prepared from samples from five water treatment plant sources of the same city’s distribution system, required the combined use of some other parameters. In particular, the distinction and apportion of the water coming from a desalinisation plant could be successfully achieved once concentrations of Boron were included in the analysis.</jats:p>",

One of the most severe impacts of natural disasters is the interruption of drinking water supply. Contaminated water causes the death of thousands of people worldwide every year. Mobile waterworks used by aid organizations are sophisticated systems with high demand of energy, skilled personnel and chemicals. They are designed to supply larger communities in the range of (several) thousand people but small and secluded areas can not be reached. The Department of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering (DESEE) at University of Kassel developed a small, transportable and easy to use dead-end membrane filtration unit for basic water supply in cases of natural disasters for small groups in the range of 200 up to 500 people in remote areas, the “WaterBackpack”. Experimental long-term series show that the unit is able to provide water in sufficient quantity and quality for the defined use case. Tests with contaminated surface water revealed, that a minimum flux of around 5 L m−2 h−1 can be kept up over a period of more than two month without any cleaning or maintenance.</jats:p>",

Nach einer Analyse des Prozesses hinsichtlich Stabilitätseigenschaften und dem Übertragungsverhalten der Erwartungswerte und Kovarianzen wird ein Zustandsregler zur Festlegung des Bestellverhaltens entworfen. Dieser Ansatz erlaubt die Kontrolle der Mittelwerte und Streuungen aller internen Zustände der Supply Chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of Indonesia's commodities which have great potential but so far little attention is the banana (Musa sp.). Until now, business people in the banana supply chain are still independent of each other in order to determine the number of decisions and fulfillment of orders. Banana business also has a factor of uncertainty in the face of supply and demand. In addition, it has the characteristics of the selling perishable so severely constrained by the age of the banana itself. To improve the performance of the banana supply chain, innovation is needed through better coordination between businesses using the approach to supply chain management. In this study the development of models and experiments on several scenarios using the simulation system to evaluate the influence of dynamic coordination of the banana supply chain performance. The size of the evaluated performance in the experiment is sales revenue, oversupply, lost sales, and availability. From the experimental results can be concluded that the combination of coordination on the side of the upstream and downstream supply chain produces the best performance in terms of sales revenue. Experiments also showed that the coordination within the supply chain to improve supply chain performance in total, although there are always one or several business people who experience a decrease in performance of the same size. In addition, also note that the government plans to conduct an increasing number of supply from the upstream side will bring greater benefits when it is realized with the condition where there is coordination within the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The benefits of e-invoicing have been documented extensively by various organisations, ranging from the European Commission ‘Expert Group on E-Invoicing’ to independent research organisations. The focus of much of the research, however, is limited to the replacement of paper invoices with electronic documents. While paperless invoicing does drive near-term cost savings, there are often further benefits to be gained through more ambitious accounts payable (AP) automation projects. The introduction of electronic invoices into a financial supply chain can be a key enabler to other projects, such as evaluated receipts settlement, supply chain finance and category spend management, each of which can have even greater impacts on a company’s income statement or balance sheet. These broader AP automation projects, however, often require new approaches to financial supply chain management, such as reversing the flow of invoices from buyer to seller or eliminating invoices altogether. Corporations considering e-invoicing initiatives should think holistically about the financial supply chain benefits that can be achieved from related projects. Much can be learned from the experiences of large organisations in North America, Europe and Asia which are already implementing many of these approaches. This paper explores the potential benefits to corporations from the adoption of an e-invoicing programme as well as broader AP automation initiatives. The focus will be on business-to-business e-invoicing as opposed to business-to-consumer billing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. We use a simple two-state two-box ocean to simulate the CO2 signal during the last four glacial-interglacial transitions in the earth system. The model is inspired by the similarity in spatial organization and temporal transition patterns between the earth and other complex systems, such as mammals. The comparison identifies the earth's metabolic rate with net autotrophic primary production in the upper ocean, sustained through new inorganic carbon and nutrients advected from the deep ocean and organic matter remineralized within the upper ocean. We view the glacial-interglacial transition as a switch of the upper ocean from a basal to an enhanced metabolic state, with energy supply initially relying on the remineralization of the local organic sources and the eventual steady state resulting from the increased advective supply of inorganic deep sources. During the interglacial-glacial transition the opposite occurs, with an initial excess of advective supply and primary production that allows the replenishment of the upper-ocean organic storages. We set the relative change in energy supply from the CO2 signal and use genetic algorithms to explore the sensitivity of the model output to both the basal recirculation rate and the intensity-timing of the maximum recirculation rate. The model is capable of reproducing quite well the long-term oscillations, as shown by correlations with observations typically about 0.8. The dominant time scale for each cycle ranges between about 40 and 45 kyr, close to the 41 kyr average obliquity astronomical period, and the deep-ocean recirculation rate increases between one and two orders of magnitude from glacial to interglacial periods.</jats:p>"

All these methods of degradation proved feasible. The kinetics of propoxycarbazone-sodium degradation in water followed the pseudo-first order equation for all studied processes except the Fenton treatment. The application of schemes with ozone demonstrated low pseudo-first order rate constants within the range of 10−4 s−1. Addition of UV radiation to the processes improved the removal of propoxycarbazone-sodium and increased the pseudo-first order rate constants to 10−3 s−1. The Fenton process was the most efficient and resulted in 5 and 60 s of half-life and 90% conversion time of propoxycarbazone-sodium, respectively, at 14 mM H2O2 concentration. UV treatment and the Fenton process may be recommended for practical application in decontamination of water or wastewater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the dot-com collapse and the recent Enron bankruptcy, one might conclude that the promises of the so-called new economy have been overstated. Yet, in spite of the litany of failed Internet pure plays and Enrons unexpected demise, the Internet has transformed the way the business is being conducted. Yes, the basics still matter and cost-cutting is appropriate, but today it must be achieved along with unprecedented business-model innovation and corporate agility.Witness the way many traditional firms are still thriving and succeeding by transforming their core business architectures around the Net. The Internet is slashing the cost of sharing knowledge, collaborating, and meshing business processes among supply chain partners. Valued-added communities are replacing traditional vertically integrated industries. These value added communities are external networks that cover both company and supply chain processes, such as financial, marketing, accounting and human resources services. Smart companies are focusing on their core competencies and outsourcing the remainder of their non-essential processes.The traditional vertically integrated corporation is no longer the most effective vehicle for value creation. Ford was the quintessential example of this. At one point, the company owned steamships, power plants, forests and virtually every other input critical to building an automobile. The vertically integrated structure worked well for auto manufacturers for a time to achieve scale economies and productivity. But these companies have squeezed out about as much productivity as they can.In todays networked economy, one company makes the car's wheels, another makes the engine, another makes the seats and another makes the body all of which flow through the value added community that the auto company created. In the end, the auto company and the consumer both benefit. The automobile consumers get a better quality product, delivered precisely when and how they want it, at a much better cost. The auto company can respond to customers far more quickly than ever before.We strongly believe that the glue for building these networked communities is a business process orientation (BPO), a concept introduced in one of our earlier books, which serves as a powerful organizing principle for firms competing in the networked economy. BPO is not simply a new business fad, but an entirely new way of thinking or viewing an organization. Nor is BPO simply a new business operations strategy, but rather broad framework for organizing work and information flows that ultimately help an organization build superior customer value. Corporate survival in the Internet economy will depend both on the effectiveness of internal processes and their integration with supply chain customers. Supply chain management will serve as the coordinating mechanism for process integration among supply chain partners. Competitors can match individual processes or activities but cant match the integration or fit of these activities In this paper,we present empirical evidence showing that building a process-oriented organization results in improved business performance. We also propose that BPO can be successfully applied to supply chain networks and argue that value is created in the networked economy based on the alignment of supply chain processes.</jats:p>"

These solutions, however, are problematic when the data is sensitive and the participants are reluctant to share their private, proprietary information. The development and deployment of privacy preserving coordinating model in supply chain based on common replenishment epoch could allow supply chain collaborations to take place without revealing any participant's data to the others, reaping the benefits of collaboration while avoiding the drawbacks. In this paper, secure multi-party computation protocols are applied in the problem of a multi-stage supply chain, where the objective is to find a CRE policy for each facility in the system such that the total average ordering and inventory-related cost of the entire system is minimized.</jats:p>"

The analysis was based on a dataset assembled from the written responses to the National Food Policy discussion in Scotland, which contains opinions on the different dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental and social) from a broad range of individuals and organizations representing different segments of the Scottish population. The empirical analyses involved comparing the responses according to two criteria: by food supply chain stakeholder and by geographical region. The results indicated that whilst there were differences among the studied groups, the importance of social and economic sustainability were strongly evident in the foregoing analysis, highlighting issues such as diet and nutrition, the importance of local food, building sustainability on sound economic performance, the market power of supermarkets, and regulation and support in building human and technical capabilities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Studies suggest that only 31% of Europe is thought to have a water supply that is either plentiful or sufficient to meet demands until 2015, and water stress indexes show a number of countries with traditionally wet climates such as Belgium and Bulgaria, under significant water stress. Therefore, there is both a desire and a need to reduce the consumption of water over much of Europe. For industry, often economics determine the viability of water recycling, which does not necessarily fall under the standards currently being set for the major water reuse schemes. While the additional annual recycling capacity in Western Europe is set to increase by 10%, much of the Global market is focussed on major reuse facilities based on the municipal sector. Within the industrial sector there are opportunities to achieve major changes in the water cycle which can have a significant impact on total water consumption. The impact on regional water consumption by industries efforts can be massive, as industry accounts for 50% of the water consumption in Western Europe. When benchmarked data across industry sectors is analysed, we find that industries ranging from paper mills, dairy, beverage, ceramic and electronics have opportunities to reduce their water consumption by around 50%. But what are the mechanisms that drive actions in the industry water cycle, and how great can the impact be? This paper explores industrial water costs across Europe, and the drivers leading to reduced water consumption. As operators of water and wastewater facilities for many industrial customers across Europe, Ondeo Industrial Solutions examine the raw water costs and the viability of recycle schemes. Economics is not the only driver towards the reduction in water consumption on industrial sites. There are political and legislative drivers that can often override the economics such as the European PPC (Pollution Prevention and Control) directive that can often lead to a programme of water consumption reductions.</jats:p>",

However, whereas the latter is one of the wealthiest areas of England, the former includes some of the highest pockets of deprivation and was a government priority area for increasing housing supply. Due to differences in historical land use and geography, the price elasticity in the least constrained area is approximately six times higher than the most constrained. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we study virus filtration efficiency using surrogate virus particles and via statistical surface-response approach. We focus on the effect of particle size (20–100 nm range) as a key factor along with the effects of transmembrane pressure (20–60 kPa range) and feed flowrate (0.3–1.0 L/F;min range) on the filtration virus removal efficiency (LRV). The particle size is shown to impart a great deal of influence on surrogate particle removal. The effect of particle-to-pore-size ratio is reported for comparison of membrane molecular weight cut off (MWCO) performance. It was shown experimentally and through the developed empirical regression model that transmembrane pressure plays a major role in controlling the filtration efficiency along with flowrate. In the studied experimental range, higher LRV values are obtained at lower transmembrane pressure (20 kPa) and at higher feed flowrate (1 L/F;min). Further the effect on LRV of the interaction between transmembrane pressure and particle size seems to be more significant than that of the interaction of flowrate with particle size.</jats:p>",

Experiments were performed as a function of aqueous pH, chitosan/Pb2+ ratio, and background electrolyte concentration. The value of pH was found to be the most important parameter to effect the lead removal. The lead removal rate reaches the plateau at almost 100% when the chitosan and lead ratio goes more than 4.0 at pH 6.0. With transmembrane pressure (TMP) 0.1 MPa, chitosan/Pb2+ ratio 4 and pH 6, the lead removal rate decreases sharply from 99.2% to 19.5% as the adding NaCl concentration increases from 0 to 500 mmol. The regeneration of the chitosan by acidification using diafiltration technique was further performed. In the end, the effect of regenerated chitosan on the lead removal was evaluated. At the optimum experimental condition of pH 6.0, regenerated chitosan/Pb2+ ratio 4 and TMP 0.10 MPa, the lead removal rate was found to be 96.2%, which is almost the same as that obtained on the original chitosan. The overall results from the two-step process of complexation-UF and decomplexation-UF separation showed that it could be a promising method for lead removal and recovery from aqueous solutions.</jats:p>",

Also, a surrogate SUVA254 parameter was used to evaluate the aromatic carbon content. Prior to the application of the electrooxidation for HA degradation the electrochemical behavior of BDD electrode in HA containing 0.1M Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the working conditions of bulk electrolysis corresponding to water decomposition potential range were selected. The influence of the applied current density, pH, HA initial concentration on the performance of BDD electrode was investigated in relation with the specific electrical consumption. Applying electrooxidation using BDD electrodes for the real surface water treatment led to the mineralization efficiency of 65% after 150 minutes.</jats:p>",

The result showed: when the MIEX® dosage reached 800 bed volume (BV), the polymeric aluminium chloride (PAC) dosage could be reduced to 14 mg/L, and the Trans-Membrane Pressure (TMP) could be recovered effectively after hydraulic flush. This pretreatment could remove most of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic charged organics as well as some neutral organics. Foulants of molecular weight (MW) &amp;lt;1000 dalton (Da) and 3000 Da &amp;lt; MW &amp;lt; 100,000 Da organics could be removed by 40.7% and 96.0%, respectively. By reducing pore blocking and membrane cake resistance, the ultrafiltration (UF) membrane reduced the total resistance of membrane.

The study uses Bangladesh data, and following Cover et al (2006), employs a modification of the Blanchard-Quah (BQ) approach, in which the two shocks are allowed to be correlated. Strong evidence is found for the hypothesis that aggregate demand and supply shocks are interrelated in Bangladesh. For the case in which causality is assumed to be running from demand to supply shocks, it was found that an independent supply shock plays significant role for fluctuations in inflation, which was absent in the standard BQ model. The results suggest that a tightening of monetary policy may lead to an adverse effect on the long-run growth potential and some supply-side policies may be required to supplement contractionary monetary policy in combating inflation in Bangladesh.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many decisions in the water industry, particularly related to large infrastructure projects, involve numerous discrete alternatives and criteria and are often characterised by uncertain consequences, complex interactions, and the participation of multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a methodology that can be used to aid decision making when discrete alternatives are involved, as it facilitates stakeholder participation and collaborative decision making and does not require the assignment of monetary values to environmental or social criteria. This paper demonstrates the application of MCDA to a real case study in the water industry in South Australia. The case study involved undertaking an analysis of options for ensuring sufficient supply of treated wastewater to an expanded horticultural irrigation scheme. Participants from the water utility, United Water, and the water authority, SA Water, were involved in the decision analysis process through two workshops. Eleven options were assessed using fourteen criteria. The ranking of options utilised a reliability approach which took into account the participants preferences (i.e. criteria weights) and the uncertainty in the values assigned to the criteria.</jats:p>",

The suppliers have heterogeneous production costs, which are private information, and the winning supplier has to invest in production capacity before the demand uncertainty is resolved. The buyer chooses to offer a push or pull contract, for which the single price and winning supplier are determined via the auction. We show that, with a pull contract, the buyer does not necessarily benefit from a larger number of suppliers participating in the auction, due to the negative effect of supplier competition on the incentive of supplier capacity investment. We thus propose an enhanced pull mechanism that mitigates this effect with a floor price. We then analyze and compare the outcomes of auctions for push and (enhanced) pull contracts, establishing when one form is preferred over the other based on the buyer's profits. We also compare our simple, price‐only push and pull contract auctions to the optimal mechanisms, benchmarking the performance of the simple mechanisms as well as establishing the relative importance of auction design and contract design in procurement auctions. </jats:p>",

Batch sorption experiments were carried out to study kinetics, and the effect of Mg(II) and different pH conditions on Cd(II) sorption. Sequential extraction experiments were performed to understand binding characteristics. In general, thiol-functionalization improved the removal of Cd(II) by activated carbon in aqueous solution. Compared to untreated activated carbon, over a factor of four of the maximum sorption capacity enhancement was achieved. The presence of Mg(II) interfered Cd(II) sorption, but the degree of the sorption interference was alleviated significantly. Cd(II) sorption occurred more rapidly due to more involvement of ion exhchange by thiol- functionalization.</jats:p>",

We consider a model of two supply chains each consisting of one manufacturer selling to one retailer, with the retailers engaging in Cournot or Bertrand competition. For Cournot retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either competition is less intense or at least one retailer's information is less accurate. A supply chain may become worse off when making its information more accurate or production diseconomy smaller, if such an improvement induces the firms in the rival supply chain to cease sharing information. For Bertrand retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either competition is less intense or information is more accurate. Under Bertrand competition a manufacturer may be worse off by receiving information, which is never the case under Cournot competition. Information sharing in one supply chain triggers a competitive reaction from the other supply chain and this reaction is damaging to the first supply chain under Cournot competition but may be beneficial under Bertrand competition.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"es\">Aunque nuestro entendimiento de la dinámica de aglomeración de la industria está bastante desarrollado, no está tan claro si las empresas de energía renovables y sus potenciales suplidores se ubicarán de manera similar a otras industrias mejores establecidas. En consecuencia, este ensayo debe ser visto principalmente como un primer paso para descifrar las tendencias de colocalización de la industria de renovables y sus potenciales suplidores. Basado en la metodología y datos elaborado por el Proyecto de Política de Energía Renovable y la Asociación de Energía Sustentable de Carolina del Norte, encontramos que la geografía de los potenciales suplidores está fuertemente concentrada a lo largo del corredor I-85 entre Charlotte, la Triad y el Research Triangle con otros puntos importantes en Hickory, Wilmington y especialmente Asheville. También parece que los posibles suplidores tienen preferencias de co-localización que se imponen de manera significativa con firmas existentes de energía renovable y eficiencia energética, localizadas en Carolina del Norte. Poco entendimiento existe alrededor de cómo se relacionan entre sí estos potenciales suministradores y empresas de energía renovables y de eficiencia energética con respecto a los efectos de la potencial difusión de conocimiento y la formación de redes formales e informales de producción—un área clave para la investigación futura.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To guarantee a good water quality at the consumer’s tap, natural organic matter (NOM) should be (partly) removed during drinking water treatment. The objective of this research is to measure the effect of NOM removal by ion exchange on the biological stability of drinking water. Experiments were performed in two lanes of the pilot plant of Weesperkarspel in the Netherlands. The lanes consisted of ozonation, softening, biological activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. Ion exchange in fluidized form was used as pre-treatment in one lane and removed 50% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC); the other lane was used as reference. Compared to the reference lane, the assimilable organic carbon (AOC) concentration of the finished water in the lane pretreated by ion exchange was 61% lower. The biofilm formation rate of the finished water was decreased with 70% to 2.0 pg ATP/cm2.day. The achieved concentration of AOC and the values of the biofilm formation rate with ion exchange pre-treatment showed that the biological stability of drinking water can be improved by extending a treatment plant with ion exchange, especially when ozonation is involved as disinfection and oxidation step.</jats:p>",

The optimal water supply was calculated from average daily temperature. The aims of the study were to investigate the effect of different water supply on yield quantity. The regularly irrigated plant stands gave significantly higher yield, and unirrigated plants showed yield loss.Water supply had strong positive (R2=0.81) effect on marketable yield and average fruit weight (R2=0.78). Linear regression showed, that 46.5 mm more water supply caused 10 t/ha more marketable yield, and 13.4 mm more water supply caused 1 g more in the average fruit weight.

The drinking water sources considered for examination were harvested rain water, tap water and well water stored in plastic water pots for 2 to 4 days. The waterborne pathogens in the samples that were isolated were characterized for antibiotic resistance. Estimation of bacterial loads in the water samples revealed mean total bacterial count (TBC) of 1.17 × 105, 1.30 × 104 and 9.70 × 104 cfu/ml for rain water, tap water and well water respectively. The mean-total coliform count (TCC) were recorded as 1.57 × 106, 7.40 × 105 and 5.70 × 105 cfu/ml for rain water, tap water and well water respectively. Seven bacteria genera comprising Escherichia (41.7%), Shigella (75%), Klebsiella (33.3%), Pseudomonas (25%), Staphylococcus (25%), Streptococcus (50%) and Enterococcus (20%) were isolated from stored rain water .Three genera comprising Escherichia coli (8.3%), Staphylococcus (25%) and Pseudomonas (75%) were isolated from stored tap water. In well water samples, nine genera comprising Escherichia (50%), Salmonella (100%) Enterococcus (80%) and Shigella (25%) Proteus (100%) Serratia (100%), Klebsiella (66.6%), Staphylococcus (50%) and Streptococcus (50%) were isolated. The antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that the majority of the bacteria isolated particulaly, Escherichia, Salmonella, Enterococcus and Shigella were resistant to common antibiotics which are still available in Nigerian market. The resistance pattern of the bacterial isolates ranged from 50–100% to amoxicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, cotrimoxazone, erythromycin, gentamicin. In terms of physico-chemical analysis, all the water samples met the WHO standard for drinking water. However, the results obtained revealed that adequate domestic water sanitation and disinfection programmes must be put in place to ensure safety against waterborne antibiotic resistant pathogens especially in developing countries.</jats:p>",

Vilm.-Andr. ‘Supertunia Royal Velvet’ during vegetative propagation. Starting with unrooted cuttings (Day 0), fertigation was applied continuously at three time intervals (Day 0 to 7, Day 8 to 14, or Day 15 to 21) using either a “complete” (C) water-soluble fertilizer containing (in mg·L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) 75 NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N, 25 NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-N, 12 phosphorus (P), 83 potassium (K), 20 calcium (Ca), 10 magnesium (Mg), 1.4 sulfur (S), 2 iron (Fe), 1 manganese (Mn), 1 zinc (Zn), 0.5 copper (Cu), 0.5 boron (B), and 0.2 molybdenum (Mo) or a micronutrient fertilizer (M) containing (in mg·L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) 1.4 S, 2 Fe, 1 Mn, 1 Zn, 0.5 Cu, 0.5 B, and 0.2 Mo in a complete factorial arrangement. With constant fertigation using the C fertilizer, plant dry weight (DW) doubled from Day 0 (sticking of unrooted cuttings) to Day 7 (0.020 g to 0.047 g), root emergence was observed by Day 4, and by Day 7, the average length of primary roots was 2.6 cm. During any week that the M fertilizer was substituted for the C fertilizer, tissue N–P–K concentrations decreased compared with plants receiving the C fertilizer. For example, plants receiving the M fertilizer between Day 0 and 7 had 20% lower tissue-N concentration at Day 7 compared with those receiving the C fertilizer. Although both shoot DW and leaf count increased once macronutrient fertilization was resumed after Day 7, final shoot DW and leaf count were lower than plants receiving C fertilizer from Day 0 to 21. Time to first root emergence was unaffected by fertigation. Constant application of C resulted in a higher shoot-to-root ratio at Day 21 than all other treatments. Results emphasize the importance of early fertigation on petunia, a fast-rooting species, to maintain tissue nutrient levels within recommended ranges.</jats:p>",

In many humanitarian situations however, service delivery cannot wait for procurement reform. The needs of many of the Millennium Development Goals are immediate, while procurement reform may take years to institutionalize. Under these circumstances, international organisations such as the United Nations have both implementation and capacity-building roles, often placing them in high-risk situations. This has led to the development of procurement risk assessment and management tools, designed to provide objectivity in country procurement risk monitoring and review, as well as assist capacity building. The procurement risk assessment methodology that follows uses established risk modeling to provide procurement risk ratings in 60 HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria programs in 26 countries, and is successfully promoting procurement strengthening within high-risk country offices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dynamic programming (DP) models have been proposed by a number of researchers to develop optimal reservoir operation. In this paper, we propose to eliminate the fixed threshold values, specifically the maximum allowable release and reservoir storage from the DP model and replace them with dynamic dependent values calculated by a fuzzy inference engine. For this purpose, a simple model of DP is modified based on a novel intelligent state dropping (ISD) mechanism. The ISD mechanism is designed based on fuzzy logic theory. Although the proposed methodology is widely used for broadband satellite based internet protocol network congestion control, its application in water resources management has not been reported to date. Application of the ISD mechanism incorporates the inflow uncertainty in reservoir optimization model in a simpler way than the stochastic DP-based optimization models (SDP). Furthermore, the multi-purpose objective function of DP-model is changed to a single objective function. The simulation results showed that the newly proposed model reduces the shortfall in supplying demand and improves the reservoir operation performance indices, i.e., the reservoir reliability indices, as compared with the results by the DP and SDP models.</jats:p>",

To better understand oil company and oil services contractor responses to HIV, TB and malaria, we examined their level of engagement, drivers behind it, reasons for inaction, areas of high impact and opportunities for progress.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We found that the industry has made inroads in addressing HIV and malaria, but that TB has received little attention by comparison.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There is wide variation in company interaction on these health issues. While oil companies are ahead of the curve in developing targetted programs, the contractor community has not been as active. Contractor action is largely dependent on guidance from oil companies and – in some cases – financial institutions if they are providing funding. Contractual clauses to address these diseases are becoming more prevalent and are generally considered effective, but there is still room for improvement. Contractual language could be clearer and more standardized; monitoring of contractual compliance could increase.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In addition to client requirements, risk perception remains a primary driver of health initiatives but our research showed that the perception of the risk of these diseases as well as their impact was mixed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Finally, our survey revealed greater interaction between oil companies and oil services contractors than between oil services contractors and their sub-contractors. We found that the sub-contractor community remains the most poorly served in terms of disease prevention and management programs yet it is this community which is the most at risk. Interaction across the industry supply chain needs to be increased in order to ensure that this group is not excluded from health initiatives.</jats:p>",

A questionnaire-based survey was conducted on four sectors, namely, automobile, engineering, process and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG). It is observed from this study that selected sectors do not significantly differ on types of SC knowledge and KM use in various SC performance indicators. It is also observed that selected sectors differ on use of KM in different SC functional areas and various supplier measurement criteria. The analysis reveals that selected sectors have fundamental similarities and dissimilarities in their operations and functioning. This might be the reason for the similarities and dissimilarities found in their KM practices in SC. </jats:p>",

At the same time, they are reverted in the corporate sales forecasting. The empirical studies indicate that factors play an important role in supply chain sales forecasting. Their application can greatly improve the specific and general forecasting accuracy and represents the thought of collaborative forecasting. They can contribute to the supply chain implication and prominent information application; they can contribute to positively employing the potential negative constraints of supply chain enterprises; and they can also contribute to the management of supply chain as the information whole. All these can be considered as an extension of the economic information filter in different hierarchies and modules. </jats:p>",

Algogenic organic matter (AOM), the main contributor to total NOM levels in raw waters characterised by elevated algae levels, is currently the subject of much investigation. In this study, the effect of AOM on fouling of ultrafiltration and the effectiveness of magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX®) pre-treatment for AOM removal and membrane fouling control was evaluated. The results showed that, the main species of algae in raw water were Chlorella vulgaris, which accounted for 80% of total algae. AOM was predominantly hydrophilic (50% or more) with a low SUVA (1.7 Lm−1 mg−1). Coagulation alone could not remove AOM effectively (less than 20%), however, when combined with magnetic ion exchange resin pre-treatment, more than 60% of AOM was be removed; pre-treatment followed by coagulation was observed to be very effective in controlling membrane fouling by AOM. The application of magnetic ion exchange resin technology at a bed volume treatment rate (BVTR) of 800 was observed to effectively eliminate fouling of UF membrane. Careful analyses of the molecular weight (MW) distribution of AOM and UV absorbance of treated water revealed that the effectiveness in membrane fouling control was the result of the changes in AOM molecular characteristics in treated water, namely a change in MW due to the preferential removal of high molecular proteins by coagulation and magnetic ion exchange resin pre-treatment. The results demonstrate that magnetic ion exchange resin followed by coagulation might be a new membrane pre-treatment option for UF membrane fouling control.</jats:p>",

A process-based coupled surface water-groundwater model was developed for Southern River catchment (Perth, Western Australia) to investigate the effect of urban development on catchment water balance. It was shown that urbanisation of highly permeable flat catchments with shallow groundwater resulted in significant increase in net groundwater recharge. The increased recharge creates the opportunity to use local groundwater resources for non-potable water supply with the added advantage of reducing the total discharge from new urban developments. This minimises the environmental impacts of increased urbanisation, as higher discharge is often associated with greater nutrient loads to receiving environments. Through the used of water balance modelling it was demonstrated that there are both water and nutrient benefits from local groundwater use in terms of reduced nutrient exports to receiving waters and additional water resources for non-potable water supply.</jats:p>",

Coagulation conditions were optimized using polyaluminum chloride (PACl), PACl with dry cationic polymer (polymer), and PACl with polymer and powder activated carbon (PAC). DOM was measured in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet absorption at a wavelength of 254 nm (UV-254). Results show that the optimal condition for PACl, PACl and polymer, and PACl with polymer and PAC coagulation were PACl 20 mg/L at pH 7, PACl 20 mg/L and polymer 0·1 mg/L, and PACl 20 mg/L with polymer 0·1 mg/L and PAC 10 mg/L, respectively. When the DOM contents in coagulated water were fractioned to be hydrophilic (HPI) and hydrophobic (HPO) groups, it was found that the coagulation process could effectively remove more DOC of HPO than DOC of HPI. The coagulation using PACl combined with polymer and PAC provided the highest level of DOC of HPI, DOC of HPO, Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of HPI, and THMFP of HPO removal efficiencies and were shown to be 65%, 75%, 77%, and 79%, respectively.</jats:p>",

In order to cost – from a social point of view – an improved water supply technology that is likely to secure access to safe drinking water (as defined by the WHO–Unicef joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation), an analytical approach is used that disaggregates the technology process according to its essential components, singled out by an engineering description. Questionnaires were developed to identify the main resources invested in a water supply project and to collect, at different disaggregation levels, four types of costs: investment, operation, maintenance and other relevant costs (e.g. administration). Comparability of these different cost elements is achieved by discounting expenditures at different times to the same reference time. Full and unit cost indicators that allow a least-cost analysis can then be derived from this cost picture. To successfully apply the method to actual projects, a spreadsheet was developed using Microsoft Excel to enable user-friendly implementation of all the costing tasks. </jats:p>",

Additionally, the economic impact of applying adequacy constraints, i.e. request specific part of the microgrid demand to be supplied by local power production, in case of intentional islanding, is estimated. This is essential to achieve seamless transition from interconnected to autonomous operation of microgrids. Two cases are examined: adequacy constraint applied to the whole microgrid demand and only to the critical loads. Moreover, the magnitude and frequency of interruption of critical and noncritical loads, in case of an upstream network fault is calculated. The potential of DSB to reduce operating costs improving at the same time the quality of service to the loads of higher priority is shown. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

To incorporate the uncertainty in water use, a model that combines time series Monte Carlo simulations and a deterministic artificial neural network (ANN) is developed to simulate the daily water demand under climate variation. The model is first applied to assess how climate change alters the risk of a current water supply system and is then used to estimate the effects of demand management programs and system expansion. The model quantifies water supply system risk in terms of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability (RRV). The model evaluates 11 scenarios defined by combining various population growth forecasts, demand management programs, system expansions, and global climate model (GCM) scenarios. The simulation results suggest that a rise in temperature and a change in precipitation magnitude will negatively impact the performance of the case study system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Some microfungi are known to be opportunistic human pathogens, and there is a body of scientific opinion that one of their routes of infection may be water aerosols. Others have been implicated as causative agents of odours and off-tastes in drinking water. This study was undertaken to investigate three potential sources of microfungi in a treated, oligotrophic municipal water supply system in sub-tropical Australia. Formation of the microfungal component of developing biofilm on hard surfaces in water storage reservoirs was also assessed. Inside and outside air samples were collected from two reservoirs using two types of Burkard air samplers. Biofilm and soft sediment samples were collected from the inner surfaces of asbestos cement water pipes and from pipe dead ends respectively. These were analysed for microfungal growth and sporulation using Calcofluor White stain and epifluorescent microscopy. Artificial coupons of glass, PVC and concrete were immersed in two reservoirs to assess microfungal biofilm formation. This was analysed periodically using Calcofluor White stain and epifluorescent microscopy, cultures of coupon swabs and scanning electron microscopy. Fungal spores were recovered from all air samples. The number of colonies and the genera were similar for both inside and outside air. Microfungal filaments and sporulating structures were recovered from most of the pipe inner surface biofilm and dead end sediment samples, but were sparser in the biofilm than in the sediment samples. No recognisable, vegetative filamentous fungi were found in the slowly developing biofilm on coupons. This study indicates that airborne spores are an important potential source of microfungi found in water storage reservoirs. It has also demonstrated conclusively that filamentous microfungi grow and sporulate on water pipe inner surfaces and in soft sediments within the water distribution system.</jats:p>"

Each retailer is restricted to order once in every order cycle and their orders are replenished in a balanced manner within the cycle. Our study investigates the impact of information sharing and advance order information (AOI) on the supply chain. We find that the supplier benefits from the two mechanisms via two important factors, the information about observed end‐customer demands and the decision on re‐establishing the replenishment sequence. We derive the supplier's optimal sequence for stochastically comparable end‐customer demands with AOI and propose a sequencing rule for the setting with information sharing. Our numerical study examines the cost impacts of two proposed mechanisms on the entire supply chain. </jats:p>",

The following correlation is established: the specific force is increased and the exergy of the flow is used better with decreasing length of the zone of energy supply and with decreasing of distance between the zone and the place of beginning of the channel expansion. Raising the temperature at a single energy supply pulse may be considered as factor which increases specific force. It takes place at lower frequencies</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a quantitative estimation of the impact of reservoirs on discharge and irrigation water supply during the 20th century at global, continental, and river basin scale. Compared to a natural situation the combined effect of reservoir operation and irrigation extractions decreased mean annual discharge to oceans and significantly changed the timing of this discharge. For example, in Europe, May discharge decreased by 10%, while in February it increased by 8%. At the end of the 20th century, reservoir operations and irrigation extractions decreased annual global discharge by about 2.1% (930 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Simulation results show that reservoirs contribute significantly to irrigation water supply in many regions. Basins that rely heavily on reservoir water are the Colorado and Columbia River basins in the United States and several large basins in India, China, and central Asia (e.g., in the Krishna and Huang He basins, reservoirs more than doubled surface water supply). Continents gaining the most are North America, Africa, and Asia, where reservoirs supplied 57, 22, and 360 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> respectively between 1981–2000, which is in all cases 40% more than the availability in the situation without reservoirs. Globally, the irrigation water supply from reservoirs increased from around 18 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (adding 5% to surface water supply) at the beginning of the 20th century to 460 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (adding almost 40% to surface water supply) at the end of the 20th century. The analysis is performed using a newly developed and validated reservoir operation scheme within a global‐scale hydrology and vegetation model (LPJmL).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fouling remains one of the major constraints on the use of low pressure membranes in drinking water treatment. Work over the last few years has shown the importance of biopolymers (carbohydrates and protein-like material) as foulants for ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. The purpose of this study was to investigate at pilot scale the use of rapid biofiltration (without prior coagulation or ozone addition) as an innovative pretreatment to reduce fouling of UF membranes. The investigation was carried out on a water with a higher than average DOC and significant temperature variation. The biofilters, each operated at a hydraulic loading of 5 m/h, had empty bed contact times of 5, 10 and 15 minutes. The membrane unit was operated at a flux equivalent to 60 LMH at 20°C. The investigation confirmed the encouraging results obtained in an earlier smaller scale study with essentially the same water. Increased biofiltration contact time (i.e. increased bed depth) led to lower rates of hydraulically irreversible fouling. The initial biofiltration backwash procedure, involving air scour as is common in chemically assisted filtration, led in some cases to an increased rate of membrane fouling immediately after the backwash. An alternative backwashing strategy was developed, however the feasibility of operating with this approach over very long periods of time needs to be confirmed. To assist in full-scale implementation of this “green” and simple pretreatment, the design and operating conditions for the biofilters should be optimized for various types of waters. It is expected that biofiltration pretreatment will be of particular interest for small and/or isolated systems where a higher initial capital cost may be acceptable because of operational simplicity and reduced chemical requirements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Changes in root architecture are one of the adaptive strategies used by plants to compensate for nutrient deficiencies in soils. In this work, the temporal responses of Arabidopsis (<jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>) root system architecture to low boron (B) supply were investigated. Arabidopsis Col‐0 seedlings were grown in 10 µ<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> B for 5 days and then transferred to a low B medium (0.4 µ<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) or control medium (10 µ<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) for a 4‐day period. Low B supply caused an inhibition of primary root (PR) growth without altering either the growth or number of lateral roots (LRs). In addition, low B supply induced root hair formation and elongation in positions close to the PR meristem not observed under control conditions. The possible role of auxin and ethylene in the alteration of root system architecture elicited by low B supply was also studied by using two Arabidopsis reporter lines (DR5:GUS and EBS:GUS) and two Arabidopsis mutants with impaired auxin and ethylene signaling (<jats:italic>aux1‐22</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ein2‐1</jats:italic>). Low B supply increased auxin reporter DR5:GUS activity in PR tip, suggesting that low B alters the pattern of auxin distribution in PR tip. Moreover, PR elongation in <jats:italic>aux1‐22</jats:italic> mutant was less sensitive to low B treatment than in wild‐type plants, which suggests that auxin resistant 1 (AUX1) participates in the inhibition of PR elongation under low B supply. From all these results, a hypothetical model to explain the effect of low B treatment on PR growth is proposed. We also show that ethylene, via ethylene‐insensitive 2 (EIN2) protein, is involved in the induction of root hair formation and elongation under low B treatment.</jats:p>",

This more comprehensive approach has been termed critical infrastructure resilience. Given the occurrence of a particular disruptive event, the resilience of a system to that event is the system's ability to reduce efficiently both the magnitude and duration of the deviation from targeted system performance levels. Under the direction of the U. S. Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, Sandia National Laboratories has developed a comprehensive resilience assessment framework for evaluating the resilience of infrastructure and economic systems. The framework includes a quantitative methodology that measures resilience costs that result from a disruption to infrastructure function. The framework also includes a qualitative analysis methodology that assesses system characteristics affecting resilience to provide insight and direction for potential improvements. This article describes the resilience assessment framework and demonstrates the utility of the assessment framework through application to two hypothetical scenarios involving the disruption of a petrochemical supply chain by hurricanes. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Process Saf Prog, 2011</jats:p>",

Direct application of the kinetic model for the 0‐ to 15‐cm depth significantly underestimated a field‐based measure of plant available soil N supply (PASNS). Modeling strategies that considered the soil mineral N (SMN) present at the start of the growing season, or included a pool of labile mineralizable N (Pool I) not normally considered in determination of <jats:italic>N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub></jats:italic>, performed better, but still underestimated high values of PASNS. Strategies which included a greater soil depth (0–30 cm), or which assumed that the mineralizable N pool was replenished during the growing season, overestimated PASNS. A strategy which used a higher value of <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> for Pool I gave the most promising results. Results of this study highlight the importance of considering both SMN and labile mineralizable N pools in predicting SNS, and suggest that it is possible to estimate growing season SNS in humid regions using simple kinetic models.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To overcome the inefficiency arising from the separate use of conventional forecast accuracy measures that suffer from the bullwhip effect, especially in uncertain and vague supply chain environments, a forecast accuracy measure, Mean Local Trend Error (MLTE) and a fuzzy-inference-based multicriteria evaluation method are proposed. In contrast to conventional measures, MLTE survives the bullwhip effect by evaluating forecasts based on local trend error. The proposed evaluation method applies fuzzy inference to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness in supply chains and makes a comprehensive evaluation by using an aggregated forecast accuracy index (ACCURACY), which is developed based on fuzzy inference by integrating the proposed MLTE and a conventional measure MAPE, thereby enhancing its efficiency for evaluating supply chain demand forecasts. The proposed MLTE and evaluation method are confirmed by comparative experiments with MAPE based on evaluating four typical forecasting methods – a simple moving average, single exponential smoothing, autoregressive, and autoregressive moving average – on an actual manufacturing-order dataset. The results show that MLTE yields a triple and ACCURACY a quadruple improvement in terms of average distinguishability compared to MAPE. The proposal has potential applications in stock market forecast evaluations.</jats:p>",
