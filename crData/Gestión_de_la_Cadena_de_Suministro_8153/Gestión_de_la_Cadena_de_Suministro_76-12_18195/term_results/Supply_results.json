Larvae were found to be very resistant to prolonged exposure to low humidity. The concentration of the hatching medium showed little effect upon development of eggs, though the rate of larval emergence was reduced as the concentration of the culture medium increased. The relevance of this information is discussed in the context of other requirements of the egg stages during their hatching phase and how this may affect the behaviour of this nematode under field conditions.</jats:p>",

Extensive placental infarction was invariably present and the degree of infarction reflected the extent of pathological changes in the spiral arteries.

Three pricing policies were examined. The first policy assumed no price‐use relationship, and quantity demanded was based on existing community usage with a low water rate. The price of water was set to recover system costs. A price‐use relationship was assumed in the second policy and the water rate was constant. The price of water was determined from the associated system which provided maximum expected net benefits. The third policy assumed the price‐use relationship and the price charged for water during each billing period was a non‐linear function of storage which increased as the amount of water in storage at the beginning of the period decreased.</jats:p><jats:p>It was found that the use of the conservation pricing policies substantially reduced storage requirements while providing demonstrable net benefits to the community and a large average supply. The conservation pricing policies substantially lowered the average price paid for water. The effect of uncertainty in consumer response to changes in price was studied by using a probabilistic price‐use relationship. This uncertainty did not significantly reduce the effectiveness of the conservation policy. It was concluded that demand management by the use of a proper pricing policy could significantly increase net water supply benefits to a community.</jats:p>",
