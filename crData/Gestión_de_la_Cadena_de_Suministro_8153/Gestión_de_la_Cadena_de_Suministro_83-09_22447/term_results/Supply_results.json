This approach suffered from two shortcomings. First, TRAS combined treated and untreated acres into one weighted average, eliminating the capability of assessing response to individual treatments. Second, alternative types of management intensification could not be examined, since TRAS allowed modeling of only one set of management intensities at a time. The approach presented here, the Timber Resource Inventory Model, simulates management intensification by using yield-table projections for up to five treatment and response levels for a large number of species and sites.</jats:p>",

These resonances usually cause arc instabilities which make convenient lamp operation impossible. In this paper an investigation is made of the occurrence of acoustic resonances and arc instabilities as a function of the modulation depth of the lamp power. A critical value of this modulation depth, below which no arc instabilities occur in the power frequency range from 0 to 50 kHz, has been determined for different commercial lamp types. </jats:p>",

Fertility declined significantly in Mexico in the 1970s, and therefore the number of new entrants to the labor force ages in the 1990s will decline; the replacement ratio is projected to be about 330 to 100—a decrease of 19 percent. Nevertheless, it seems very unlikely, even allowing for renewed rapid growth in Mexico's economy, that new job opportunities can be created to accommodate such an enormous influx to the job market.
