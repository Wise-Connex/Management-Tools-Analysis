The technique is suitable for various nonrepetitive electrical transient measurements, such as carrier mobility determination, occurring over timescales ranging from tens of microseconds to several seconds; it essentially eliminates capacitive currents caused by noise in the power supply voltage, which can interfere with measurement of the true transient current. In an example, the noise on a 10-ms transient current (driven by 2000 V dc, and observed as a voltage across a 100-kΩ load resistor) was barely more than the Johnson noise (∼2×10−11 A rms) to be expected from the resistor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1982, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station near Phoenix, Arizona, will begin commercial operation as one of the world's largest power facilities. Locating this multi-unit nuclear power plant in the Arizona Desert was a decision whose uniqueness was exceeded only by the magnitude of the project: Approximately $3.0 billion for three nominal 1300 MWe units needing a total of 90 million gallons of cooling water per day. To supply this resource, Phoenix city wastewater will be conveyed 38 miles to the plant site, treated, stored, used, recycled, and the residues disposed of. Wastewater has been used as cooling water for power plants before, but never in this quantity, in such a climate, and for so critical a use. </jats:p><jats:p> The overall problem of systems design was a classic unstructured and interconnected situation. Every major decision—on conveyance, treatment plant capacity, method of treatment, size of the storage reservoir, condenser tube material, use of wet/dry cooling towers, cycles of concentrations, and blowdown disposal—was linked in cost and performance with two or three others, and all were surrounded by uncertainties regarding supply, performance, and demand. To comprehensively analyze these factors, a spectrum of Management Science methods was used to develop a project plan, sort through the interconnections, assess their net effects, and select the design parameters of the system. </jats:p><jats:p> Besides providing direction for the project and comprehensiveness in the final design, the effort was directly responsible for a reduction of $20 million in capital construction costs, or a cash flow savings of $3.5 million per year for the anticipated 30-year economic life of the plant. </jats:p>",

Three cases had absent main pulmonary artery, one with and two without signs of infundibular septation. We suggest that absent main pulmonary artery may exist with both infundibular pulmonary atresia and persistent truncus arteriosus. SCAs have been found to have similar histological features as systemic muscular arteries of the same size--their medial muscular layer merges gradually into an elastic one at different depth inside the lungs. Injection of contrast material allowed us to demonstrate that these vessels are functional, since they inosculate into efficient pulmonary arteries ending in the respiratory units. When the distal pulmonary vascular bed is perfused by large SCAs, proliferative lesions like those found in large left-to-right shunts may occur. Early in infancy, banding of large, nonstenotic SCAs could protect the distal pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, total surgical repair should be associated with ligation of the SCA to avoid residual left-to-right shunt, if the pulmonary arteries can carry the full pulmonary blood flow.</jats:p>",
