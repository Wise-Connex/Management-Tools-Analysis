      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Republic of Korea, multi-regional water supply pipelines were intensively laid during the rapid economic growth period; however, these pipelines are now aging. The cost of renewal of the aged pipelines would be enormous. Therefore, limited resources need to be distributed effectively in accordance with the priority of renewal. In this study, the risks involved in the multi-regional water supply pipeline of region K were calculated and assessed for setting the priority of renewal. The probability of failure of the pipeline was calculated through a quantification theory, and the effects of failure on the water supply pipeline were calculated by interpreting a pressure driven analysis. The risk considering the probability and consequence of failure comprehensively was found to be the largest at section A12. Three alternatives were considered for risk reduction, and the effect of each alternative on the risk reduction was analyzed. As a result, the construction of double piping by laying a new pipeline was found to be the most effective measure for risk reduction. The results of this study can be utilized as the basic data for establishing an investment plan for the renewal of the water supply pipeline and asset management plan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The blind source separation theory was introduced and the trend and amplitude (TAA) model was established in order to overcome the shortcomings of some traditional global leakage discharge analysis models in water distribution systems (WDS). The TAA model considers the leakage discharge as one part of the total water supply flow, consisting of constrained independent component analysis (CICA) model and amplitude solving model. In the CICA model, the CICA algorithm was chosen and two reference vectors were constructed, and then the trend of leakage discharge was obtained. In the amplitude solving model, the two-element coupled linear overdetermined equations were derived and the amplitude was calculated. The TAA model was optimized and verified based on the data from three kinds of WDS (the laboratory WDS, the emulational WDS and the actual WDS). The simulation accuracy of the TAA model was high enough when the total water supply flow was a non-Gaussian signal in the WDS with one entrance only; the TAA model can effectively avoid the complexity (and reflect the uncertainty) of the relationship between leakage discharge and pressure head. More importantly, the model has good transplant performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, firms have been using their supply chain integration (SCI) as a competitive weapon in the intensive, globalised competitive arena. The contingent perspective in supply chain management maintains that it is necessary to observe the interaction between SCI practices and supply chain justice. A critical issue to be resolved is whether this fit leads to synergistic and complementary effects on supply chain performance. In order to contribute to this research problem, we analysed supply chain justice instances in order to determine the importance of supply chain justice, as well as highlights complementary role in SCI and its influences on supply chain performance. A conceptual framework has been developed and five propositions established to verify the contents of a theoretical study. Accordingly, balancing the adoption of SCI practices and supply chain justice will lead to the generation of greater benefits relative to the effect of both independent driving forces on supply chain performance. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been analysed in order to examine its applicability in the South African context. The study thereby suggests the empirical research guidelines and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research.</jats:p>"

Focusing on four dimensions - policy, service, allocation, and descriptive representation - it documents systematic variation in what people want from legislators and what legislators choose to emphasize while in office. It has important implications for the study of representation, as well as normative questions about political inequality in America. The demand-side results show that constituents who are economically advantaged tend to prefer policy-based representation while the disadvantaged place relatively more importance in constituent service and/or allocation. Suggestive results from the legislator data complement this finding; legislators in wealthy, white districts tend to focus more on policy while those representing economically disadvantaged and racially diverse districts may place more emphasis on service and/or allocation. A likely consequence is that the policy choices made by representatives reflect the policy preferences of the economically advantaged because policy representation is what those citizens want.</jats:p>",

To describe the quantitative reliability of heat supply subsystem reliability indicators are used. Main times between failure and unitary failure rates including the month of their occurrence, type and diameter of the heating network, thermal power region were working out. Knowing the characteristics of the time to repair for the heating network, the reliability of heat supply subsystem for different thermal power region, considering the district heating system configuration can be determined.</jats:p>",

The Pakistani population depends heavily on milk for nutritional needs and 10% of household income is spent on milk. This commodity requires continuous monitoring and care from its site of production by smallholder dairy producers through to urban consumers along tradition milk marketing chains. Feed ingredients used as concentrate feed to enhance milk production are often contaminated with mycotoxins, which, after ingestion, are transferred into milk. Aflatoxins can contribute to the causation of liver cancers, immune system disorders, and growth-related issues in children. Moreover, deaths in both humans and animals have also been reported after ingestion of aflatoxin-contaminated food. Studies have shown contamination of food and feed ingredients with mycotoxins, especially aflatoxins. This review places the dairy industry into context, summarizes how milk and milk products are contaminated with aflatoxins, and discusses the present legislative regulation of milk quality implemented in Pakistan. There is a need to eliminate fungus-susceptible animal feed ingredients, which are the source of mycotoxins so prevalent in the milk marketed to the consumer in Pakistan.</jats:p>"

Conflict of interest exists for business between maintaining shareholder value and delivering “value” within the food offering to its customers and the wider array of societal stakeholders. Shareholders are profit driven and price is the predominant factor that influences consumer purchasing behaviour leading to a constantly negotiated interface between price and other reward factors.

The uses of these technologies have shown an improvement in construction business process particularly in planning and designing processes. These improvements significantly affect the performance of Supply Chain Management (SCM) in construction industry. The construction industry is critical for national wealth creation particularly in the developing countries such Malaysia. However, about five percent of construction projects were not able to be completed due to various reasons. Therefore, there is a great interest to find out the level of utilization of SCT within the construction industry, which is believed as a main driver to improve the SCM performance and directly reflect to the construction project performance. The objective of this paper is to identify and highlight the issues and problems associated with the current SCM practices, particularly in the technology utilization among the major players in the Malaysian construction industry.  To be more specifically, the type of application system that is being utilized in the Malaysian construction supply chain process will be identified.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to understand transient data and the dynamics nature of water from deep sections at the thick vadose zone, and to estimate groundwater recharge by applying Darcy's law of unsaturated water fluxes. The study was conducted during year 2009–2013 at Luancheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station of Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in the North China Plain. The water contents were measured with water probes and matric suctions using pressure transducers at depths of 9 and 11 m and were combined with laboratory measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity to estimate groundwater recharge. The results indicated that the soil water content at 9- and 11-m depths increased following the rainy season and then gradually stabilized. And the intensity and continuity of precipitation events played an important role in soil water changes. The soil water dynamics between different depths (9 and 11 m) indicated a time lag (approximately 5–11 days). The groundwater recharge ranged from 7.60 to 19.75 mm resulting from hysteresis over the study period.</jats:p>",

The study is focus on the water supply system in regards to the water sources, water delivery (water supply interruption), distribution network, and revenue collection. In order to study, the following objectives; (1) to study the sources of water supply and production in the city, (2) to study the status of water revenue collection and distribution networks, (3) to study the various indicators such as water quantity and quality based on household survey (4) to draw an inference based on studies to encourage the practice for better service. The methodology was adopted the very limited literature review. The data analyses were mainly from the secondary data from various offices of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), field investigation and households data (conducted in sub city of the Mekele city, and focus group discussion). The sampling size of the households was 300 dwelling units. The SPPS and Excel were used as tool to analyze the primary data.</jats:p>"

In meeting these challenges, the trilemma of security of supply under conditions of economic viability and environmental sustainability also needs to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable development. To fulfil the natural resources needs of future generations we have three resources at our disposal: (1) the geosphere or primary resources; (2) the technosphere or secondary resources and (3) human ingenuity and creativity driving innovation. Man does not need natural resources as such, only the intrinsic property of a material that enables the fulfilment of a function is required. Any material that can perform the same function more efficiently or cheaply can replace any other material. In our constant drive to secure the supply of efficient raw materials, the feedback control cycle plays an indispensable role by virtue of it reacting to price signals on both the supply and demand sides. The feedback cycle of course goes hand in hand with a continuous learning process. On the supply side, the learning effects are in technology development around primary resources and the increased use of secondary resources; on the demand side with thriftier use of raw materials.</jats:p>"

One of such functions is the choice of intermediaries (carriers, freight forwarders, suppliers, service enterprises etc.) and, according to some specialists, it is a major strategic decision in management supply chains. The methods of choosing the logistic intermediaries are considered in many works, however, some questions remain debatable. The article discusses the analytical and expert approaches which serve as a basis to choose the intermediaries; along with it, in the article a comparative evaluation of choice expert methods is done: point-rating assessment, analytic hierarchy process and the general algorithm for selecting; the conclusions have been drawn about the applicability of each method.</jats:p>",

To address this question, we take advantage of a unique dataset of over 200,000 credit card mail solicitations to a representative sample of households over the recent credit cycle – a period that includes the implementation of the CARD Act. We find that while lenders use credit scores as a prominent screening device, they also take into account a wide array of other information on borrowers' credit histories and financial and demographic characteristics. For instance, the likelihood of receiving an offer is sensitive to the exact timing of a prior bankruptcy filing. We also find that credit market conditions affect the marginal information used in lenders' offer decisions, as lenders sharply reduced credit supplied to subprime borrowers during the crisis and in response to the CARD Act. Finally, we document that lenders extend multiple distinct offers to the same consumers over a relatively short period, likely designed such that consumers reveal private information in their choice of contract.</jats:p>"

As such, it can contribute to rapid identification of new leakages, unregistered changes in valve status or network configuration, etc., in DMAs and supply areas. The method is tested on synthetic and real flow data. The obtained results show that the method performs well in synthetic tests and allows an objective identification of most anomalies in flow patterns in a real life dataset.</jats:p>",

The Muslim community prefers privatization of water supply as against paid public supply. The backward caste community prefers both paid public delivery and privatization. Residents of non-notified (NN) slums prefer paid public delivery as against privatization. Access to accountability mechanisms for water supply is lower for residents of Muslim dominated regions and NN areas. This is reflected by household perception about awareness of councilors regarding water supply conditions in the slums. The choice of alternative institution depends on the degree of risk of exclusion due to lack of access to accountability mechanisms. Notification of NN slums, higher revenue autonomy and capacity of local bodies, and innovations in scale neutral technologies may improve access to water supply by marginalized communities in slums.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;La certificación de Comercio Justo (Fairtrade) se presenta como una importante intervención de mercado en el comercio internacional de bienes de consumo, a través del cual los pequeños productores agrícolas y artesanales, en regiones en vías de desarrollo, pueden obtener mejores precios de venta y conseguir acceso al crédito y la asistencia técnica. Las cooperativas, o asociaciones de productores, son un modo de organización clave a través del cual la mayoría de sistemas de certificación de comercio justo ofrecen sus beneficios. Sin embargo, muchas cooperativas, incluso aquellas que ofrecen primas de comercio justo, se debilitan por el persistente y significativo número de ventas externas hechas por sus mismos miembros a comerciantes intermediarios privados que trabajan para compañías que pertenecen a inversionistas. Debido a las ventas externas, las cooperativas son a menudo incapaces de garantizar un suministro confiable de café de sus miembros. Este artículo es el primero en establecer una conexión explíca entre las prácticas comerciales de los miembros de las cooperativas y las prácticas de trabajo agrícola que los miembros usan en el campo. El estudio econométrico presentado en el presente trabajo señala que los productores que utilizan proporcionalmente más métodos no comerciales de trabajo en sus campos, que incluye una tradición indígena de intercambio laboral llamada choba-choba, participan proporcionalmente en menos ventas externas. El artículo examina el problema de ventas externas en la cooperativa de café Oro Verde de la región Lamas al norte de Perú, que abarca tanto indígenas de Lamas (Lamista) como comunidades mestizas. Las ventas externas han sido un problema para Oro Verde en el pasado, en el que un 46% de todo el café producido por los miembros se vendía a los intermediarios privados durante 2007. Los miembros de la cooperativa Oro Verde hacen uso de tres prácticas laborales: el trabajo conjunto basado en relaciones familiares, la mano de obra contratada y la costumbre indígena de intercambio laboral y por turnos conocida como choba-choba. La presencia de la costumbre choba-choba como reserva de trabajo no comercial compensa las imperfecciones en los mercados de trabajo y de crédito.Esto mediante la reducción de necesidades de dinero en efectivo de los productores y la satisfacción de las alzas repentinas de demanda de trabajo. El pago en especie por el trabajo hecho también conlleva un menor costo de oportunidad cuando hay un involuntario desempleo local. La hipótesis central de este estudio es que el acceso a la práctica choba-choba facilita patrocinio a la cooperativa y reduce las ventas externas. Los resultados de unas variables instrumentales (IV) del modelo probit confirman esta hipótesis, demostrando que los miembros de las cooperativas de café que hacen un uso más intenso del choba-choba, así como del trabajo en familia, participan en menos ventas externas y más ventas a través de la cooperativa en proporción a su cosecha total. Estos resultados indican que las prácticas laborales no comerciales, que incluye el trabajo en familia y choba-choba, desempeñan una función de apoyo en el fomento de la estabilidad y viabilidad financiera del mercadeo de las cooperativas agrícolas. Tres importantes implicaciones se derivan de estos resultados. Primero, las prácticas laborales no comerciales pueden desempeñar un papel importante en el proceso de construcción de instituciones agrícolas cooperativas y democráticas en los países en vías de desarrollo. Segundo, el proceso de formación de instituciones y relaciones de mercado cooperativas puede ser más exitoso en comunidades con fuertes estructuras locales de cooperación e intercambio no comercial preexistentes. Tercero, y en términos más generales, los patrones de intercambio no comercial son capaces de influir en los resultados del mercado. Fuertes relaciones de intercambio no comercial, como choba-choba pueden, por tanto, desempeñar un papel clave en la construcción del mercado socialmente equitativo que fue imaginado por los creadores del sistema de Comercio Justo.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Column tests, which were designed to scale-down larger adsorption systems in terms of size, time and water flow, indicate a higher removal capacity compared to that observed during batch experiments with magnetite powder, reaching 9.2 mg/g at pH 6.4 before residual Cr(VI) exceeds 10 μg/L.

In this paper problem of designing a TSP (Travelling Sales man problem) is addressed which is one of the NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. Computational experiments conducted with GA (Genetic algorithm) on large and small size TSP cases where compared with NNA (Nearest neighboring algorithm) and have proved that the GA provides optimal tour every time in reasonable time by outperforming the NNA solution when number of cities are increased.</jats:p>"

The flood situation management method proposed in this paper was designed to reduce the flood impact at its early arising stage. The river is supposed to be equipped with reservoirs in which water excesses are stored and then released only when the flood episode ends. The supervisory control scheme allows calculation of the water volumes through the use of a network flow. Management objectives, such as the maximum discharge level allowed in the river, the order of priority for the reservoir storage or release, the measured levels and discharge in the river and in the reservoirs, and the assessed parameters such as time delays, are combined to configure the network flow. Then, the optimal flow in the network is computed and supplies the reservoirs’ gate opening setpoints. Finally, the method was applied to a simulated case for which the time delay during the flood varied and remained efficient for flood attenuation compared with the case when the gates were always open, thanks to the network configuration.</jats:p>",

Drawing on actor-network theory, this article identifies two key aspects of these contexts. The first is embeddedness, which refers to the degree to which there are networks that carry information and action from the benchmark to its contexts and back that are sustained institutionally, including by technical artefacts, objects, and routine local practices. Embeddedness is critical to the effectiveness of benchmarking. The second is publicness, which refers to the degree to which these networks exhibit expanding flows of information across widening circles of engagement, or instead are marked by control, domination, and exclusion. The article argues that benchmarking as a form of governance has an inherent impetus toward greater publicness, although this can be prevented by self-interested actors or problems associated with embeddedness. The article then explores the relevance of these conceptual points by examining cases of transnational benchmarking: disaster risk reduction and supply chain management.</jats:p>",

For HAdV2 the stability decreased with increasing temperatures (−80 &amp;gt; −20 &amp;gt; 4 &amp;gt; 22 °C). The time required to reach one log reduction in viral titers (T90) was similar among all the times and temperatures by different cell-culture based methods and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The HAdV2 stability decreased with the time of storage temperature and methods employed, aside from samples stored at 22 and 4 °C which showed the lowest T90 values (50 days). For MNV-1, the samples stored at 22 and −20 °C showed higher log10 decay values, followed by 4 and −80 °C; while genome persistence was ranked as −80 &amp;gt; −20 &amp;gt; 4 &amp;gt; 22 °C. The T90 values were lower for samples stored at 22 °C (33 days), followed by 4, −20 and −80 °C with 111, 100 and 333 days, respectively. The results indicate that, under laboratory storage conditions, freshwater samples should be kept at 4 °C and at −80 °C for short- and long-term periods, respectively.

An E&amp;P company transports a variety of materials ranging from an oil rig to a fastener. Large volume of import material is transported across international waters and then hauled to work sites deploying multi-modal transportation. All supply chain operations have to follow strict compliance to various regulatory provisions, law of the land and high HSE standards. In addition the industry demands flexibility and assurance. - a rig standby as a result of material unavailability can cost upto a million dollars per day. Cyclical nature of the oil business requires an efficient supply chain. During the crests the focus is on extracting oil as much and as fast as possible whereas during the troughs cost effectiveness is key.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In mature and developed Oil &amp; Gas upstream markets such as USA, North Sea, Middle East the scale of activity has spawned consolidation in supply chains. Local material suppliers have developed significant infrastructure that is shared across different operators in a region. Thus operators partner with material suppliers to maximize efficiency and cost effectiveness across their supply chain. Unlike mature markets, developing oil &amp; gas markets like India reel through fragmented supply chain operations. In general, companies internalize supply chain activities and deploy logistics companies tactically leading to disjointed processes and lack of material visibility.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Cairn India (Company) operates the largest onshore producing block in India. Like other E&amp;P companies in the region Cairn handles its supply chain in-house. Due to several challenges in the existing model a strong need to revamp the system was felt. Cairn has taken the initiative to develop a vendor base in India to emulate the structured and integrated supply chain prevalent in mature markets. The contract structure is innovative to enable scale, performance linked compensation and aligns the goal of the service provider with that of the operator. This strategic partnership is expected to fetch multi-fold benefits for the operator including: ○Efficient supply chain management that is scalable as per business requirements○Improved inventory planning and optimization through material visibility and tracking○Enhanced business performance through robust Service Level Agreements○Reduced transactional effort and enhanced focus on core business activities</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During the development of the model, prospective partners were engaged at multiple levels to validate the practicality of implementation. The paper discusses the model in more detail along with key risks in terms of its implementation, partner performance and execution.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This contracting approach is a significant leap towards increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of inbound supply chain in the undeveloped geographies. The success of this model can be easily replicated and the benefits could be reaped by industry at large.</jats:p>",

Over the last decade, audits have evolved from a tool for companies to track internal organisational performance into a transnational governing mechanism to measure and strengthen corporate accountability globally and shape corporate responsibility norms. Drawing on original interviews, we assess the effectiveness of supply chain benchmarks and audits in promoting environmental and social improvements in global retail supply chains. Two principal arguments emerge from our analysis. First, that audits can be best understood as a productive form of power, which codifies and legitimates retail corporations’ poor social and environmental records, and shapes state approaches to supply chain governance. Second, that growing public and government trust in audit metrics ends up concealing real problems in global supply chains. Retailers are, in fact, auditing only small portions of supply chains, omitting the portions of supply chains where labour and environmental abuse are most likely to take place. Furthermore, the audit regime tends to address labour and environmental issues very unevenly, since ‘people’ are more difficult to classify and verify through numbers than capital and product quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are many different aspects to be analyzed when designing a railway infrastructure. The energy system, which withstands the demand for energy from operating trains, must consider many factors to create a functional infrastructure, in terms of demanded energy and cost sustainable. The methodology proposed gives a set of possible solutions to the designer or engineer. On the one hand, this method works with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), with high time efficiency. The main target of this work is to obtain the best electrical configuration in terms of number and location of substations and characteristics of the overhead line system. On the other hand, best configurations must take into account things such as real railway operation, signalling system, infrastructure, costs linked with environment, maintenance, construction and connection with general electric network, losses of energy dissipated along the catenary. Hence, this methodology must combine all of these skills and integrate it with a railway configuration, modelling and simulation tool, Hamlet developed at CITEF (Research Centre on Railway Technologies by Technical University of Madrid, Spain). After using this methodology, designers will have a set of configurations in order to get the final choice of location of traction substations and type of overhead line system to achieve properly the power demand from trains in railway systems.</jats:p>"

Reports that music calms animals and improves productivity appear in commercial journals. The present study investigated the growth rate comparisons between the experimented broilers (Group A: water supply modification group; Group B: sound exposure group) and the control broilers (Group C: control group) in terms of weight and raw meat texture measured by shear force. The water supply modification group was given 12 litres of Yasin water twice per day while the sound exposure group were broadcasted with sound of Quran verses. Twenty-seven broilers were randomly selected from each group on Day 24 and weight measurement was carried out every week until the harvest day (Day 39). Group B showed a higher mean weight on Day 24 (1.441 ± 0.013 kg) than Group A and C. Significant difference in the weight on Day 39 existed for both Group A and B compared to Group C (p &lt; 0.05). However, there was no significant (p &gt; 0.05) difference of shear force in the same muscles (breast and drumstick raw meat) of the three groups but the shear force of the breast meat for Group A, B and C broilers was lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of their drumstick meat. Broadcasting the sound of the Quran verses in the coop and adding Yasin water to the broilers’ drink can be applied to improve the growth rate of broilers for producing better quality poultry.</jats:p>"

Concerns over the competition for agricultural land resources between food and bioenergy supply hinder the further development of bioenergy, especially in China, the country that needs to feed the world’s largest population. Prior research has suggested the introduction of energy crops and reviewed the resulting agricultural land use change in China. However, there is a lack of quantitative studies which estimate the value, contribution, and impact of bioenergy for specific conditions at the county level and provide adequate information to guide local practices. To fill this gap, we choose the Jiangsu Province in China as a case study, build up a spatial-agent dynamic model of agricultural land use, and perform a sensitivity analysis for important parameters. The simulation results show that straw from conventional crops generally dominates Jiangsu’s biomass supply with a contribution above 85%. The sensitivity analyses reveal severe consequences of bioenergy targets for local land use. For Jiangsu Province, reclaimed mudflats, an alternative to arable lands for energy crop plantation, help to secure the local biomass supply and to alleviate the land use conflict between food and biomass production.</jats:p>"

Due to the growing attention to sustainability, and the international trend toward agricultural trades and stakeholder involvement in food, there is a need for a system-based approach in the field of food systems sustainability.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– In total, 12 semi-structured individual interviews were conducted among marketing managers working for different organizations within the Quebec hog marketing channel. The organizations chosen vary depending on the size, level of integration and involvement in the industry, to create a sample that adequately represents the industry. For the purpose of this research, three primary producers, one veterinarian, three licenced abattoirs, one food processor, one distributor, one independent retailer and two types of food service facility, one from a franchise system and the other from a high-end restaurant were questioned regarding the current state of the industry, as well as the impact of sustainable development on their strategic plans.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The Canadian hog and pork industry is currently facing strong competition from several fronts: the USA and South America, a population with increasingly sophisticated demands, a strong Canadian dollar and a significant increase in input costs, particularly in respect to oil and corn. To be able to meet this competition, and in order to prosper in an uncertain marketplace, marketing channel believes that it must reduce its production costs, increase product awareness in the domestic market and promote cooperation among industry members.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– This research is mainly concerned with the Quebec hog industry. External validity has not been achieved with the current research. In addition, a lack of distributor availability to answer the interview questions limits researchers’ capacity to extrapolate results to all retailers. Meetings with other food distributors would be required to verify the accuracy of results. Although this study is exploratory in nature, several appealing research avenues emerge. First, the research focusses primarily on members of the distribution network, but does not consider the consumers’ point of view. It would be fruitful to study the impact of sustainable development on the perceived product quality by measuring consumers’ intent to purchase.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The principal point of interest that makes this case worthy of study and of potential application to future business modeling is how sustainability and sustainable development is perceived throughout various marketing channels. The Quebec hog industry faces strong competition from several countries that are able to offer a similar product at a lower cost. The mature market consists of a limited number of producers interested in offering a product on the market at the lowest possible price.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>– When it comes to sustainable development and the hog industry, the economic and environmental aspects seem to be well understood by members of the industry. On the other hand, the social aspect of sustainability is not mentioned frequently and is often not a part of the leaders’ main concerns. Nevertheless, members of the industry agree that sustainable development affects the Quebec hog value chain, and will remain a topic of interest in the coming years.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– To the knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate the use of sustainability as strategic cornerstone for a marketing channel in a mature market, particularly in the hog industry.

However, there is a dearth internationally of empirical research that has investigated the factors propelling companies to integrate or inhibiting them from integrating sustainability principles in their supply chain management (SCM). Therefore, this study examines the motivators for and barriers to SSCM adoption in the New Zealand business context and aims to contribute to an improved understanding of the motivators of and barriers to SSCM implementation. To this end, an exploratory case study was conducted and senior managers of four large New Zealand based companies were interviewed. The results reveal that sustainability values of top management, a desire to reduce risk and stakeholder management are salient motivators for SSCM adoption. Conversely, a lack of supplier awareness, negative perceptions and inadequate government support are identified as barriers to SSCM implementation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new principle for mainstream nitrogen removal through nitritation followed by anammox was studied in a two-stage moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) configuration. The first stage was optimized for nitritation by using thin biofilms and a feed alternating between synthetic mainstream wastewater at 15°C and, for shorter periods, synthetic reject water at 30 °C. The exposure of the biofilm to reject water conditions aimed to improve the growth conditions for ammonia oxidizing bacteria, while inhibiting nitrite oxidizing bacteria. The biofilm thickness was maintained below 200 μm to ensure high exposure of the total biomass to the bulk reactor conditions. Nitritation was successfully achieved in the configuration, with a nitrite accumulation ratio above 75% during the majority of the study, and ammonia removal rates between 0.25 and 0.50 g NH4-N/L,d. The anoxic second stage, optimized for anammox, was fed with the effluent from the nitritation reactor, reaching nitrogen removal rates above 0.20 g TN/L,d.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hydraulic analysis of water distribution networks (WDNs) is divided into two approaches: namely, a demand-driven analysis (DDA) and a pressure-driven analysis (PDA). In the DDA, the basic assumption is that the nodal demand is fully supplied irrespective of the nodal pressure, which is mainly suitable for normal operating conditions. However, in abnormal conditions, such as pipe failures or unexpected increase in demand, the DDA approach may cause unrealistic results, such as negative pressure. To address the shortcomings of DDA, PDA has been considered in a number of studies. For PDA, however, the head-outflow relation (HOR) should be given, which is known to contain a high degree of uncertainty. Here, the DDA-based simulator, EPANET2 was modified to develop a PDA model simulating pressure deficient conditions and a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was performed to consider the quantitative uncertainty in HOR. The developed PDA model was applied to two networks (a well-known benchmark system and a real-life WDN) and the results showed that the proposed model is superior to other reported models when dealing with negative pressure under abnormal conditions. In addition, the MCS-based sensitivity analysis presents the ranges of pressure and available discharge, quantifying service reliability of water networks.</jats:p>",

On the coast, several cities have their population doubled due to tourism during summer. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the potential for potable water savings by using rainwater in the residential sector of 60 cities located in Santa Catarina state. Computer simulations using the Netuno computer programme were performed considering long-term daily rainfall time series for each city and typical characteristics of houses such as roof area, number of people per house, potable water demand and non-potable water demand (rainwater demand). In total, 2,700 simulations were performed. From the computer simulations, an ideal rainwater tank capacity and the corresponding potential for potable water savings for each case were obtained. Results showed average potable water savings ranging from 75 to 461 litres/day per house and rainwater tank capacities ranging from 1,000 to 16,000 litres. Despite the production of average outcomes using long-term daily rainfall data in cities with a high inter-annual variation of rainfall, results showed that the use of rainwater in houses may bring considerable potable water savings in Santa Catarina state and so could contribute to mitigating the potable water shortages.</jats:p>",

When the formal sector grows larger in those countries, more entrepreneurs become creditworthy, but the higher pressure on the credit market limits further capital accumulation.

A conceptual model is drawn up based on the existing literature in supply chain coordination contracts, performance, supply chain orientation, and supply chain integration and tested on a large sample of European firms. Multiple and multinomial logistic regression models allow for estimating the relationships between these variables. Our results demonstrate that the selection of contracts and the probability of their adoption depend on several combinations of firms' performance, supply chain orientation, and integration. Overall, the research provides an empirical contribution to the literature on coordination with contracts, which turns out to be mainly game theory based.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The aim of this article is to demonstrate that supply systems were important during both war and peace. Stores of grain and bread were needed to supply garrisons and prepare for sudden war. Food was also needed if an army was mobilized and used as a workforce in large-scale construction works. This can be clearly seen in the construction work of Sveaborg’s sea fortress in the middle of the eighteenth century. Thousands of soldiers were commanded to take part in it, which required careful planning to keep them supplied annually through the intensive construction periods from spring to autumn. As the soldiers could not buy enough food by themselves, the Crown had to give them bread for sustenance. This in turn required purchasing large quantities of grain, grinding the grain into flour and baking the flour into bread. To manage all this, the whole supply system had to evolve. New magazines, bakeries and mills were established and new personnel hired. Although the construction of Sveaborg was an extraordinary phenomenon, many of these changes had a long lasting legacy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We provide an empirical and theoretical assessment of the value of information sharing in a two-stage supply chain. The value of downstream sales information to the upstream firm stems from improving upstream order fulfillment forecast accuracy. Such an improvement can lead to lower safety stock and better service. Based on the data collected from a consumer packaged goods company, we empirically show that, if the company includes the downstream sales data to forecast orders, the improvement in the mean squared forecast error ranges from 7.1% to 81.1% across all studied products. Theoretical models in the literature, however, suggest that the value of information sharing should be zero for over half of our studied products. To reconcile the gap between the literature and the empirical observations, we develop a new theoretical model. Whereas the literature assumes that the decision maker strictly adheres to a given inventory policy, our model allows him to deviate, accounting for private information held by the decision maker, yet unobservable to the econometrician. This turns out to reconcile our empirical findings with the literature. These “decision deviations” lead to information losses in the order process, resulting in a strictly positive value of downstream information sharing. Furthermore, we empirically quantify and show the significance of the value of operations knowledge—the value of knowing the downstream replenishment policy.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</jats:p>",

The SC can be the means by which businesses add value to customers and therefore competitive advantage in the international market. Competitiveness no longer exists among individual members of a SC but between SCs. International literature pointed out, that strategy and competitiveness associated with specific strategic priorities. In this paper will be documented that the priorities as objectives of strategic importance comprise the key areas for the performance of the SC network. To support this, a systematic framework of strategic priorities, will be developed, which will visualize the major SC assessment areas that the SC network should turn its improvement efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – In total, 200 high level managers from 71 Greek manufacturing companies covering the whole country using their own SC networks took part in the study.

First the research outcome enables managers to design their SC strategy. Second, proved the great importance of the strategic priorities institutionalization. Third, makes clear to stakeholders which are the SC network performance issues to consider. Fourth, the proposed framework could serve as a suitable formula for assessing the effectiveness and readiness of SC to face the competition. Fifth, it is an effective way of prioritizing the strategic practices as it provides the most important areas on which the firm can base tasks like evaluation, benchmarking and comparison of its SC both as a network and as individual firms. Finally, the proposed framework is an effective way to evaluate the consistency of strategic objectives and actions adopted for the SC. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Literature review revealed a very important conclusion.

Supply-side strategies bear infrastructure and energy costs, while demand-side strategies bear costs of implementation and inconvenience to consumers. To evaluate the performance of demand-side strategies, the participation and water use adaptations of consumers should be simulated. In this study, a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) framework is developed to simulate consumer agents that change their consumption to affect the withdrawal from the water supply system, which, in turn influences operational policies and long-term resource planning. Agent-based models are encoded to represent consumers and a policy maker agent and are coupled with water resources system simulation models. The CAS framework is coupled with an evolutionary computation-based multi-objective methodology to explore tradeoffs in cost, inconvenience to consumers, and environmental impacts for both  supply-side and demand-side strategies. Decisions are identified to specify storage levels in a reservoir that trigger: (1) increases in the volume of water pumped through inter-basin transfers from an external reservoir; and (2) drought stages, which restrict the volume of water that is allowed for residential outdoor uses. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for Arlington, Texas, water supply system to identify non-dominated strategies for an historic drought decade. Results demonstrate that pumping costs associated with maximizing environmental reliability exceed pumping costs associated with minimizing restrictions on consumer water use.</jats:p>"

In the present study five key input variables for production of rice based on literature review and the authenticated data available from agricultural sources have been selected. These variables are area sown, agricultural workers (AW), area irrigated, growth rate and yield per hectare.

Correlation analysis also showed that priority wise consumption depends upon whole sale price per ton, population and the per capita NNP. The poverty ratio is found to be having insignificant correlation with other variables of consumption and hence was omitted from subsequent study. The outcomes of the correlation analysis are utilized for designing rule base for fuzzy inference system (FIS) to forecast the production and consumption of the rice.

The DSS permits the user to identify one or more optimal Alternatives over a fixed long-term planning horizon using performance metrics mapped to the TRUST sustainability criteria. The DSS exposes lists of in-built intervention options and system performance metrics for the user to compose new Alternatives. The quantitative metrics are calculated by the WaterMet2 model, and further qualitative or user-defined metrics may be specified by the user or by external tools feeding into the DSS. A multi-criteria decision analysis approach is employed within the DSS to compare the defined Alternatives and to rank them with respect to a pre-specified weighting scheme for different Scenarios. Two rich, interactive graphical user interfaces, one desktop and one web-based, are employed to assist with guiding the end user through the stages of defining the problem, evaluating and ranking Alternatives. This mechanism provides a useful tool for decision makers to compare different strategies for the planning of UWS with respect to multiple Scenarios. The efficacy of the DSS is demonstrated on a northern European case study inspired by a real-life UWS for a mixture of quantitative and qualitative criteria. The results demonstrate how the DSS, integrated with an UWS modelling approach, can be used to assist planners in meeting their long-term, strategic-level sustainability objectives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are two manifestations of supply chains in health care. One involves the supply of equipment and materials used in health care delivery. The other supply chain involves the delivery of health care itself, wherein patients supply their physical conditions and service suppliers deliver health care services. This article considers the latter supply chain, analyzing a case study in which patients have comorbidities and thus require the services of a network of multiple health care providers. In the case study, we examine three schemes for coordination of care. In the first scheme, the patient herself is expected to manage the coordination. In the second scheme, physicians are expected to coordinate the care. In the third scheme, a third‐party coordinator manages care across network members. We examine these three possible coordination alternatives using a technique known as Process‐Chain‐Network (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PCN</jats:styled-content>) Analysis. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PCN</jats:styled-content> Analysis helps us document how coordination schemes are implemented and where they may fail. Our analysis of the case study leads us to the development of ex post theory about <jats:italic>who</jats:italic> should initiate coordination and <jats:italic>how</jats:italic> it should take place under conditions of comorbidities. Empirical data coming from the case study support the theory. We describe possible applications of the theory inside and outside of health care, and show how the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PCN</jats:styled-content> approach can guide process innovation.</jats:p>",

Fewer articles are addressing issues of developing countries then developed countries. Majority of the articles involved multiple as entity of analysis (combination of supplier, distributor, manufacturer, retailer and consumer), information as element of exchange and chain as the level of analysis. A large number of articles involved “agri-food,” “dairy” and “pork” as perishable products. Majority of articles used “case study” methodology. Statistical analysis as a tool for problem solving was used in majority of articles. Performance measurement aspect is also on growth in PFSCQ literature. Information sharing, logistic management, strategic management, demand forecasting and integration among the various stakeholders of PFSCQ are some of the critical issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Many literature reviews that aim at critical examination of supply chain literature are reported but none of them focussed exclusively on content of PFSCQ.

DC‐link switching is achieved by multicarrier sinusoidal pulse‐width modulation technique which results in improved quality of obtained output AC power. Reduction in DC source and switch count makes the system more cost effective.

SEM images revealed that the Fe–Mn binary oxide was dispersed as flower-like spheres with a diameter of 500 − 800 nm and the width of the petals was 20 − 30 nm. Sorption of the As to the Fe–Mn binary oxide reached equilibrium in less than 180 s, which is much faster than pure MnO2 and amorphous iron manganese binary oxide. The adsorption isotherm agreed well with the Freundlich adsorption model with adsorption capacities of 26.5 mg/g, when the equilibrium concentration was 34.5 mg/L. The effect of temperature revealed that the adsorption of As was exothermic, and the adsorption decreased with increasing temperature from 20 °C to 70 °C. The removal percentage of As by Fe–Mn binary oxide reached 100% from aqueous solution at pH 4.0 − 6.0. The Fe–Mn binary oxide nano-flowers are a potential highly efficient nanomaterial for removal of As from water.</jats:p>",

Globalization and integration of economies make such decisions further complex and risk prone. The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the risk factors to be considered while taking new facility location decision associated with global supply chain and device the methodology. A grey-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is used for this purpose, which also takes in to account the uncertainty in decision making. Such approach enables final decision to be more real and practical. The paper also highlighted and discussed the criteria on the basis of which the management can select the best suitable site. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The risk factors related to facility location for a global firm are identified.

Availability of dry fodder and concentrates were estimated using appropriate conversion ratios to different field crop production, while green fodder was estimated by applying per hectare yield to different fodder sources. The requirement was worked out by converting livestock into adult cattle units and multiplying by per unit consumption capacity. The annual availability of feed and fodder in the state was estimated at 51.54 million tonne is against the requirement of 68.61 million tonne and thereby deficit of around 25% per annum. The feed deficiency was estimated almost in all the districts except in the districts of Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Churu and Ganganagar. The eastern and south eastern districts were deficit in green fodder whereas western and southern hill districts were deficit in dry fodder. Other critical dimensions were low roughage: concentration ration (1:0.06) and high population pressure on pasture and grazing lands. The policies to develop silvi-pastoral model, creation of fodder banks/ storage facilities, strengthening extension system, developing drought resistant and high yielding variety, crop varieties with emphasis on fodder component needs priority attention.</jats:p>"

The rate of EGR required by an engine varies by the speed and load and control of the right amount entering the cylinders is crucial to ensure good engine performance and low NOx emission. However, controlling the amount of EGR entering the intake manifold does not ensure that EGR rate will be evenly distributed among the engine's cylinders.

As a building block, we first discuss the implications of bargaining within a single chain by considering an asymmetric Nash bargaining over the wholesale price (BW). We show that both Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) and vertical integration (VI) strategies are special cases of the BW contract. We then develop the Nash equilibrium in an industry with two supply chains that use BW. We identify the profit‐maximizing (coordinating) bargaining power within this industry. We show that when a chain is not monopolistic, VI does not coordinate the chain and that the MS contract, where the manufacturer has all the bargaining power, is coordinating when competition is intense. We find that the main determinant of the equilibrium in mature industries is to respond well to the actions of the competing chain rather than to directly maximize the profit of each chain. That is, the equilibrium does not necessarily maximize the profit of the entire industry. While a coordination of the industry could then increase the profitability of both chains, such a coordination is likely against antitrust law. Moreover, if one chain cannot change its actions, the other chain may unilaterally improve its profitability by deviating from the equilibrium. Our results lead to several predictions supported by empirical findings, such as that in competitive industries chains will work “close to” the MS contract.</jats:p>",

In this study, we examined current heat and electricity production by incineration plants in Japan for external use. Herein, we discuss specific challenges to the promotion of heat utilisation and future municipal solid waste management strategies. We conducted a questionnaire survey to determine the actual conditions of heat production by incineration plants. From the survey results, information of about 498 incineration plants was extracted. When we investigated the relationship between heat production for external use and population density where incineration plants were located, we found that regions with a population density &lt;1000 persons (km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>)<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> produce &lt;500 MJ t<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> of heat. We also found that external use of such energy for factories, markets, and related use, was noted in cities with a population density of 2000 to 4000 persons (km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>)<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Several incineration plants have poor performance for heat production because there are few facilities near them to provide demand for the energy. This is the result of redundant capacity, and is reflected in the heat production performance. Given these results, we discussed future challenges to creating energy demand around incineration plants where there is presently none. We also examined the challenges involved in increasing heat supply beyond the present situation. </jats:p>",

Accordingly, the present study aims to evaluate the relationship between a green supplier, green innovation, environmental performance, and competitive advantage in the cement industry, which is an important industry for Iran. This study is descriptive in nature and conducted based on correlation and structural equation modelling. Managers and experts of cement companies in Fars Province are selected as samples for the study. A questionnaire and Smart-PLS software were used as research tools. The results of data analysis show that there is a positive and significant relationship between a green supplier, green innovations and environmental performance of an organisation, while there is a negative yet significant relationship between a green supplier, green innovations and environmental performance of an organisation. There is also a significant positive relationship between green innovation and environmental performance on one hand, and environmental performance and competitive advantage on the other.</jats:p>"

In this study, we examine the impact of incentive mechanisms for internal stakeholders and negotiating leverage with external partners on supply chain efficiency in the hospital industry. We premise the study on agency, stewardship, and power theories. We use data from over 200 California hospitals in a five‐year period (pooled data) to estimate regression models using generalized estimating equation. We find that physician employment and contract management enhance supply chain efficiency. Surprisingly, we did not find that better supply chain efficiency was associated with either hospital affiliation with systems or high‐volume purchases through large national group purchasing organizations. The results have important theoretical and managerial implications for supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The aim of  this study is to explore new insight from a growing body of research which is investigating SCF issues in China, an evolving transition economy. A content analysis on a review  of 151 Chinese-written SCF papers from 2004–2014, based on a sample of 45 leading Chinese journals (Chinese Social Science Citation Index, CSSCI) was conducted from  three perspectives: topical coverage, theoretical application and methodological inquiry.  The study reveals that the research stream of SCF in China has emerged and evolved to  a considerable extent. However, the SCF phenomenon in China is not exactly the same as “SCF” as it is perceived in the mature economy, which is articulated in mainstream SCM English literature. The Chinese business context in which SCF has been implemented has played a dominant role in initiating, affecting and even shaping SCF. This study represents the first endeavor in the field of SCM.

Based on data collected from one hundred and twelve Chinese manufacturing enterprises, the empirical results show that environmental management practices have a significantly positive influence on technological innovation performance, and supply chain integration plays a moderating role on the relationship. In addition, the results indicate that supply chain integration is also a predictive variable of technological innovation performance and supply chain knowledge sharing.

Development of the chlorophyll a standard was based on field studies of Colorado reservoirs and compliance data from the associated water treatment systems. Controlling algal abundance in these reservoirs can supplement conventional treatment or serve as an alternative to additional treatment in situations in which algae contribute significantly to the organic precursors that can form DBPs during treatment.

Oral‐health‐related morbidity changed, leading to more periodontal and fewer prosthetic treatments needs, with the overall demand decreasing in all scenarios (−25% to −33%). In contrast, the overall number of dentists did only limitedly change, resulting in moderate decrease in the supplied service quantities (max. −22%). Thus, the demand–supply ratio increased in all but the worst case scenario, but was unequally distributed between spatial units, with several areas being over‐ and some being under‐ or none‐serviced in 2030.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Within the limitations of the underlying data and the required assumptions, this study expects an increasingly polarized ratio of dental services demand and supply in Northern Germany.

One solution to diminish this risk is to add more disinfectant to the water at the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). However, this increases the cost of water treatment and may also cause the formation of trihalomethanes. Mexico has the largest bottled water market in the world. Also, most houses are built with individual storage containers due to intermittent service, which generates a greater residence time of the water before use. This paper shows an alternative to guarantee minimum disinfection along WDNs and diminish the use of disinfectant at the DWTP considering the conditions of water consumption and use in Mexico. We propose a model based on Genetic Algorithms to obtain scenarios where free chlorine is maintained at the minimum permissible concentration throughout the day. In addition, Water Managers could optimize the use of disinfectant by implementing booster chlorination stations (BCSs). The results show that chlorine use could be reduced by 38%, therefore guaranteeing the chlorine concentration limits along the WDN.</jats:p>",

Any incorrect decision from supply chain member may have negative influences on other members or the whole supply chain. Therefore, choosing the appropriate supply chain partners is quite necessary and significant to the supply chain performance improvement because the partners can share risks and benefits with proper contract. Concentrating on the agricultural products supply chain, the supply chain partner selection model and indexes system are put forward in this paper, the clustering and classification analyses of potential supply chain partners are made by data mining technology, and the empirical analysis is made for agricultural products supply chain.

One hundred fixed human female cadavers were dissected using transabdominal, gluteal, and perineal approaches, resulting in two hundred dissections of the sacral plexus. The pudendal nerve and the sacral nerve roots were traced from their origin at the sacral foramina to their termination. All nerves contributing to the innervation of the LA were considered to be the nerve to the LA. Based on the spinal nerve components, the nerve to the LA was classified into the following categories: 50% (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 100) originated from S4 and S5 (type I); 19% (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 38) originated from S5 (type II); 16% (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 32) originated from S4 (type III); 11% (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 22) originated from S3 and S4 (type IV); 4% (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 8) originated from S3, S4, and S5 (type V). Two patterns of nerve termination were observed. In 42% of specimens, the nerve to the LA penetrated the coccygeus muscle and assumed an external position along the inferior surface of the LA muscle. In the remaining 58% of specimens, the nerve crossed the superior surface of the coccygeus muscle and continued along the superior surface of the iliococcygeus muscle. Damage to the nerve to LA has been associated with various pathologies. In order to minimize injuries during surgical procedures, a thorough understanding of the course and variations of the nerve to the LA is extremely important. Clin.

Generally, we find that the main responsibility for regulating LTC services is centralized in half of these countries, whereas in the remaining countries, this responsibility is typically shared between authorities at the central level and those at the regional or local levels in both institutional and home‐based care. Responsibilities for planning LTC capacities are jointly met by central and non‐central authorities in most countries. Access to publicly financed services is rarely means tested, and most countries have implemented legal entitlements conditional on needs. In virtually all countries, access to institutional care is subject to cost sharing, which also applies to home‐based care in most countries. The relative importance of institutional LTC relative to home‐based LTC services differs significantly across Europe. Although old MS appear to be experiencing some degree of convergence, institutional capacity levels still span a wide range. Considerable diversity may also be observed in the national public–private mix in the provision of LTC services. Lastly, free choice between public and private providers exists in the vast majority of these countries. This overview provides vital insights into the differences and similarities in the organization of LTC systems across Europe, especially between old and new MS, while also contributing valuable insight into previously neglected topics, thus broadening the knowledge base of international experience for mutual learning.</jats:p>",

We therefore carried out an evaluation of the timber supply vulnerability to current and future fire risk through simplified calculations involving historical forest growth and harvest rates and current and projected forest burn rates. Calculations were performed at the level of forest management areas (FMAs) across the boreal and montane ecozones of Canada. For some FMAs, the vulnerability of timber supply to fire was estimated to be high to extreme by the middle of the century. For those FMAs, the increases in tree growth necessary to negate these risks were generally unrealistic. A modest simulated decrease in tree growth over time, however, was sufficient to raise the vulnerability of many other FMAs from low to moderate. Known biases in the analysis suggest that our assessment might underestimate the level of vulnerability in all FMAs. Other natural disturbances are not included in the analysis but their impact on timber supply may be additive to that of fire. Some adaptation measures to face these increasing risks are discussed.</jats:p>",

The results of this analysis indicated that the optimum hydropower generation was 5.7% higher than the usual operating hydropower generation, which suggested that, during flood season, it would be beneficial to increase hydropower generation from reservoirs, while maintaining a safe degree of flood risk.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a Model-Driven Decision Support System (DSS) is proposed to reassign the actual homogeneous stock and the planned homogeneous sublots to already committed orders under uncertainty by means of a mathematical programming model (SP-Model). The DSS functionalities enable ceramic decision makers to generate different solutions by changing model options. Uncertainty in the planned homogeneous quantities, and any other type of uncertainty, is managed via scenarios. The robustness of each solution is tested in planned and real situations with another DSS functionality based on another mathematical programming model (ASP-Model). With these DSS features, the ceramic decision maker can choose in a friendly fashion the orders to be served with the current homogeneous stock and the future uncertainty homogeneous supply to better achieve a balance between the maximisation of multiple objectives and robustness.</jats:p>"

Based on capacitance controlled oscillators (CCOs) for ultra-low voltage/power consumption, the sensor readout circuit is directly powered by the on-chip solar cell to improve the overall system energy efficiency. An extended sensing range with high sensing accuracy is achieved using a two-step successive approximation register (SAR) and delta-sigma ([Formula: see text]) analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion (ADC) scheme. Digital controls are generated on-chip using a customized sub-threshold digital standard cell library. Systematic error analysis and optimization including the finite switch on-resistance, buffer input-dependent delay, and SAR quantization nonlinearity are also outlined. High power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) is ensured by using a pseudo-differential topology with ratiometric readout. The complete sensing system is implemented using a standard 0.18[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. Simulation results show that the readout circuit achieves a wide input range from 1.5[Formula: see text]pF to 6.5[Formula: see text]pF with a worst case PSRR of 0.5% from 0.3[Formula: see text]V to 0.42[Formula: see text]V (0.67% from 0.3[Formula: see text]V to 0.6[Formula: see text]V). With a 3.5[Formula: see text]pF input capacitance and a 0.3[Formula: see text]V supply, the [Formula: see text] stage achieves a resolution of 7.1-bit (corresponding to a capacitance of 2.2[Formula: see text]fF/LSB) with a conversion frequency of 371[Formula: see text]Hz. With an average power consumption of 40[Formula: see text]nW and a sampling frequency of 47.5[Formula: see text]kHz, a figure-of-merit (FoM) of 0.78[Formula: see text]pJ/conv-step is achieved. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract Frugivorous birds are important seed dispersers and influence the recruitment of many plant species in the rainforest. The efficiency of this dispersal generally depends on environment quality, bird species, richness and diversity of resources, and low levels of anthropogenic disturbance. In this study, we compared the sighting number of dusky-legged guans (Penelope obscura) by km and their movement in two areas of Serra do Japi, one around the administrative base (Base) where birds received anthropogenic food and a pristine area (DAE) with no anthropogenic resource. We also compared the richness of native seeds in feces of birds living in these two areas. Although the abundance of P. obscura was higher in the Base, these individuals moved less, dispersed 80% fewer species of plants and consumed 30% fewer seeds than individuals from DAE. The rarefaction indicated a low richness in the frugivorous diet of birds from the Base when compared to the populations from DAE. We conclude that human food supply can interfere in the behavior of these birds and in the richness of native seeds dispersed.</jats:p>"

In this essay we outline two major challenges and several fruitful directions forward. First, we review the different outcomes of interest in research on labor rights and highlight several tensions that lead to difficulty comparing findings across studies, inappropriate data choices, and unexamined causal assumptions. Second, we highlight a failure to adequately integrate the findings of research in two different subliteratures, one focusing on the incentives of states and firms to adopt reforms, and a second focusing on the implementation of those reforms with monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We conclude by highlighting the important questions raised by a clearer integration of these two literatures and identifying several recent studies that begin to answer them. </jats:p>",

We tested the use of sales data for weighting consumers’ exposure to health-related labeling information in the Slovenian food supply. Food labeling data were collected from 6342 pre-packed foods available in four different food stores in Slovenia. Consumers’ exposure was calculated as the percentage of available food products with particular food information in the food category. In addition, 12-month sales data were used to calculate sales weighted exposure as a percentage of sold food products with certain food information in the food category. The consumer’s in-store and sales-weighted exposure to nutrition claims was 37% and 45%, respectively. Exposure to health claims was much lower (13%, 11% when sales-weighted). Health claims were mainly found in the form of general non-specific claims or function claims, while children’s development and reduction of disease risk claims were present on only 0.1% and 0.2% of the investigated foods, respectively. Sales data were found very useful for establishing a reliable estimation of consumers’ exposure to information provided on food labels. The high penetration of health-related information on food labels indicates that careful regulation of this area is appropriate. Further studies should focus on assessing the nutritional quality of foods labeled with nutrition and health claims, and understanding the importance of such labeling techniques for consumers’ food preferences and choices.</jats:p>"

Here we reduce the level of canonical histones in a human cell line by silencing stem-loop–binding protein, a histone mRNA regulatory factor. We show that canonical histone depletion increases the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation rate and temporally separates transcription and splicing. Furthermore, histone depletion also causes several pre-mRNA splicing defects, including skipping of alternative exons and intron retention. Thus we demonstrate that the correct histone supply is required to control the RNAPII elongation rate and pre-mRNA splicing.</jats:p>",
