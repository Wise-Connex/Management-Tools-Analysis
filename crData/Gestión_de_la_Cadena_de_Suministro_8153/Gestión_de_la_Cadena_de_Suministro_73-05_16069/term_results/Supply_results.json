For silt‐loam‐clay mixtures of soils, the required seepage bed area varies from 365 sq ft (34 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) to 640 sq ft (60 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) for average households if actions of higher aerobic microorganisms are strong.</jats:p><jats:p>Water‐supply wells located on the same property are protected from wastewater contamination by natural purification in deep layers of undisturbed soil. The protective distance between mouth of well and seepage bed has a vertical and a horizontal component, the former determined by the depth of the well. The need for a sufficiently long horizontal component influences the required property size. It also depends on the types of soil at deeper layers. For an 80 ft deep well for example, the horizontal protective distance varies from 80 ft (24 m) for silt‐loam mixtures to 140 ft (42 m) for sand‐silt mixtures.</jats:p><jats:p>Wastewater can be entirely evaporated, if soil infiltration would be a hazard to water‐supply wells. Evapotranspiration beds of 2000 sq ft (186 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) with strong microbial activity are needed for average households.</jats:p>",
