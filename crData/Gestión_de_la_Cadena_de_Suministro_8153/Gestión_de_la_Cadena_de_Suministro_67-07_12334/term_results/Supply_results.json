In fishes,where the necessities of existence are taken care of largely by the respiratory and taste centers in the brainstem augmented by olfaction, the caudal division is the larger. As locomotion becomes more important and complex in reptiles and birds, the corpus striatum and the cerebellum become larger, necessitating a gradual shift of arterial blood into the rostral division. At the reptilian level the cerebral branches have evolved sufficiently to be recognized as having a mammalianlike pattern, and it is at this point that the mammalian terminology can be applied. Branches of the basilar artery, which is formed by the union of the two caudal rami, retain their basically segmental arrangement. The vertebral artery has not yet appeared.</jats:p><jats:p>The intrinsic vascular patterns are in the form of a wide‐meshed plexus, at first uniformly distributed among cells and fibers, but later more ldense in the nuclear areas. The first evidence of specialization in the vascular arrangement is the formation of a perineuronal plexus within the optic lobes in amphibians and in the appearance of a definitive striate artery. The vascular patterns are correlated with the phylogenetic development and the general functional development of members of each of the classes described.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The influence of the nitrogen supply on the growth and development of Euphorbia esula L. was investigated by growing seedlings in sand culture at nitrogen levels of 105 p.p.m. (later increased to 210 p.p.m.), 10.5 p.p.m. and 2.1 p.p.m. Shoot height and dry weight and the shoot/root ratio were much reduced by nitrogen deficiency and the outgrowth of lateral buds was completely suppressed at the lowest nitrogen level. Root development proved very responsive. The \"heterorhizic\" pattern of long and short roots of differing growth potential described from field observations was much less evident under the experimental conditions. Long roots were more numerous and were produced at an earlier stage of development than is usual in the field. These differences increased markedly with the nitrogen supply. The number of lateral roots (of both types) per unit length of the parent roots and the number of shoot buds on the root system were both considerably greater at the higher nitrogen levels. The increase in shoot bud production, however, could be largely attributed to associated effects on the size and mode of development of the root system. Regrowth from buds on the roots, induced by shoot removal, was extremely vigorous in the seedlings treated with high nitrogen but was almost completely suppressed at the lowest nitrogen level. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. Electrophysiological and histological techniques have been employed to search for pulmonary arterial chemoreceptors in kittens and cats.</jats:p><jats:p>2. In cats, impulses were recorded from vagal fibres arising from chemoreceptors in the aortico‐pulmonary region. The receptors were identified by their response to hypoxia, and their location was investigated by comparing the effects of injecting drugs at various sites in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. In only one of a large number of experiments did a chemoreceptor appear to receive pulmonary rather than systemic arterial blood.</jats:p><jats:p>3. No chemoreceptor impulses were evoked when a segment of the pulmonary artery was perfused as described by Duke, Green, Heffron &amp; Stubbens (1963).</jats:p><jats:p>4. The vasculature of the aortico‐pulmonary bodies was displayed by micro‐dissection following injection of coloured gelatin masses, and the bodies were examined histologically. In the new‐born kitten, the pulmonary artery invariably furnished a branch to some aortic bodies but the vessel frequently anastomosed with systemic arteries. As post‐natal development proceeded the vessel became occluded, and in most kittens more than a month old and in forty‐one of forty‐three cats the aortic bodies were supplied wholly by systemic arteries.</jats:p><jats:p>5. It was concluded that a pulmonary arterial supply to aortic bodies in the adult animal is an uncommon variation owing to the abnormal persistence of a foetal condition.</jats:p><jats:p>6. Results indicated that the nomenclature introduced by Howe (1956) is, with slight modification, a useful method of classifying the various groups of aortic bodies according to their position, blood supply and innervation.</jats:p>",
