      "abstract": "<jats:p>Economists have, in the last 20 years, made many contributions to the study of the deterrent effect of sanctions on criminals — these are surveyed in Brief &amp; Fienberg (1980), Blumstein &amp; Cohen (1978), Tullock (1974), Palmer (1977) and Taylor (1978). A considerable amount of the empirical work has dealt with crime supply functions for specific types of crime. Surprisingly little attention has been given to the switching of criminals between crimes in response to differentials in deterrence. Only three empirical studies of this phenomenon have appeared: Heineke (1978), Holtmann &amp; Yap (1978), Hakim <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> (1984). All of these use cross‐section US data for property crimes. Their findings are thus somewhat tentative given that they may not hold up in other national contexts. This paper seeks to remedy this gap by studying substitution behaviour for burglary, robbery and theft using 1981 data for the police force areas of England and Wales. We compare our results with those of American researchers and also examine the impact of substitution on the broad conclusions of the conventional non‐substitution model.</jats:p>",

Because the uprooting‐replanting decision is central to understanding rubber supply response in Sri Lanka and for other perennial crops where replanting activities dominate new planting, the standard approaches do not adequately capture supply response.</jats:p>",

The remainder is taken up as NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> from the soil and the net effect of soybean cropping is depletion of the soil N pool. Therefore, a program was commenced to identify genotypes of soybean which were capable of high levels of nodulation and high rates of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation in the presence of NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. In the first year of screening, 489 genotypes of diverse origin were grown in sand, free of <jats:italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</jats:italic> prior to inoculation with effective strain CB 1809 (USDA136), in unreplicated, 14‐L free‐draining pots in a glasshouse and supplied with nutrients containing either zero or 2.5 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. Plants were sampled at R2 for plant growth (shoot mass), for nodulation, and for the proportion of plant N derived from N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation (relative abundance of ureides in xylem exudate and extracts of shoot axes and nodulated roots). From the original 489 genotypes, 66 “NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐tolerant”, 9 “NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐sensitive” and 12 others were selected for a second year of screening on the basis of an overall ranking index which related nodulation and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation (relative ureides) activity at 2.5 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> to activity at zero NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. In year two, treatments were replicated twice; plant culture and sampling procedures were otherwise identical to those used in the first year. Variation in symbiotic activity at high NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> supply was again evident with between 5‐ and 13‐fold differences in the nodulation and ureide indices recorded. In both screenings, genotypes of Korean origin ranked first overall and provided three of the top 10 lines. Of the original 19 Korean genotypes, 15 (80%) were screened in year 2 and nine (47%) were identified for future evaluation. Only 5% of the other 470 genotypes were selected as “NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐tolerant” after two years of screening. Isolation of genotypes, superior in nodulation and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation in the presence of NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> under both glasshouse and field conditions, should be achieved with further screening in a high‐NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> field soil.</jats:p>",

However, in most high-technology industries a greater proportion of the manufacturing cost is associated with the products and materials supplied from the supplier network. It is therefore vitally important that the very same disciplines, controls and philosophies that apply in-house to manufacture on time, at minimum cost with minimum working capital, are applied to the components, materials and services supplied from outside the industry. This paper reviews the actions necessary in order to ensure that the supplier chain is managed with maximum effectiveness for quality production, minimum cost, with secure lead-times and delivery. The paper reviews the importance of supplier involvement in the influence of design details, working to ‘should costs’, sealing of manufacturing methods and also a commitment to just-in-time delivery, as well as just-in-time manufacture. The paper concludes with the declaration that the competitiveness of British industry largely depends on how the larger companies contribute to the international competitiveness of their suppliers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this study was to assess the individual effects of cooling, increased oxygenation, and umbilical cord occlusion on nonshivering thermogenesis in utero. A cooling coil was placed around eight fetal sheep of 132–145 days gestation; thermistors were placed in the fetal esophagus and maternal iliac artery, vascular catheters and a tracheal catheter were inserted, and a snare was placed loosely around the umbilical cord. The next day cold water was circulated through the coil for 5 h. During the 1st h of cooling alone, fetal core temperature fell 2.79 degrees C, but indexes of brown fat activity increased only slightly. After ventilation with O2, plasma free fatty acid concentration (FFA) rose 7.4-fold to 244 +/- 42 mu eq/l, glycerol concentration rose fourfold to 376 +/- 85 microM, and the difference between brown fat and core temperature widened to 0.60 +/- 0.10 degrees C. Ventilation with N2-enriched air did not evoke similar responses. After snaring the umbilical cord while ventilation was continued, FFA rose to 554 +/- 95 mu eq/l, glycerol rose to 684 +/- 76 microM, and the temperature difference widened to 0.77 +/- 0.13 degrees C. Whole-body O2 consumption peaked at 19.6 ml.min-1.kg-1 of fetal tissue. We conclude that fetal thermogenic responses are limited in part by O2 delivery to brown fat and are augmented by occlusion of the umbilical cord. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Short term increases in stream sediment loads during pre‐afforestation ground preparation have often been followed by a return to low sediment loads. However, in the Macclesfield Forest in the southern Pennines, comparison of the magnetic characteristics of soils and downstream reservoir deposits suggest that significant changes in the processes of soil erosion occur later in the cycle of forest management at the time of canopy closure. A preliminary magnetic mixing model indicates that the proportion of reservoir sediments derived from the subsoil (below 0·3 m depth) has increased from 30 to 70 per cent between 1929 and 1981. Changes in hydraulic stresses subsequent to road construction and forest development, in association with unstable Pleistocene deposits, may provide an explanation for these events.</jats:p>",

The infants displayed a wide range in arterial oxygen tension (Pa<jats:sub>o2</jats:sub>) and oxygen saturation (Sa<jats:sub>o2</jats:sub>). During the first days of life siEp varied widely with a range from less than 3 to more than 10000 mIU/ml. The wide variation is consistent with findings in cord blood at term. The siEp levels did not correlate significantly with haemoglobin, haematocrit, Pa<jats:sub>o2</jats:sub>, Sa<jats:sub>o2</jats:sub>, or arterial oxygen content in the total sample, nor when the cohort was split up into different age groups. Cyanotic infants aged 2–13 weeks had significantly higher siEp concentrations than normal adults (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt;0.001) and than children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, aged 4 months‐10 years (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt;0.001). The raised siEp levels in cyanotic children aged 2–13 weeks found in this study and the normal levels found in their older counterparts (4 months‐10 years) (reported elsewhere) are consistent with the pattern observed in man and animals exposed to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia, in which after an initial rise in erythropoietin concentrations the levels fall to normal while increased erythropoiesis is sustained.</jats:p>",
