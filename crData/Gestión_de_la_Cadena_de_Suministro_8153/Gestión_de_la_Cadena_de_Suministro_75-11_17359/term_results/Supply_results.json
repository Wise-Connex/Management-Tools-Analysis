The Devonian Shales underlie approximately 100,000 square miles in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. We estimate that Pennsylvania, and New York. We estimate that in this area there are approximately 460 trillion tons of Shale readily accessible to the drill, almost all of which is above 10,000 feet in depth. It should also be noted that the same formations underlie approximately 150,000 square miles in adjacent areas in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas but will not be considered in this paper. paper.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

One patient experienced chest pain, and one exhibited chemical signs of myocardial hypoxia. Heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial O2 consumption did not change significantly. Coronary blood flow decreased and coronary (a-v)O2 difference widened. Since the alkalosis increased the blood O2 affinity, the fall in PO2 in coronary venous blood was proportionately even greater than the fall in O2 concentration. Thus, hypocapnic alkalosis due to hyperventilation interferes with myocardial O2 supply by 1) coronary vasoconstriction and 2) increased O2 affinity of blood.</jats:p>",

This resulted in considerable modification to root form, but with only a small depression in shoot growth, compared with control plants receiving an ample supply to all parts of the root system. The extension of seminal axes was little affected by the concentration of phosphate to which they were exposed.</jats:p><jats:p>Similar responses to those described for phosphate occurred with variation in concentration of nitrate or ammonium, but with potassium a localized supply promoted the growth of laterals to approximately the same extent as controls throughout the entire root system.</jats:p><jats:p>The experiments show that adequate external concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus are required by any part of the root system for optimal growth of laterals, but not axes. Possible mechanisms which compensate shoot growth when nutrients are supplied to only part of the root system, and agronomic implications, are discussed.</jats:p>",
