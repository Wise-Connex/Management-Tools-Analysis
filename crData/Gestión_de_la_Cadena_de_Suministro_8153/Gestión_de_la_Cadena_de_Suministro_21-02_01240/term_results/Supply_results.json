      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains are fundamental to whether decent work flourishes or not. Not only do supply chain dynamics shape employment practices and working conditions, but they also influence business models and capabilities which structure opportunities for decent work. As scholars and policymakers race to strengthen labor standards in supply chains and confront barriers to their effective implementation, management scholars can both benefit from and advance an understanding of the role of supply chains in giving rise to indecent work, especially the business practices commonly described as forced labor and modern slavery. To help realize this potential, this article draws from my research on the business of forced labor to emphasize three points. First, there are clear and discernible patterns with respect to the root causes of forced labor in supply chains. Second, forced labor in supply chains cannot be understood in isolation of broader dynamics of work and employment, since low‐waged workers tend to move in and out of conditions of forced labor in relatively short periods of time. Third, on‐the‐ground studies of the effectiveness of buyer‐centric governance programs reveal serious gaps between corporate social responsibility standards and business practices when it comes to indicators most relevant to forced labor. I conclude with a discussion of future directions in this research agenda and highlight the potential for business scholars to make a contribution.</jats:p>",

This stems, in part, from the fact that SCM researchers and industry practitioners share a common “logic of efficiency” in the analysis of supply chains.

In this introduction to the 2021 Emerging Discourse Incubator, “Managing Working Conditions in Supply Chains: Towards Decent Work,” we argue that the trajectory of this research may be insufficient for addressing decent work. This is due to four characteristics of the extant literature—buyer‐centrism, product‐centrism, techno‐centrism, and social‐centrism. As an alternative, we offer ways to ‘humanize’ research on working conditions in supply chains across four dimensions: <jats:italic>actors, issues, contexts,</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>methods</jats:italic>.

The single competition between enterprises turns into the competition between supply chain and supply chain. However, the occurrence of natural disasters, terrorist attacks and the game and coupling of the internal structure of the supply chain make the supply chain encounter the interruption crisis in the process. Therefore, studying different mitigation strategies for the interruption of node locations in the supply chain is particularly important. In this paper, supply interruption cases are designed, and the simulation models of the dual-chain one-way coordination strategy mode and the dual-chain multi-node two-way coordination strategy mode are constructed by combining system dynamics. The dynamic operation mechanism of supply chain system with different mitigation strategies is deduced by two indexes of “inventory level” and “order accumulation rate”. The results show that the “dual-chain multi-node two-way coordination strategy” has the best performance in improving the defense ability of node enterprises.</jats:p>",

This paper conducted a systematic literature review by collecting author-anchored keywords from peer-reviewed articles on IT-based supply chain management. A total of 1264 articles and 2575 keywords from eleven supply chain-related journals were analysed with social network analysis. A knowledge map with ten research hot topics was identified. Additionally, a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) model is developed not only to guide researchers to further understand IT-based SCM topical and structural meanings but also to contribute to enlightening a coherent and rigorous body of theories relevant to academics and supply chain and logistics managers interested in SSCM.</jats:p>"

Our suggestions are applicable to designing any intervention in supply chain research, but need tailoring to the local context. Our interventions were aimed at achieving decent working conditions in emerging‐country suppliers, but our insights are applicable for all supply chain scholars. In the context of emerging‐country suppliers, poor working conditions have been strongly criticized after the Rana Plaza accident and subsequently received more attention with the UN’s introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (notably, SDG 8). Tensions between productivity‐enhancing and decent work logics create challenges for the design of interventions with long‐lasting performance improvements. This paper presents a way of overcoming the tensions by illustrating how interventions that integrate improvements in working conditions with productivity can be designed.</jats:p>",

The proposed framework is then applied to a real case of the Moroccan public pharmaceutical supply chain, which has different features that distinguish it from other supply chains including its importance, urgency, and regulation. We employed the DELPHI method to determine the key stakeholders that should be involved in the decisional process.

In order to select the optimal partner enterprises of logistics service supply chain, a two-stage partner selection method is proposed from the perspective of supply and demand matching. In the first stage, the logistics project is divided into multiple subtasks. The demand criteria system of subtasks and the supply capabilities criteria system of candidate enterprises are established. The concept of subtask-oriented supply–demand matching degree is proposed. According to the supply–demand matching degree threshold, the qualified enterprises of each subtask are selected. In the second stage, a partner selection model is established. The partner selection model is transformed into a matching problem of weighted bipartite graph between subtasks and qualified enterprises, and the optimal matching combinations are determined by using Kuhn–Munkras algorithm. The feasibility of the two-stage partner selection method is verified by a computational experiment. The sensitivity analysis in the computational experiment provides help for decision makers to set parameters more reasonably. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains are unique logistics systems. Typically, such systems include a number of components. The key component is considered to be the producer enterprise, around which supply chains are organized. The efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain largely depends on the level of development of the key component. In turn, the latter depends on effective investment. It is established that the practice of enterprises-producers, which are key components of supply chains, requires a qualitative economic justification of investment measures, which must be forecasted for the long term before their implementation. The article substantiates the need to assess the effectiveness of investment in the development of a key component of the supply chain based on a targeted approach. It is indicated that to assess the effectiveness of investment in the development of industrial enterprises should use absolute and relative cash flows, the values of which are used in the calculations of absolute and comparative effects, respectively. With this in mind, a targeted approach should be applied to improve the quality of assessing the effectiveness of investment in the development of manufacturing enterprises. The essence of the criterion indicator of net cash flow is thoroughly described. It is stated that the economic assessment of the comparative economic effect should be based on the definition of incremental indicators that reflect changes in the activities of the enterprise due to the investment of additional investments in the assets of its logistics system. The tree of maximizing the efficiency of investments in the main assets of the production logistics system of the enterprise is formalized. An approach to evaluating the effectiveness of investing funds in the production and logistics system of the enterprise is proposed.</jats:p>"

      ],
      "type": "posted-content",
      "container-title": [],
      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>-------&amp;gt;Antitrust law and policy today are a semi-coherent welter of legal and economic doctrines. Immanent in them, however, is a structure of great simplicity and utility. The concept at the heart of the antitrust laws is the linear supply chain, consisting of an essential input, a downstream market in which competition is harmed through the discriminatory supply of the input to downstream firms, and consumers who pay higher prices for finished products as a result of the discriminatory behavior. Antitrust attacks this problem of the discriminatory supply of inputs in two ways. First, it seeks to prevent any one intelligence from taking control over the input, because absent such centralized control, competition from input suppliers eliminates any attempt at discrimination. Stopping the centralization of control over inputs is not always possible, however, because sometimes centralized control improves the quality of the input, and antitrust follows an implicit rule of “innovation primacy,” which holds that any act that plausibly improves the product likely does more good for consumers than any resulting increase in prices harms them, and so the act must be immune from antitrust scrutiny. -------&amp;gt;Second, antitrust regulates attempts by input controllers to use their power to increase their profits other than by charging what they know to be the highest possible prices for their products given their level of knowledge of consumer willingness to pay. Profits can be increased in this way by only three routes, each of which involves discrimination by the input controller in the supply of inputs to downstream firms. The input controller can discriminate in favor of firms that improve the final product ultimately sold to consumers and so increase consumers’ willingness to pay. The input controller can discriminate in favor of downstream firms that supply the input controller with information about consumer willingness to pay, enabling the input controller better to choose its prices to maximize its profits. And the input controller can discriminate against downstream firms that refuse to give the input controller access to profits that the firms have in turn extracted from consumers. The doctrine of innovation primacy protects discrimination that improves the final product sold to consumers, but not discrimination that facilitates information acquisition or the disciplining of refractory downstream firms. -------&amp;gt;This analysis resolves numerous longstanding conundrums in antitrust, including (1) whether antitrust picks winners (it must), (2) whether picking winners limits consumer sovereignty (impossible, because whenever a firm discriminates in the supply of inputs, the firm picks winners, and antitrust, which does no more than challenge such discrimination, therefore only ever substitutes its judgment for that of firms, never for that of end consumers), (3) whether antitrust should have a monopoly power requirement (it should, but the requirement should apply to the input market and not, as at present, to the downstream market in which competition is harmed), (4) whether firms should be allowed to compete on their own platforms as a general matter (of course they should, unless it is thought that consumers always know better than firms how everything they buy should be made, from start to finish), and (5) how to define the limits of the firm (the boundary of the firm does not end where formal ownership ends, but rather where discrimination in the supply of inputs ends). The analysis also shows why Lorain Journal, Aspen Skiing, Linkline, Trinko, Microsoft, Qualcomm, exclusive dealing, and tying are all the same basic case.</p>"

The supply chain activities emphasize on cooperation between parties to reduce risks in all stage of supply chain. Risk event occur are the return of fish to suppliers due to the poor quality, damaged product during the production process, and customer complaints due to improper order services. These problems result on out of stock of fresh fish, low customer satisfaction, and financial loss for the fish processing industries and distributors. Therefore, it is important to identify, measure and analyse the risks that probably occur in the supply chain from harvest area to end customer. The house of risk method used to analyse the supply chain risk and Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) approach used to divided the business process into 5 main processes i.e., plan, source, make, deliver and return. The data collection was done by deep interview and spread questionnaires to industries manager and staff. The risk identification result shows that 7 risk events occur in the production process and 8 risk events in delivery process. These two processes have highest risk event number. The highest risk severity is found on Chlorine contaminated products. Based on severity value, some recommendation was formulated to reduce the impact of occurred risks to increase the supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

The aim of the current study is to build a fuzzy chance-constrained programming method which is developed for supporting the uncertainty of demand. This method ensured that the fuzzy constraints can be satisfied at specified confidence levels, leading to cost-effective solutions under acceptable risk magnitudes. Finally, through the case of the electronic product manufacturing enterprise, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by adopting a sensitivity analysis of capacity loss level and minimizing objective function. Numerical simulation shows that selecting two manufacturing centers can effectively reduce the supply chain cost and maintain business continuity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article reveals the main trends in the functioning of global supply chains in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on the activities of Ukrainian enterprises are identified. It is noted that the closure of borders between countries and the introduction of self-isolation regime caused a significant reduction in production capacity and the volume of international trade. Global supply chains have become very vulnerable and necessitate their revision and the search for alternative ways to deliver goods to end users. Since Ukraine is a country with an open market economy, this article summarizes the main challenges for import-dependent supply chains and makes proposals on ways to overcome them. The expediency of applying the concept of Lean-management in business processes management of refrigeration supply chains during a pandemic as a means of overcoming crisis situations and ensuring sustainable development are proved. The dynamics and structure analysis of the company LLC \"Holod Engineering\" income and expenses allowed to establish a tendency to reduce the profitability of the company's business and capital turnover, as well as increase the share of logistics costs in the production costs. The greatest impact on the growth of logistics costs have the inventory costs due to the processes of storage and orders completion and delivery delays, which lead to customer dissatisfaction and complaints. Methodical approaches to estimating the level of processes coordination in the supply chains of refrigeration equipment, calculation of supply lots optimal parameters, levels of raw materials and components stocks, production and storage capacity rationalization of the enterprise are substantiated. With the help of Shewhart's control charts, the coordination of business processes in the equipment supply chains were assessed and the sources of potential losses were identified. The technological and logistics processes optimization in terms of their cost, duration and quality of results takes into account not only individual processes of enterprises, but also interprocess connections between supply chain links. It is proposed to implement a number of organizational measures using the concept of lean management, which involves market integration, production process, procurement and sales in order to provide a high level of customer service. The efficiency of the proposed organizational changes and their impact on business profitability, inventory turnover, the amount of logistics costs and the quality of customer service are determined.</jats:p>"

Detailed discussions of the German dual system, Sweden’s democratic education, the southern Mediterranean approach to human capital, and on-the-job training models in India and the United States are provided. The implications of a widespread shift from vocational training and apprenticeship are addressed as are the implications of this shift for the future health of the focal countries.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>”. It is shown that in order to increase the efficiency of the functioning of complete logistical supply chains (CLSC), it is necessary to develop special methodological tools, and, on their basis, software to facilitate decision-making on the timely formation of liquid consignments at the terminal sections of the chain of liquid goods. The article describes a fuzzy network of CLSC in the form of a hierarchical two-level nested Petri net (NPN), the upper level of which reproduces the process of functioning of the focal company as the central element of the CLSC, and each of the components of the lower level of the network model is an elementary Petri net reflecting the logistic processes at the terminal sections of the CLSC production of raw materials and sale of finished products. This article also gives a description of the procedure for creating a fuzzy network model for representing information about business processes that take place during the functioning of the CLSC, taking into account the existing time and resource constraints, in the form of a NPN, which is expanded by introducing fuzzy and temporal statements. Special methods of automated decision- making on the sustainable functioning of CLSCs are described and justified in terms of making a choice on the transport mode and optimal routing.  Based on the developed methodological tools, the process of forming and providing the stable functioning of the CLSC for typical food products of the grocery group, namely dried fruits, is considered.</jats:p>"

Paradoxically, while farmers in the countryside suffer from poverty due to the low profitability of the agricultural activity, inhabitants at urban centers pay high prices for fresh and nutritious foods. In this work, we propose a supply chain system and a business model based on food hubs located on existing (and often abandoned) public facilities in the central region of Colombia. There are many examples in which the hub strategy has facilitated trade and logistics in supply chains. However, few studies consider the particularities of the presented case. We study a business strategy through a mathematical model which considers both the sustainable and efficient operation of the food hubs and better trading conditions for farmers. We propose a variant of the competitive hub location problem adapted to this case study. We tested the model under different scenarios such as changes in the attractiveness parameters, operation costs, and profit margins. The results suggest that if hubs are able to attract farmers, the model can be both sustainable for the hub concessionaires and for the farmers.</jats:p>"

Moreover, sustainable development issues are correlated and can meet in agricultural supply chains. For several decades, parallel to decision-makers, the research community has elaborated sustainability assessment tools. Such tools evolved to fit with actuality, but it is challenging to find decision-making support tools for sustainable development adequate in agricultural supply chains and developing countries contexts. There is a necessity to define evidence-based tools and exhaustive analytical frameworks according to sustainability multidimensionality and strategical tradeoffs necessity.

It provides evidence-based analytical results allowing to identify enablers for strategic sustainable and inclusive interventions.

The purpose of the article is to determine the main logistics decisions, which have to be made by enterprises in order to improve the efficiency of the functioning of energy supply chains. To achieve this goal, the following general scientific methods are used: analysis, synthesis, systematization, theoretical generalization, abstraction and analogy. The article considers such logistics solutions in the energy supply of enterprises as: planning the amount for energy services need, the choice of the energy consumption alternative, the alternative «make or buy», and the choice of supplier. The characteristics of each of these logistic solutions are given and alternatives for their adoption are considered. The factors that should be taken into account when planning the needs of enterprises in energy services are summarized. It is determined what initial data should be considered at planning of the need, and also methods which can be applied. Four variants of consumption of energy services with centralized energy supply are identified. It is proved that the priority type of energy for consumers is electricity. It is proved that the priority type for consumers is electric energy, the factors influencing the choice of the energy supply option are determined. The managerial alternative «make or buy» in the energy supply of enterprises is characterized. The advantages and disadvantages of own productions of energy services are determined. A sequence of ten stages in choosing the option of own production of energy services is developed by the author. The factors influencing the choice of energy service provider for enterprises are summarized. The scheme for selecting process an energy service provider is proposed, which includes nine stages and allows managers to make an optimal logistic decision</jats:p>"

The first phase (November 1860 to end June 1862) was characterised by a complacency in the trade, which expected neither a civil war nor a cotton scarcity. The Confederacy’s King Cotton strategy and its failure are examined, as well as British public opinion and British government policy. During the second phase (July 1862 to end August 1864), the full scale of the catastrophe was belatedly recognised and prices soared. Cotton speculation in the Liverpool market became endemic. A price collapse in September 1864 marked the end of the phase. Thereafter, confusion was widespread and prices oscillated violently, as did speculation. This third phase arguably lasted until 1876. The chapter concludes that the civil war period in Liverpool can best be seen as an extended series of bets on whether a war would start and how long it would last.</p>",

Although there are reported works on solving approaches for the relaxed 3L-CVRP that consider product rotation to optimize load capacity, rotation on the three axes has not been thoroughly studied. In this aspect, the present work explicitly explores the three-axes rotation and its impact on load capacity optimization. In order to improve the relaxed 3L-CVRP problem, a two-phase solution was developed. The first phase consists of finding the solution for the CVRP problem, using a demand previously obtained with a heuristic developed to convert the 3L-CVRP demand into CVRP demand. The second phase is to obtain the loading of the vehicle using a heuristic developed to load the items using rules to obtain the rotation of the items. The proposed approach was able to improve the load assignment in 48.1% of well-known 3L-CVRP instances when compared to similar approaches on the relaxed 3L-CVRP. The outcomes of this research can be applied to transportation problems where package rotation on the z-axis is an option, and there are not fragile items to load in the vehicles.</jats:p>"

The study evaluates the hydraulic analysis of water supply distribution network using water GEMS v8i. which used for modeling and Simulation of hydraulic parameters in the distribution networks. The hydraulic parameters which analyzed by using this software were junction pressure, velocity of water in networking system, and nodal demands and the overall result of water supply did not satisfied demand. The water distribution system has been analyzed for steady state and extended period simulation for the present population scenario for intermittent water supply using water Gems v8i. About 14 percent of the total number of nodes analyzed had negative pressures while 68 percent of the nodes had pressures less than the adopted pressure for the analysis. These negative pressures indicate that there is inadequate head within the distribution network for water conveyance to all the sections. In the same manner 85.6 percent of flow velocities in the pipes were within the adopted velocity while around 14.4 percent of the velocities exceeded the adopted velocity. The results in this study revealed that the performance of the water distribution system of under current demand is inefficient.\n                        </jats:p>"

With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs)—certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies—most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.</jats:p>",

The weak links in the health supply chains are hindering the access of essential healthcare resulting in inefficient use of scarce resources and loss of lives. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and demand forecasting is one of the weakest links of health supply chains. Also, many of the existing bottlenecks in supply chains and health systems impede the accurate forecasting of demand, and without the ability to forecast demand with certainty, the stakeholders cannot plan and make commitments for the future. Forecasts are an important feeder for budgeting and logistics planning. Under this backdrop, the study examines how improved forecasting can lead to better short-term and long-term access to health commodities and outlines market-related risks. It explores further how incentives are misaligned creating an uneven distribution of risks, leading to the inability to match demand and supply. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was performed, analyzing 71 articles from a descriptive and content approach. Findings indicate the emerging trends in global health and the consequences of inaccurate demand forecasting for health supply chains. The content analysis identifies key factors that can pose a varying degree of risks for the health supply chain stakeholders. The study highlights how the key factors emerge as enablers and blockers, depending on the impact on the overall health supply chains. The study also provides recommendations for actions for reducing these risks. Consequently, limitations of this work are presented, and opportunities are identified for future lines of research. Finally, the conclusion confirms that by adopting a combination of approaches, stakeholders can ensure better information sharing, identify avenues of diversifying risks, and understand the implications.</jats:p>"

These studies focus on both supply side factors that concern the traits of populist actors and demand side factors in the form of characteristics of the supporters. However, we still lack a solid understanding of how these supply and demand side factors interact to explain the support of populist leaders. We contribute to this literature by examining the interplay of two central supply side factors, people-centeredness and anti-immigration policies, and two demand side factors, political dissatisfaction and generational differences, in determining populist support. We test these explanations by leveraging a choice-based conjoint analysis embedded in a representative sample of the Finnish population (n=1030). The results show that while people-centeredness enhance the favourability of prospective political leaders among the general population, only anti-immigration policies appeal to the politically dissatisfied. In contrast to recent studies, we find no evidence that populist leader traits would be more favoured by younger generations. These results indicate that the interplay between supply and demand may well be more intricate than what previous studies suggest.</p>"

After 9 months, hyphae and associated soil was picked from static (mycorrhizal) and rotating (severed hyphae) mesh cores and corresponding rhizosphere soil was sampled for bacterial analysis. AM symbiosis increased uptake of<jats:sup>34</jats:sup>S from organo-<jats:sup>34</jats:sup>S enriched soil at early stages of plant growth when S demand appeared to be high. The static (mycorrhizal) treatments were shown to harbour larger populations of cultivable heterotrophs and sulfonate mobilising bacteria. Microbial communities were significantly different in the hyphosphere of mycorrhizal hyphae and hyphae not associated to plant hosts. Sulfate ester (arylsulfatase enzyme assay,<jats:italic>atsA</jats:italic>gene) and sulfonate mobilising activity (<jats:italic>asfA</jats:italic>gene) was altered by an intact AM symbiotic partnership which stimulated the genera<jats:italic>Azospirillum, Burkholderia</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Polaromonas</jats:italic>. Illumina sequencing revealed that AM symbiosis led to community shifts, reduced diversity and dominance of the Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria. This study demonstrated that AM symbioses can promote organo-S mobilization and plant uptake through interaction with hyphospheric bacteria.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Research highlights</jats:title><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>AM hyphae enhanced uptake of organically bound<jats:sup>34</jats:sup>S at early stages of growth.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>AM hyphosphere harboured a large population of organo-S desulfurizing bacteria.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Microbial communities significantly differed in rotating and static mesh cores.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>AM hyphae influenced bacterial sulfate ester and sulfonate mobilising activity.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>AM hyphae reduced bacterial diversity, increased Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria abundance.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:sec>"

Instead, they have the indirect objective of reducing emissions. They provide poor future price information. And they have high transaction costs for implementation, requiring treaties and laws. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel double-sided auction mechanism of emissions permits and sequestration contracts tied to temperature. This mechanism constrains warming for many (e.g., 150) years into the future and every auction would provide price information for this time range. In addition, this paper proposes a set of market rules and a bottom-up implementation path. A coalition of businesses begin implementation with jurisdictions joining as they are ready. The combination of the selected market rules and the proposed implementation path appear to incentivize participation. This design appears to be closer to “first best” with a lower cost of mitigation than any in the literature, while increasing the certainty of avoiding catastrophic warming. This design should also have a faster pathway to implementation. A numerical simulation shows surprising results, e.g., that static prices are wrong, prices should evolve over time in a way that contradicts other recent proposals, and “global warming potential” as used in existing ETSs is generally erroneous.</jats:p>"

The geo-electrical results were to unearth the lithology of the study area; it was found to be underlain with varying geology of both Precambrian and Paleozoic sedimentary formation. These formations consist of phyllite, schist, granite, meta-sediments, and meta-volcanics making up the Precambrian and sandstone, shale, siltstone, mudstones, granitiods also, of the Paleozoic sedimentary. Areas of low resistivity were targeted for drilling per the geophysical results of the profile, values between 24 and 100 ohm.m were zones of probable groundwater occurrence in the study. The groundwater storage capacity and the extractable storage capacity were estimated to be approximately 710,000 km3 and 290,000 km3. The pumping test results acquired from 81 boreholes from the study were used to analyze the sustainability. However, groundwater depth was studied using the Static water level (SWL), areas of SWL around 22 m and 25 m are likely to have a shallow depth whereas areas of 17 m would have deeper groundwater depth.</jats:p>",

This study developed Machine Learning (ML) models to detect leaks in the WDN. Water pressure data under leaking versus non-leaking conditions were generated with holistic WSN simulation code EPANET considering factors such as the fluctuating user demands, data noise, and the extent of leaks, etc. The results indicate that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a supervised ML model, can accurately classify leaking versus non-leaking conditions; it, however, requires balanced dataset under both leaking and non-leaking conditions, which is difficult for a real WSN that mostly operate under normal service condition. Autoencoder neural network (AE), an unsupervised ML model, is further developed to detect leak with unbalanced data. The results show AE ML model achieved high accuracy when leaks occur in pipes inside the sensor monitoring area, while the accuracy is compromised otherwise. This observation will provide guidelines to deploy monitoring sensors to cover the desired monitoring area. A novel strategy is proposed based on multiple independent detection attempts to further increase the reliability of leak detection by the AE and is found to significantly reduce the probability of false alarm. The trained AE model and leak detection strategy is further tested on a testbed WSN and achieved promising results. The ML model and leak detection strategy can be readily deployed for in-service WSNs using data obtained with internet-of-things (IoTs) technologies such as smart meters.</jats:p>"

When viewing the situation on labour markets, not only quantitative changes in the total population size are significant, but also changes in the population categorised by economic age groups. International research indicates that the population size is decreasing. These processes translate into labour markets experiencing deficiencies in labour force. To counteract and minimise these undesirable conditions, continuous monitoring and diagnosis of the status of labour resources is required. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of demographic changes in labour supply based on the example of the Lithuanian and Polish labour markets and to redefine the groups of people forming unused labour resources. To this end, both secondary and primary data were used. The former were derived from statistical reports originating from the analysed countries, while the latter were obtained from the author’s own studies carried out among 200 respondents classified as unused labour resources. The research found that in the labour markets of both studied countries, very significant changes have occurred and will continue to occur, which may lead to the reduction in the productive-age population and to the increase in the post-productive-age population. The research has been carried out based on the systematic literature review methodology, which included theoretical and empirical research publications from 2000-2019, a diagnostic survey conducted among people classified as unused labour resources, as well as methods of descriptive statistics and induction. The literature review has demonstrated a shortage of studies on the subject of research, which makes the content of the paper a partial answer to the existing knowledge gap.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Safe drinking water is among the most important environmental as well as health challenges facing Egypt. Groundwater from the aquifer of the Nile valley in Upper Egypt accounts for about 40% of the overall source of drinking water. Nearly, all rural residents rely on groundwater as the source of drinking water. Irrigation water is the main source of groundwater recharge in Nile Valley. Moreover, nitrate fertilizer utilization in Egypt has risen significantly due to the requirement for further agricultural production. Nitrate levels higher than the permissible limit (45 mg/L) for drinking water have been related to health issues. To determine the effect of agrochemical nitrate on the health of pumping water, municipal water wellfields established in Upper Egypt have been examined. Pumped water from those municipal wells (60 m depth and 2000 m3/day gross pumping rate) was evaluated from 2000 to 2018 to accomplish this objective. Monthly analysis of the quality of groundwater, in particular nitrate, has been conducted. Sulfate and nitrate concentrations as well as other consistency metrics were assessed. Water sampling findings show that the water already comes under the drinking-water limits. Nevertheless, increased nitrate and sulfate values are found beyond naturally existing levels in the aquifer. Consequently, to determine the possible future likelihood of nitrate contamination in such municipal wells, the trendline of nitrate level has been used. The observations suggest that the intensive utilization of nitrogen fertilizer in Upper Egypt in the last 30 years would endanger the quality of the groundwater supply. Resultantly, the usage of nitrogen fertilizers in Upper Egypt must be regulated and continuous groundwater monitoring must be implemented.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the effects on coordination mechanisms in vertically cooperating agri-food networks that result from the implementation of different blockchain technology platform types (BCTPT). The research is based on an extensive literature overview and exploratory use cases of BCTPT implementations in the agri-food industry which are presented to illustrate the applicability of the findings. Our analysis shows that BCTPT predominantly differentiate through the coordination mechanisms exerting of power, information sharing, decision-making, and collective learning benefits. We also reveal that blockchain use cases with high success rates typically operate in a vertical ecosystem where a focal firm assumes the responsibility for coordinating the activities in the supply chain network. These use cases are typically operationalized in tracking and tracing applications as well as in provenance-based information provision, which either operate in vertically coordinated private blockchain or consortium-type blockchain platforms. We conclude that the choice of a specific BCTPT with its respective coordination mechanisms is a key determinant of the economic success of the intended use case, the efficient management of the supply chain network, and eventually for the chosen digital business model. This paper will close a research gap, as the potential impacts of different blockchain technology platform types on digital agri-food business models and its supply chain management have scarcely been researched.</jats:p>"

To achieve this, the study first used the Multinomial Logit Model on Malawi’s Second Integrated Household Survey dataset (IHS2) to predict the occupational distribution and to test for differences in the factors associated with the choice among the three labour outcomes. This helped to identify channels through which gender-responsive fiscal policies can target and enhance FLFP and in turn uplift women’s welfare. The empirical results revealed that when women are poor, residing in rural areas, not married or are heads of households and are least educated, they are more likely to supply casual and/or agricultural labour compared to formal wage labour. Therefore, to enhance women’s welfare through FLFP, gender-sensitive spending programmes should target women with such characteristics. The study further recommended increased gender-sensitive spending on farm credit and inputs, literacy education, girls’ education and public-works programmes. It further encouraged strict adherence to gender budgeting at national and local government level. To finance these proposals the study suggested introducing a levy on alcohol and tobacco the revenue of which should strictly be used to empower girls and enhance women’s labour supply.</jats:p>",

The decentralized coordination of associated tasks often results in the duplication of efforts and redundant/incorrect relief items supplies into single disaster regions, having negative impacts on the most vulnerable ones. This paper devotes attention to the challenges that exist in the coordination of procurement activities in relief supply chains and asks for improvement approaches to facilitate more efficient demand satisfaction in disaster situations. Therefore, the authors apply multiple case study research including expert interviews with procurement agents and heads of logistics from international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), humanitarian start-ups and military logistics centers. Results indicate that a lack of incentives to cooperate, poor communication, unclear division of competences and noncompliance to standards and regulations constitute substantial challenges in procurement coordination. Moreover, expert interview results show that social media integration, procurement flexibility, cluster and collaborative coordination have potential to support improving the coordination of NGOs’ procurement activities. By presenting several theoretical propositions, this paper complements already existing literature and provides a reference point for future research. Practitioners can benefit from findings as they are provided with a guide that allows redesigning certain processes in procurement coordination.</jats:p>"

This especially applies to very important components of district heating systems – heating water boilers. Unsatisfactory condition of boilers is mainly due to the obsolescence of basic equipment, including boilers. The operating time of them exceeds the passport lifetime. There ia a lack of modern automation, especially in terms of controlling operating modes. Nominal power of them exceeds the real heat loads. The range of hot water boilers used is not large. These are low-power boilers of the series NDIST, \"Universal\", \"Energiia\", \"Fakel\" and others, medium-power boilers of the series TVG and KVG and high-power boilers of series PTVM and KVGM. According to their prevalence, special attention should be paid to boilers of the series TVG and KVG. The series are installed on quarter boiler houses. The boilers of these series have an efficient design of the furnace volume and an optimized design of the convective part. Nevertheless, in terms of automation, gas supply and air supply systems, they no longer meet today's requirements. They are outdated comparing to the achieved level of technical solutions. The article discusses the main shortcomings of the design of boilers: insufficient durability of the gas collector in the hearth burner, small diameter of the pipes of the convective part and the use of fireclay materials in the setting of the burners. The first two shortcomings were overcome by the developers by the increase in the diameter of the pipes of convective packages and the modernization of MPIG-3 hearth burners. The third shortcoming should be overcomed by replacing the setting with a modern one during off-season repairs. Reserves for improving the energy efficiency of boilers of these series are found. To do this, it is necessary to install additional convective heating surfaces (economizers or air-heaters), replace the setting and equip the boilers with a modern automation system with cascading the burners. It allows improving efficiency up to 94...95 % and environmental performance according to the modern requirements.</jats:p>"

A stochastic method is proposed to calculate the security of supply throughout the networks, taking into account the likelihood of events, operational constraints and dynamic supply and demand. The stochastic method is evaluated on a real gas network case study. The calculated security of supply parameters provide insight into the most critical parts of the network and can be used for future network planning. The capabilities of the coupled hybrid energy network simulation are demonstrated on the real gas network coupled to a simplified electricity network.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the study is to assess the efficiency of cash flow management at power supply companies of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries. A methodological approach to cash flow forecasting with the use of linear and polynomial regression has been developed. The study is based on the data provided by 12 power supply companies operating in CIS member countries. Forecasting based on the generated polynomial models of multiple regression of cash flow for the power supply companies under study confirms the strong possibility of extrapolating the studied trends to future periods. Compared to the linear model, the polynomial one confirms higher values of the determination coefficients for the majority of power supply companies. The projected volumes of cash inflow, cash outflow, and net cash flows of power supply companies with the application of the described polynomial multiple regression models have a fairly high degree of approximation. The correlations between operating cash flows and outflows, between total cash inflow and outflow of the majority of power supply companies are high. The low level of synchronization between cash inflows and outflows of the companies under study is associated with the specifics of their financial and investment activities and the cash flow management policy. It has been proven that energy enterprises’ financial stability significantly depends on the synchronization and uniformity of cash flows. The proposed methodological approach allows identifying enterprises by the criterion of riskiness from the standpoint of the synchronization and homogeneity of their cash flows.</jats:p>"

Here we identify a thalamus-derived factor, VGF, which is indispensable for thalamocortical axons to maintain the proper amount of layer 4 neurons in the mouse sensory cortices. This process is prerequisite for further maturation of the primary somatosensory area, such as barrel field formation instructed by a neuronal activity-dependent mechanism. Our results also provide an insight into regionalization of brain in that highly site-specific axon projection anterogradely confers further regional complexity upon the target field through locally secreting signaling molecules from axon terminals.</jats:p>"

The system uses STM32 as the control core, it is divided into main controller, autotransformer module, rectifier bridge module, PFC module, inverter module, booster module, battery pack, current and voltage detection module. When the utility power is connected, it supplies power to the inverter module and if it is disconnected, the main control terminal allows the battery to supply power to the inverter module in time, thereby realizing online uninterrupted power supply. Experimental results show that this system can supply power to the load without interruption, and has a good load regulation rate and voltage regulation rate.</jats:p>",

(2016) seven-point scoring framework, the relationships between biomass supply for bioenergy and the SDGs were evaluated based on existing synthesis papers, modeling studies and empirical analyses, and expert knowledge. To complement this, contributions to SDG targets of 37 best practice case studies from around the world were documented. In reviewing these case studies, it was found that when supply chains are implemented appropriately and integrated with existing systems, they can have overwhelmingly positive contributions. Beyond directly contributing to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), at least half of all case studies supported progress toward SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption); however, the ways in which supply chains contributed often differed. Agricultural biomass supply chains (energy crops and residues) were most likely to contribute to SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), while waste and forest supply chains were most likely to contribute to SDG 15 (Life on Land). The development of bioenergy systems in rural and indigenous communities also indirectly supports societal SDGs such as SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Inequality), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). This work informs how SDGs can be used as a normative framework to guide the implementation of sustainable biomass supply chains, whether it is used for bioenergy or the broader bioeconomy. Recommendations for key stakeholders and topics for future work are also proposed.</jats:p>"

Worn-out tires are either buried or burned, both of which harm the environment through polluting the air and groundwater. Companies need to consider their social responsibility, such as employment and regional development, and the environmental impact of their activities when making strategic and operational decisions. This study addresses the closed-loop supply chain network design (SCND) and operations planning problem with regard to the three dimensions of sustainability using a mathematical programming approach. The options of retreading, recycling, and energy recovery together with the use of green technologies are considered to minimize the environmental impacts. The proposed decision model can help supply chain managers in tire manufacturing industry make better-informed decisions in order to achieve the three-fold objectives of sustainability. The developed mathematical model turns out to be a multi-objective, multi-echelon, and multi-product mixed integer linear programming. The model is solved using the Lp-metric method and CPLEX solver. The scenario approach is used to address the uncertainty in demand of new products and the rate of return of worn-out tires. The model solutions are the optimal location of the facilities considering population density and unemployment rate in addition to economic dimension, the optimal amount of allocation, the flow of materials, and the best green technology selection. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to validate the model and test the robustness of the obtained solutions. Finally, managerial implications are provided.</jats:p>"

Therefore, accurate predictions of infiltration characteristics are required to understand the behavior of the subsurface flow of water through the soil surface. The aim of the current study is to simulate and improve the prediction accuracy of the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of soil using regression tree methods. Experimental data recorded with a double ring infiltrometer for 17 different sites are used in this study. Three regression tree methods: random tree, random forest (RF) and M5 tree, are employed to model the infiltration characteristics using basic soil characteristics. The performance of the modelling approaches is compared in predicting the infiltration rate as well as cumulative infiltration, and the obtained results suggest that the performance of the RF model is better than the other applied models with coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.97 and 0.97, root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.10 and 6.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) = 5.74 and 4.44 for infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration respectively. The RF model is used to represent the infiltration characteristics of the study area. Moreover, parametric sensitivity is adopted to study the significance of each input parameter in estimating the infiltration process. The results suggest that time (t) is the most influencing parameter in predicting the infiltration process using this data set.</jats:p>",

Among different abatement technologies, also the use of LNG as maritime fuel is one option. Hence, the number of LNG-fueled vessels plying in North Sea and Baltic Sea is growing, so ports have to cope with the increasing demand for LNG. Until now, German ports have been a little bit delayed in the installation of LNG infrastructure. Currently, a new LNG-terminal at Brunsbüttel, the western entrance to the Kiel Canal, is under construction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The distribution of LNG from the new LNG-hub to the other German ports can be modelled as an Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) that is usually solved by combinatorial optimization methods. This paper investigates the research question, how the distribution can be modeled as an IRP, which distribution mode is the most economic for the German ports and which modal mix for the LNG supply leads to the greenest distribution. The results of this paper are empirically validated by data that were collected in several EU-projects on sustainable supply chain management and green logistics.</jats:p>",

Manufacturing activities in residential areas of the urban environment and the associated generation of municipal production waste (MPW) are serious problems. The primary goal of this study is to design smart supply chain (SSC) scenarios for the shipment of MPW from a city MFM cluster under uncertainty. This paper presents a new model of the finite MPW generation capacity for a city MFM cluster on the basis of an analysis of its finite production capacity using the material flow analysis (MFA) methodology. The proposed model allows us to determine the number of transport fleet units needed for the implementation of various supply chain (SC) scenarios of MPW. To select the best scenario for MPW shipment in real time, the application of SSC and SSC management (SSCM) technologies is proposed. SSCM performance indicators are proposed which allow us to evaluate the efficiency of using vehicles for cluster MPW transportation. The numerical values of the SSCM performance indicators for various options regarding the handling of city MFM buildings using trucks are obtained. These evaluations form the basis for the decision-making and planning associated with the SSCs of MPW.</jats:p>"

Batch experiments were carried out to study the effect of various parameters affecting the biosorption such as pH (2–10), biosorbent dose (0.05 g/L to 0.35 g/L), contact time (10–80 min) and initial fluoride concentration (0.001–0.006 g/L) for the biosorption of fluoride at room temperature. The maximum removal of fluoride was found at pH 6, biosorbent dose 0.3 g and contact time 60 min. Physicochemical characterization studies revealed the suitable morphology and chemical functional groups present on the biosorbent. Isothermal data agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model with R2 value 0.976 and KL 0.1. The biosorption interface of fluoride onto Tamarindus indica activated seed coat obeyed the pseudo-second-order rate equation with R2 0.976. The present study demonstrates that Tamarindus indica activated seed coat can effectively remediate fluoride-contaminated water.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the lack of adequate preparations and proper coping against them causes nations to suffer heavy losses and casualties, which are sometimes irrecoverable. Consequently, as an essential activity in crisis management, humanitarian relief logistics has been of particular importance and has taken a good deal of notice at the international level during recent years. Aid facilities location and the storage of necessary commodities before a disaster and the proper distribution of relief commodities among demand points following a disaster are critical logistical strategies to improve performance and reduce latency when responding to a given disaster. In this regard, this study presents a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model in a two-level network that includes warehouses and affected areas. The model aims at minimizing total social costs, which include the expense of founding warehouses, the expense of procuring commodities, and deprivation cost, as well as maximizing fulfilled demands and warehouses utility. In this study, several pre-disaster periods, a limited budget for establishing warehouses and procuring relief commodities with their gradual injection into the system, the time value of money, various criteria for evaluating warehouses, the risk of disruption in warehouses and transportation networks, and heterogeneous warehouses are considered. The maximization of warehouses utility is done according to a data envelopment analysis model. Moreover, a multi-objective fuzzy programming model called the weighted max-min model is applied to solve the proposed model. Ultimately, the outcomes of the evaluation and validation of the proposed model show its appropriate and efficient performance.</jats:p>"

The magnitude of this climate variability changes with variation in location. Rajasthan comes under the arid and semi-arid zone of India in which monsoon is a principal element of water resource. Due to erratic and scanty rainfall in this zone, agriculture is totally dependent on the monsoon. The objective of the present study is to assess the meteorological drought characteristics using Drought Indices Calculator DrinC from the historical rainfall records of the Barmer District of Rajasthan State by employing the criterion of percentage departure (D%), rainfall anomaly index (RAI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI). Trend analysis of seasonal and extreme annual monthly rainfall was carried out for the Barmer District of Rajasthan State using the data period between 1901 and 2002 at the 5% level of significance. Sen's slope estimator was also applied to identify the trend. Temporal analysis is useful to predict and identify the possible drought severity and its duration in the study region. It also helps in understanding its effect on groundwater recharge and increasing the risk of water shortage. Trend analysis of rainfall over 102 years shows an increasing trend in pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, southwest monsoon and annual rainfall and a decreasing trend in winter rainfall. Through this study, policy makers and local administrators will be benefitted, which will help them in taking proactive drought relief decisions in the drought-hit regions.</jats:p>",

The case study findings clearly highlight why and how multi-tier apparel supply chains fail to implement social standards effectively. As a consequence of substantial goal conflicts and information asymmetries, sourcing agents and suppliers are driven to perform opportunistic behaviors in form of hidden characteristics, hidden intentions, and hidden actions, which significantly harm social standards. Fashion retailers need to empower their corporate social responsibility (CSR) departments by awarding an integrative role to sourcing decisions. Moreover, accurate calculation of orders, risk sharing, cost sharing, price premiums, and especially guaranteed order continuity for social compliance are critical to reduce opportunistic behaviors upstream of the supply chain. The development of social standards is highly suggested, e.g., by including novel metrics such as the assessment of buying practices or the evaluation of capacity planning at factories and the strict inclusion of subcontractors’ social performances. This paper presents evidence from multiple Vietnamese and Indonesian cases involving sourcing agents as well as Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers on a highly sensitive topic. With the development of the conceptual framework and the formulation of seven related novel propositions, this paper unveils the ineffectiveness of social standards, offers guidance for practitioners, and contributes to the neglected social dimension in sustainable supply chain management research and accountability literature.</jats:p>"

The dependencies of breakthrough curves on these parameters were confirmed from the data obtained. Modeling of data was done. Thomas, Yoon–Nelson and Adams–Bohart models were applied to experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves. These kinetic models were helpful to determine the characteristic parameters of column designing for defluoridation on a large scale. Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were found to be more suitable for the description of the breakthrough curve than the Adams–Bohart model in the present study.

Achieving the goal of improving uninterrupted power supply for the operation of electrical installations of the mining complex is ensured by solving the problem of reducing the time of disconnection of damaged areas and transient processes. For this, an algorithm has been developed that uses a set of signs of emergency situations: values of voltages, currents, states of relay protection actuators and automation. In addition, the integration of automatic power supply control and relay protection based on the concept of smart power supply networks of a mining enterprise has been proposed. A sign of identification of the type of emergency mode was by the level of voltage reduction on the buses of the switchgear, control of the actuation of relay protection devices that disconnect equipment in emergency mode, autoreclosing, underfrequency load shedding, automatic reserve entry. MATLAB/Simulink simulated the operation of electrical equipment of the power supply system in accordance with the known method of relay protection and automation, as well as using the proposed algorithm for identifying emergency modes and restoring voltage after disconnection of the damaged area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development and improvement of solar equipment is a necessary step in the development of solar heating systems. One of the ways to develop solar air heaters is to use new materials for the production of solar absorbers. This expands the possibility of using nozzle and capillary-porous materials in contrast to liquid solar collectors. Development and research of air heating systems with equipment made of modern textile materials is relevant. For the manufacture of absorbers it is advisable to use textile materials. This will reduce the cost of solar collectors, as well as reduce their weight and capital costs. The absorber meets requirements for both solar thermal collectors and electric heaters: high absorption capacity of solar radiation; developed heat transfer surface; relevant physical properties: low mass, resistance to ultraviolet radiation, thermal resistance, low cost for cheaper solar system; sufficient electrical resistance. A combined solar-electric air heater has been developed, which combines two main elements of any solar system – a solar heat collector and an additional heat source, the absorber of which is made of carbon graphite knitted fabric. This reduces its cost and mass and allows them to be used on existing heating facilities without the construction of bulky supporting structures to accommodate solar fields. The combined solar-electric air heater can be used as an independent heat generator for heat supply systems. To use the proposed solar-electric air heater, it is necessary to heat its absorber with an electric current, so the material from which it is made must be electrically conductive, but have sufficient electrical resistance. The use of carbon-graphite knitted fabric allows the use the direct heating of the solar energy absorber by electric current due to the corresponding electrical characteristics. This article presents the results of an experimental study of the electrical resistivity of carbon-graphite knitted fabric. These studies allow determining the electrical power of the device regardless of the size of the device. The research results presented in the article can be used only for a certain type of carbon graphite knitted fabric.</jats:p>"

In our experiments the increase of money supply and the decrease of interest rates had a direct positive impact on share prices. These findings support the hypothesis that extreme expansive monetary policy with low, zero or negative interest rates encourage financial bubbles on the stock market. To avoid a crash the exit from such a policy must be slow. As happened in 1929, crashes can damage the financial system and the real economy.

However, the reality of globalization, while providing many benefits, has resulted in a world where organizations no longer fully control -- and often do not have full visibility into -- the supply ecosystems of the products that they make or the services that they deliver. With more and more businesses becoming digital, producing digital products and services, and moving their workloads to the cloud, the impact of a cybersecurity event today is greater than ever before and could include personal data loss, significant financial losses, compromise of product integrity or safety, and even loss of life. Organizations can no longer protect themselves by simply securing their own infrastructures since their electronic perimeter is no longer meaningful; threat actors intentionally target the suppliers of more cyber-mature organizations to take advantage of the weakest link. That is why identifying, assessing, and mitigating cyber supply chain risks is a critical capability to ensure business resilience. The multidisciplinary approach to managing these types of risks is called Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM). This document provides the ever- increasing community of digital businesses a set of Key Practices that any organization can use to manage cybersecurity risks associated with their supply chains. The Key Practices presented in this document can be used to implement a robust C-SCRM function at an organization of any size, scope, and complexity. These practices combine the information contained in existing C-SCRM government and industry resources with the information gathered during the 2015 and 2019 NIST research initiatives.</jats:p>"

Few studies were found on the inter-relationships between supply chain management practices, environmental sustainability, and firm financial performance. Moreover, manufacturing companies are compelled by different pressure groups across the globe to maintain environmental standards while conducting their business and supply chain activities. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the impact of supply chain practices on environmental sustainability and financial performance. In addition, the role of environmental sustainability as a mediator between supply chain management and financial performance was analyzed to improve sustainable development. A well-designed questionnaire was administered to manufacturing companies in Jordan for data collection. A total of 376 responses were analyzed and the proposed hypotheses were tested by using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach. The results reveal that environmental sustainability was tested significantly and influenced by supply chain practices such as relationship with customers, postponement, level of information sharing, and information quality. Whereas environmental sustainability had a significant direct effect on financial performance. Finally, environmental sustainability mediated the relationship of all supply chain management practices with financial performance except strategic supplier partnership dimension. The study provides policy guidelines to decision makers while simultaneously assists the managers to improve sustainability practices in manufacturing companies.</jats:p>"

Simulation of the air exchange organization in an exhibition hall in International Exhibition Centre in Kyiv with ventilation at a constant air volume (CAV) has been performed. The floor area is 5258 m2, the height is 19 m, the minimum outdoor air flow is 21.667 m3/s (78000 m3/h). The current design scheme of air exchange organization is zonal. General air exchange is 43.3333 m3/s (156000 m3/h). Recirculation is accepted 50 %. The air flow supplied in the upper and middle zones is, respectively, 22.5 m3/s (81000 m3/h) and 20.833 m3/s (75000 m3/h). Inlet air has temperature 291.65 K (18.5 °C). It is supplied downward by twisted jets. There are 65 Trox VDL-AHLD-E3/800/0/0/0/RAL 9010 air diffusers with a diameter of 800 mm. The proposed scheme is single-zonal using 24 diffusers PES-D-8-10/15-0,9 4 m above the floor and air removal from the upper zone. This scheme allows halving the air exchange to the minimum outdoor air without recirculation. The air temperature should be decreased by 3.3 K to 288.35 K (15.2 °С). The number of air-conditioners is decreased twice. The calculated consumption of cold decreased by 65.58 W/m2 or 29 %, the calculated consumption of heat for the second heating – by 7.17 W/m2 or 18 %. Saving of capital investments in prices of February 2020 is 792.16 UAH/m2 or 55 %, and decrease of operating costs for the cooling period is 6.61 UAH/m2 or 15 %. Thus, the system is economically beneficial from the beginning of its installation. In the future, its operation will be simulated in a mode with a variable flow rate.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, alongside industrialized agriculture and food-supply systems, an alternative, network-based framework has evolved supporting local development, social innovation and sustainability objectives. Short supply chains are in the focus of the new era. At the same time, from the 1990s a new, bottom-up, spatially bound rural development method, the Liaison Entre Actions pour le Development de l’Economie Rurale (LEADER) approach, has arisen. The purpose of this study is to examine the involvement of LEADER local action groups in the management of alternative food systems in Europe. After a literature-based, detailed theoretical review, a quantitative analysis concerning the content of the official websites of action groups was conducted. A local product promoting quantitative index was created from the qualitative characteristics of the sites. From the collected data, using basic statistical analysis and thematic mapping connections were searched between local action group general characteristics and their short supply chain support activities. The results indicate notable national differences between Western and Eastern European and Mediterranean LEADER groups, supporting previous literature. It may be concluded that local action groups as potential hubs of social innovation, can be crucial actors in local foodscapes, mainly in less developed areas where other non-profit or for-profit organizations are unable to manage supply chains.</jats:p>"

The targeted population of this study was comprised of 499 manufacturing companies which are all located in Nairobi and its environs. In order to come up with a representative sample, stratified random sampling method was used since the population is heterogeneous. The stratified technique ensured that each sector in the target population has an equal chance of being selected. There were 217 respondents sampled from the 499 manufacturing firms out of 217,180 respondents returned the questionnaires for analysis. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires which were tested for validity and reliability using 10% of the total sample respondents. Quantitative data was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics and with the help of SPSS version 23 while qualitative data was analyzed descriptively. Linear and multiple regression models were used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The information was presented using tables, charts, frequencies, percentages and graphs.&#x0D;\nFindings: The study established that there exists a positive influence of customer relations management on performance management of manufacturing firms in Kenya at 5% level of significant (β=0.595, P&lt;0.05). This indicates that as customer relationship management increases to certain level then performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya also increases significantly and vice-versa&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that the government of Kenya should create awareness of their policies through training of the key stakeholders for this organization. Customer relationship management requires to improve on quality production and lead time, manufacturing firms must also improve their customer relationship management. Since the quality of the products has not significantly improved for the last 5 years, more strategies must be put in place to incorporate technology which will aid to improve the quality and also maintain required lead time in these organizations. The study was guided by Social Exchange Theory which was beneficial in explaining the influence of customer relationship management and performance of manufacturing firms.</jats:p>"

Herein, an age-structured model of COVID-19 spread in South Korea is parameterized to understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. The model determines optimal vaccine allocation for minimizing infections, deaths, and years of life lost while accounting for population factors, such as country-specific age distribution and contact structure, and various levels of vaccine efficacy. A transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized in adults aged 20–49 years and those older than 50 years to minimize the cumulative incidence and mortality, respectively. A strategy to minimize years of life lost involves the vaccination of adults aged 40–69 years, reflecting the relatively high case-fatality rates and years of life lost in this age group. An incidence-minimizing vaccination strategy is highly sensitive to vaccine efficacy, and vaccines with lower efficacy should be administered to teenagers and adults aged 50–59 years. Consideration of age-specific contact rates and vaccine efficacy is critical to optimize vaccine allocation. New recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines under consideration by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are mainly based on a mortality-minimizing allocation strategy.</jats:p>"

For instance, applying new-generation digitalized technologies in the Dairy Supply Chain (DSC) enables an increase of manufacturing productivity, improves planning and forecasting, and also enhances competitive capabilities according to Industry 4.0 assumptions. It is worth mentioning, that in modern DSC, high visibility of raw materials, components, products, and processes by all contributors on all stages of DSC is crucial. This article focuses on the transparency aspect of the DSC supported by IoT-based technologies enabling interoperability among all DSC participants. The paper addresses the problem of effective integration of heterogeneous data sources, i.e., deployed new technological IoT solutions with traditional SCM systems and a third-party software component. The main objective of this report is to propose the IoT-based DSC model comprising four chain stages: milk production, milk transportation, milk processing, and dairy products distribution. Moreover, the comprehensive DSC domain ontology as a knowledge model is formulated and described. The ontology aims on improvement of the DSC management efficiency by facilitating interoperability within DSC. The applicability of the proposed ontological model is verified using a sustainable-oriented case study, which estimates the environmental footprint at the milk transportation stage of the DSC.</jats:p>"

This is primarily due to insufficient availability of empirical data on large-scale networks. To addresses this gap in the literature, we investigate the relationship between embeddedness patterns of individual firms in a supply network and their performance using empirical data from the automotive industry. In this study, we devise three measures that characterize the embeddedness of individual firms in a supply network. These are namely: centrality, tier position, and triads. Our findings caution us that centrality impacts individual performance through a diminishing returns relationship. The second measure, tier position, allows us to investigate the concept of tiers in supply networks because we find that as networks emerge, the boundaries between tiers become unclear. Performance of suppliers degrade as they move away from the focal firm (i.e., Toyota). The final measure, triads, investigates the effect of buying and selling to firms that supply the same customer, portraying the level of competition and cooperation in a supplier’s network. We find that increased coopetition (i.e., cooperative competition) is a performance enhancer, however, excessive complexity resulting from being involved in both upstream and downstream coopetition results in diminishing performance. These original insights help understand the drivers of firm performance from a network perspective and provide a basis for further research.</jats:p>"

To tackle the policy making challenges, a fuzzy game theoretical model was employed in a centralized and decentralized SC setting. The results revealed that SCs always achieve a higher expected profit under a decentralized structure, regardless of the type of the governments intervention policy. Also, the government’s policy making success was found to be highly dependent on the channel leadership, market competition, and the SC structure. Our findings suggest that the policy makers’ objectives in reducing environmental pollution and increasing revenue are highly achievable, without risk of losing channel coordination and maximum level of efficiency.</jats:p>"

Therefore, there is need to balance between energy consumption-economic growth and environment duality in energy policy. Conversely, any disruptions in energy supply will lead to destabilize economy, interruption in output and suspend social life in the long term. Accordingly, rising and ennsuring energy security would be helpful for Turkish economy. In this frame we assesed energy security in line with Cabalu (2010) on the basis of energy intensity, import dependency, domestic production and geopolitical risk indicators. Lastly, we derived a composite security index from them. Results showed that Turkey is vulnerable in terms of fossil fuels due to insufficient domestic production and huge share in the national energy mix. On that note, policy makers can target possible sources of supply disruptions and mitigate their effects by taking measures against risks in energy security.</jats:p>"

One effective intervention to reduce overdose deaths is to distribute the opioid antagonist naloxone directly to persons actively using opioids (ie, “take-home naloxone”), especially at touchpoints with the potential for significant impact such as emergency departments and jails. A number of hospital emergency departments have recently sought to implement individual take-home naloxone programs; however, programmatic success has been inconsistent due primarily to the inability to secure reliable funding for a naloxone supply. In this commentary, we establish the argument for a publicly funded naloxone supply to support take-home naloxone distribution in emergency department settings. We posit that the complex billing and reimbursement system for medication dispensing is impossibly burdensome during emergency care for an acute opioid overdose, and that the mounting death toll from this public health crisis demands a strong commitment to harm reduction. A publicly financed naloxone supply would demonstrate this commitment and make a measurable impact in saving lives. Ultimately, provision of naloxone should be coupled with other comprehensive treatment services and medications for opioid use disorder to meaningfully reduce harms associated with opioid use.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Although there is ample literature that highlights the use of renewable energy, especially solar energy, in mitigating the effects of climate change, empirical evidence linking benefits of renewable energy with educational access and attainment is very limited.  Results: By using school level data between 2013-18 from Pakistan, this paper estimates the effectiveness of the policy regarding power supply to schools through solar energy on enrolment. Using a difference-in-difference estimation and controlling for school-specific and infrastructure-specific characteristics, we show that average enrolment per school in Punjab increased by 48.5 students, compared to average enrolment per school elsewhere in Pakistan, after the policy of installing solar panels at schools in Punjab was announced. Furthermore, gender-wise breakup of results suggest that the policy resulted in increased enrolment for boys’ schools, girls’ school and mixed-gender schools. The results are consistent when standard errors are normal, robust, or clustered at the province level. Policy implications: Limitation of the study includes unidentified mechanisms for the policy effect and heterogeneous effects on gender, which should be the focus of future research.</jats:p>"

Despite cultivation-based methods routinely employed in monitoring drinking water quality, cultivation of specific indicator organisms alone is not always guarantee for assuring safe drinking water delivery. The presence of complex microbiomes in drinking water distribution systems affects treatment effectiveness leading to poor quality water which as a result affects health of human and animals. Drinking water treatment and distribution systems harbor various microbiota despite efforts made in improving water infrastructures and several waterborne diseases become serious problems in the water industry, specially, in developing Countries. Intermittent water supply, long-time of water storage, low water pressure in distribution systems, storage tankers and pipes as well as contaminated source water are among many of the factors responsible for low drinking water quality which in turn affecting health of people. The aim of this study was to explore microbial diversity and structure in water samples collected from source water, treated water, reservoirs, and several household points of use locations (taps). High throughput Illumina sequencing technology was employed by targeting V4 region of 16S rRNA following Illumina protocol to analyze the community structure of bacteria. The core dominating taxa were Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Gamma proteobacteria were dominant among other Proteobacterial classes across all sampling points. Opportunistic bacterial genera such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Actinobacteria, as well as eukaryotic microbes like Cryptosporidium, Hartmanella, Acanthamoeba, Aspergillus, and Candida were also the abundant taxa found along the distribution systems. The shift in microbial community structure from source to point of use locations were influenced by factors such as residual free chlorine, intermittent water supply and long-time storage at the household. The shift in microbial community structure from source to point of use locations were influenced by factors such as residual free chlorine, intermittent water supply and long-time storage at the household. The complex microbiota which was present in different sample sites receiving treated water from the two treatment plants (Legedadi and Gefersa) starting from source water to household point of consumption across the distribution systems in Addis Ababa brings drinking water quality problem which further causes significant health problems to both human and animal health. Treatment ineffectiveness, disinfection inefficiency, poor maintenance actions, leakage of sewage and other domestic wastes are few among many other factors responsible for degraded drinking water quality in this study putting health at high risk which, this, leads to morbidity and mortality. Findings of this research provide important and bassline information to understand the microbial profiles of drinking water along source water and distribution systems.</jats:p>"

When determining the energy value of natural gas in European countries, different values of the final temperature of combustion products, values of higher or lower heat of combustion are used. This causes a deviation of up to 19 % of the values of the heat of combustion of natural gas of the same composition, depending on the standard conditions established in a particular country. The dynamics of temperature change in some sections of the network and its influence on the determination of gas volumes were studied on the example of the urban-type settlement of Yampil, Khmelnytsky region. On the basis of actual values of the basic gas parameters in characteristic pointss of the settlement network, influence of ambient temperature on the basic parameters of the gas is investigated. Graphical dependences of gas density, Wobbe index, and gas volume on temperature are constructed. Based on the calculations, it was determined that when the temperature changes in the range from 0 to 40 °C, the volume of gas increases by 0.34 m3 per 1 °C. The density decreases by 0.002 kg/m3 per 1 °C. The maximum value of the Wobbe index is reached at temperatures of 10 and 25 °C. The same volume of gas can have different energy value, as it directly depends on the composition and percentage of the components of the gas mixture. There are special metters, which analyze the gas components. But they are installed only at large consumers. The presence of a corrector for temperature and pressure at the gas metering unit allows to increase the reliability of metering, but does not completely solves the problem. The amount of gas measured by the meters must be brought to standard conditions and converted into units of energy.</jats:p>"

Therefore, treated effluent through different technologies is generally preferred for reuse especially in water-scarce regions. In the present study, the performances of some treatment technologies like constructed wetland (CW), waste stabilisation pond (WSP), membrane bioreactor (MBR), vermi-biofiltration (VBF) and land treatment methods for removal of chemical and biological impurities from municipal wastewater were reviewed. The study revealed that the treated water quality varied depending on the hydraulic retention time under different treatment methods. The reservoir should be considered an integral part of the wastewater treatment system and not merely an operative ponding volume for irrigation. The comparatively advanced MBR technique showed better performance for removal of BOD, COD, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and other biological impurities than the traditional approach. Some techniques like land treatment methods and VBF were found to be equally attractive in developed as well as developing nations. The future projections of global green and blue water scarcities indicate treated water to be a valuable alternative water resource to fulfil required crop water footprints as well as irrigation demands.</jats:p>",

Energy supply contracting helps building residents to overcome the barrier of high upfront investment costs while additionally reducing risks related to energy-saving mechanisms. This study examines profitability for energy contractors in a variety of business cases that simultaneously ensure energy cost savings for the residents. A mixed-integer linear optimization model is developed for a neighborhood energy community, consisting of three buildings with diverse usages. In the process, the optimum capacities of building-attached and building-integrated photovoltaics, a heat pump and a gas-fired mini combined heat and power unit are determined to cover the energy community’s electricity and heat load. Results show that cross-domain contracting within energy communities is highly profitable for both, the contractor and the residents, while the extent depends on the accounting method, assumed interest rate and depreciation time. The additional application of energy-efficiency measures in/on the buildings, constituting a combination of energy supply and energy performance contracting, further increases profitability. The investigation of several sensitivities shows that high grid energy costs for electricity and gas enhance profitability of local energy technologies, leading to an increase in optimal technology capacities.</jats:p>"

The targeted population of this study is comprised of 499 manufacturing companies which are all located in Nairobi and its environs. In order to come up with a representative sample, stratified random sampling method was used since the population is heterogeneous. The stratified technique ensured that each sector in the target population has an equal chance of being selected. There were 217 respondents sampled from the 499 manufacturing firms out of 217 ,180 respondents returned the questionnaires for analysis. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires which were tested for validity and reliability using 10% of the total sample respondents. Quantitative data was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics and with the help of SPSS version 23 while qualitative data was analyzed descriptively. Linear and multiple regression models were used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The information was presented using tables, charts, frequencies, percentages and graphs.&#x0D;\nFindings: The study established that there exists a positive influence of supplier relations management on performance management of manufacturing firms in Kenya at 5% level of significant (β=0.295, P&lt;0.05). This indicates that as the level of supplier relationship management increases also performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya increases significantly.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study provides evidence that indeed supply relationship management as a strategic alliance influences performance in these organizations. In addition, the study is of benefit to the government of Kenya who should create awareness of their policies through training of the key stakeholders for this organizations since the majority of the respondents 53.17% indicated that the government policies and strategies are ineffective. Supply relationship management had significant effect on organization performance and this requires that to improve on quality production and lead time, manufacturing firms must also improve their supply relationship management. Since the quality of the products has not significantly improved for the last 5 years, more strategies must be put in place to incorporate technology which will aid to improve the quality and also maintain required lead time in these organizations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To protect their population during pandemic outbreak, countries apply several preventive restrictions and even shut down their economies to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Since food supply chains in developed countries are complicated and dependent on their external suppliers, these restrictions cause not only economic but also social tension. The limited access to raw materials, packaging material and labour force result in the increasing prices of food products, which forces the population to refuse from quality food products. In the European Union food supply chains, which are negatively affected by protectionist elements and COVID-19 restrictions, the room for manoeuvre of Latvia’s small open economy is limited. The current paper analyses the impact of COVID-19 crisis on global food industry, providing a deeper insight into the case study of Latvia meat supply chains’ experience in overcoming pandemic risks. The research outcomes lead to the conclusion that although COVID-19 impact during first breakout has not caused unexpected and serious consequences for the meat sector companies, the main internal and external risks are associated with further uncertainty and instability in the EU markets. Based on extensive analysis of meat sector specifics, the authors have summarized the recommendations for meat sector companies to better prepare for further potential pandemic situations. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-01257 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

The IRR of cash flow inthe traditional and technological production systems were positive, although the IRR ofthe traditional system was greater even though it had lower production volumes.Study Limitations/Implications: It was observed that vanilla requires between 3 and 4years for its first harvest, independently of the production system, traditional ortechnological, which means that there are negative cash flow numbers during the firsttwo years in both systems, despite a positive IRR.Findings/Conclusions: The critical stage in the supply chain of the company studiedwas the production. The cash flow for the technological system was superior whencompared to the traditional system. However, the IRR for the technological system waslower, since the investment in shade cloth was not compensated by the discountedcash flows that could otherwise be obtained.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main factor contributing to greenhouse gas emissions is the building up of the surrounding area. Studies have shown that buildings globally consume 30-40 % of energy use and release 40-50 % of global carbon dioxide emissions. Among all systems in houses, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are by far the most energy intensive. They consume approximately 50 % of the total energy demand of buildings. However, the systems are some of the most important systems in today's buildings. The number of these systems that are being installed has increased dramatically over the past few years. This is mainly due to the increasing demands for thermal energy, comfort and climate change. This paper presents a feasibility and ecology study between two ventilation or air-conditioning systems: constant air volume (CAV) and variable air volume (VAV). One of the purposes of this work is to determine the energy costs for each of the systems. An air conditioning system that saves operating costs usually requires a large initial investment. In this case, engineers must decide whether it is worth paying the additional upfront costs for a system that has lower operating costs. Despite the low attractiveness from the point of view of the investor, the VAV systems reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of energy resources for servicing the commercial sector. Such system have less metal consumption. Thus, the cost of metal processing is also reduced. The results of this study can contribute to the future selection of ventilation systems, as well as contribute to the design and improvement of the systems under study. Energy saving is one of the main reasons why VAV systems are very popular today for the design of ventilation and air conditioning systems for office buildings and in many industries abroad. With these systems, the volume of transported air is reduced as soon as the operating load falls below the maximum projected load. The calculation of emissions of harmful substances into the environment was made while ensuring the operation of CAV and VAV systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plant biomass is one of the most widespread renewable energy sources. Energy utilization of biomass allows solving some problems associated with the development of off-grid energy systems and the processing of combustible waste (primarily agricultural and forestry waste). This paper is devoted to the study of an allothermal gasification process of plant biomass materials using a kinetic-thermodynamic model developed by the author. The gasification process is considered stationary, and steam is used as a gasification agent. The power of the supplied heat is considered constant (10 kW). One of the significant tasks related to allothermal gasification is to choose flowrate parameters so that the heat supplied is efficiently used in chemical reactions without the threat of reactor overheating. The determination of the boundaries of the safe gasifier operation involved variant calculations with a view to optimizing the gasification conditions. The calculation results show that the allothermal gasification process can proceed with a thermochemical efficiency of about 70%. For each fixed fuel consumption level, there is an optimal fuel-steam ratio. The complete conversion of biomass requires sufficiently high temperatures. The produced gas contains a significant steam fraction \n(&gt;50 vol%) even under optimal conditions. The calculated fraction of hydrogen in dry gas is up to 60vol%.

Although geographically expanded supply chains incur a risk of inflows of negative economic shocks from other regions and countries, this risk can be alleviated by more diversification. In addition, diversified supply chains are found to promote the performance of firms. Recently, the domestic supply chains of Japanese firms started to be diversified, but firms still agglomerate in Tokyo substantially. Moreover, the international supply chains of Japanese firms rely considerably on Chinese suppliers and clients. Therefore, more geographic diversification of supply chains of Japanese firms is suggested for the more robust, resilient, and high‐growth economy in the post Abenomics period, including diversifying within Japan, reducing the reliance on China, and strengthening links with developed countries, with the help of the government.</jats:p>",

Occasionally, water systems fail due to natural disasters or structural supply issues, such as water-main breaks or unplanned changes in municipal or facility water quality. It is critical to regularly monitor and immediately recognize such a failure and take steps to avoid exposing the patients to contaminants. In addition to the recognition of the problem, the ability to pivot and continue to provide safe treatment to inpatients who are dependent on dialysis is essential, both from an ultrafiltration and a clearance standpoint. At our hospital, an unforeseen water disruption occurred and we were able to continue to provide KRT with premade, bagged dialysate to mitigate the effect on our patients on dialysis. This is a novel method using available machines and dialysate, which we normally stock for continuous KRT, for short dialysis sessions. The methodology is similar to that which has been widely used for short daily home hemodialysis with low dialysate flow rate. Because this situation occurred in the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we had to be mindful of dialysate volumes and staffing time. Here, we present our investigation into the cause of the water-system failure and how we quickly implemented the alternative dialysis method. Short dialysis with low-flow dialysate will not deliver the same Kt/V per session as standard dialysis; however, this method was successfully implemented and tailored with adjustments for patients requiring higher clearance for specific indications, such as severe hyperkalemia.</jats:p>",

The study aims to analyze the risks in the supply chain because the WCO to Biodiesel supply chain is vulnerable to different risks than the typical supply chain and the green supply chain. The method used in this research is the group analytical hierarchy process (G-AHP) approach to create a consensus model between actors of the supply chain. Deep interviews were conducted with six experts to identify the risks and the normal scale was used to quantify their preference. Then, the PriEst software assisted the risk weight calculation, AHP matrix validation, and consensus modelling. The findings show the supply chain is vulnerable to 23 risks, categorized into six risk categories. The three risks that cause the most uncertainties in the supply chain are supply chain design risk, key supplier risk, and financial source risk. Technology risks and asset failure risks are the least concern because most WCO conversion is not done in Indonesia. These findings would be useful for the government to focus its effort on the most critical risks.</jats:p>"

The cumulative value (2021–2031) of the water resources policy to reallocate agricultural water to achieve water supply security is about TWD 15.904–31.13 billion. The shadow price of industrial water is about TWD 40.18/cubic meter.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Choosing a supplier is a complex decision-making process that can reduce the total cost of production inputs and increase profits without increasing the price or sacrificing product quality. However, supplier selection processes usually involve multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria which increase the complexity of the problem and may decrease the accuracy and effectiveness of the process. Such complex decision-making problems can be supported by using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) models. While there have been multiple MCDM models to support supplier selection processes in different industries and sectors, only a few are developed to support the supplier selection processes in the garment industry, especially under uncertain decision-making environment. This paper presents an integrated mathematical model under a fuzzy environment and applies it to the supplier selection process in the garment industry. In this research, the authors utilize the Buckley extension based fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) method in combination with linear normalization based fuzzy Grey Relational Analysis (F-GRA) method to develop a MCDM approach to the supplier selection process under a fuzzy environment. As a result, supplier 08 (SA08) is the optimal supplier. The contribution of this work is to propose an MCDM model for ranking potential suppliers in the garment industry under a fuzzy environment. The proposed approach can also be applied to support complex decision-making processes under a fuzzy environment in different industries.</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>Tropical deforestation in global agricultural commodity supply chains is a “wicked” problem. Attempted solutions to wicked conservation problems like tropical deforestation often involve idealised, technical mechanisms. For example, company commitments to “zero deforestation” have become a mainstay of global forest conservation efforts. To be resolved, however, wicked conservation problems require strategically-developed, context-specific mixes of mechanisms. Drawing on interdisciplinary literature from the policy sciences, energy and land-use policy, and conservation, we examine why the contextual complexity of wicked conservation problems demands mixes of mechanisms. We present an operational model of conservation that incorporates the mechanism mix concept. We then explore how the dynamism and uncertainty of wicked problems means mixes of mechanisms must be continually reconfigured. Drawing the concepts of contextual complexity, dynamism and uncertainty together, we propose a conceptual model – the “M3 Model” – which aids understanding of how mechanism mixes can be reconfigured to sustain progress towards a desired outcome. The M3 model has four practical implications, which we discuss with reference to supply chain initiatives to reduce deforestation. First, it makes the need to address multiple interacting variables explicit, countering the tendency to seek panaceas. Second, it emphasises the importance of analysing mechanisms’ contributions to problem amelioration, instead of their shortcomings as idealised solutions. Third, it highlights the possibility of failure, reorienting conservation practice towards learning. Fourth, it emphasises polycentric governance, reinforcing the need for distributed mechanism deployment across stakeholder groups. Our synthesis provides tools to support a holistic, systemic approach to tackling wicked conservation problems.</p>"

The logistics network design (LND) lead to different supply, storage and distribution environments and result in flows, these logistics operations have an impact on the performance of the chain of fresh agricultural products. Specifically, in the PFSC with seasonality, a temporary imbalance between supply and demand is generated, which affects the balance in the flows and affects the losses, costs and response capacity. This research study that problem.Design/methodology/approach: A multi-echelon, multi-objective and multi-product model is established that determines the configuration of the logistics network of the PFSC with seasonally and allows actors to approach efficiency frontiers, which contribute to their permanence in the markets. The model was applied to the case of the perishable fruit supply chain, in a developing country, Colombia. The population information was taken from government surveys and studies, which allowed parameterizing the model.Findings: The application of model permitted to answer the next questions: How does improve the performance from PFSC through logistics network design? And, How the existence of smallholdings in food production and from retail merchants is preserved? In the perishable food supply chain.Social implications: Where the perishable food supply chain actors are located in non-efficient borders and their sustainability may be affected by competition factors, the stakeholders should focus on increasing food availability and reducing losses to improve access and therefore food security.Originality/value: A new model for the logistics network configurations of seasonal perishable fruit supply chain was development, the optimizing from five objectives with two sub-models is obtained, one for surplus and the other for the deficit moments. The model includes real conditions, such as, fruit loss due T0 and RH by different thermal floors and the means used for the transport of fruits in mountain areas at countries in route of development. The impact over the small producers, retailers and consumers in the times of scarcity or surplus was analyzed.</jats:p>"

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that has severely affected global business dynamics. Similar vulnerabilities have been caused by other outbreaks in the past. In these terms, prevention strategies against propagating disruptions require vigilant goal conceptualization and roadmaps. In this respect, there is a need to explore supply chain operation management strategies to overcome the challenges that emerge due to COVID-19-like situations. Therefore, this review is aimed at exploring such challenges and developing strategies for sustainability, and viability perspectives for SCs, through a structured literature review (SLR) approach. Moreover, this study investigated the impacts of previous epidemic outbreaks on SCs, to identify the research objectives, methodological approaches, and implications for SCs. The study also explored the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the business environment, in terms of effective resource allocation, supply and demand disruptions, and transportation network optimization, through operations management techniques. Furthermore, this article structured a framework that emphasizes the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, resilience strategies, and sustainability to overcome SC challenges during pandemics. Finally, future research avenues were identified by including a research agenda for experts and practitioners to develop new pathways to get out of the crisis.</jats:p>"

The supply chain consists of a single risk-neutral supplier and a risk-averse retailer. We characterize the retailer’s order quantity decision under the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) criterion and the supplier’s production decision. The results show that facing disruption risk and risk-aversion, both the retailer and the supplier would be more prudent to order and produce less than the risk-neutral scenario, inducing damage to the supply chain performance. The number of options purchased is decreasing in disruption risk and the risk-aversion of the retailer. The supplier will increase production as the disruption risk decreases or the shortage penalty increases. When the supplier does not know the risk-aversion of the retailer, the former will produce more and bear a higher overstock risk. We also investigate conditions that facilitate vulnerable supply chain coordination and find that the existence of risk-aversion and disruption risk restrict the option price and exercise price to lower price levels. Finally, we compare the option contract with wholesale price contract from the supplier’s and retailer’s perspectives through a numerical study. </jats:p>",

Hybrid power system offers sufficient power supply for the rural villages by providing alternative supply for intermittent nature of renewable energy resource. Hence, intermittency of renewable energy resources is a challenge to electrify the rural community in a sustainable manner with the above sources. Thus, efficient resources management is a reasonable choice for intermittent renewable energy resources. The majority of rural villages in Ethiopia are suffering from lack of electricity. This causes deforestation, travel for long distance to fetch water, and no good social services, like clinic and schools, sufficiently. Therefore, the objective of this study was to maximize reliability of power supply by renewable energy sources. Data on wind speed and solar radiation are obtained from the NASA surface meteorological agency. While hydro data are obtained from physical measurements. Different configuration options are considered by Homer software to find the optimal configuration of hybrid system. The optimal configuration system is selected and hybrid components are sized. The optimal hybrid system consists of solar PV, wind, and hydro to supply a community load with a share of 13%, 52%, and 35% respectively. The fuzzy logic controller is designed to manage the intermittent nature of energies. Hence, the demand and energy sources are unpredictable; intelligent control system is important to manage the system accordingly. The control system is designed in MATALAB software. The result obtained from resource combination shows demand and supply are balanced. From the Twelve probabilistic combinations of demand and energy sources, one of the combinations shows that when 7.5 kW is demanded, the power generated/output from hybrid system is 10 kW which is greater than demand. To satisfy 7.5 kW demand control system takes 4.25 kW, 2.75 kW, and 1.08 kW share from wind, hydro, and solar sources respectively. The fuzzy logic control system is designed, to monitor the resource availability and load demand. This controller was managing the demand and the available resources according to the rule.</jats:p>",

Passive monitoring techniques permit investigation of interannual dependencies in bedload transport in high resolution, including sediment supply factors. Here, seismic impact plate records are processed using a probabilistic model BedLoad from Impact Plates model to derive a 5‐year bedload data set at 5‐min intervals for the lower River Avon, Devon, UK. For water years that range from very dry to very wet, annual coarse bedload yields are estimated to vary through two orders of magnitude with wide prediction intervals. The most effective discharge occurs consistently at about one‐third of bankfull flow, morphologically at “subbarfull” stage, the result of hysteretic trends and falling limb transport in this non‐threshold channel. A two‐phase sediment rating curve is revealed with a variable supply related “bulge” during in‐bank flows, giving way to a near‐linear trend during overbank flows. The supply related component is predicted well using a sensitivity style metric that combines the cumulative duration of competent flows with the magnitude‐duration product of near‐threshold flows, defining a field‐scale exemplar of “stress history.” Further, the relative proportion of supply related coarse bedload yield relates strongly to the relative wetness of the previous year. High resolution, multiyear data reveal that controls on bedload dynamics are unique to a site's hydrogeoclimatic context and position in the river basin. Passive monitoring holds promise for generating “type sites” of bedload behavior critical for use in improving aquatic biodiversity and the sustainability of river management.</jats:p>",

This study aims at overcoming this gap in research by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the years to come. We use the Delphi technique to estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports by 2025. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results suggest substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the European traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on quality and sustainability rather than quantity. In addition, a significant growth in the world’s demand for olive oil is expected in non-traditional markets, which will be driven by greater awareness of the positive health and sustainability attributes of this product, jointly with the changes in lifestyles and rising incomes of several consumer segments. These emerging markets offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Future international challenges facing the olive oil industry include new market entry, worldwide product promotion, quality standards’ harmonization, enacting trade facilitation schemes, and dealing with the COVID-19 impacts. Findings improve market predictability and transparency, and ultimately support decision-making and strategic planning in the olive oil sector.</jats:p>"

This article also explores the factors that are associated with changes in water use. The month March 2020 is used in this study as a cut-off because this is the month in which the government implemented a lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Results indicate that most households had an increase in the quantity of water used after March 2020 when compared with the period before March 2020. Household characteristics that were associated with a change in the quantity of water used were age, sex, education, main occupation of household head, household size and region of residence. The results can be used to inform the prediction and demand modelling of household water use for improved water interventions for equitable water supply during emergencies.</jats:p>",

В статье рассмотрены труды ученых, посвященные подходам к оценке как ресурсного, так и инновационного потенциала предприятий разных видов деятельности. На основании этого предложен подход к оценке инновационно-ресурсного потенциала предприятий, оказывающих услуги водоснабжения (предприятий водоснабжения). Такой агрегированный потенциал рассматривается как совокупность базовых компонентов и тех составляющих, которые отражают новаторские возможности деятельности экономического субъекта. Авторами разработана методика оценки инновационно-ресурсного потенциала предприятий водоснабжения — через систему показателей, характеризующих каждый структурный элемент (субпотенциал). Авторы выделяют: образовательно-кадровый, научно-исследовательский, информационно-технологический, производственно-технический, социально-экологический, финансово-экономический и организационно-управленческий субпотенциалы. Каждый вид субпотенциала обладает уникальными характеристиками, свойственными сфере водоснабжения. На основании специфики каждого субпотенциала авторами отобраны из имеющихся в научном обороте специфичные для данной сферы деятельности показатели, а также предложены новые показатели. В статье авторами использованы следующие методы научного исследования: теоретический анализ; структурный анализ; анализ показателей оценки. На основании использованных научных методов авторами предложена методика оценки инновационно-ресурсного потенциала предприятия водоснабжения, включающая пять этапов. Методика оценки инновационно-ресурсного потенциала через систему показателей, характеризующих каждый вид субпотенциала, позволила авторам разработать основные направления повышения эффективности использования инновационно-ресурсного потенциала предприятия водоснабжения для повышения эффективности его деятельности, что, в свою очередь, улучшит качество предоставляемых потребителю услуг, с учетом рационализации используемых ресурсов.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>In modern conditions of increasing competition in the market, enterprises need to assess the existing potential in a timely manner to identify possible reserves for improving the efficiency of their production activity. The article discusses approaches to assessing the resource and innovation potential of enterprises of different types of activity. Based on this, the authors suggest an approach to assessing the innovation and resource potential of enterprises providing water supply services (water supply enterprises). This aggregated potential is considered as a system of basic components and the components that reflect the innovation capabilities of a particular economic subject. The authors developed a methodology for assessing the innovation and resource potential of water supply enterprises through a system of indicators that describe each structural element of this potential (subpotentials). The authors underline the following subpotentials: educational and personnel-related, scientific, information-technological, industrial and technical, socio-ecological, financial and economic, organizational and managerial. Each type of subpotentials has its unique characteristic that can be used in the sphere of water supply. Based on the specifics of each subpotential, the authors selected the indicators of this field of activity that are available in scientific sphere, and proposed new indicators. The authors used the following methods of scientific research: theoretical analysis, structural analysis, and analysis of the assessing indicators. The authors suggested a five-stage methodology of assessing the innovation and resource potential of water supply enterprises, based on the applied scientific methods. The methodology of assessing the innovation and resource potential of water supply enterprises through a system of indicators that describes each type of subpotentials has allowed the authors to develop the main directions for increasing the efficiency of water supply enterprises that will improve the quality of services provided to the consumers, taking into account the rationalization of the resources used.</jats:p>",

These existing carbon sources constitute a great potential to roll out BECCS on commercial scale. Yet, despite political targets for negative emission production in Sweden, no incentive schemes were thus far enacted. While previous proposals focus on governmental compensation, the aim of this work is to set BECCS into the supply chain of a wide array of consumer products and thereby find alternative or complementary, business-driven, ways to incentivise BECCS when applied to the pulp and paper industry. In this work, we assess a “value proposition” for low-carbon products in supply chains linked to the pulp and paper industry. By projecting the costs and negative emissions related to BECCS from the pulp mill to typical consumer products, as exemplified by three case study products, we show how BECCS can substantially reduce the carbon footprint of the consumer products, while only marginally increasing their cost. Additional price premiums could shorten the payback period of the initial investment in BECCS. The developed business case presents how actors along the supply chain for pulp and paper products can collectively contribute to securing financing and to mitigating investment risks. The results challenge the private sector, i.e., the companies along the pulp-and-paper supply chain to commit considerable investments also in the case without or with too weak direct political incentives. We conclude by discussing the governance implications on corporate and public level to enable the collaborative “bottom-up” adoption of BECCS.</jats:p>"

The proposed model is a decision support tool that allows testing several scenarios in order to study the behavior of physical flows within a supply chain depending on the inventory and transport costs and taking into consideration the environmental issues through the integration of a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> tax in transport costs. The developed model can be used to analyze various scenarios and perform various “what-if” analyzes, as well as to answer questions about the long-term operation of distribution chains. The results show that logistic decisions and strategies taken at the supply chain level influence inventory and transport costs. They show also that the model is a well decision-support tool for calculating and analyzing transport and inventory costs. We first expose the methodology and the literature review. Next, we present in detail the structure of the model consisting of the causal loops diagram and stock and flow diagram. Finally, we discuss the results of the model.</jats:p>",

Data was collected through questionnaire survey and systematic literature review of the supply chain social sustainability papers, published in peer-reviewed journals within the time frame of January 2000 to October 2020. Findings from this study show that social aspects are less researched and practiced compared to economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Research is still at an infancy stage in the emerging economies with very few social sustainability-centered studies focusing on practices and metrics to measure the impact of these practices. The paper identifies 26 social issues for social sustainability in supply chain for two different economies and does a comparative study. Scope of the paper is limited to Manufacturing and Energy sectors in the USA and in India to seek a possible contrasting or adhering perspective to the issues. Results and discussion pertain to the chosen sectors and geographies and provide key insight on the perspectives in the region with a conclusion on further research and mitigation methods through research and implementation of corporate practices that can help mitigate systemic social issues.</jats:p>"

В качестве возобновляемых факторов рассмотрены физический и человеческий капитал, а также трудовые ресурсы. Основным уравнением в исследовании берется уравнение обмена количественной теории денег. Опираясь на аппарат векторного анализа, получено уравнение скорости изменения денежного агрегата М2. Предполагается, что скорость обращения денег постоянна на заданных участках времени, но наличие вихревых составляющих в изменении факторов производства не исключается. Такие перекосы могут возникать, например, при дисбалансе инвестирования в возобновляемые факторы. Показано, что прирост денежного агрегата зависит от предельных значений производительности труда, предельной фондоотдачи, предельной производительности человеческого капитала, прироста ВВП и прироста основных возобновляемых факторов производства. Проведено численное моделирование изменения денежного агрегата М2 в условных единицах в период 2003— 2018 гг. Аналитическое представление отражает общие тенденции изменения, но в настоящее время о реальном сравнении речи идти не может. Это связано с необходимостью более точного определения вклада человеческого капитала в ВВП, но таких данных нет. Конечно-разностный аналог уравнения может быть одним из инструментов при прогнозировании денежного агрегата в краткосрочной перспективе. Получено дифференциальное уравнение, которое дает общее аналитическое представление о всевозможных вариантах поведения инфляции.

Physical and human capital, as well as labor resources, is considered among renewable factors. The basic equation in the study is the equation of exchange of the quantitative theory of money. The equation of the rate of change of the monetary aggregate M2 is obtained, based on the apparatus of vector analysis. It is assumed that the rate of circulation of money is constant at given time intervals, but the presence of vortex components in the change in factors of production is not excluded. Such imbalances can arise, for example, with imbalances in investment in renewable factors. It is shown that the growth of the monetary aggregate depends on the marginal values of labor productivity, marginal capital return, marginal productivity of human capital, GDP growth and growth of the main renewable factors of production. Numerical modeling of the change in the monetary aggregate M2 in conventional units from 2003 to 2018 was carried out. Analytical calculations reflect the general trends of change, but at present, a real comparison is out of the question. This is due to the need to more accurately determine the contribution of human capital to GDP, but there are no such data. The finite-difference analogue of the equation can be one of the tools in forecasting the monetary aggregate in the short term. A differential equation is obtained, which gives a general analytical idea of all possible variants of inflation behavior. Conditions are found in the form of inequalities that allow us to find a limit on the supply of money that is critical for the hyperinflation occurrence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Managing the inventory of spare parts is very difficult because of the stochastic nature of part’s demand. Also, only controlling the inventory of the spare part is not enough; instead, the supply chain of the spare part needs to be managed efficiently. Moreover, every organization now aims to have a resilient and sustainable supply chain to overcome the risk of facility disruption and to ensure environmental sustainability. This paper thus aims to establish a model of inventory-location relating to the resilient supply chain network of spare parts.Design/methodology/approach: First, applying queuing theory, a location-inventory model for a spare parts supply chain facing a facility disruption risk and has a restriction for CO2 emission, is developed. The model is later formulated as a non-linear mixed-integer programming problem and is solved using MATLAB.Findings: The model gives optimal decisions about the location of the warehouse facility and the policy of inventory management of each location selected. The sensitivity analysis shows that the very low probability of facility disruption does not influence controlling the average emission level. However, the average emission level certainly decreases with the increment of the disruption probability when the facility disruption probability is significant.Practical implications: Using this model, based on the cost and emission parameters and the likelihood of facility disruption, the spare part’s manufacturer can optimize the total average cost of the spare part’s supply chain through making a trade-off between productions, warehouse selection, inventory warehousing and demand allocation.Originality/value: Previous research focuses only on developing a framework for designing an efficient spare parts planning and control system. The inventory-location model for spare parts is not addressed in the sense of risk of facilities disturbance and emission. This research first time jointly considered the probabilistic facility disruption risk and carbon emission for modeling the spare part’s supply chain network.</jats:p>"

First, the effects of hydraulic transients on water quality have been reviewed. The transient waves are approximated by sinusoidal functions so that their effects are incorporated into the controlled system as external disturbances. Next, the active control is implemented based on the adaptive super-twisting (STW) sliding mode control (SMC) algorithms. Then, the robust performance is guaranteed whenever the sliding variables reach the sliding surfaces in finite time despite disturbances. The STW SMC scheme is to eliminate the chattering problems for protecting the valves and to improve the convergence precision for water production. The control gains are adaptable to enable formation of an effective controller for dealing with large disturbances such as water hammer during desalination process. The simulation results reveal the superior performances on controlling water product, while eliminating shock waves. Especially, the effect of hydraulic shocks has been dramatically attenuated, hence the plant components are protected to avoid fracture. Finally, the robust stability and performance of the desalination plants are guaranteed against large disturbances to ensure the population with quality water as well as system sustainability.</jats:p>",

Quite a lot of attention has been paid to the correct solution of this problem in various fields of technology. The article proposes and implements a probabilistic approach to calculating the circuit reliability of the power supply system using an assessment of the actual state of its main elements. The assessment of the state of the equipment of the power supply system is carried out using an integral indicator of the technical condition. This creates the basis for applying a risk-based approach to the management of maintenance and repairs to assess the consequences and feasibility of repair and restoration work of power equipment while minimizing possible damage from power outages to consumers. The article presents two methods for calculating reliability, focused on both recoverable and non-recoverable elements of the power supply system. In addition, a decision-making model for managing repairs of power equipment in power supply systems is proposed. A separate case is considered when the power supply system provides electricity to a mono-consumer, which is typical for oil and gas production. Based on the analysis of scenarios for the implementation of the risk-based approach, the influence of various degrees of severity of the consequences of failure on the assessment of decisions made is studied. The developed models and methods are illustrated by computational examples from the practice of operating electrical equipment in power supply systems with a monoconsumer</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), automation and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted renewed interest in multiple industrial fields. Global manufacturing bases were affected strongly by workforce shortages associated with the spread of COVID-19, and are working to increase productivity by embracing digital manufacturing technologies that take advantage of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) that offer the promise of improved connectivity among supply chains. This trend can increase and smooth the flow of social capital, which is a potential resource in supply chains and can affect supply chain performance in healthcare industry. However, such an issue has not been properly recognized as the best practice in healthcare industry. Thus, this study investigates empirically the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance in healthcare manufacturing companies based on previous research that proposed a role for social capital. We surveyed the staff of domestic small and medium-sized healthcare manufacturing companies in South Korea currently operating or planning to deploy digital manufacturing technologies. Online and email surveys were utilized to collect the data. Invalid responses were excluded and the remaining 130 responses were analyzed using a structural equation model in SPSS with the AMOS module. We found that digitalization has a positive effect on the formation of social capital, which in turn has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The direct effect of digitalization on supply chain performance is small, and relatively large portions are mediated and influenced by social capital. The establishment of strategic relationships in the healthcare manufacturing industry is significant, as supply chain networks and production processes can influence the intended use of factory output. Companies should, therefore, secure timely and accurate information to manage the flow of products and services. The formation of social capital in the supply chain can help visualize entire supply chains and has a positive effect on real-time information-sharing among key elements of those chains.</jats:p>"

This research was conducted with a Design-Based Research approach that combines scientific design methods with the problems that occur for internet development in rural areas of Indonesia. The finding that the development of wireless internet in rural areas can be carried out with the concept of a supply chain structure consisting of suppliers (ISP providers of internet sources), manufacturers (local government or village-owned enterprises managing and transmitting wireless internet to wholesaler), wholesaler (installed 5GHz wireless repeater in people residential areas), retailers (installed 5GHz wireless receiver devices from wholesaler and convert to 2.4GHz wireless transmitters installed in every resident’s house) and customers (each resident’s smartphones or notebooks device connected by wireless).</jats:p>",

This research was conducted at a dairy farmer cooperative located in West Java. The analysis used to measure the performance was supply chain operation reference-analysis hierarchy process (SCOR-AHP). For measuring the product quality, ten post-production concentrate samples, 27 samples after the distribution process, and 25 samples for homogeneity test from five mixer machines were taken. Concentrate quality parameters were moisture, ash, crude fat, crude protein, crude fiber, total digestible nutrients (TDN), and salt content. Post-production samples data were compared with Indonesian National Standard (SNI) using one-tailed one-sample t-test, samples data from the field were tested using two samples independent t-tests compared to post-production samples data, and homogeneity test was seen from the coefficient of variation value of the salt content. The results show that the supply chain performance value of dairy cow concentrate at the cooperative is excellent. The nutrient content complies with SNI, but the homogeneity of the mixture is classified as poor category. The nutrient content of samples taken from the field shows differences with post-production samples except for TDN. The excessive total cost can be utilized to enhance performance in generating a better quality product. The cooperative should enhance homogeneity by concerning the mixing process and maintain the quality consistency by reformulating, stabilizing the quality of feedstuff, and calculating stock properly to avoid longer storage.</jats:p>"

The method thus has a considerable influence on the supply chain’s performance, taking account of internal synchronization. After multiple interviews with two companies, an interactive process was developed. The outcomes of the study were extracted from the variables associated with the exam. We have already seen various statistics that indicate that automation has eliminated manufacturing costs, human bugs and a somewhat time-consuming process for supply chains.

It is necessary to focus on iron oxidation from the water. This work aims to develop nanobubbles (NBs) technology to remove iron (Fe2+) from aqueous solutions. In batch experiments, the effects of initial Fe2+ concentration, pH, and aeration pressure on the Fe2+ oxidation efficiency were carried out. The results showed that initial concentrations, pH and aeration pressure are significant parameters influencing Fe2+ oxidation. On the basis of single factor experiments, the Box–Behnken design was used to optimize the Fe2+ oxidation conditions with NBs using three parameters (Fe2+ concentration, pH, and aeration pressure) under the response surface methodology. The optimal Fe2+ oxidation was achieved when the initial concentration was 13.7 mg·L−1, pH = 9, and the aeration pressure was 290 kPa. The regression model of Fe2+ oxidation rate under optimized test conditions is accurate and effective. The results showed that the combination of single factor test and response surface optimization can be used to optimize the Fe2+ oxidation process with NBs. It is concluded that NBs technology is promising for Fe2+ oxidation from water.</jats:p>",

The flyback converter and the secondary volta ge doubler structure are used to achieve high gain. At the same time, in order to improve the efficiency, the resonant soft switching technology is used to achieve valley opening through the resonance of the transformer leakage inductance and the capacitor to realize the soft switching of the switch tube and the diode. This article developed a 250W experimental prototype, and conducted a series of no-load and full-load tests under closed-loop steady-state operation, which can realize the zero-voltage turn-on of the switch tube and the zero-current turn-off of the diode. The efficiency is up to 93.7% under full load conditions, while the output ripple is small and there is no oscillation, and the device stress is small, which proves to be suitable for use in the anode power supply of micro satellites.</jats:p>",

The development of metering error curves requires steady-state conditions which are extremely rare in water distribution systems characterized by intermittent supply. Simple deterministic models are suggested and developed from monthly data collected over a 4-year period (2010–2014) for three most dominant meter models (Models 1–3) in the Kampala Water Distribution System (KWDS), Uganda. This study combines pressure and billing information at the same time to understand metering accuracy. Results showed that metering accuracy increased by 4.2% for Model 1, 8.4% for Model 2 and 2.9% for Model 3, when the pressure was increased from 10 to 50 meters head. Age did not influence the impact of pressure on meter accuracy. The most sensitive parameter in the model was the meter age. Metering accuracy was relatively constant after a period of 5 years. The least sensitive parameter was the working pressure which caused a slight change to the annual billed volume. The ability of the model to accurately predict the meter registration degenerated with an increasing annual billed volume. Model 2 meters were the best performing and probably the most suitable meters in the KWDS.</jats:p>",

Fuel cells require a constant supply of pressurized air, for which high-speed turbo compressors with air bearings are an optimal choice to reduce size, guarantee oil-free operation required for the lifetime of the fuel cell, and increase efficiency. However, the inverter driving the electric motor of the turbo compressor does not scale down with increasing speed; therefore, other technology advances are required to achieve an overall compressor system with low weight. New power electronic topologies (double-bridge voltage sources inverter), cutting edge power semiconductor technology (gallium nitride), and multiobjective optimization techniques allow reducing the inverter size, increasing inverter efficiency, and improving the output current quality and in return lowering the losses in the electric motor. This enables the electrical, mechanical, and thermal integration of the inverter into the compressor housing of very high-speed and compact turbo compressors, thereby reducing the size and weight of the overall compressor system by a factor of two. Furthermore, a turbo compressor with an integrated inverter reduces complexity and cost for operators with savings in casing, cables, coolant piping, and connectors and reduces EMI noise by shielding the high-frequency motor currents with one housing. Beside its main application for fuel cell air supply, the advantages gained by an integrated inverter can also be used in other boosting and air handling applications such as advanced air and exhaust handling in combustion engines. The proposed integration concept is verified with a 280,000 rpm, 1 kW turbo compressor, targeted for the Balance of Plant (BoP) of a 5–15 kW fuel cell. The experimental results show that the temperature limits on the power electronics parts can be kept below the limit of 90 °C up to a coolant temperature of 55 °C, and beside the advantage of lower cabling effort, the efficiency of the compressor system (turbo compressor and integrated inverter) is increased by 5.5% compared to a turbo compressor without an integrated inverter.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oil and gas offshore exploration and production (E &amp; P) will remain necessary to meet increasing global energy demands. However, appraising and exploring these resources has a major impact on sustainability and faces many challenges. Improving the supply chain operations that support E&amp;P activities presents opportunities to contribute to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but relies on organizations being able to adopt new strategies and technology and, innovate their current business models. Business model innovation (BMI) has not been actively pursued in this industry, partially due to the traditional operation management and due to the complexity in changing established models or adopting full-fledged archetypes. Thus, the present study proposes a more flexible and granular approach to BMI by defining elements to be adopted rather than proposing business models archetypes. To define the elements, an application of systems engineering (SE) is adopted through a morphological analysis (MA). They are presented in morphological boxes in three dimensions—technology, organization, and the human element—inspired by sustainable business model (SBM) literature. The elements are proposed as “bricks” for BMI where they can be adopted and re-arranged as necessary, providing granularity and flexibility to facilitate BMI for organizations of varying sizes.</jats:p>"

However, no study analyses factors influencing the sustainability of rural drinking water supply programs holistically, and this study aims to fill that gap. This study utilized a system dynamics approach based on a case study of a community-based rural drinking water supply program (PAMSIMAS in Bahasa) in Magelang Regency, Indonesia. Five sustainability aspects were considered in the model development and simulation: financial, institutional, environmental, technical, and social aspects. Eight scenario analyses related to those five aspects were conducted. The causal loop diagrams suggest that the overall loop in the system is reinforcing, meaning that the improvement in one aspect will improve the overall condition of the system and deterioration in one aspect will reduce the overall condition of the system. Scenario analysis shows that external fund is critical to support the program financially, especially at the beginning of the project when the piped system is being built and water revenue is still low. Scenario and sensitivity analyses revealed that human factors, i.e., the performance of the water board and response and support from the community, positively influence the sustainability of the water supply program. Additionally, the water board plays a key role in accelerating the pipe network growth. Finally, this paper argues that visualising and simulating the causal relationship and dynamic behaviour of the rural water supply program are critical for water stakeholders to better design and implement the water supply program.</jats:p>"

We analyzed the sustainability of supply chain of four organizations positioned in the condition of governance of their supply chain belonging to the commerce, industry, service, and public service sectors, all of which are recognized in the region and in the state, they are located by their social, financial, or environmental performances. We used mathematical alignment calculations based on the theoretical profile and profile deviation techniques to obtain indices of alignment with sustainability. The main finding was the medium‐ to high‐level alignment among SC members, whose practices are moderately sustainable.

Here, we use a mixture of field and experimental data to examine these problems and apply a suite of traditional and novel analysis approaches to highlight dynamics which might otherwise go undetected. Eleven years of monitoring channel morphology in a small forested watershed indicate that pool‐riffles persist through large changes in upstream water and bedload supply and that bed architecture relief is correlated to flow magnitude. A flume experiment consisting of eight runs was conducted to examine the field case in more detail. The experimental design splits the eight runs into four runs of relatively high water and sediment supply and four of relatively low water supply, with no upstream sediment supply. Experimental results corroborate the field‐based measurements of pool‐riffle persistence, which is due to a coupling between downstream width variations, and spatial patterns of flow velocity and bedload transport. More specifically, measurements made during the flume experiments along a prominent pool‐riffle pair indicate that temporal and spatial changes to topography, flow hydraulics, and bed surface sediment texture are more rich and nuanced than existing generalizations offer. For example, clustering analysis completed using self‐organizing maps indicates that sediment sorting between pools and riffles is not simply a binary type response of finer versus coarser described by some characteristic grain size.</jats:p>",

Transients have been generated by the fast and complete closure of a valve placed at the downstream end section of the pipe. In the first phase of the calibration procedure, the proposed algorithm has been used to estimate both the viscoelastic parameters of a generalized Kelvin–Voigt model and the unsteady-state friction coefficient, by minimizing the difference between the numerical and experimental results. In the second phase of the procedure, the calibrated model allowed the evaluation of leak size and location with an acceptable accuracy.

This may hinder the level of customer satisfaction. This paper presents a sustainable closed-loop supply chain framework coupled with cross-docking subject to product non-conformance. A cost model is proposed to investigate the economic and environmental aspects of such systems. The transportation cost is analyzed in terms of total carbon emissions.

The results of different size problems are compared with the branch and bound approach and the proposed lower bound.

We analyse the comparative evolution of these markets across Europe over the decade leading up to 2015, focusing on supply, graduate/high-skilled jobs, underemployment, wages, the graduate wage premium and the penalty for underemployment. The supply of tertiary graduates increased everywhere and converged, and this upward convergence is forecast to persist. In contrast the growth of graduate jobs was slower, not ubiquitous and nonconvergent. Underemployment was spreading, though at a modest rate; this rise was convergent but not ubiquitous. The rise was most substantial in Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Italy and Greece. Graduates’ real wages trended predominantly downward, but varied a great deal between countries. The graduate wage premium declined by more than one percentage point in seven countries.

Thus the supplier is trying to prevent the supply of other competitors of the same type. Effective logistical arrangements in the distribution of goods need to pay attention to the behavior characteristics of shipping costs. The purpose of this study is to minimize shipping costs with a distribution scheme that can optimize product loads. By using the Balinski linear approach, the problem of sending fixed costs can be solved by the branching method. The branching method gradually produces new problem-solving branches with different objective functions and constraints. Each value branch could be compared so that the optimal solution for the cost is found.</jats:p>",

Bank resilience is important for firms when selecting a lender and it is therefore vital to control for bank‐specific demand when identifying credit supply shocks. An application using bank‐specific demand shows that—even after fully controlling for demand, borrower quality, and bank strength—unconventional monetary policies stimulate loan supply.</jats:p>",

To make the strategies for ensuring the energy supply security of a country, it is essential to quantitatively assess the security. This paper aims to present a methodology to evaluate the energy supply security of a country by using different indices of energy dependence and energy diversity, which have been raised as two main paradigms of energy supply security. This study also proposes two indices reflecting the correlation between a country’s energy diversity and energy import dependence to evaluate its energy supply security based on easily accessible data. The presented methodology and indices were applied to the evaluation of the primary energy supply security of Korea from 1991 to 2018. The results show that a country highly dependent on energy imports is not evaluated as secure enough in terms of energy supply even if it obtains higher energy diversity. This finding supports the importance of the correlation of energy dependence and energy diversity of a country to ensure its energy supply security. This approach could be further adapted to other countries and help them to make their energy policy and strategies.</jats:p>"

The principle of its operation is the supply of air by a shielding jet at the upper level and the suction of polluted air at the lower level symmetrically from opposite sides. At this stage of experimental research, the velocity fields and the nature of the interaction of inflow jets and suction flares have been studied. When determining the geometric dimensions of the air-jet screen structure, the location of key components and system elements, it is important to know, ensure and not exceed the allowable values of air flow velocity above the surface of the liquid mirror. During the observations of the aerodynamic properties of two-level air-jet screens, questions arose about the need to use flat rotational flows and control the velocity field in their interaction. Minimization of the interaction of inflow jets and flares of suction is the basis of the concept of designing a sсreen of this type. The shielding conditions have been experimentally confirmed due to the stabilization of the velocity field above the bath surface. The corresponding dependencies of change of formation of the protective air screen from the basic parameters as that a ratio of velocity \"inflow-removal\" and geometrical characteristics of a design are defined. For the developed air-jet screen of galvanic baths experimentally determined conditions of effective shielding are as follows: the ratio of the width of the slot for ejection of air from the working area to the width of the gas-tight wall is 0.75, and the ratio of screening jet velocity to air removal rate is within 0.3-2.45. This achieves a capture efficiency of up to 90 %. The expediency of arranging an ejection slot under the air supply slot to increase the flow rate and range of the jet has been confirmed.</jats:p>"

To reduce this risk and maximize added value, blockchain technology is used to change the supply chain of the fishing industry. Blockchain technology is a ledger database that is distributed to record transactions among parties that can be verified and permanently. This paper proposes a blockchain technology framework in the fishing industry. This paper will explain the definition and benefits of blockchain, current applications, and design a new model of the supply chain. The potential benefits of the blockchain are transparency and traceability, reducing costs and time, and preventing illegal or unethical fishery products from entering the supply chain.

Samples were collected during peak algal bloom month (January 2018) from two sampling sites, near the dam (S1) and at the center of the reservoir (S2). Identification and enumeration of phytoplankton taxa were done and the measurement of common hepatotoxin (MCs and NOD) concentrations was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

In these first cyanotoxin analyses conducted for a drinking water supply source in Ethiopia, six major MC variants, namely MC-dmRR, MC-RR, MC-YR, MC-dmLR, MC-LR, and MC-LA, were detected in both algal seston and water samples. MC-LR was the most dominant MCs variant, while nodularin was not detected for both sampling sites.

We show that the episodic algae blooming is strongly related to the increased inflows of the residential wastewater from the surrounding watersheds, because the household water use has increased ~3.2% in April 2020, while the runoff into the reservoirs driven by the rainfall was much lower in 2020 compared to the previous year for the same month. In the case of Guarapiranga Reservoir, PC increased nearly 500% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Given the importance of Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs for the water supply of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), the abrupt occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms related to the state’s lockdown should be considered a major concern for public and environmental health of the region.

Given data on cellulose content, hemicellulose content, and their relative convertibility, miscanthus is expected to be 11% more efficient at conversion to biofuels than switchgrass under the biochemical conversion route. Based on this scenario of improved conversion efficiency and associated profit, we simulate an 11% price premium for miscanthus over other feedstocks in a base‐case scenario. By adding this price premium, supplies of miscanthus increase over the base case by about 4 million (44%), 94 million (64%), and 166 million (94%) tons in year 0, 10, and 20 after simulated contracts for production are initiated respectively. These results emphasize that custom simulations are needed to quantify feedstock availability if supplies are intended to reflect grower response to industry demands for feedstock quality specifications. Farmers can grow ‘peas or carrots’, and price signals from biorefineries will influence what energy crops they produce. Recognizing that the energy crop mix is tractable according to quality characteristics is relevant both for near‐term and long‐term biofuels research and development. We recommend accounting for market preferences for quality attributes when estimating potential future supplies of energy crops. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

In order to improve the transient response of the system, a dynamic bias circuit is designed, which can automatically track the change of load current. In addition, the temperature coefficient of bandgap reference in conventional LDO is generally 20-100 ppm/°C. The bandgap reference circuit proposed in this paper can achieve 1.73 ppm/°C without trimming, and the accuracy is better than 1% at all process corner. The design and simulation are based on TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS process, the simulation results show that the LDO output voltage is 1 V when input power supply voltage is 1.2 V. The proposed regulator can operate with a minimum dropout voltage of 200 mV when load current is 50 mA. The maximum undershoot and overshoot voltages are 34 mV and 28 mV, respectively, with 1mA-50mA and 50mA-1mA step load current.</jats:p>",

This research is aimed to identify water supply, agricultural water demand, and calculate water supply-demand balance in various planting scenarios using Verhulst Logistic Logarithm. The results of the analysis indicated that the potential of water supply in 2020 will be 21,752.48 MCM and the projection in 2050 will be 25,381.01 MCM. The total agricultural water demand will be 21,615.32 MCM (in 2020) and 20,970.03 MCM (estimation in 2050). The total water demand for one cropping will be 7,952.83 MCM and 7,772.10 MCM (projection in 2050), for two croppings 15,392.47 MCM and 14,976.32 MCM (projection in 2050), and for three croppings 21,752.48 MCM and 22,515.52 MCM (projection in 2050). The analysis of water supply-demand balance in each district area for one and two croppings in 2020 and 2050 show a surplus, whereas for three croppings, some regions showed a deficit. If the trend of water supply is known, the phenomenon of climate change can be identified and anticipated.</jats:p>",

The authors assess contemporary trends in small-scale farming in Russia and identify the main regions with a concentration of individual subsidiary farms in agricultural production. The main trends in the development of personal subsidiary farms are considered on the example of the Altai Krai. In individual subsidiary farms, the number of livestock and poultry decreases, and the number of bee families increases. Individual subsidiary farms remain the primary producers of potatoes, vegetables, wool, commercial honey, milk, cattle, meat, and poultry. The production marketability tends to increase but remains low. The reserve for the growth of sales volume due to production and marketing cooperation is practically not used since only five cooperatives are operating. The authors grouped the factors hindering the development of households, considering the demographic, behavioral, organizational, financial, and legal aspects of small businesses. In rural areas with a concentration of production in individual subsidiary farms, demographic indicators are at the regional average values. In addition, the labor market tension is lower than the average for the area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The eutrophic Lake Eichbaumsee, a ~1 km long and 280 m wide (maximum water depth 16 m) dredging lake southeast of Hamburg (Germany), has been treated for water quality improvements using various techniques (i.e., aeration plants, removal of dissolved phosphorous by aluminum phosphorous precipitation, and by Bentophos® (Phoslock Environmental Technologies, Sydney, Australia), adsorption) during the past ~15 years. Despite these treatments, no long-term improvement of the water quality has been observed and the lake water phosphorous content has continued to increase by e.g., ~670 kg phosphorous between autumn 2014 and autumn 2019. As no creeks or rivers drain into the lake and hydrological groundwater models do not suggest any major groundwater discharge into the lake, sources of phosphorous (and other nutrients) are unknown. We investigated the phosphorous fluxes from sediment pore water and from groundwater in the water body of the lake. Sediment pore water was extracted from sediment cores recovered by divers in August 2018 and February 2019. Diffusive phosphorous fluxes from pore water were calculated based on phosphorus gradients. Stable water isotopes (δ2H, δ18O) were measured in the lake water, in interstitial waters in the banks surrounding the lake, in the Elbe River, and in three groundwater wells close to the lake. Stable isotope (δ2H, δ18O) water mass balance models were used to compute water inflow/outflow to/from the lake. Our results revealed pore-water borne phosphorous fluxes between 0.2 mg/m2/d and 1.9 mg/m2/d. Assuming that the measured phosphorous fluxes are temporarily and spatially representative for the whole lake, about 11 kg/a to 110 kg/a of phosphorous is released from sediments. This amount is lower than the observed lake water phosphorous increase of ~344 kg between April 2018 and November 2018. Water stable isotope (δ2H, δ18O) compositions indicate a water exchange between an aquifer and the lake water. Based on stable isotope mass balances we estimated an inflow of phosphorous from the aquifer to the lake of between ~150 kg/a and ~390 kg/a. This result suggests that groundwater-borne phosphorous is a significant phosphorous source for the Eichbaumsee and highlights the importance of groundwater for lake water phosphorous balances.</jats:p>"

Building on earlier work, we proposed a general method for visualizing detailed supply chains across geographic space, applying the preferential attachment rule to gravity equations in the network context; we then provided illustrations for U.S. extractive, manufacturing, and service industries, also highlighting differences in rural–urban interdependencies across these sectors. The resulting visualizations may be helpful for better understanding supply chain geographies, as well as business interconnections and interdependencies, and to anticipate and potentially address vulnerabilities to different types of shocks.</jats:p>"

As a potential solution, this paper proposes a new business model for a multi-echelon Supply Chain inventory management pattern. Specifically, an inventory model with proactive lateral transshipments was developed and subsequently tested carrying out 288 experiments with the aim of assessing transshipments impact on the performance of a two-echelon Supply Chain. The final goal was to investigate the potential reduction of the overall cost of the enterprise and, conversely, whether this approach could promote significant improvements in the level of service, achievable through a more efficient management of resources. The analyses and simulations indicate the use of large batches and/or low-cost products did not demand the necessity of transshipment events. These preliminary findings could be potentially validated and tested in the future considering more complex networks or multiple products.</jats:p>",

In fact, phthalate has been identified as the cause of serious health conditions and its impact within the operation of logistic processes has not been studied. In this work, we perform research on the generation of phthalate as the control on these emissions is important to adjust the supply strategy to reduce the human risk exposure and contamination of the environment. For this purpose, generation of phthalate is modeled through the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and its impact on the supply strategy is assessed through its integration within a stochastic inventory control model. As presented, it is possible to adjust the supply strategy to reduce the cumulative generation of phthalate within the warehouse and thus reduce its impact on human health and environment sustainability.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study is to assess the risk of long-term soil salinization by considering the agricultural practices mentioned in the project for the ‘Water Quality’ experiment in the semi-arid region of Cherfech (Tunisia). A Hydrus-1D model was used to simulate the movement of water and the transfer of salts. Soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters were estimated using inverse modeling. Calibration and validation of the model were made for the water and salt profiles carried out with four irrigation qualities QA, QB, QC and QD. Four scenarios over 50 years were studied: (i) S1 with rainfall (400 mm) only; (ii) S2 with rainfall and irrigation (1,400 mm); (iii) S3 with a 2 °C increase in temperature; (iv) S4 with the addition of 100 mm·d−1 of rainfall. The four scenarios highlighted the high risk of soil salinization, especially for the QB, QC and QD qualities after 20 years of irrigation and the deep dynamics of water and salts beyond the root zone which increases the risk of groundwater salinization.</jats:p>",

Its closeness to Addis Ababa city has attracted industrial, urban development, and population growth. This development has created problems with drinking water shortages in the community. This study aimed at determining the household's willingness to pay (WTP) amount toward improving water supply services and analyzing the influencing factors of WTP. A contingent valuation (CV) technique was applied in quantifying the households' WTP and the influencing factors toward the program. The field observations, key informant interviews, and household questionnaire interviews from 250 respondents out of the targeted 280 were employed in collecting field data. Results from CV revealed that 66% of the households were WTP toward improving the water supply services beyond their current monthly water bills. Households were WTP about 20 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) above the average current water bill of 161 ETB. The binary logistic model results statistically demonstrated that independent variables of gender, age, marital status, education level, years in Sebeta, and average monthly income were significantly influencing the household's WTP at p = 0.01 and 0.05. This study provides vital hints for further research and baseline information for local administration and communities about the water supply in the area and holistic appropriation of water tariffs in line with government policy.</jats:p>",

This study aims at investigating and assessing risks on the supply chain, especially for health care supplies. The theme of the article is based on the development of an information-driven model to help in the assessment of supply chain risk. An integrative review technique has been used to analyze literature to develop prepositions for the model. The main actors of the model are supply chain preparedness, supply chain risk, supply chain response, and supply chain recovery. The findings identify that timely preparation and assessment of supply chain risk can result in accurate adoption of the practices that can not only reduce supply chain risk but also enhance supply chain recovery during any catastrophic event. </jats:p>",

The timely production and distribution of harvested crops and fruits are essential because of the increased demand across the globe. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, one third of the food produced for consumption is lost or wasted worldwide, amounting to approximately 1.3 billion tons per year. The productivity of the farm’s yield decreases mainly because of unstandardized processes. The employment of an optimal supply chain management scheme must be the key to the situation. This would not only promote consumer shielding; however, it will jointly help corporations sustain economic supply chains. Due to health and socio-economic consequences, the most vulnerable population groups’ food security is likely to decline further (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2020). The agriculture sector’s supply chain faces many challenges, such as inadequacy of information flow, lack of logistics efficiency, lack of infrastructure and storage facilities, lack of risk mitigation systems that are critical during unforeseen disruptions. The paper identifies various risks in the supply chain and their ability to disrupt the supply chain in terms of severity, food insecurity, and sustainability. A study has been done among a hundred stakeholders, and thirty experts from the field, and the exploratory research suggests possible approaches to these challenges using technology.</jats:p>"

Three dynamic games are well-studied by considering the multiple effects of price and non-price factors on the market.

When the manufacturer opts for a cost-sharing program, the manufacturer and retailer under Model-D are always economically better off, and therefore a cost-sharing program is always profit-Pareto-improving. </jats:p>",

Mainly related to large, slow-running gear drives such as used in heavy industry applications, grease lubrication can also be the preferred solution for small, fast running gear drives. Conse-quently, the calculation of the wear service life within the gear design process is essential. Due to their flowing properties, there is a danger of losing the lubrication supply depending on the operating conditions, boundary conditions and grease properties. While a circulating lubricant ensures a continuous lubricant supply to the gear mesh, channeling includes the risk of starved lubrication and consequentially, even a discontinuation of the lubricating film that can lead to heavy damages of the gearbox. The experimental investigations on a modified FZG back-to-back test rig show a strong effect of operating conditions and grease properties on the lubricant supply: A higher amount of grease in the gearbox and a higher lubricant temperature support circulating, whereas, a higher consistency of the grease supports channeling. Based on the results, a first calculation approach is developed that approximates the lubricant supply of grease lubricated gears for the gear design process.</jats:p>",

However, less attention has been paid to sustainability orientation as a direct driver of a firm’s innovativeness leading towards long term business performance. In this study, sustainable supply chain drivers, strategic sustainability orientation and firm performance have been evaluated. The mediating concepts such as corporate environmental management and corporate social responsibility impacting the relationship between strategic sustainability orientation and firm performance have been tested too. The results illustrate that employees’ motivation and managerial attitude have positive impacts on strategic sustainability orientation and on the other hand strategic sustainability orientation with the mediating roles of corporate environmental management and corporate social responsibility has a positive effect on firm performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines trade credit strategy in a supply chain framework including one manufacturer and two competitive retailers under a Cournot game setting. We consider three supply chain models depending on how many retailers have capital constraints: (i) Model NN (i.e., none of the retailers has capital constraints); (ii) model AN (i.e., a single retailer has capital constraint); and (iii) model AA (i.e., dual retailers have capital constraints). We analyze equilibrium strategies of supply chain under three models, and show that the manufacturer sets a higher price for a capital-constrained retailer than that for a fund-abundant retailer. Notably, the fund-abundant retailer’s wholesale price is not dependent on its rival’s capital status. Certain numerical experiments have been performed to show the impact of retailer’s competition, market disturbance, and production cost on trade credit financing strategy. Findings reveal that by increasing the horizontal competition intensity, the capital-constrained retailer benefits more from trade credit. With a higher market disturbance or a higher production cost, the manufacturer is more willing to offer trade credit to capital-constrained retailers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>At present, China has a developing natural gas market, and ensuring the security of gas supply is an issue of high concern. Gas supply reliability, the natural gas pipeline system's ability to satisfy the market demand, is determined by both supply side and demand side and is usually adopted by the researches to measure the security of gas supply. In the previous study, the demand side is usually simplified by using load duration curve (LDC) to describe the demand, which neglects the effect of demand side management. The simplification leads to the inaccurate and unreasonable assessment of the gas supply reliability, especially in high-demand situation. To overcome this deficiency and achieve a more reasonable result of gas supply reliability, this paper extends the previous study on demand side by proposing a novel method of management on natural gas demand side, and the effects of demand side management on gas supply reliability is analyzed. The management includes natural gas prediction models for different types of users, the user classification rule, and the demand adjustment model based on user classification. First, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a support vector machine (SVM) model are applied to predict the natural gas demand for different types of users, such as urban gas distributor (including residential customer, commercial customer, small industrial customer), power plant, large industrial customer, and compressed natural gas (CNG) station. Then, the user classification rule is built based on users' attribute and impact of supplied gas's interruption or reduction. Natural gas users are classified into four levels. (1) demand fully satisfied, (2) demand slightly reduced, (3) demand reduced, and (4) demand interrupted. The user classification rule also provides the demand reduction range of different users. Moreover, the optimization model of demand adjustment is built, and the objective of the model is to maximize the amount of gas supplied to each user based on the classification rule. The constraints of the model are determined by the classification rule, including the demand reduction range of different users. Finally, the improved method of gas supply reliability assessment is developed and is applied to the case study of our previous study derived from a realistic natural gas pipeline system operated by PetroChina to analyze the effects of demand side management on natural gas pipeline system's gas supply reliability.</jats:p>",

Debris flows can initiate from landsliding or rilling in soil-mantled portions of the landscape, but there have been few direct observations of debris flow initiation in steep, rocky portions of the landscape that lacdk a thick, continuous soil mantle. We monitored a steep, first-order catchment that burned in the San Gabriel Mountains, California, USA. Following fire, but prior to rainfall, much of the hillslope soil mantle was removed by dry ravel, exposing bedrock and depositing ∼0.5 m of sandy sediment in the channel network. During a one-year recurrence rainstorm, debris flows initiated in the channel network, evacuating the accumulated dry ravel and underlying cobble bed, and scouring the channel to bedrock. The channel abuts a plowed terrace, which allowed a complete sediment budget, confirming that ∼95% of sediment deposited in a debris flow fan matched that evacuated from the channel, with a minor rainfall-driven hillslope contribution. Subsequent larger storms produced debris flows in higher-order channels but not in the first-order channel because of a sediment supply limitation. These observations are consistent with a model for post-fire ravel routing in steep, rocky landscapes where sediment was sourced by incineration of vegetation dams—following ∼30 years of hillslope soil production since the last fire—and transported downslope by dry processes, leading to a hillslope sediment-supply limitation and infilling of low-order channels with relatively fine sediment. Our observations of debris flow initiation are consistent with failure of the channel bed alluvium due to grain size reduction from dry ravel deposits that allowed high Shields numbers and mass failure even for moderate intensity rainstorms.</jats:p>",

Iron (Fe) is a key element in the Earth climate system, as it can enhance\nmarine primary productivity in the high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC)\nregions where, despite a high concentration of major nutrients,\nchlorophyll production is low due to iron limitation. Eolian mineral dust\nrepresents one of the main Fe sources to the oceans; thus, quantifying its\nvariability over the last glacial cycle is crucial to evaluate its role in\nstrengthening the biological carbon pump. Polar ice cores, which preserve\ndetailed climate records in their stratigraphy, provide a sensitive and\ncontinuous archive for reconstructing past eolian Fe fluxes. Here, we show\nthe Northern Hemisphere Fe record retrieved from the NEEM ice core\n(Greenland), which offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the past Fe\nfluxes in a portion of the Arctic over the last 108 kyr. Holocene Fe fluxes\n(0.042–11.7 ka, 0.5 mg m−2 yr−1) at the NEEM site were 4 times lower than the average recorded over the last glacial period (11.7–108 ka, 2.0 mg m−2 yr−1), whereas they were greater during the\nLast Glacial Maximum (LGM; 14.5–26.5 ka, 3.6 mg m−2 yr−1)\nand Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4; 60–71 ka, 5.8 mg m−2 yr−1). Comparing the NEEM Fe record with paleoceanographic records\nretrieved from the HNLC North Pacific, we found that the coldest periods,\ncharacterized by the highest Fe fluxes, were distinguished by low marine\nprimary productivity in the subarctic Pacific Ocean, likely due to the\ngreater sea ice extent and the absence of major nutrients upwelling. This\nsupports the hypothesis that Fe fertilization during colder and dustier\nperiods (i.e., LGM and MIS 4) was more effective in other regions, such as\nthe midlatitude North Pacific, where a closer relationship between marine\nproductivity and the NEEM Fe fluxes was observed.\n                    </jats:p>"

But other sources of energy may need to be added, because hydro energy is subject to good rain patterns, threatened by the spectre of climate change, as already indicated by the current prolonged hours of load shedding by state-owned , Zambia Electricity Supply Company. This research looks at state-of-art mining technologies and collaborative business processes that leverage on the expected ramp in copper and cobalt (Cu-Co) global demand post-Covid-19, to help design resilient business systems by manufacturing, source goods and services within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region to lower Cu-Co production costs, and maximise profits through shared resources and bilateral trade agreements. With evidence, projection and predictions by global leaders in the Cu-Co industry, this study evaluates the preparedness and resilience of the Zambian mining industry for sustainable energy supply, environmental sustainability, and suggests some possible business collaborations within the SADC region to share the following resources: metal refineries, transportation of goods and services, expertise and energy supplies within SADC, to enhance business sustainability. The study shows that the resilience of Cu-Co business in resource-rich nations like Zambia is complex and is heavily influenced by investment decisions, stakeholder interests, copper ore grades and extractive process types, reliable power supply, and socio-economic and political issues. The significance of this study is that it proposes some business collaborations within SADC that can increase energy reliability and supply, Cu-Co production, increase business resilience, improve global competitiveness and sustainability by exploring energy efficiency and generation-mix strategy.

This paper answers the following questions; (1) Can the urban–rural divide in voting behavior be explained by the fact that urban and non-urban populations differ in terms of education, income and other individual characteristics of voters, or by variations in immigration? (2) Can variations in public service supply explain parts of the urban–rural divide in far-right populist support? and (3) How does population growth and public services relate to voting behavior when examining urban and rural municipalities separately? The analyses combine survey data on individual characteristics and register data aggregated on municipalities. The results in this paper suggest that voter characteristics and immigration explain a substantial part of the urban–rural divide. However, the propensity to vote for a far-right populist party is still higher in regions with lower population growth even when controlling for individual characteristics and immigration. When considering public service supply, the urban–rural divide is further weakened. The propensity to vote for a far-right party decreases with higher public service supply and higher share of immigrants. The findings in this paper thereby support the hypothesis that individuals in shrinking areas with lower access to public services are likely to respond to the deterioration of their location by casting a vote on the far-right (i.e., protest voting).</jats:p>",

Many studies, carried out near the basin outlet, have suggested that the dam impounds significant sediment, resulting in shoreline retreat of the Chao Phraya Delta. In this study, the impact of damming on the sediment regime is analyzed through the sediment variation along the Ping River. The results show that the Ping River drains a mountainous region, with sediment mainly transported in suspension in the upper and middle reaches. By contrast, sediment is mostly transported as bedload in the lower basin. Variation of long-term total sediment flux data suggests that, while the Bhumibol Dam does effectively trap sediment, there was only a 5% reduction in sediment supply to the Chao Phraya River system because of sediment additions downstream.</jats:p>"

The predominance of phytoplankton species, especially Aphanizomenon flos aquae (Cyanophyta), Gomphosphaeria lacustris (Cyanophyta), Microcystis aeruginosa (Cyanophyta), Nostoc punctiforme (Cyanophyta), Oscillatoria limnetica (Cyanophyta), Pediastrum simplex (Chlorophyta), and Melosira granulata (Bacillariophyta) in treated water was much less than that in raw water. Trihalomethanes (THMs) levels in treated waters were higher than in raw water, while lower concentrations of heavy metals were recorded in treated water. Intracellular levels of microcystins were lower, whereas the extracellular levels were higher in treated water than raw water, and the former recorded the highest level in raw water during summer. Hence, the levels of dissolved microcystins and THMs in treated water were higher especially during summer, the season of luxurious growth of Microcystis species. Trophic state index (TSI) was relatively high in raw water compared with treated water due to high concentrations of nutrients (total-P, total-N, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia) in raw water.</jats:p>",

Like any other Saharian city in a developing country, the city is facing the challenges of rapid urbanization and the need to improve wastewater treatment and management. The main objective of this work is to assess the performance of waste stabilization ponds in an arid area. This evaluation concerns microbiological and physico-chemical monitoring over three and twelve months respectively. Microbiological results indicate bacterial elimination rates of over 90% in autumn–winter due to the effectiveness of facultative ponds with 20–25 days of retention time, water clarity, ponds depth, and high sunlight exposure and penetration. Physico-chemical parameters surpass the Moroccan standards for reuse except Ph and T0 by 20–30%, this wastewater is relatively loaded with various pollutants, especially high organic load and low oxygen content. Statistical analysis has been made by principal component analysis (PCA), and confirms that dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, COD and BOD5 do not reach the threshold for discharge into the natural environment, and moreover their reuse. For the improvement of the quality of these waters, it is legitimate to provide an upgrade of this plant by a tertiary treatment with maturation ponds.</jats:p>",

Technologies, such as blockchain, big-data, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing and cloud-computing, are all hot topics. Motivated by their importance, in this paper, we conduct a review of the closely related literature in the well-established mainstream operational research (OR) journals. From our research, we first examine the OR literature on Industry 4.0 related studies. Then we classify the technology-operations-related literature into three major categories, namely, information technologies for supply chain operations, technologies for sustainable operations, and technologies for production operations. Various less popular areas on technology-driven operations in supply chains, namely, technology licensing and outsourcing (TLO), online data, and risk, finance and security (RFS), are also examined. From the reviews, we identify the major research gaps. After that, we establish a future research agenda. We believed that this paper lays the foundation for further OR studies on technology-driven supply chain management in the Industry 4.0 era. </jats:p>",

The protection and re-closing of substation outgoing line are used to coordinate with the time limit characteristics of voltage-time type switch to isolate fault and recover power supply automatically. The access of small hydro-power (SH) makes the distribution system present multi power pattern. In this paper, based on LFA considering SH access, in order to achieve the goal that SH can operate in isolated network with load after fault, LFA under the mode of customer power supply priority (LFAUP) with adaptive opening time for switch is proposed. When the fault point is located on the grid side of the quasi power balance switch (QPBS) and the isolated network is on its load side, the switch can automatically isolate all types of short circuit fault from the load side without residual voltage locking (also known as X locking). When the power of the isolated network is balanced, the loads in which will not get power failure. Simulation results show LFAUP advanced in the paper is correct and feasible.</jats:p>",

It is noted that the vast majority of PT in rural areas have a very low load factor, which leads to an increase in specific losses of electric energy when this is transmitted to various consumers. It is planned to optimize the existing synchronized power supply systems in rural areas by creating new power supply projects in such a way as to integrate existing power sources and ensure the most efficient loading of power transformers for the subsequent transfer of these systems to isolated ones that receive power from distributed generation facilities. As an example, we use data from an electric grid company on loading power transformers in one of the districts of the Irkutsk region. Issues related to the determination of electric energy losses in rural PT at different numerical values of their load factors are considered. A computing device was developed using modern programming tools in the MATLAB system, which has been used to calculate and plot the dependence of power losses in transformers of various capacities on the actual and recommended load factors, as well as the dependence of specific losses during the transit of 1 kVA of power through a power transformer at the actual, recommended and optimal load factors. The analysis of specific losses of electric energy at the actual, recommended and optimal load factors of PT is made. Based on the analysis, the intervals of optimal load factors for different rated power of PT of rural distribution electric networks are proposed. It is noted that to increase the energy efficiency of PT, it is necessary to reduce idling losses by increasing the load of these transformers, which can be achieved by reducing the number of transformers while changing the configuration of 0.38 kV distribution networks.</jats:p>"

This has a direct bearing on the reduction of natural resources, the negative impact on the environment as well as the rise of social concerns due to increased product costs, pollution, etc. Full sustainability of this type of systems can be achieved by optimizing all activities across the chain of raw materials, through production to customers while considering all aspects of sustainability - environmental, economic and social. The study proposes a multi-objective modelling approach for optimal design of three-echelon supply chain (SC) for production of dairy products according to different recipes where all aspects of sustainability are taken into consideration. The approach was implemented on a real case study from Bulgaria. Four mix integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization models were defined without and with social impact consideration. They are solved using General Algebriac Modeling System (GAMS) software. The obtained results have shown how the social impact assessment affects the obtained optimal products portfolios and profits. In these cases, varying the values of environmental constraints also affect the products portfolios and profits without affect the social costs. The stricter constraints on the environment impact leads to higher economic costs and lower profits, and conversely, high values of environmental constraints result in higher profits and lower economic costs. The obtained solutions can be used in the decision-making process to achieve social sustainability of the considered dairy supply chain.</jats:p>"

Second, a DC unbalanced power coordinated distribution strategy under abnormal conditions is used based on the dynamic priority control to ensure power supply security of the critical AC lines. Third, the controller parameters of CCUP grid converters are calculated. Through a simple control process, the number of the regulation converters is dynamically scheduled according to the DC unbalanced power. The DC fault influence range on the urban power grid can be limited in a sufficiently small area. Simulation verified the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</jats:p>"

During the operation of continuous technological processes, a power failure even for a short period of time leads to significant economic damage. The most modern technical solution to this problem is the creation of guaranteed power supply systems using diesel power plants (DES) and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), based on rechargeable batteries and supercapacitor modules. It is proposed to use supercapacitors in parallel with the battery in order to ensure the stable operation of the diesel generators under starting conditions, as well as during load transfer. In this case, when using supercapacitors, it becomes possible to reduce the power capacity of the generators and uninterruptible power supplies along with the size of their batteries. Therefore, the cost of the solution decreases and its energy efficiency increases. To test the efficiency of the system, a computer model was created using MATLAB. The system showed a successful operation in supplying the load from all the power sources as well as maintaining Unity Power Factor at the Mains/Generator side.</jats:p>",

Make better technical and economic use. When the distributed power supply is connected to the distribution network, it will cause the trend size and direction of each branch to change, so that the system loss is not only related to the load size, but also related to the location and capacity of DG. Therefore, it is important to study the rational planning of DG in depth. In order to improve the system network loss effectively, a distributed power distribution power distribution network reactive optimization model with the minimum active loss of the system is established, and an improved multi-target firefly algorithm is proposed for the problem that the traditional firefly algorithm will oscillate repeatedly near the extreme point later in the iteration. In view of the shortcomings of the traditional firefly algorithm, which is easy to precocious and over-dependent on control parameters, the chaotic search strategy and global idea are integrated into the firefly algorithm, and an improved firefly algorithm is proposed, which is applied to solve the planning problem of distributed power supply. The example shows that the proposed algorithm has good practicability and adaptability, and also verifies the practical significance of the proposed model<jats:sup>[1]</jats:sup>.</jats:p>",

Countries that have large hydrocarbon reserves such as the Republic of Kazakhstan are no exception. The main challenges of using renewable energy sources in these countries are related not only to their spatial and temporal variety, but also to the high cost of produced energycomparing to the traditional energy B sources based on hydrocarbon fuel. The solution to the mentioned problems can be achieved by optimizing the use of renewable energy resources, which requires a comprehensive analysis of the territory in terms of physical-geographic conditions and economic factors. The article offers methodological approaches and the results from a spatial analysis of the energy supply potential to consumers in the Republic of Kazakhstan using the cartography tools. It takes into account not only the distribution of resource potential, but also the environmental factors (specially protected natural areas, water conservation zone, etc.) limiting the installation of power plants based on RES, and the energy consumption schedule. Economic factors include the performance of typical power plants based on RES, as well as the present value of potentially generated energy.</jats:p>",

Numerous programmes have been implemented in order to secure jobs for the unemployed in the labour market; however, the number of unemployed graduates keeps on increasing. It is significant to recognise the main reason behind this issue to tackle the risk of long-term unemployment, specifically from the supply side. Using the Relative Importance Index (RII), this study investigated 402 respondents at selected job fairs to identify the cause of their difficulty in entering the labour market. The findings revealed that the unemployed people believe that the principal cause of their unemployment is the lack of suitable jobs for them in the market.

A field monitoring study on two UK rivers invaded by signal crayfish (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</jats:italic></jats:styled-content>) assessed the impact of burrowing on bank erosion processes. Erosion pins were installed in 17 riverbanks across a gradient of crayfish burrow densities and monitored for 22 months. Bank retreat increased significantly with crayfish burrow density. At the bank scale (&lt;6 m river length), high crayfish burrow densities were associated with accelerated bank retreat of up to 253% and more than a doubling of the area of bank collapse compared with banks without burrows. Direct sediment supply by burrowing activity contributed 0.2% and 0.6% of total sediment at the reach (1.1 km) and local bank (&lt;6 m) scales. However, accelerated bank retreat caused by burrows contributed 12.2% and 29.8% of the total sediment supply at the reach and bank scales. Together, burrowing and the associated acceleration of retreat and collapse supplied an additional 25.4 t km<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> a<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of floodplain sediments at one site, demonstrating the substantial impact that signal crayfish can have on fine sediment supply. For the first time, an empirical relation linking animal burrow characteristics to riverbank retreat is presented. The study adds to a small number of sediment budget studies that compare sediment fluxes driven by biotic and abiotic energy but is unique in isolating and measuring the substantial interactive effect of the acceleration of abiotic bank erosion facilitated by biotic activity. Biotic energy expended through burrowing represents an energy surcharge to the river system that can augment sediment erosion by geophysical mechanisms.</jats:p>",

In which, supply chain operations, particularly agri-food management, becomes a prosperous beneficiary from blockchain technology. In the local context, Vietnam has been achieved the competitive advantages in agricultural production among the world in some agri-food products such as black peppercorn, cashew nuts, coffee, coconut, rice, and rubber. Furthermore, Vietnam is considered as one of pioneers in implementing blockchain technology for traceability and transparency of agri-food products across Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. However, design and implementation of the blockchain technology application in agri-food production in the case of Vietnam agriculture industry have been confronted with opportunities and challenges, besides its strengths and weaknesses in nature. This paper aims to concentrating on the analysis of Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) of blockchain-applied supply chain relevant to agri-food products. In addition, the application of blockchain technology in supply chains has been expected to promote the sustainable development of Vietnam agriculture, in the accordance with the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the 21st century.

According to the different required functions of the natural gas pipeline network, its reliability is divided into three aspects, namely mechanical reliability, hydraulic reliability, and gas supply reliability. However, most of the previous studies confused the definitions of the hydraulic reliability and gas supply reliability. Moreover, the uncertainty in the process of supplying natural gas to the targeted market and the hydraulic characteristic of the natural gas pipeline network are often ignored. Therefore, a methodology to assess hydraulic reliability and gas supply reliability of the natural gas pipeline network is developed in the study, and the uncertainty and hydraulic characteristic of the natural gas pipeline network are both considered. The methodology consists of four parts: establishment of the indicator system, calculation of the gas supply, prediction of the market demand, and assessment of the hydraulic reliability and gas supply reliability. Moreover, a case study is applied to confirm the feasibility of the methodology, and the reliability evaluation results provide a comprehensive picture about the abilities of the natural gas pipeline network to perform the specified gas supply function and satisfy consumers' demand, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison between these two types of reliability is presented. The results indicate that the natural gas pipeline network may not be able to meet the market demand even if the system completes the required gas supply tasks due to the impact of the market demand uncertainty.</jats:p>",

This study selected the carbon sequestration service in Yantai as an example and carried out a study on the measurement of ecological compensation based on the ecosystem services supply and demand. Moreover, this study clarified the whole process of the generation, circulation and social demand docking of ecological benefits from the perspective of “nature-society”, proposed a spatial flow characterization method for carbon sequestration services, and described the “externality” spillover of ecosystem services. The results showed that most areas of Yantai belonged to the ecological surplus area, which were important sources of carbon sequestration services. Ecological compensation was needed, with a total amount of about 2.2 billion yuan. Qixia, Muping and Penglai had greater comparative ecological radiation force (CERF), and the total amount of carbon sequestration services transferred to the external areas was large. Although the carbon sequestration flows of Yantai showed a spatial decay law, there were significant differences in the direction of different districts and cities. The study can provide a reference for achieving sustainable development of Yantai and formulating ecological compensation policy.</jats:p>"

In Russia, in connection with the introduction and implementation of government support measures for solar, wind, bioenergy, starting in 2013, a large-scale introduction of energy-generating facilities began. This factor, as well as the need to solve the problem of recycling waste from the municipal sector, agriculture and forestry, makes it necessary to use local renewable energy resources, including waste. This approach helps to optimize the regional energy system, even if they are grid connected. The paper discusses the methods and potential for optimizing energy supply in the regions of southern Russia, which has a high population density, a significant deficit in energy balance, and problems in the field of solid waste processing. The basis for this work is the use of municipal sector waste as an energy resource, with an assessment of the economic and environmental efficiency of this process. The use of geoinformation technologies provides a spatial analysis of the resource potential, a comparative analysis of the distribution of energy production and consumption within the region, as well as helps to assess the availability of territories for the optimal placement of solid municipal waste processing facilities.</jats:p>",

Recent research and practices have shown that cloud-based ERP systems if implemented correctly could be a great beneficial advantage to the logistics and supply chain process of a large organization. Unfortunately, the implementation has been slow in the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). Reports have shown that there is a need to re-engineer linkages between service systems within the growing organizations. From the perspective of an enterprise like NIMASA, only limited research has been conducted that has played an important role in intimating the organization towards the adoption of a cloud-based ERP system as well as the post-implementation measures. Most recent studies have been conducted only in the context of generic information system adoption. Information system research is not strong enough without considering the articulating system speed and performance of CERP. This study investigates the critical factors influencing the adoption of Cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (CERP) in the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency with a focus on Maritime logistics and supply chain. A structured based questionnaire was administered to 130 senior maritime workers in the Nigerian Maritime industry to extract factors that hinder the adoption of information systems like cloud-based ERP. The quantitative data were analyzed based on the impact ranking to inform a proposed implementation model for a Cloud-based ERP in the organization. The research also highlights some important Critical Success Factors like technology-related factors, funding for technology innovation (Economic and financial factors), Policy related barriers, and how they influence development in the Maritime industry.</jats:p>",

At the same time, two kinds of collaborative transmission process models of supply chain information are established, and simulation analysis is carried out on the two models by the Monte Carlo method to verify the effect of collaborative transmission of information flow in supply chains within big data environments. The major contribution of the work is the design of a supply chain model with the help of big data. The impacts of the Internet of Things with empirical studies and limited models are the focuses of the study. It can be seen from the simulation results that there will be a minimum  to minimise the cost  under the two supply chain information‐transfer process models. The manufacturing cost of the big data platform is about  lower than that of the traditional supply chain, and increased delay costs accordingly lead to increased costs for manufacturers in both supply chains.</jats:p>",

Local water leaks and pipe failures in the water supply system are inevitable problems due to the aging of pipes. Therefore, leakage detection and prevention are required to monitor the integrity of the water supply system. This paper is a fundamental study on the applicability of the smart bolt, which was developed as a monitoring system to detect water leakage in water supply monitoring. Detection experiments were conducted using a smart bolt with a built-in strain sensor and an accelerometer. Through finite element analysis using ANSYS 2019 R2 and tensile strength testing, the strength of the smart bolt was confirmed to have the acceptable tensile strength. The smart bolt used in this study was verified to meet the allowable criteria of torque and tensile stress for a municipal water supply system. The frequency responses of the simulated leakage pipe system, according to the leakage of the valve and the main pipe, were analyzed, and a leak signal at the valve leak point was detected in the 60-Hz band. The main pipe leaking point was observed to produce a leak signal with a much higher-order mode than that of the valve leak point. Therefore, the smart bolt can be applied to detect warning leak signs from water supply valves and to monitor for loosening of the bolts.</jats:p>"

Disasters, either man-made or natural, affect production and supply chains negatively with perilous effects. On the other hand, flexibility and resilience to manage the perpetuated risks in a manufacturing system are vital for achieving a controllable production rate. Still, these performances are strongly dependent on the multi-criteria decision making in the working environment with the policies launched during the crisis. Undoubtedly, health stability in a society generates ripple effects in the supply chain due to high demand fluctuation, likewise due to the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Incorporation of dependent demand factors to manage the risk from uncertainty during this pandemic has been a challenge to achieve a viable profit for the supply chain partners. A non-linear supply chain management model is developed with a controllable production rate to provide an economic benefit to the manufacturing firm in terms of the optimized total cost of production and to deal with the different situations under variable demand. The costs in the model are set as fuzzy to cope up with the uncertain conditions created by lasting pandemic.

Cooling air is supplied using a combination arrangement, with cross-flow and impingement together. The louver consists of a row of film cooling holes, contained within a specially designed device that concentrates and directs the coolant from a slot, so that it then advects as a layer downstream along the test surface. This louver-supplied coolant is then supplemented by coolant which emerges from different rows of downstream film cooling holes. The same coolant supply passage is employed for the louver row of holes, as well as for the film cooling holes, such that different louver and film cooling mass flowrates are set by different hole diameters for the two different types of cooling holes. The results are different from data provided by past investigations, because of the use and arrangement of the louver slot, and because of the unique coolant supply configurations. The experimental results are given for mainstream Reynolds numbers from 107,000 to 114,000. Full-coverage blowing ratios are constant with streamwise location along the test surface and range from 3.68 to 5.70. Corresponding louver slot blowing ratios then range from 1.72 to 2.65. Provided are heat transfer coefficient and adiabatic effectiveness distributions, which are measured along the mainstream side of the test plate. Both types of data show less variation with streamwise development location, relative to results obtained without a louver employed, when examined at the same approximate effective blowing ratio, mainstream Reynolds number, cross-flow Reynolds number, and impingement jet Reynolds number. When compared at the same effective blowing ratio or the same impingement jet Reynolds number, spanwise-averaged heat transfer coefficients are consistently lower, especially for the downstream regions of the test plate, when the louver is utilized. With the same type of comparisons, the presence of the louver slot results in significantly higher values of adiabatic film cooling effectiveness (spanwise-averaged), particularly at and near the upstream portions of the test plate. With such characteristics, dramatic increases in thermal protection are provided by the presence of the louver slot, the magnitudes of which vary with the experimental condition and test surface location.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of economic globalization, the competition among enterprises is increasingly fierce. Therefore, companies need close information sharing to realize the integration of supply chain. This article aims to study the collaborative management and information sharing mechanism of supply chain inventory based on cloud computing and 5G Internet of Things. This article first introduces the theory and methods of collaborative supply chain management and the information exchange mechanism and then discusses the problem of information sharing in the supply chain, that is, the bullwhip phenomenon, and then from the demand forecast, supply chain structure, time lag, and shortage game, six aspects are analyzed. The cause of the bullwhip phenomenon is analyzed. Secondly, this article proposes a quantitative analysis of the bullwhip effect, establishes a mathematical model of the bullwhip effect in the supply chain, and uses quantitative analysis to analyze the value of information sharing in the supply chain. Finally, this article uses cloud computing technology to build a supply chain information collaboration system architecture and uses EPC Internet of Things to build a supply chain information sharing model and describes the entire operation process of the supply chain. The experimental results of this paper show that the application of cloud computing technology to supply chain management establishes a system platform for supply chain information sharing, improves the overall operational efficiency of supply chain management, and realizes supply chain information sharing and business collaboration. In addition, the operating costs and risks of each node enterprise in the supply chain are reduced by 12% compared with the nonsharing situation, which also shows that the overall benefits of the supply chain have been correspondingly improved and market competitiveness has been enhanced.</jats:p>",

There is scope for improving the operational efficiency of such processes using real-time monitoring systems. The present study aimed to evaluate the performance of an activated biosorbent prepared from the leaves of Acalypha indica for treating textile industry effluent by simulating process control with real-time monitoring. Batch experiments were performed with synthetic and real-time dye effluents to identify the optimum conditions (pH = 3.0, dosage = 1.0 g/L; time = 1 h) for the highest adsorption capacity (6 mg g−1 and 2 mg g−1). The evaluation of physical parameters suggested best fit for Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The LabVIEW-based simulation control system enabled close monitoring of pH and temperature during the process. Based on the inputs, an alteration of initial pH has resulted in substantial reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (73.91%), turbidity (52.43%) and total dissolved solids (TDS) (19.43%). The average incremental increase was highest for COD (45.80 ± 0.06%) compared to TDS (10.13 ± 0.06%) and turbidity (−1.74 ± 0.03%) for varying dosage (3 g to 11 g). The proposed framework for incorporating a process-control-based monitoring system can help to achieve better performance.</jats:p>",

Specifically, for coastal areas, the main problem faced is the consistency of the results obtained, one of the main causes is a distorted supply chain. In this study, we are trying to design a conceptual framework for decision support systems in order to assist the decision-making process of fisheries business operators in coastal areas in the Kei Islands, Indonesia. With the main objective of expediting the supply chain of fisheries in this region. The design of the DSS that was built was adjusted to the needs of every fishery businessman in this region. So, in addition to web-based DSS framework design, we also conducted surveys on fisheries supply chain processes from capture fishermen and aquaculture farmers to adjust the conditions of needs and empirical problems to design DSS concepts that can help overcome supply chain problems in the fisheries sector in the region.</jats:p>",

This work explores the negative impacts of imbalanced of 10 HP three phase induction motor squirrel-cage fed by three phase IGBT inverter at full load. The drive system has been designed and simulated by MATLAB/Simulink. The inverter switches are controlled by a pulse controller, which consists of two level pulse width modulation (PWM). The results represent the effects on the performance of the motor. The results of the Simulation show the negative impacts of imbalanced non-sinusoidal voltages which are higher than the case of balanced non-sinusoidal voltages.

It was studied the websites of airlines in order to find out the providing level of modern global passenger airlines operating on legacy, low-cost and hybrid business models and to identify the main trends among air carrier to ensure a complete passenger travel chain. The main feature of the world's air carriers is that most of them provide services at the level of 3PL-provider, and only the world's leading air carriers provide the organization of the passenger travel chain at the level of 3+PL-provider. The generalized scheme of providing for a passenger travel chain involving air transport for the purpose of definition of a role of each type of logistics provider and their collaboration in such chains was constructed. For example, 3–PL, 3PL, 3+PL air carriers can involve 2 PL-companies in the performance of business processes in the passenger chain. At the same time, the air carrier of 4PL-level will involve performers from 2 PL 3-PL, 3PL levels in the processes of the travel chain. On the virtual 5 PL platform, the passenger will independently choose performers from different levels of providing according to their own needs.</jats:p>"

The SRL supply chain predominantly provides live lobsters, which includes wet holding in fishing vessels, sea-cages, or processing facilities for periods of up to several months. Survival, quality, and safety of this largely exported high-value product is a major consideration for the industry. In a controlled experiment, SRL were exposed to highly toxic cultures of Alexandrium catenella at field relevant concentrations (2 × 105 cells L−1) in an experimental aquaculture facility over a period of 21 days. While significant PST accumulation in the lobster hepatopancreas has been reported in parallel experiments feeding lobsters with toxic mussels, no PST toxin accumulated in this experiment from exposure to toxic algal cells, and no negative impact on lobster health was observed as assessed via a wide range of behavioural, immunological, and physiological measures.

The new index system aims to evaluate the reliability of the impact of voltage sag from the perspective of the structure, function and safety of industrial users. The specific evaluation methods are mainly composed of direct loss evaluation, indirect loss evaluation and potential safety hazard evaluation. Direct loss refers to the economic loss caused by the interruption of industrial process after the occurrence of voltage sag. Indirect loss refers to the economic loss caused by defective products due to the imperfect industrial production process. The potential safety hazard refers to the potential safety hazard of the production line where the important equipment is located after suffering voltage sag. This paper focuses on the rationality of quantitative evaluation with the principle of economic equivalence, the significance and internal relations of industrial user structure, function and safety index, and puts forward a reasonable calculation method. Through the case calculation, the layered evaluation results are consistent with the empirical conclusions, with applicability.</jats:p>",

Prior research suggests that the complexity of a firm’s supply network is critical in determining its resilience to disruptions, but tensions arise when delineating the precise nature of the relationship between supply network complexity and resilience. In this research, we investigate whether and how three facets of supply network complexity—supply complexity (nodes in the network), logistics complexity (arcs in the network), and product complexity (contents moving through the network)—influence a firm’s ability to resist and recover from disruptions. We empirically investigate this relationship in the context of automotive sector shipments from Japan to the United States before, during, and after the 2011 Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami, using the difference‐in‐differences technique. Results indicate that the relationship between supply network complexity and resilience is multifaceted; some aspects of supply network complexity intensify disruption impact, whereas others enhance disruption recovery.</jats:p>",

In this study, 30 groundwater samples were collected in May 2019, and the data were analyzed using geographic information system, factor analysis, positive matrix factorization, and risk-based corrective action models. The results indicated that the F− concentration of the groundwater samples ranged from 0.16 to 2.06 mg/L, with a mean value of 1.10 mg/L. The F− concentrations of 53.33% of the groundwater samples exceeded China's maximum permissible limit for drinking water (1.00 mg/L). Quantificational source apportionment revealed that the weathering of F-bearing minerals is the main source (66.20%). Cation exchange (16.30%), agricultural activities (13.20%), and natural geological processes (4.30%) were the other sources of F−. The percentages of infants, children, teens, male adults, and female adults that face health risks due to excess F− intake were approximately 20.00%, 70.00%, 6.67%, 20.00%, and 10.00%, respectively. This research provided useful insights into the proper management of groundwater extraction to mitigate health problems associated with excessive F− intake.</jats:p>",

The use of catalytic converters provides one of the solutions to the problem of lowering the amount of exhaust fumes. As most catalytic converters contain a combination of the three metals Pt, Pd and Rh, the manufacture of catalysts for automobiles is the largest sector of demand for and consumption of PGMs (platinum group metals). In Poland, the recycling system for catalysts is still in the development stage, but there is a significant trend of increase mainly due to EU policy on the circular economy. Due to frequent legal changes, the market is not fully transparent and the price for used catalysts can vary significantly. Therefore, apart from the recycling technology itself, it is important for the company to have a transparent method of testing the catalysts. The aim of this article was to identify the key opportunities and challenges to improving the catalyst recycling system in Poland. The organisational solutions have been analysed to show that an effective system could be implemented by creating a network between suppliers and customers with the use of good laboratory equipment and IT applications. The article defines the key opportunities and challenges such as the need to invest in an innovative laboratory and software for assessment of chemical composition and economic value of waste. A great opportunity for the development of this sector is the high demand for critical raw materials such as PGMs, which can be supported by research and development (R&amp;D) projects.</jats:p>"

In rolling contacts with limited lubricant supply, the film thickness decreases at high rolling speeds, as more lubricant is displaced than replenished. This lubricant depletion is known as starvation and may induce mixed lubrication due to a low film thickness. When estimating the bearing lifetime, a fully flooded lubrication, i.e. an unlimited lubricant supply, is usually assumed. This leads to an overestimation of film thickness in operating ranges where starvation occurs. Thus, considering the onset of starvation is crucial to reduce the risk of premature bearing failures due to high friction and wear in the mixed lubrication regime. Therefore, this contribution presents a method, based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, to calculate the onset of starvation in oil lubricated point contacts.</jats:p>",

Given that the collector recycles used products, four information sharing modes (i.e., no information sharing, information sharing with the manufacturer, information sharing with the collector, and information sharing with both the manufacturer and the collector) are examined in the manufacturer Stackelberg and collector Stackelberg supply chains, respectively. We find that the retailer’s sharing information behavior always benefits for the collector and the entire supply chain. The retailer, however, has no incentive to share demand information voluntarily. As for the manufacturer, the retailer’s sharing information behavior always benefits him in the collector Stackelberg scenario, while may hurt him in the manufacturer Stackelberg scenario. Furthermore, the impact of channel power structure in the four information sharing modes is also discussed. The results show that the manufacturer Stackelberg model or the collector Stackelberg model may be the better structure for chain members depending on the retailer’s demand forecast accuracy.</jats:p>",

In this study, the water footprints of viscose staple fiber blouses and blended men's suits were comprehensively evaluated based on the ISO 14046 standard and the life cycle assessment (LCA) polygon method. The WFA results from our study indicate that the production stage of viscose staple fiber garments has the most significant water resource environmental load. Specifically, the water footprint related to the production of viscose staple fiber for three types of clothing accounted for more than 50% of the total water footprint, with men's 100% viscose staple fiber suits having the largest impact on water resources and the environment. Furthermore, our results indicate that the water alkaline footprint is primarily influenced by the viscose staple fiber production as well as the dyeing and finishing processes. NaOH and Na2CO3 are the main pollutants that caused the water alkaline footprint. In addition, the water ecotoxicity footprint was the major driving factor of water resource environmental load.

Models are formulated in three-stage game structures in five different scenarios, where the government organization determines optimal subsidy by pursuing social welfare maximization. Both manufacturers invest in improving green quality levels of products. The study aims to explore the advantage of vertical integration and strategic collusion from the perspective of green supply chain practice in the presence of subsidy. The key contributions from the present study indicate that under competition, members of both supply chains are able to receive higher profits through horizontal collusion, but green quality levels of the product remain suboptimal. If upstream manufacturers cooperate, government subsidy does not necessarily improve product quality level, and the amount of government expenditure increased substantially. By comparing outcomes where members are vertically integrated with scenarios where members make strategic collusion, we found that the former might outperform by later. Cross-price sensitivity appears as a significant parameter affecting supply chain members’ performance and the amount of government expenditure. Cooperation between members at the horizontal level is a more robust strategic measure than vertical integration if consumers are highly price-sensitive.</jats:p>",

Open costing is a popular costing practice in which a supplier compiles an itemized list of costs rather than a fixed price. To examine the extent to which open costing is practiced as part of BSRs, interviews were conducted with 30 professionals operating as suppliers in China and Bangladesh. A thematic analysis of the interview data identified several factors important to open costing and the BSR, including Mutual Trust, Fairness, Flexibility, Efficiency, and Sustainability.

Market players are allowed to trade electric energy in both futures and day‐ahead electricity markets. The behaviour of market players in each market affects the prices and power transactions of the other market. In this study, the mutual impacts of the futures and day‐ahead electricity markets are studied using a mixed supply function‐Cournot equilibrium model. The day‐ahead electricity market is modelled by Cournot method and futures market negotiations are modelled by the supply function method. The proposed model considers the strategic behaviour of consumers in the futures market, mark‐to‐marketing (MTM) settlement in the futures market, dynamics of market players’ behaviour during the trading period, and transmission system constraints. An upgraded risk management method is also introduced and evaluated. The proposed model is applied to a test system and the impacts of different parameters on the results are discussed.</jats:p>",

The study was underpinned on the Resource Dependence Theory. The null hypothesis that guided the study was: SCPIC have no significant influence on information technology infrastructure of public universities in Kenya. The study employed cross-sectional survey design. The unit of analysis for the study was public universities. Primary data was collected from 31 public universities in Kenya, using structured questionnaire administered to the heads of procurement and ICT departments. A pilot study was conducted. Validity and reliability tests were done using Cronbach Alpha coefficient. To describe profiles of the universities and research variables, means, standard deviations and coefficient of variations were used. Pearson's correlation was used to examine relationships between the variables. Linear regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis. The findings of the study indicated that supply chain process integration capabilities influence information technology infrastructure of public universities in Kenya. By empirically examining the model connecting the variables, the study has contributed to building of scientific knowledge. The study has provided scholars with insights into the role of supply chain process integration capabilities as an independent variable and information technology infrastructure as a dependent variable. The study concluded that supply chain process integration capabilities enhance information technology infrastructure of public universities in Kenya. This is critical in human capital development and capacity building for achievement of The 'Big 4' Agenda in Kenya and realization of Kenya Vision 2030. Public universities should make deliberate efforts to establish strong SCPIC in order to enhance information technology infrastructure of the public universities. The research recommends replication of the study in different sectors and contexts to enhance understanding of the relationship between supply chain process integration capabilities and information technology infrastructure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transformations in the environment occur both under the influence of natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Small rivers are one of the most vulnerable to changes in natural objects. Wastewater is a specific source of pollution for reservoirs: the most frequent pollution of small rivers is caused by flushing from agricultural land. The lower Volga region belongs to regions with unfavorable conditions for water supply, which is caused by a complex of natural and anthropogenic factors. The Saratov region by its geographical location, climate conditions, level of development of socio-economic relations, features of agricultural production largely reflects the regional characteristics of the Lower Volga region and can serve as a model for making management decisions to improve the hygienic conditions of water supply in rural areas of this region. Analysis of the results of laboratory studies, as well as sanitary and topographical study of the coastal zone indicates insufficient implementation of water protection measures on the researched rivers: they are mainly cosmetic in nature and do not contribute to a radical improvement of the sanitary and ecological situation on small rivers. Given the excess of water quality indicators in the flood period, also in the summer, the water of the Nahoy and B. Karaman rivers can be attributed to the second class of water supply sources, which implies the need to clean and disinfect water from these reservoirs when using it for drinking purposes. Values of the total hazard index for small rivers showed a clear seasonal relationship: for samples taken in the summer, they were higher than for samples taken in the spring. The value of non-carcinogenic risk exceeded the acceptable value for all samples, while the greatest contribution to the probability value of risk is made by nitrites, nitrates, iron and manganese, as typical surface water pollutants of arid zone water.</jats:p>",

West Java Province is one of fruits producing centers in Indonesia. Anto Wijaya Fruit is a prominent company of fruits supply, especially for mango, in West Java. This study aims to (1) identify fruit supply chain management before the pandemic, (2) analyze the emerging challenges due to the outbreak, and (3) propose a scheme of fruits supply chain in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the case of Anto Wijaya Fruit. This study was conducted from January to May 2020. Several key persons were interviewed along the chain from the producers up to the end customers. Qualitative analysis was employed in the framework of Food Supply Chain Networking (FSCN). The results showed that, firstly, Anto Wijaya Fruit mango supply chain has not been implemented optimally.

However, internal and external complexity has great influence on these systems. An approach is to increase manufacturing robustness and responsiveness—and thus resilience—by manufacturing control. In order to execute an effective control method, it is necessary to provide sufficient information of high value in terms of data format, quality and time of availability. Nowadays, raw data is available in large quantities. An obstacle to manufacturing control is the short-term handling of events induced by customers and suppliers. These events cause different kinds of turbulence in manufacturing systems. If such turbulences could be evaluated in advance, based on data processing, they could serve as aggregated input data for a control system. This paper presents an approach how to combine turbulence evaluation and the derivation of measures into a learning system for turbulence mitigation. Integrated in manufacturing control, turbulence mitigation increases manufacturing resilience and strengthens the supply network’s resilience.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Power quality and neutral section are two technical problems that hinder the development of electrified railway to high-speed and heavy railway. The co-phase power supply technology is one of the best ways to solve these two technical problems. At present, a V type connection traction transformer is widely used in a power frequency single-phase AC traction power supply system, especially in high-speed railway. In this paper, a new type of co-phase power supply system for electrified railway based on V type connection traction transformer is proposed. One single-phase winding in the V type connection traction transformer is used as main power supply channel, and three ports are used as compensation ports. Neutral section is no longer set with traction substation, and the train is continuously powered through. The independent single-phase Static Var Generators (SVGs) are used to compensate the three-phase imbalance caused by single-phase traction load. When necessary, the power factor can be improved at the same time. The principle, structure, control strategy, and capacity configuration of the technical scheme are analyzed in this paper, and the effectiveness of the scheme is verified by using the measured data of electrified railway. The advantage of this scheme lies in the universal applicability of the V type connection traction transformer, and the flexibility of the SVG device.</jats:p>"

In this study, we assessed various water supply technologies used for mitigating arsenic and salinity in Laksam of Cumilla and Assasuni of Satkhira district. Water samples were analyzed for Arsenic, Iron, Chloride (indicator for salinity) and FC from different water extraction systems (shallow, deep and Tara tubewells), groundwater arsenic treatment units (SIDKO and READ-F), rainwater harvesting systems (RWH), pond sand filters (PSF), and managed aquifer recharge units. Most shallow tubewells, both in Laksam and Assasuni, have been found to produce arsenic contaminated water. But water from deep and Tara tubewells have been found arsenic-free, though high concentration of iron was observed in the wells in Laksam. Rainwater harvesting systems, PSF and MAR units in Assasuni have been found to provide water free from the common chemical contaminants but suffer from high bacterial contamination. Deep tubewell appear to be the most preferred option where a suitable aquifer is available. The community-scale groundwater treatment systems would require strong operation and maintenance support from the service providers to be successful.&#x0D;\nEnviron.

To this end, we distributed a survey to North American port managing bodies and terminal operators. The survey, answered by 37 respondents, follows a structure defined by critical elements affecting stakeholder perceptions and acceptability in relation to a project or an ongoing business activity. The results disclose differences in social license to operate measurement and public engagement practices between port managing bodies and terminal operators. Furthermore, follow-up interviews were conducted with eight port managing bodies in order to capture the value added and the barriers to engage with local communities. Finally, the study enables benchmarking possibilities both within the sample and on a global level, giving an indication and assessment of the respondents’ competitive positions regarding stakeholder perceptions, communication, and engagement practices, and the steps to be taken in order to strengthen any strategic and competitive state.</jats:p>"

The contribution of this research is to explore and evaluate sustainable agility in supply chains for a dairy manufacturing organization located in Saudi Arabia. Other contributions of this research are to update the literature about the different factors contributing to achieve agile supply chain, propose conceptual framework and assessment approach incorporating the relationships between sustainable supply-chain capabilities, enablers, and attributes, and shortlisting the agility barriers and how they would facilitate manufacturing organizations’ performance. The paper presents supply chain agility evaluation approach, which covers identification of agile supply-chain capabilities and drivers. It also presents a conceptual model and a framework to define agility level and barriers within the supply-chain. In the paper, fuzzy logic approach is preferred, owing to its capability to incorporate and deal with problems involving impreciseness and vagueness phenomena. Threshold-value in this study for the case organization is set to 0.24829. The outcome of the adopted approach indicates that 21 attributes performed below the threshold value; these attributes are further categorized as agility barriers. These are the barriers within their supply chain that impact the agility-level. For the case organization, the foremost priority is to enhance maintainability and serviceability to make it flexible and inexpensive to establish an agile responsive supply chain. At the same time, it should have priority to focus on development and integration of their core competencies to deal with cross-functional and cross-enterprise issues in supply chain. For the case organization, the agility level was found “very agile,” although it is below the “extremely agile.” Thus, a study was developed to understand the behaviour of the supply chain agility and assess/evaluate it to support decision makers in order to develop a strategic solution for different organizational barriers.</jats:p>"

Maize, as a main income, has not been able to prosper farmers yet. Structural Equation Modelling was applied to analyze the effectiveness of social capital, supply chain, and competitive advantage on the maize farmers’ income. This study was conducted with 120 maize farmers as samples in one of Indonesia's maize production centers. Three indicators measure each variable. Social capital indicators are trust, social network, and norm; supply chain is the flow of goods, flow of information, and flow of capital; the competitive advantage is cost leadership, product differentiation, and focus.  Furthermore, the indicators of farmers’ income are land area, production, and labor. The study revealed that social capital did not directly impact maize farmers' income by the test variables of social capital, supply chain, and competitive advantage. In this case, in increasing maize farmers’ income, social capital needs to be supported by supply chain and competitive advantage as intervening variables. The study further revealed that social capital significantly affected the supply chain and competitive advantage, in which these two variables significantly influenced maize farmers’ income. Moreover, supply chain and competitive advantage have reinforced social capital to increase maize farmers’ income. From the intervening variables, competitive advantage was more vital to reinforce social capital than supply chain in increasing maize farmers’ income.</jats:p>"

Agronomic biofortification can promisingly improve the plant nutrient concentration without changing the genetic makeup of plants. This study was designed to assess the best method of Mn application to enhance productivity and grain Mn contents under conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) systems. Manganese was delivered through seed coating (250-mg kg−1 seed), osmopriming (0.1-M Mn solution), soil application (1 kg ha−1), and foliar application (0.25-M Mn solution). A general control with no seed Mn application was included, whereas hydropriming and water spray were used as positive control treatments for Mn seed priming and Mn foliar spray, respectively. No tillage had a higher total soil porosity (9%), soil organic carbon (16%), soil microbial biomass carbon (4%), nitrogen (2%), and soil nutrients in the CT system. Manganese nutrition through various methods significantly enhanced the yield, grain biofortification, and net benefits for CT and NT systems. Averaged across two years, the maximum improvement in grain productivity was recorded with osmopriming (28%) followed by foliar application (26%). The highest grain Mn concentration (29% over no application) was recorded with Mn foliar applications under both tillage systems. Moreover, the highest economic returns and marginal net benefits were recorded with osmopriming. To improve the wheat production, profitability, and grain Mn concentration, Mn application through priming and foliar application may be opted.</jats:p>"

The main sources of water are surface waters of the Om and Taburga rivers, lakes and artificial reservoirs, groundwater. In general, the territory of Kormilovka district lacks fresh groundwater. Currently, water is supplied by hydraulic structures on the Omriver as part of water intake and treatment facilities, water pipelines and a pressure distribution network. Water supply from underground sources is carried out from tubular wells with a depth of 5.0 - 9.0 m, from wells with a depth of 200 m and deep-water wells of about 1100 m. Water intakes from underground sources are available in almost all rural settlements, but they are used for technical and (or) economic purposes. An ecological assessment of the state of surface and underground sources isprovided. The results of an analysis of the geological and hydrogeological situation are presented. Of greatest interest are Neogene-Quaternary, Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene and Lower Upper Cretaceous (Pokursky) complexes. According to the generalized characteristics of quality of groundwater from three underground aquifers in Kormilovka district, the most acceptable is the Pokursky aquifer, since itsgroundwaters are less mineralized, softer, more protected, and, consequently, their microbiological and parasitic indicators comply with the sanitary standards. When using both surface and groundwater for household and drinking purposes, it is environmentally safe for the population only after adjusting such indicators as turbidity, color, chlorine, iron, and dry residue content and bringing the microbiological indicators to SanPiN 2.1.4.1074-01 and SanPiN 2.1.4.544-96.</jats:p>",

The research was carried out by means of computer modeling using the Matlab software system based on the developed models of power supply systems (PSS) equipped with ER with energy storage devices. The results obtained show that in standard circuits of PSS for linear consumers with short circuits in the supply network, voltage dips occur, the depth of which reaches 100%. The use of an ER and an energy storage device connected to DC buses allows maintaining voltage at consumer clamps near the nominal value in case of short circuits in the 10 kV feed line and 25 kV overhead contact system. The ER significantly limits the recharge of the short circuit location from the power storage. In addition, on the basis of the ER it is possible to provide the normative quality of electricity considering voltage deviations, asymmetry and harmonic distortions on the 0.4 kV buses of the substation that feeds non-traction consumers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Hazardous materials (hazmat) storage and transportation pose threats to people’s safety and the environment, which creates a need for governments and local authorities to regulate such shipments. This paper proposes a novel mathematical model for what is termed the hazmat closed-loop supply chain network design problem. The model, which can be viewed as a way to combine several directions previously considered in the literature, includes two echelons in the forward direction (production and distribution centers), three echelons in the backward direction (collection, recovery, and disposal centers), and emergency response team positioning. The two objectives of minimizing the strategic, tactical, and operational costs as well as the risk exposure on road networks are considered in this model. Since the forward flow of hazmat is directly related to the reverse flow, and since hazmat accidents can occur at all stages of the lifecycle (storage, shipment, loading, and unloading, etc.), it is argued that such a unified framework is essential. A robust framework is also presented to hedge the optimization model in case of demand and return uncertainty. The performance of both models is evaluated based on a standard dataset from Albany, NY. Considering the trade-offs between cost and risk, the results demonstrate the design of efficient hazmat closed-loop supply chain networks where the risk exposure can be reduced significantly by employing the proposed models. </jats:p>",

Water demand forecasting is a significant issue in the designing, maintaining and operating of a reliable and economical water supply system. An explicit mathematical method was presented in this study, based on the indicators of industrial output value, such as the gross output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery. The impact of total retail sales and year trends in the domestic or industrial water demands, can accurately forecast the water demand fluctuations for a municipality. Adopt RAGA-PP optimal selection model through a grouping method of data handling for water demand management to test for the case study Shaanxi, China. Results showed that the prediction effect of multivariate logarithmic model accuracy can reach 99.50%, and it is estimated that the demand for water resources in Shaanxi would exceed 10 billion m3 by 2030. The average relative error of the water consumption from 2015 to 2017 is 3.05% for the model of multiple linear and 0.50% for the model of multivariate logarithm model.

People usually turn on the motor when their taps go dry and switch off the motor when the tank starts overflowing. This results in needless wasting of water and the lack of water in emergencies. This water is mostly coming through supply line pipes installed by the government through different schemes. The timing of this water coming is mostly irregular because it varies time to time, and in areas where it is fixed, the time is inconvenient for domestic residents to switch ON their motors and fill their tanks. Either the water comes late at night or in the daytime when the people are mostly at their jobs, so they are unable to turn ON their motors. This paper presents a solution to both these problems, a hardware model has been developed using Arduino as the main microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors to detect the level of water in tanks two pumping motors one for underground and one for an overhead tank. And one a water flow sensor is used to automatically detect the water coming in supply lines and switch on the motor.

The supply of sediment from these slopes to mountain streams and its subsequent transport lead to sediment connectivity, which describes the integrated coupled state of these systems. Studies from the Northern Calcareous Alps show that the size of the sediment contributing area (SCA), a subset of the drainage area that effectively delivers sediment to the channel network, can be used as a predictor of sediment delivery to mountain streams. The SCA concept is delineated on a digital elevation model (DEM) using a set of rules related to the steepness and length of slopes directly adjacent to the channel network, the gradient of the latter and the vegetation cover. The present study investigates the applicability of this concept to the Western Alps to identify geomorphologically active areas and to estimate mean annual sediment yield (SY) in mainly debris‐flow‐prone catchments. We use a statistical approach that shows a parameter optimisation and a linear regression of SY on SCA extent. We use a dataset of ~25 years of assessed coarse sediment accumulation in 35 sediment retention basins. In the investigated catchments, sediment transport is governed by several factors, mainly by the extent of vegetation‐free areas with a minimum slope of 23° that is coupled to the channel network with a very low gradient of the latter. With our improved framework, we can show that the SCA approach can be applied to catchments that are widely distributed, in a large spatial scale (hectare area) and very heterogeneous in their properties. In general, the investigated catchments show high connectivity, resulting in significant correlations between long‐term average yield and the size of the SCA.</jats:p>",

Aim. The investigation of the nodulation and nitrogen-fixing activities of Sinorhizobium meliloti as well as the ethylene production by alfalfa plants at the early stages of the formation of symbiotic system under conditions of both optimal and insufficient water supply and the pre-sowing treatment of seeds by lectin. Methods. Microbiological (cultivation of bacteria culture, seed inoculation), physiological (pot experiment), biochemical (nitrogenase activity and ethylene production determination). Results. It was observed a decrease of the nodulation activity of Sinorhizobium meliloti under drought as well as under lectin application, which was accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced by macrosymbiont ethylene at the early stages of the symbiosis formation. At the same time, the nitrogen fixing activity was inhibited at the insufficient water supply only. The use of lectin promoted the symbiotic apparatus functioning under optimal and insufficient water supply. After renewal of irrigation an increase of the nodule weight and nitrogen fixing activity as well as the aboveground mass of alfalfa plants were noted under lectin treatment. Conclusions. It was identified the role of ethylene as a negative regulator of the nodulation processes at pre-sowing treatment of alfalfa seeds with lectin. The formation of the effective nitrogen-fixing system capable of full recovery after drought under lectin application confirms the prospects for further research in the use of lectins to create optimal conditions for the realization of the symbiotic potential of rhizobia and to increase the symbiotic systemˊ resistance to the action of stress factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The limited available water resources and competition among different water use sectors have become the main constraints of food security and sustainability. Faced with the inability to expand the area of cultivated land due to urbanization and population growth, one of the biggest challenges and risks for developing countries is to ensure the supply of food quantity and quality under extremely limited water resources. To achieve water-saving and improve calorie supply by adjusting crop production allocations, three objectives—of minimum blue water footprint, maximum calorie production, and each crop production no less than the reference level of nine main crops in China—were achieved using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The results display that compared with the reference year, model Maize+ (maize production increased) had significant blue water saving (~32%), the blue water footprint of crop production in all provinces reduced, and its calorie production increased by 4%. This solution is not realistic for China because wheat and rice production need to be reduced by 82 and 80%, respectively. However, model Citrus– (citrus production decreased) reduced the blue water footprint of crop production (~16%), and increased calorie production (~12%). Compared with other solutions, it is a sustainable crop production structure that is easier to realize because it is better at meeting the production of each crop. Therefore, China can appropriately increase the planting area of maize and reduce the planting of citrus and other crops that consume more blue water and produce fewer calories to ensure the security and sustainability of food supplies. However, the improvement of water saving-technology, rationalization of agricultural water resources management, crop production allocations mentioned in this study, and other efforts are necessary to achieve this goal.</jats:p>"

Studies focused on these problems have increased in recent decades, but few have applied land use optimization to reduce such spatial mismatches. This study developed a methodology to identify ES mismatches and then use these mismatches as objectives for land use optimization. The methodology was applied to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao “Greater Bay Area” (GBA), a megacity of over 70 million people and one of the world’s largest urban agglomerations. Considering the demand for a healthy and secure living environment among city-dwellers, we focused on three ES: heat mitigation, flood mitigation, and recreational services. The results showed large spatial heterogeneity in supply and demand for these three ES. However, compared to current conditions in the GBA, our model showed that optimized land use allocation could better match the supply and demand for heat mitigation (number of beneficiaries increased by 15%), flood mitigation (amount of population exposed to flood damage decreased by 37%), and recreation (number of beneficiaries increased by 14%). By integrating land use allocation and spatial mismatch analysis, this methodology provides a feasible way to align ES supply and demand to advance urban and regional sustainability.</jats:p>"

Exploring the relationship in specific study areas is necessary to support regional planning for sustainability. In this study, we analyzed the equilibrium relationship between ecosystem service supply and consumption driven by economic development and ecological restoration from 1995 to 2018 in Northeast China. We quantified the supply and consumption of three critical ecosystem services, food production, water yield and atmospheric regulation, and identified the main areas for supply and consumption of ecosystem services. We measured the quantity and spatial equilibrium relationship between ecosystem service supply and consumption driven by economic development and ecological restoration at economic megaregion scale. We found the new industrial structure shaped by regional economic development policies formed the new ecosystem service consumer demand. The development of agricultural industry not only resulted in the increase of water consumption, but also the scope of water consumption was expanded in Northeast China. The development of tertiary industry causes the change of atmospheric regulation consumption in urban agglomeration. What’s more, economic development exacerbated imbalances in the supply and consumption of ecosystem services. The unbalanced areas where food supply was less than consumption were in the clusters of Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and coastal cities. Since food products can circulate freely through the market, this imbalance will not fundamentally affect regional food security, but will improve the level of agricultural industrialization and scale. The implementation of the grain economic policy caused the rapid expansion of unbalanced areas where water supply was less than consumption. The incredible space mismatch between the supply and consumption of ecosystem services still exists for a long time. However, the implementation of the ecological restoration didn’t effectively solve the problem of insatiable ecosystem service consumption. The ecosystem service consumption brought by economic development need to be given the utmost attention when formulating ecological restoration policies and economic development policies. The results can provide insights for enhancing economic sustainability in northeast china, as well other economic megaregion with similar characteristics throughout the world.</jats:p>"

To put it differently, most of the companies are aiming to adopt new businesses and raise the competition in the global market. For this, most of the companies or organizations are choosing strategies such as corporate social responsibility and supply chain management that allow the companies to ensure financial strengthening. Moreover, stakeholders and customers have raised their concerns towards corporate social responsibility with respect to global supply chain and ensured to act in a socially responsible way. It is believed that majority of the organizations are placing high importance on implementing corporate social responsibility or CSR activities in order to enhance the whole business. The active participation of companies in CSR activities will always benefit them in terms of profit, virtues and other moral standards. Usually, corporate firms exhibit their virtues ignoring the moral standard, which eventually reveals the nature of hypocrisy. Corporate hypocrisy is a context when companies or organizations assure the public to do something in corporate social responsibility context and end up doing entirely different. Keeping this in mind, the current study aims to reveal the hidden nature of corporate hypocrisy and its effect on inner stakeholders explicitly focusing on the employees' observations on corporate hypocrisy; examine the hypocritical behaviour of the reputed firms towards the consumers, which in turn affects the supply chain globally. For this, data analysis will be carried out with consumer firms across countries. Results show that firms are completely held responsible for their behaviour eventually defaming reputation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>More and more contract manufacturers have started to establish their own brands besides providing manufacturing service for retailers who operate exclusive well-known brands. This paper studies the encroachment strategy of a contract manufacturer in a supply chain and the impact of fairness concern. Four scenarios are investigated by building game models: no fairness concern, the retailer’s fairness concern, the contract manufacturer’s fairness concern, and both members’ fairness concern. The results show that when there is no fairness concern, the contract manufacturer always has motivation to encroach. However, when there exists fairness concern, only when the reservation price is sufficiently high, the contract manufacturer will encroach. Fairness concern has certain strength to stop the contract manufacturer’s encroachment. When the reservation price is sufficiently low, the encroachment of the contract manufacturer benefits the retailer, or else it will harm the benefit of the retailer. The effect of fairness concern on profit margin and wholesale price decisions is opposite under different encroachment strategies. However, the fairness concern has no impact on the retail price of the private brand. Under encroachment strategy, contract manufacturer’s or both members’ fairness concerns have positive effect on the retailer’s profit in certain conditions. However, the fairness concern always decreases the contract manufacturer’s profit no matter what the form it is. Numerical examples show that it is best for the supply chain that both members have fairness concern under no encroachment. However, when the contract manufacturer has a private brand, it is best for the supply chain that no one has fairness concern when the advantageous inequity concern parameter is sufficiently low. When the advantageous inequity concern parameter is sufficiently high, it is best for the supply chain that both members have fairness concern.</jats:p>",

However, titanium alloys are also difficult-to-cut materials. Metalworking fluids are employed in the machining process to improve the machinability of titanium alloys. In recent years much attention has been paid to the use of the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) techniques in the machining of the titanium alloys. In this study, the tool wear and its influence on the components of cutting forces have been investigated for different MQL supply strategies into the cutting zone - MQL via external nozzle and MQL via tool holder were investigated. The obtained results were compared with dry turning. It was concluded that the mechanism of tool wear is very similar for each cutting condition, however, it was also noted that the tool life is 28% and 68% longer for the MQL via external nozzle and MQL via tool holder, respectively, compared with the dry cutting conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soybean is one of the most profitable advanced crops in agricultural production in Ukraine and the world as a whole. Therefore, studies of means of regulation and increase in the adaptive capacity of soybeans in symbiosis with nodule bacteria under the action of unfavourable environmental factors are relevant and should be aimed at the use of complex bacterial compositions involving modern nanotechnological approaches. Nanocarboxylates of ferrum, molybdenum and germanium metals were used as components of rhizobia inoculation suspension for soybean seed treatment to study the effectiveness of their complex effect on the regulation of the activity of the key antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase in plants under drought. Various symbiotic systems were used, which included soybean plants and inoculation suspensions based on the active, virulent Tn5-mutant Bradyrhizobium japonicum B1-20 by adding nanoparticles of ferrum, germanium and molybdenum carboxylates to the culture medium in a ratio of 1: 1000. Citric acid was the chelator. A model drought lasting 14 days was created during the period of active fixation of atmospheric molecular nitrogen by root nodules of soybeans in the budding and flowering stages, by means of controlled watering of plants to 30% of the total moisture content. In the stage of bean formation, watering of plants was resumed to the optimal level – 60% of the total moisture content. The control was soybean plants, the seeds of which were inoculated with a suspension of rhizobia without the addition of chelated metals. The following research methods were used in the work – microbiological, physiological and biochemical. According to the results, it was found that when nanoparticles of carboxylates of ferrum, molybdenum and germanium were added to the inoculation suspension of rhizobia, there was an increase in superoxide dismutase activity in root nodules and a decrease in soybean leaves under optimal water supply conditions of plants. This indicates the initial changes in the activity of the antioxidant enzyme in these symbiotic systems, induced by the influence of chelated metals in combination with the rhizobia of the active Tn5-mutant B. japonicum B1-20. Prolonged drought induced an increase in the overall level of superoxide dismutase activity in soybean nodules and leaves, compared to plants grown under optimal watering conditions. The symbiotic system formed by soybeans and B. japonicum with molybdenum carboxylate nanoparticles was the most sensitive to long-term drought exposure, compared to two other soybean-rhizobial symbioses using ferrum and germanium nanocarboxylates. This was manifested in the unstable reaction of the enzyme to the action of drought – suppression or intensification of the level of its activity in the root nodules and leaves of soybeans inoculated with rhizobia containing molybdenum carboxylate nanoparticles. In symbiotic systems with the participation of germanium and ferrum nanocarboxylates, slight changes were revealed in superoxide dismutase activity in root nodules and leaves of plants during drought and restoration of enzyme activity to the level of plants with optimal watering after water stress. It is concluded that the addition to the culture medium of rhizobia Tn5-mutant B1-20 of nanocarboxylates of germanium or ferrum is an effective means of regulating the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase in soybean root nodules and leaves, which can contribute to an increase in the protective properties and adaptation of plants to the action of dehydration.</jats:p>"

Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze the information. Results show that coincidences and divergences are observed in the importance given to the worlds; the Civic, Inspired and Opinion worlds are perceived similarly by the three types of actors and are related to the interest in how these activities benefit the environment. Differences are attributed to the role played by each type of actor and to socioeconomic aspects.

Throughout its supply chain, there are risks to each tier affecting overall supply chain performance. Even though they have risks, not all tiers have the same vulnerability, depending on the ability of the risk owner to overcome them. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a vulnerability risk assessment of the certified coconut palm sugar in Kulon Progo Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In-depth interviews with 54 risk owners throughout the product supply chain were then carried out using purposive and snowball samplings. The stages of risk assessment, starting from the identification, analysis, and evaluation of risks, were carried out using the ISO 31000:2009 framework. Risk categorization at the first assessment stage and mapping of expected loss and vulnerabilities at the second stage were carried out using the Rapid Agricultural Supply Chain Risk Assessment (RapAgRisk) instrument. The results showed that there were 35 risk events in the farmers, collectors, sub-Control Processing Units (sub-CPUs), Control Processing Units (CPUs), and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of sugar in Kulon Progo, which consisted of various risk categories, i.e., weather risk; natural disaster risk; biological and environmental risks; logistic and infrastructure risks; market risk; as well as management and operational risks. The risk events in the supply chain of the Granulated Coconut Sugar Kulon Progo have various degrees of vulnerability, starting from limited, low, moderate, highly, to extremely vulnerabilities. Risk events that are classified as limited vulnerability were considered acceptable, and the risk owner has been able to handle these risks well so that mitigation proposals were not given, while other risk events need to be mitigated to reduce their severities.</jats:p>"

In situ data were collected during the ARKTIKA-2018 expedition and then complemented with satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), sea surface height, wind speed, and sea ice concentration. The estimation of SSS fields is challenging in high-latitude regions, and the precision of soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) SSS retrieval is improved by applying a threshold on SSS weekly error. For the first time in this region, the validity of DMI (Danish Meteorological Institute) SST and SMOS SSS products is thoroughly studied using ARKTIKA-2018 expedition continuous thermosalinograph measurements and conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) casts. They are found to be adequate to describe large surface gradients in this region. Surface gradients and mixing of the river and the sea water in the ice-free and ice-covered areas are described with a special attention to the marginal ice zone at a synoptic scale. We suggest that the freshwater is pushed northward, close to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and under the sea ice, which is confirmed by the oxygen isotope analysis. The SST-SSS diagram based on satellite estimates shows the possibility of investigating the surface water mass transformation at a synoptic scale and reveals the presence of river water on the shelf of the East Siberian Sea. The Ekman transport is calculated to better understand the pathway of surface water displacement on the shelf and beyond.\n                    </jats:p>"

Thus, it is necessary to ensure energy dissipation and pressure head reduction to reduce the pipeline pressure head. The energy dissipation box is a new type of energy dissipation and pressure head reduction device, which is widely used in the gravitational flow transition systems. At present, there is still a dearth of systematic knowledge about the performance of energy dissipation boxes. In this paper, a relationship between the location of the energy dissipation box and the pressure head amplitude is established, a theoretical optimal location equation of the energy dissipation box is derived, and numerical simulations using an engineering example are carried out for verification. The protective effects of an energy dissipation box placed at the theoretical optimal location and an upstream location are compared. The results indicate that for the same valve action time, the optimal position allows effectively reducing the total volume of energy dissipation box. The oscillation amplitudes of the water level in the box and the pressure head behind the box are markedly reduced. Under the condition that the water level oscillation of the energy dissipation box is almost the same, the optimal location offers better pressure head reduction protection performance than the upstream location.</jats:p>"

The optimal operation of the system is realised by mobilising the multi‐energy complementary characteristics during device failure. The reliability of the system under three different operation objectives is compared and analysed. Three new reliability indices are proposed, which take into account the supply of multiple energy loads and the differences among different energy. Finally, through the analysis of energy supply reliability under different objectives, the reasonability of the proposed indices and the flexible scheduling of energy flow under different objectives are verified; therefore, the IES can realise adaptive and targeted operation strategy during device failure. Also, the influence of different device faults on the system's energy supply reliability is ranked, which is of great significance to find the weak parts of the system and provide a reference for the system to improve energy supply reliability.</jats:p>",

However, the traditional evaluating models mostly consider the historical performance data and fail to predict and diagnose the problems’ root. This paper proposes a distributed, trustworthy, tamper-proof, and learning framework for evaluating service supply chain performance based on blockchain and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) techniques, named Di-ANFIS. The main objectives of this research are as follows: (1) presenting hierarchical criteria of service supply chain performance to cope with the diagnosis of the problems’ root; (2) proposing a smart learning model to deal with the uncertainty conditions by a combination of neural network and fuzzy logic; and (3) introducing a distributed blockchain-based framework due to the dependence of ANFIS on big data and the lack of trust and security in the supply chain. Furthermore, the proposed six-layer conceptual framework consists of the data layer, connection layer, blockchain layer, smart layer, ANFIS layer, and application layer. This architecture creates a performance management system using the Internet of Things, smart contracts, and ANFIS based on the blockchain platform. The Di-ANFIS model provides a performance evaluation system without needing a third party and a reliable intermediary that provides an agile and diagnostic model in a smart and learning process. It also saves computing time and speeds up information flow.</jats:p>",

In the current study, biochar, produced from organic residues (digestates) from a biogas plant, was applied with and without digestates at low (3.4 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and intermediate (17.1 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) rates to two acidic and sandy soils in northern Germany that are used for corn (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) production. Soil nutrient availability, crop yields, microbial biomass and carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions from heterotrophic respiration were measured over two consecutive years. The effects of biochar application depended on the intrinsic properties of the two tested soils and the biochar application rates. Although the soils at the fallow site, with initially low nutrient concentrations, showed a significant increase in pH, soil nutrients and crop yield after low biochar application rates, a similar response was found at the cornfield site only after application of substantially larger amounts of biochar. The effect of a single dose of biochar at the beginning of the experiment diminished over time but was still detectable after 2 years. Whereas plant available nutrient concentrations increased after biochar application, the availability of potentially phytotoxic trace elements (Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr) decreased significantly, and although slight increases in microbial biomass carbon and heterotrophic CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes were observed after biochar application, they were mostly not significant. The results indicate that the application of relatively small amounts of biochar could have positive effects on plant available nutrients and crop yields of marginal arable soils and may decrease the need for mineral fertilizers while simultaneously increasing the sequestration of soil organic carbon.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlights</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>A low rate of biochar increased plant available nutrients and crop yield on marginal soils.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Biochar application reduced the availability of potentially harmful trace elements.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Heterotrophic respiration showed no clear response to biochar application.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Biochar application may reduce fertilizer need and increase carbon sequestration on marginal soils.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

The e-waste collection issue has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in developing countries, due to low collection rates. This study aims to search for progressive solutions in the e-waste collection sphere with close-to-zero transport and infrastructure costs and the minimization of consumers’ efforts towards an enhanced e-waste management efficiency and collection rate. Along these lines, the present paper develops a smart reverse system of e-waste from end-of-life electronics holders to local recycling infrastructures based on intelligent information technology (IT) tools involving local delivery services to collect e-waste and connecting with interactive online maps of users’ requests. This system considers the vehicles of local delivery services as potential mobile collection points that collect and deliver e-waste to a local recycling enterprise with a minimum deviation from the planned routes. Besides e-waste transport and infrastructure costs minimization, the proposed smart e-waste reverse system supports the reduction of CO2 through the optimal deployment of e-waste collection vehicles. The present study also advances a solid rationale for involving local e-waste operators as key stakeholders of the smart e-waste reverse system. Deploying the business model canvas (BMC) toolkit, a business model of the developed system has been built for the case of Sumy city, Ukraine, and discussed in light of recent studies.</jats:p>"

Cholera alone is estimated to cause 95,000 deaths per year, most of which occur in endemic settings with inadequate water access. Whilst a global strategy to eliminate cholera by 2030 calls for investment in improved drinking water services, there is limited rigorous evidence for the impact of improved water supply on endemic cholera transmission in low-income urban settings. Our protocol is designed to deliver a pragmatic health impact evaluation of a large-scale water supply intervention in Uvira (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a cholera transmission hotspot. <jats:bold>Methods/Design.</jats:bold>A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT) was designed to evaluate the impact of a large-scale drinking water supply intervention on cholera incidence among the 280,000 inhabitants of Uvira. The city was divided into 16 clusters, where new community and household taps will be installed following a randomised sequence over a transition period of up to 8 weeks in each cluster. The primary trial outcomes are the monthly incidence of “confirmed” cholera cases (patients testing positive by rapid detection kit) and of “suspected” cholera cases (patients admitted to the cholera treatment centre). Concurrent process and economic evaluations will provide further information on the context, costs and efficiency of the intervention. <jats:bold>Discussion.</jats:bold>In this protocol, we describe a pragmatic approach to conducting rigorous research to assess the impacts of a complex water supply intervention on severe diarrhoeal disease and cholera in an unstable, low-resource setting representative of cholera-affected areas. In particular, we discuss a series of pre-identified risks and linked mitigation strategies as well as the value of combining different data collection methods and preparation of multiple analysis scenarios to account for possible deviations from the protocol. The study described here has the potential to provide robust evidence to support more effective cholera control in challenging, high-burden settings.    <jats:bold>Trial registration. </jats:bold>This trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02928341, 10th October 2016, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02928341) and has received ethics approval from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (8913, 10603) and from the Ethics Committee from the School of Public Health, University of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (ESP/CE/088/2015).</jats:p>"

The novelty of this article is that the model is investigated from the consumer's perspective, whereas in the previous studies, the proposed models were from other upstream members' perspectives such as manufacturer and retailer. Furthermore, inducement and advertising strategies are proposed for stimulating consumers to engage more in an RSC. To analyse the effect of these two strategies, the three‐person RSC game‐theoretical approach is used. A three‐person supply chain consists of a pharmaceutical manufacturer and a retailer who will interact with a strategic consumer in several non‐cooperative Stackelberg games. Three Stackelberg games are established and, each member takes a turn as a leadership role and the other two players assume the role of the follower.</jats:p>",

Southwest Gondwana hosts one of the thickest and most laterally extensive records of Earth's penultimate icehouse, the late Paleozoic ice age. We present the first high-resolution U-Pb zircon chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) analysis of late Paleozoic ice age deposits in the Kalahari Basin of southern Africa, which, coupled with existing CA-ID-TIMS zircon records from the Paraná and Karoo Basins, we used to refine the late Paleozoic ice age glacial history of SW Gondwana. Key findings from this work suggest that subglacial evidence in the Kalahari region is restricted to the Carboniferous (older than 300 Ma), with glacially influenced deposits culminating in this region by the earliest Permian (296 Ma). The U-Pb detrital zircon geochronologic records from the Paraná Basin of South America, which was located downstream of the Kalahari Basin in the latest Carboniferous and Permian, indicate that large-scale changes in sediment supplied to the Paraná were contemporaneous with shifts in the SW Gondwana ice record. Gondwanan deglaciation events were associated with the delivery of far-field, African-sourced sediments into the Paraná Basin. In contrast, Gondwanan glacial periods were associated with the restriction of African-sourced sediments into the basin. We interpret the influx of far-field sediments into the Paraná Basin as an expansion of the catchment area for the Paraná Basin during the deglaciation events, which occurred in the latest Carboniferous (300–299 Ma), early Permian (296 Ma), and late early Permian (&amp;lt;284 Ma). The coupled ice and detrital zircon records for this region of Gondwana present opportunities to investigate climate feedbacks associated with changes in freshwater and nutrient delivery to late Paleozoic ocean basins across the turnover from icehouse to greenhouse conditions.</jats:p>",

After a long period of operation, hydraulic structures continue to operate without scheduled repairs, so it is necessary to perform technical reconstruction of the structure on the basis of innovative, as well as previously proven repair technologies. Most of the long-term operated hydraulic structures in Russia are in unsatisfactory condition, requiring modernization and reconstruction. Volumetric anti-filtration geotextile coating is used for technical restoration of long-term water supply structures that have failed. The volumetric cellular structure is filled with soil and has a variable height of the edge from the ridge to the bottom of the slope. Operational reliability and durability of the volumetric coating are provided by a cellular structure with a variable ridge height, to eliminate the formation of landslides in the underlying soil and in the filling, as well as the loss of water for filtration. A solid-state model of the stress-strain state of a bulk anti-filtration geotextile coating was constructed. The number of elements and the number of units of the ensemble was 127830 and 102740, respectively. The source information was encoded in terms of the increment method, taking into account the fragmentary representation of a three-dimensional anti-filtration geotextile coating with a variable edge height in the form of simple geometric objects-plates. The work of the coating from the load from its own weight and filling the volume cells of the soil at various parameters was numerically modelled. The results obtained are adequate to the calculations and do not exceed the operational parameters of the design. Processing of the obtained simulation results showed the presence of minor displacements, both horizontally and vertically along the structure, which indicates the presence of a large margin of safety of the bulk anti-filtration geotextile coating.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The correlation coefficient between two variables is an important aspect of statistics. The accuracy of assessments of correlation relies on information from a set of discourses. Data collected in statistical studies are often full of exceptions. Pythagorean fuzzy soft sets (PFSS) are a parametrized family of extended Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS). They comprise a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets which may be used to accurately assess deficiencies and uncertainties in evaluations. PFSS can accommodate uncertainty more competently than intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets and are the most important strategy when dealing with fuzzy information in decision-making processes. Herein, the concept and characteristics of correlation coefficients and the weighted correlation coefficients in PFSS are discussed. We also introduce the Pythagorean fuzzy soft weighted average (PFSWA) and Pythagorean fuzzy soft weighted geometric (PFSWG) operators and discuss their desirable characteristics. A prioritization technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) under the PFSS environment based on correlation coefficients and weighted correlation coefficients will be introduced. Through the proposed methodology, a technique for decision-making is developed. Additionally, an application of the proposed TOPSIS technique is presented for green supplier selection in green supply chain management (GSCM). The practicality, efficacy, and flexibility of the proposed approach is proved through comparative analyses, drawing upon existing studies.</jats:p>"

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has compounded the opioid crisis and worsened outcomes by introducing new barriers to MOUD access. Many strategies to ensure continued access to MOUD have been described, but the role of leveraging pharmacists during the opioid/COVID-19 syndemic to improve medication access and outcomes remains underappreciated. Pharmacists, while both qualified and capable of liberalizing access to all forms of MOUD, may have the strongest impact by increasing access to buprenorphine. Herein, we present progressive strategies to maintain and extend buprenorphine access for patients with OUD through deployment of clinical pharmacists, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which access may be further restricted.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Leveraging pharmacists to extend access to MOUD, particularly buprenorphine, remains an underutilized strategy that should be implemented, particularly during the concurrent COVID-19 global pandemic.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of supply-side determinants in increasing clean cooking, yet few large-scale studies have assessed their significance quantitatively. As part of the CLEAN-Air(Africa) study, a population-based survey was conducted (N = 5,638) assessing cooking practices in peri-urban communities within Cameroon, Kenya and Ghana. Multilevel logistic and log-linear regression were used to assess socioeconomic and supply-side determinants of LPG usage (primary versus secondary fuel) and consumption (kilograms/capita/year), respectively. Supply-side factors (e.g. cylinder refill and transportation costs) and using single versus multi-burner stoves were better predictors of both the probability of primarily cooking with LPG and annual LPG consumption than household SES. These results suggest the need for policies promoting LPG access and stove equipment that meet household needs.</jats:p>"

Although digital PCR (dPCR) is considered promising for absolutely quantitating genes, the detection efficiency of dPCR is affected by many factors. This study tested eight virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria on a control plasmid and reclaimed water samples with reported primer–probe sets and designed ones on quantitative PCR (qPCR) and dPCR. Probe efficiency, data analysis, and PCR inhibition were found to affect the detection efficiency of dPCR. Firstly, poor probe quality, which is determined by probe quenching and activation efficiencies, was the main cause of PCR failure. Secondly, even if the PCR was successful, the probe quality and signal intensity could still affect the quantitative process. Manual analysis of dPCR data on the weak signal intensity would significantly reduce errors. And lastly, the sensitivity of PCR inhibition was lower in dPCR than qPCR, but inhibition still existed. The dPCR produced various detection efficiencies for different targets in one sample indicating inconstant inhibitory effects. Dilution was still the proper approach to overcome inhibition, but decreased the detection limit. More studies are required to ensure accurate waterborne pathogen quantitation by dPCR.</jats:p>",

Selecting viable marketing channels will help reduce risks in overseas markets while positively impacting the green level and the stakeholders. This paper analyzes channel decisions under different scenarios in a game analytical framework and identifies that both exclusive and competitive channels promote the green supply chain, and that the latter leads to a higher green level and benefits the local manufacturer. Whatever profit-seeking or corporate social responsibility- (CSR-) seeking follows, the MNM prefers the competitive channel when the green research and development (R&amp;D) investment coefficient is relatively low and vice versa for the exclusive channel. Moreover, transaction cost undermines the green supply chain, the competitive structure lowers the loss of greenness, and the exclusionary mode raises the MNM’s profits. Another interesting finding is when subsidies are offered by the importing country, the competitive structure is more conducive to the green and the participant’s gains, while the exclusive structure is detrimental to the green and only advantageous for the domestic manufacturer’s benefits. Besides, the revenue-sharing contract results in a higher green level of the supply chain in the channels than before, but the MNM tends to select the exclusive marketing channel with a relatively lower green level due to the profits. Subject to the findings, we propose an improved revenue-sharing contract that achieves the MNM’s competitive retailing option and ensures the emergence of the manufacturers’ win-win solution.</jats:p>",

However, exclusive ammonium nutrition may lead to stress characterized by growth inhibition, generally associated with a profound metabolic reprogramming. In this work, we investigated how metabolism adapts according to leaf position in the vertical axis of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82) plants grown with NH4+, NO3−, or NH4NO3 supply. We dissected leaf biomass composition and metabolism through an integrative analysis of metabolites, ions, and enzyme activities. Under ammonium nutrition, carbon and nitrogen metabolism were more perturbed in mature leaves than in young ones, overall suggesting a trade-off between NH4+ accumulation and assimilation to preserve young leaves from ammonium stress. Moreover, NH4+-fed plants exhibited changes in carbon partitioning, accumulating sugars and starch at the expense of organic acids, compared with plants supplied with NO3−. We explain such reallocation by the action of the biochemical pH-stat as a mechanism to compensate the differential proton production that depends on the nitrogen source provided. This work also underlines that the regulation of leaf primary metabolism is dependent on both leaf phenological stage and the nitrogen source provided.</jats:p>",

An office room with a combined ventilation system was simulated using AIRPAK software.

During the simulation process, the effects of two different supply diffuser shapes (one way rectangular diffuser and semicircle diffuser) were compared to investigated the effect of supply diffuser shape on air age and thermal environment in hot and dry climate (passed on peak summer temperatures in Hilla city). Three tests were performed for each case based on changing the load treated by the chilled ceiling as (25%, 50% and 80%) respect to total cooling load and represented (26, 53, 85W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) respectively based on floor area.

The water network skeleton formed mainly by the ‘Eight Waters’ in the territory, along with the historical changes of Xi'an, has experienced the Lantian ape-man ‘living by the water’, the Western Zhou Fenghao ‘two capitals along the Fenghe River’, and the Qin Xianyang city ‘capital passed by Weihe river’. Developments and changes such as the ‘diversion of water to develop the capital’ in Chang'an in the Western Han Dynasty, the ‘capital be ringed by eight rivers’ in Chang'an in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, ‘reduced water’ from the end of the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, and the ‘coordinated supply’ after the founding of the People's Republic of China. After sorting out the system, it is believed that the ‘Eight Waters’ in the territory are the original driving force for the flourishing Chang'an in history. From ancient times to the present, with the development of industry, there has been a trend that human settlements and rivers are farther away. Urban water supply has shifted from groundwater sources to surface water sources. This article investigates the evolution of water conservancy projects in Xi'an from the Paleolithic Age to the present, and studies the relationship between human production and life and water resources. The changing law and development trend of the water supply structure in Xi'an urban area in modern times are analyzed.

This paper is aimed at investigating experimental cases of the influence of supply voltage waveform distortion on non-intentional emission in the range 2–150 kHz and the efficiency of power line communication based on selected PRIME (PoweRline Intelligent Metering Evolution) power line communication (PLC) technology. A series of experimental laboratory studies were investigated, representing the operation of the investigated PLC system with different types of end-user equipment (LED—Light Emitting Diode, CFL—Compact Fluorescent Lamp, induction motor with frequency converter) working under a distorted supply voltage condition obtained by the programmable power supply for different scenarios of the admissible harmonics contribution in the range 0–2 kHz. The scenarios included limits defined in standards EN 50160 and IEC 61000-4-13. The researchers used spectral analysis with a notation to emission limits, compatibility levels, and mains signalling, as well as statistics of the PLC communication. The obtained results provide important conclusions, which may be applied both in the development of the design of the appliances in question and the higher frequency emission testing methods.</jats:p>"

Our approach integrates the generation and optimization of product design alternatives using genetic algorithms and device physics simulation with large-scale supply chain planning using problem decomposition and mixed-integer programming. This corporate-wide capability is fast and effective, enabling analysis of many more business scenarios in much less time than previous solutions, while providing superior results, including faster response time to customers.

This study looks at the immediate causes of the prolong power failure in the area, in order to proffer solutions to them. Field work and questionnaires were used to obtain data for this study. During the field work, the main 33 KVA Isoko-Kwale transmission line was thoroughly inspected to ascertain its current state. In addition, the primary (11 KVA) and secondary (415 V) distribution lines, the transformer and feeder pillars were also inspected. Furthermore, questionnaires were distributed to three categories of people (electricians, civil servants and traders), to ascertain the remote causes of epileptic power supply in the region. Results obtained from the field work revealed that some of the electrical materials used in the 33 kVA transmission line were in bad shape. There were instances of missing cross arms from the utility poles, and the insulators were fixed directly to the poles. It was also observed that some cross arms were freely handing at the side of the utility poles. Considering the primary and secondary distribution lines, most of them were in bad shape. Slanting utility poles and cables overgrown with tree branches were regular occurrences. In terms of the feeder pillars, some of them were not functioning. The operational feeder pillars showed signs of overloading and burnt cables. The analysis of the questionnaires feedback with chi-square and graphical methods, revealed that: the poor state of electrical materials, and the negligence of the people of the region in adhering to the electrical rules were highly responsible for the poor electrical supply in the area. Results obtained from the study had revealed that the best remedies to the persistent power failure in the area is the total overhauling of the distribution lines patterns and the transformers. In addition, the people should adhere to the Nigeria electrical safety practices by switching off unnecessary appliances. This will help to conserve electrical energy, and minimized overloading of the 33 KVA transmission line.</jats:p>"

Los resultados arrojan que los empleados consideran que la implementación de estos dos elementos es deficiente, debido a que la mayoría de las preguntas tuvieron una media baja, además, se lograron comprobar, parcialmente, las hipótesis planteadas, en cuanto a la relación de la CSV y Alta dirección con el desempeño organizacional, y las relaciones entre el desempeño ambiental y las variables de CHV e Involucramiento.</jats:p>"

Seit Ende der 1980er-Jahre zeigt sich ein Anstieg der mittleren jährlichen Temperatur in Süddeutschland. Die jährlichen Niederschlagssummen haben sich in der jüngeren Vergangenheit (seit 2003) reduziert und somit eine deutliche Verringerung der Grundwasserneubildung aus Niederschlag bewirkt. Gleichzeitig ist eine Zunahme des Trockenheitsindex (Anzahl an Tagen mit Füllung des Bodenwasserspeichers &lt; 30 % der nutzbaren Feldkapazität) zu erkennen. Häufiger werdende und länger anhaltende Trockenperioden stellen auch die Wasserwirtschaft zunehmend vor Herausforderungen und bedürfen der frühzeitigen Entwicklung von Handlungsoptionen, z. B. auf der Basis des hier vorgestellten „Trockenwetterdargebots“, um Nutzungskonflikte zu entschärfen.</jats:p>",

In the introductory part of the article, the author analyzes the category “power” from different aspects: technical, economic, and legal. A significant part of the article is devoted to identifying the legal nature of power. The author presents the views of legal scholars that reveal the content of this category. Based on the analysis, the author concludes that “power” is not an object of civil rights. The concept of “power” is borrowed from the technical and economic sphere of knowledge and is used to denote the obligation by virtue of which the power supply organization assumes the obligation to maintain the generating equipment in readiness for energy production, and the consumer is given the corresponding right of claim. At the same time, the author notes that power supply is impossible without energy transportation, and therefore, there is a need to maintain the availability of equipment at network facilities that have a hierarchical structure. In conclusion, the author suggests introducing the concept of “grid capacity” into scientific circulation along with the legal category “generating capacity” to indicate the obligation to maintain the availability of power equipment at grid facilities.</jats:p>",

With the advent of mobile hand-held devices, these technologies have become more accessible and adaptable for use by field staff working in remote areas. The Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project started collection of data and conduct of routine operations using paper-based reporting systems. Observing the need for a robust and quality digital mobile application, a comprehensive mobile application tool was developed that allowed the project to conduct disease surveillance, workforce management and supply chain management.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>In June 2017, the project conceptualized a comprehensive mobile application tool in the local language (Hindi) for disease surveillance, human resources management, and supply chain management. The tool is also available in English. Solution for Community Health-workers (SOCH) mobile app is an android native application developed using android SDK and web-based tool using MVC.net framework. Construction of the application started in November 2017 and rolled out its pilot in April 2018, followed by pan-district roll out in July 2018.

The system ensures accountability and data robustness, which is needed for malaria elimination efforts throughout the country. The mobile application can be adapted for English or any other Indian or international language for use for malaria or any other disease surveillance and control programme. Another expansion feature of this mobile application is incorporation of indicators for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), and minor engineering by the residents of community under surveillance. The authors believe that it would be highly desirable and appropriate for an international organization, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to conduct an independent comparison of all available mobile e-surveillance tools, so that a high-performing and globally suitable system can be selected for use in malaria elimination programmes. The Foundation of Disease Elimination and Controlof India has decided to make the SOCH mobile application available to anyone who would like to use it for disease surveillance and health care programmes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The use of magnetically treated water determined the soil moisture maintenance for a longer time and fewer irrigation events, leading to less water being applied and electricity consumption. The use of the soil water retention curve derived from the field data determined less water and electric energy consumption in Lucy Brown lettuce irrigation, in comparison with the simulated use of the soil water retention curve from laboratory data.</jats:p>",

An interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the impact of LPMP on the supply of LPMs in China. Ordinary least squares and Poisson regression models were utilized to estimate the effect of LPMP on LPMs’ supply growth rate and the number of supplied LPMs. All the LPMs were divided into two subgroups: intermittent supply and continuous supply.

Understanding the characteristics of the soil wetting body of the VLSI was the key to designing this irrigation system. On the basis of experimental verification of the reliability of the HYDRUS simulation results of VLSI under the conditions of soil texture (ST), initial water content (θi), line source buried depth (B), line source diameter (D) and line source length (L), numerical studies of the migration law of the wetting front of VLSI and the distribution characteristics of soil moisture were performed. The wetting front migration (WFM) was mainly influenced by ST, θi, D and L (P &amp;lt; 0.05), while B had little effect on WFM (P &amp;gt; 0.05). The shape of the soil wetting body changed little under different influencing factors. The water content contour was approximately ‘ellipsoidal’ around the line source. The soil moisture near the line source was close to the saturated moisture content. The moisture content around the line source gradually decreased outward, and the contour lines gradually became dense. According to the simulation results, a prediction model of multiple factors influencing the migration process of the VLSI wetting front was established. The predicted value was in good agreement with the measured value. The results of this research could provide a theoretical basis for further optimizing the combination of VLSI and irrigation elements.</jats:p>",

Thus, there is a need to optimize the corn stover supply system for the overall sustainability of the corn stover‐based industries. This paper presents three practical strategies that could be implemented in the near term to improve the performance of the corn stover supply chain. The first strategy involves reducing the corn stover collection area, which entails improving producers’ participation through enhanced knowledge transfer related to this industry, improving harvest ratio of biomass, and reducing dry matter loss during biomass handling and storage. The second strategy involves reducing the overall bale supply quantity, which primarily entails increasing bale density. The final suggested strategy involves reducing quantities of in‐field machinery, which is possible through improving the efficiency of field machinery, including windrowers, balers, and stackers, and increasing their harvest durations. By successfully implementing these strategies, the overall cost associated with the supply of corn stover, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced, on an average, by 34–35% from the current average benchmarks of $95.9/metric ton (t), 11% and greenhouse gas emissions is 58.4 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e/t, respectively. This can contribute toward creating a cost‐effective logistics system that is also environmentally sustainable. This will be critical for the long‐term success of the biorefineries using corn stover as the primary feedstock. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

Here, we present a minimalist model of such coevolving networks in a spatially continuous domain, where the obtained networks can be interpreted as a part of either the counter-flowing drainage or co-flowing supply and drainage mechanisms. The model consists of three coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations that describe spatial density patterns of input and output materials by modifying a mediating scalar field, on which supply and drainage networks are carved. In the two-dimensional case, the scalar field can be viewed as the elevation of a hypothetical landscape, of which supply and drainage networks are ridges and valleys, respectively. In the three-dimensional case, the scalar field serves the role of a chemical signal, according to which vascularization of the supply and drainage networks occurs above a critical ‘erosion’ strength. The steady-state solutions are presented as a function of non-dimensional channelization indices for both materials. The spatial patterns of the emerging networks are classified within the branched and congested extreme regimes, within which the resulting networks are characterized based on the absolute as well as the relative values of two non-dimensional indices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the globalization of supply and production, supply chain management has tightened the connection between upstream and downstream enterprises. Although this modern strategy has significantly improved the efficiency of enterprises, the increasingly complex relationship between nodes also makes the supply chain system more vulnerable and unstable. As a result, the interruption of any node location in the supply chain will spread to other nodes via their diffusion, which could cause irreparable damage to the entire supply chain. Therefore, under this realistic background, only by quantitatively analyzing the specific impact on the supply chain of interruption events in different locations we can formulate active and effective mitigation strategies to achieve the effective recovery of node enterprises from interruption accidents. In this study, the system dynamics method was used to simulate the changes in inventory level, order accumulation, and profit level caused by disruption of supply, production, and sales of different node companies. The results show that the closer the node enterprise to the interruption source, the greater the risk of loss. Due to the conduction effect of the supply chain system, the risk spreads to other node enterprises. Based on the above results, corresponding mitigation strategies for enterprises to cope with different node interruptions are proposed to improve the overall efficiency and operational capabilities of the enterprise.</jats:p>"

However, the primary N source has not been traced geochemically, and we have no understanding of any temporal variation.

Low oxygen level is the main driving stimulus for angiogenesis. In an animal tissue, the oxygen level is mainly determined by three effects—the oxygen delivery through blood flow in a refined vessel network, the oxygen diffusion from blood to tissue, and the oxygen consumption in cells. Evaluation of the oxygen field is usually the bottleneck in large scale modeling and simulation of angiogenesis and related physiological processes. In this work, a fast numerical method is developed for the simulation of oxygen supply in tissue with a large-scale complex vessel network. This method employs an implicit finite-difference scheme to compute the oxygen field. By virtue of an oxygen source distribution technique from vessel center lines to mesh points and a corresponding post-processing technique that eliminate the local numerical error induced by source distribution, square mesh with relatively large mesh sizes can be applied while sufficient numerical accuracy is maintained. The new method has computational complexity which is slightly higher than linear with respect to the number of mesh points and has a convergence order which is slightly lower than second order with respect to the mesh size. With this new method, accurate evaluation of the oxygen field in a fully vascularized tissue on the scale of centimeter becomes possible.</jats:p>"

This study examines the relationships among GSCI, information sharing, and financial performance from a social contagion lens. By conceptualizing GSCI into three forms, two types of contagion mechanisms (i.e., cohesion and structural equivalence) were identified to investigate the underlying contagion effects between different forms of GSCI and the effects of various GSCI on information sharing and financial performance. Survey data were collected from 206 Chinese manufacturers and analyzed using structural equation modeling to test hypotheses. The results indicate that green supplier integration directly promotes green internal integration, green customer integration, and information sharing with suppliers. Green internal integration positively influences green customer integration and financial performance. Green customer integration enhances information sharing with customers. Both information sharing with suppliers and customers improve financial performance. This study contributes to the GSCI literature and provides novel managerial implications for manufacturers.</jats:p>",

This research considers technical data obtained from the optimization of biomethanization processes using sewage sludge and cattle manure liquid fraction, aiming to develop a spatially explicit model including multicriteria evaluation and an analytical hierarchy process to locate biogas production facilities, allocate energy resources and consider biogas unit pre-dimensioning analysis. According to the biophysical conditions and socioeconomic dynamics of the study area (Vila do Conde, Northwest Portugal), a spatially explicit model using multicriteria and multiobjective techniques allowed the definition of suitable locations, as well as the allocation of resources and support pre-dimensioning of biogas facilities. A p-median model allowed us to allocate resources and pre-dimensioning biogas facilities according to distance and accessibility elements. The results indicate: (i) the location of areas with adequate environmental conditions and socioeconomic suitability advantages to install biogas production facilities, and (ii) the ability to compare the options of centralized or distributed location alternatives and associated pre-dimensioning.</jats:p>"

To determine how the characteristics of supply and demand in a water-coupled system will vary under the influence of climate change and human activity in this area in the next 85 years, the upper Yangtze basin was considered as the study area and was divided into seven sub-basins according to seven main control sections: Shigu, Panzhihua, Xiluodu, Xiangjiaba, Zhutuo, Cuntan, and Yichang; a method for water supply and demand research considering climate change was proposed. Based on simulated runoff in the study area under changing environmental conditions, this study analyzed the available water supply and constructed a long-term water demand forecasting model using the classified water use index method under macro regulation in the study area from 2016 to 2100. The results show that the total water demand in the upstream Yangtze River appears to first increase and then decrease in 2016–2100 and will reach its peak around 2028. The ecological pressure in the upstream Yangtze River increases gradually from upstream to downstream but will not reach the surface water utilization stress threshold (hereinafter referred to as stress threshold) for the next 85 years. The contradiction between monthly supply and demand is more prominent under ecological restrictions. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, water demand exceeds the stress threshold in each sub-basin across several months (mainly March, April, and May), and the water demand nearly reaches the damage threshold in May as the basin extends below the Zhutuo section.</jats:p>"

We analyze the optimal decisions in the centralized and decentralized situations, respectively, and verify that single trade credit cannot coordinate the supply chain. However, the collaboration contract can coordinate the supply chain. Furthermore, this paper explores the influence of risk-aversion factor, trade credit period, revenue sharing coefficient, and other parameters on the optimal decisions and studies the feasible range of Pareto improvement in the collaborative model. In numerical experiments, the results show that the decisions and profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer reply on the degree of the risk aversion, the trade credit period, and the revenue sharing coefficient. The collaborative contract effectively improves supply chain performance and achieves a ‘win-win’ situation for the supply chain members. In addition, we also consider two extensions for our research. One extension shows that the collaborative contract of trade credit and buyback can also coordinate the supply chain in a certain range. The other extension considers the optimal decision of a risk-averse manufacturer with CVaR.</jats:p>",

The photoautotrophic cultivation of microalgae using flue gas from power plants has been continuously investigated to improve the economic feasibility of microalgae processes. The utilization of waste CO2 from power plants is advantageous in reducing carbon footprints and the cost of carbon sources. Nonetheless, the sudden interruption of CO2 supply during microalgal cultivation leads to a severe reduction in biomass productivity. Herein, chemical fertilizers including urea and KH2PO4 were added to the culture medium when CO2 supply was halted. Urea (5 mM) and KH2PO4 (5 mM) were present in the culture medium in the form of CO2/NH4+ and K+/H2PO4−, respectively, preventing cell growth inhibition. The culture with urea and KH2PO4 supplementation exhibited 10.02-fold higher and 7.28-fold higher biomass and lipid productivity, respectively, compared to the culture with ambient CO2 supply due to the maintenance of a stable pH and dissolved inorganic carbon in the medium. In the mass cultivation of microalgae using flue gas from coal-fired power plants, urea and KH2PO4 were supplied while the flue gas supply was shut off.

В эпоху энергоэффективности и энергосбережения на строительных предприятиях становится как никогда актуальным применение принципиально новых и высокоэффективных с точки зрения энергетической составляющей методов обработки бетонных и железобетонных изделий. Одним из таких направлений является использование электротепловой обработки бетонных и железобетонных изделий с применением мощных полупроводниковых источников питания на основе последних достижений силовой электроники. Электротепловая обработка бетонных и железобетонных изделий с источником питания повышенной частоты в большинстве случаев может быть использована с целью повышения эффективности и удобства самого процесса прогрева взамен традиционных способов, таких как паровой прогрев в автоклавах, нагрев инфракрасным излучением, прогрев активными нагревательными элементами и электродный прогрев током промышленной частоты. Рассматриваемый в статье метод подразумевает использование электротехнического комплекса повышенной частоты (ЭTКПЧ) и систему электродного прогрева. В дополнение к электродному прогреву, не всегда удобному на предприятиях сборного железобетона, авторами была разработана концепция применения ЭТKПЧ для организации индукционного нагрева бетонных конструкций. По сравнению с электродным прогревом, индукционный нагрев более совершенен в плане электробезопасности, не требует источников питания с большой силой тока, его можно использовать в железобетонных изделиях практически любой конфигурации, имеющих разветвлённую металлическую арматуру. В отличие от прогрева активными нагревательными элементами, индукционный нагрев не требует наличия нагревательных элементов, способных выходить из строя из-за локальных перегревов и требующих хорошего теплового контакта между нагревателем и опалубкой. В данном исследовании приводятся результаты физического моделирования ЭТKПЧ при работе на активно-индуктивную нагрузку (индуктор, установленный на стальной поверхности) и определения эквивалентных параметров нагрузки.

In the era of energy efficiency and energy saving approaches at construction enterprises the use of fundamentally new and highly efficient methods of processing concrete and reinforced concrete products from the point of view of the energy component has become more relevant than ever. One of these areas is the application of electrothermal treatment of concrete and reinforced concrete products with the use of highpower semiconductor power sources based on the latest achievements of power electronics. Electrothermal treatment of concrete and reinforced concrete products with a high-frequency power source in most cases can be used to increase the efficiency and convenience of the heating process itself instead of traditional methods, such as steam heating in autoclaves, heating with infrared radiation, heating with active heating elements and electrode heating with industrial frequency current. The method considered in the article involves the use of the electrotechnical complex of increased frequency and an electrode heating system. In addition to the electrode heating, which is not always convenient in precast concrete enterprises, the authors developed the concept of using electrotechnical complex of increased frequency for the organization of induction heating of concrete structures. Compared to electrode heating, induction heating is more advanced in terms of electrical safety, does not require power sources with high current, it can be used in reinforced concrete products of almost any configuration, having branched metal fittings. Unlike heating with active heating elements, induction heating does not require heating elements that can fail due to local overheating and require good thermal contact between the heater and the formwork. This paper presents the results of physical modeling of the electrotechnical complex of increased frequency when exposed to active-inductive load (an inductor mounted on a steel surface) and the determination of equivalent load parameters. The authors have experimentally demonstrated the possibility and expediency of transmitting electricity over a high-voltage cable line at an increased frequency (about 13 kHz) for the power supply of a load with a pronounced inductive character.</jats:p>",

We propose a supply chain inventory model with controllable deterioration and emission rates under payment schemes for shortage and surplus, where demand depends on price and trade credit. Carbon emissions and deterioration are factors affecting global warming, and many greenhouse managers have focused on reducing carbon emissions. Carbon caps and tax-based incentives have been used in many greenhouses to achieve such reduction. Because of the importance of reducing carbon emissions for developing a green supply chain, various studies have investigated how firms deal with carbon emission constraints. In this continuation, we have used green technology to curb the excessive emissions from the environment or make it clean from CO2. In a seller–buyer relationship, the seller can offer a trade credit period to the buyer to manage stock and stimulate demand. Deterioration may become a challenge for most firms as they are under time constraints control, and preservation technology could help. This study proposes three novel inventory strategies for a sustainable supply chain (full backorder, partial backorder, and no backorder), linking all these important issues. The solution optimizes total annual profit for inventory shortage or surplus. We conducted a numerical study with three examples to evaluate the model’s authenticity and effectiveness and demonstrate the solution technique. The deterioration and emission rates can be included in a trade credit policy to increase greenhouse profits. The results suggest that greenhouse managers could apply the proposed model to manage real-world situations.</jats:p>"

To understand the biological effects of different strength magnetized fresh water (MFW), seed germination and potted experiments on cotton were carried out to study the effects of MFW with different magnetic intensity (0, 100, 300, 500 mT). Results showed that the surface tension coefficient of MFW reduced by 7.3–10.5%, whilst dissolved oxygen concentrations increased by 8.8–12.7%. Germination strength indexes of cotton cultivated with MFW significantly increased, showing potential and vigor indexes of 16.8–22.4% and 47.4–78.0%, respectively. The emergence rate of cotton irrigated with MFW was faster and higher, with recorded values of 7.7–13.1%. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE) of cotton increased significantly, whereas the stomatal limit value (Ls) decreased. In all, results suggest the total biomasses of MFW irrigated cotton have significantly increased. Therefore, it is suggested that MFW may more effectively promote the utilization of water and light in cotton under magnetic field intensities of 300–500 mT. The results can provide guidance for the efficient utilization of magnetized fresh water in arid and semi-arid areas.</jats:p>",

Indeed, these models rely on retrospective analyses that provide insights into shifting human population demands and adaptions to water shortages. However, accurate, methodologically consistent, empirically authentic, and spatiotemporally comprehensive historical datasets for water withdrawals are scarce. Herein, we present a reanalysis of annual resolution (1950–2016) historical data set on irrigation, electric power, and public supply water withdrawal within the conterminous United States (US) at the county‐level, and, for power plants, at the site‐level. To estimate electric power water use, we synthesized a historically comprehensive list of generators and historic patterns in generation across fuels, prime movers, and cooling technologies. Irrigation water use estimation required building a crop‐demand model that utilized historical information on irrigated acreage for crops and golf courses, stage‐specific crop water demand, and climate information. To estimate public water supply use, we developed a random forest model constructed from information on population, infrastructure, climate, and land cover. These estimates generally agree with total county and state water use information provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS) water use circular and estimates generated from independent studies for specific years. However, we also observed discrepancies between our estimates and USGS data that appear to be caused by inconsistencies in the methods used by the USGS's primary data sources at the state level over decades of data collection, highlighting the importance of reanalysis to yield spatiotemporally consistent and intercomparable estimates of water use.</jats:p>",

Several strategies including jurisdictional planning and producer or sectoral‐level sourcing/certification have been used to counter this threat, each with its own limitations. There is growing interest in using jurisdictional sourcing (JS) as a hybrid that combines the best elements of each of these strategies. Specifically, JS involves bringing together key stakeholders in a given national or sub‐national political jurisdiction to agree on a land‐use plan that maintains forest ecosystems while promoting enhanced commodity production on degraded lands. Under JS, a key incentive for this agreement is the prospect of preferential sourcing from supply chain actors who want conversion‐free commodities. As with any conservation strategy, the key questions are what defines JS and under what conditions is it likely to work? To help address these questions, we convened a group of practitioners/experts to develop a theory of change that explicitly defines what JS entails from both the perspective of a given jurisdiction as well as a global markets point of view. We also developed generic objectives and indicators that can be used to measure performance. We then vetted our initial drafts with a wider circle of JS practitioners/experts as well as through a review of relevant literature and against seven case studies. It is our hope that this framework can be used to inform the collection of more standardized data across JS strategies being implemented in different locations and conditions. This data could, in turn, inform more systematic assessments of JS strategies and ultimately, revisions to this theory of change as our collective knowledge improves.</jats:p>",

Evidence in favour of using the marginal price rather than the average price is obtained, and the selection of the price is found to influence the value of the elasticities. Based on a translog cost function, the direct price elasticity of water (−0.86), the output elasticity (0.73) and the cross-price elasticities between water and capital, labour and supplies (being all of them substitutes) were estimated. By subsectors, the influence of price is only significant in those with a higher share of water in the total production cost. These results indicate that pricing can be used as a tool for managing water demand by promoting conservation of the resource. However, these results also indicate that the simultaneous use of other instruments is advisable to reinforce the impact of pricing policy on water consumption.</jats:p>",

It is a major challenge to identify the dynamic immersion process and make economic and scientific joint mitigation measures for controlling groundwater immersion. Here, we develop a three-dimensional groundwater flow model and apply it to evaluate and control reservoir immersion in the typical low-lying DFB of Xingan Navigation and Power Junction Project (XGNPJ) across Ganjiang River in Jiangxi Province, China. The field-scale model is well calibrated to predict where the groundwater immersion could potentially occur. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the countermeasures adopted for the reduction of reservoir immersion areas were analysed based on the simulation model by considering the projected future combination scenarios of engineering measures. Results indicate that without engineering mitigation measures, SWI generates groundwater inundation across 23% of the total study area. Comprehensive comparative analysis on different seepage control schemes reveals that the joint engineering measures can effectively control the immersion range to 5% of the total area. The findings can provide scientific basis for groundwater immersion assessment and guide immersion control of XGNPJ project.</jats:p>",

However, due to the inevitable spillover effect in the competitive network, enterprises’ initiative to improve the service level is reduced. From the perspective of negative spillover effect, optimization and decision-making in the competitive network of retailer-dominated supply chain are examined in this study. Considering four competitive situations in practical operation management, the corresponding double-layer compound nested Stackelberg game models are constructed, and the optimal equilibrium solutions are derived. Employing comprehensive comparison and analysis of the results, it is found that when the negative spillover effect of service increases, the optimal profit and service level of the leading supply chain or its retailers decrease, and the optimal retail price and overall optimal profit also gradually decline. For the leading supply chain, the centralized decision-making can achieve higher profits, and also more willing to improve the level of service. However, for the following supply chain, when the negative spillover effect of service is weak, the optimal service level under decentralized decision is higher, while when the spillover effect of service is strong, the optimal service level under integrated decision is higher. In addition, the supply chain-to-chain competition can bring negative incentives to the retailer that provides services, while for the rival that does not provide services, it can generate a certain free-riding effect that benefits them, and the effect is enhanced with the increase of competition.</jats:p>"

The age of both market globalization and outsourcing has started, and many companies tend to manage their supply chain and logistics activities. Most of these organizations understand that SCM needs to be tested for its performance in order to create an effective and efficient supply chain. Since e-commerce buys and sells goods over the Internet, in addition to payment between the two parties, it is the transfer of goods that also needs to occur in a correct and timely manner, hence the need for the supply chain. The supply chain is the most critical element for companies to boom in e-commerce, which needs to be quick, uninterrupted and safe. The competition is fierce because not one or two, but hundreds of e-commerce companies are competing for market share, each finding and creating specific strategies for sale and distribution. The present study is an attempt to examine various issues of supply chain management in the E-Commerce context. Although there is a lack of literature in this context, the current study critically reviewed the current literature and built a questionnaire with the inputs from leading e-commerce managers by identifying the main supply chain management issues such as preparation, inbound, outbound, returns, orders and trying to find the effect of these variables on organizational efficiency. A sample size of 100 employees employed in supply chain departments at different levels of five leading e-commerce fashion &amp; lifestyle organizations in India was taken for a questionnaire survey as a sampling unit.

However, most cluster schemes choose cluster head randomly to send data without considering load balancing and security. In addition, some cluster heads in the highly active area may be overloaded, while others in the low active area may be overloaded, which may easily lead to extreme imbalance in task allocation. Our research on relevant literature shows that the existing authentication schemes do not fully consider the load balancing of cluster heads, while the load balancing schemes ignore the security authentication of cluster heads. Therefore, this article effectively combines load balancing and security verification, and proposes a lightweight load balancing and verification scheme (secure load and energy balancing) based on clustered wireless sensor networks. Secure load and energy balancing implements cluster head’s authentication and confidentiality and integrity of all messages in load balancing. This scheme not only effectively maintains the energy balance of the whole network but also successfully improves the security overhead, thus prolonging the network lifetime. The simulation results show that compared with other similar schemes, this scheme has higher packet forwarding rate, longer network life, and lower overhead. This further proves that the scheme is energy-saving, safe, dynamic, stable, and sustainable. </jats:p>",

Owing to its poor water solubility and limited intracellular iron content, it is challenging for further application in antitumor therapy.

Drug release experiments showed that ART was not nearly released in pH 7.4, while 59% ART was released in pH 5.0 after 10 h, demonstrating the excellent pH-triggered release. Meanwhile, a high level of intracellular ROS and MDA, accompanied with decreasing GSH and GPX4, displayed a newly developed nano-drug system displayed markedly enhanced ferroptosis.

Miniaturizing the DBDPA power supply remains a crucial technological challenge because its size and weight determine the performance of fluid devices equipped with this type of actuator. In this study, we propose a compact high-voltage AC power supply for a DBDPA intended for installation on small airplanes, including unmanned aerial vehicles. The power supply, which consists of a power supply board, a main control board, and a DC/AC converter board, is ∼110 g in weight. It can drive a 300-mm long DBDPA without any substantial voltage drop. The power consumption in standby remains below 1 W, and the maximum consumption during discharge in burst mode at a burst ratio of 5% is 24 W. The power supply uses a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1800 mA h, which allows continuous DBDPA operation for ∼1.5 h. An experiment was conducted in a wind tunnel using an airfoil model whose cross-section corresponds to that of an airfoil from a commercial glider airplane. Experimental results reveal that the surface pressure around the airfoil is modified by DBDPA operation, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed power supply for operating a DBDPA as a flow control device. The size and weight of the proposed power supply can be established as a benchmark to further miniaturize and optimize DBDPA power supplies.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of SPARS on improving supply chain management. A series of four papers on SPARS described the SPARS concept, its impact on overall and domain practices and appropriate medicines use, and now in the fourth paper describing the effect on supply chain management.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>District-based health workers trained as supervisors build facility-level capacity in medicines management using an indicator-based performance assessment followed by targeted supervisory visits. From 2010 to 2013, 1222 SPARS visits were implemented, and the SPARS performance indicator scores determined. This article assesses impact on 13 indicators in three of the five SPARS domains—stock management, storage management, and ordering and reporting quality—using a pre–post design.

This requires the introduction of an energy storage device (storage battery) into such systems and the organization of an appropriate booster channel (BC). In the output stage of the BDK, various types of transformer-and-switches executive structure (TSES) are used, in particular, multilevel rectifiers (MLR), one of the quality indicators of which is the efficiency of using semiconductor devices. In order to increase this indicator, it is proposed to perform the decomposition of the MLU from two series-connected blocks, which made it possible to synthesize new circuitry solutions for the TSES of this type. The possibility of achieving the desired accuracy of maintaining the output voltage with a limited number of semiconductor devices has been confirmed on specific examples.

The knowledge of multiple fields such as industry 4.0, supply chain management, logistic supply chain management and CPEC project plans have been synthesized. An attempt has been made to model a future state created through CPEC facilities and initiatives. A model framework is presented based on the core infrastructure of CPEC projects, which will push Pakistan towards industrialization through utilizing modern manufacturing techniques and establishment of supply web. The CPEC supply web model proposes to create high quality, mass customized products from raw material and parts to be supplied from local and nearby regions through efficient logistic pathway of CPEC and BRI. A supply chain operational reference (SCOR) model has also been developed for an insight into the scenario. It is important for investors, trade associations, businessmen and policy makers to understand the population, market, and economic dynamics along with modern manufacturing trends to create smart factories and supply chains in context of CPEC.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research was conducted during 2019–2020 in the laboratory of agrochemical research and product quality of the Institute of Vegetable and Melon NAAS. The soil of the experimental site - typical low-humus loamy chernozem on loess loam (in the plow layer (0-25 cm) of humus contained 4.3%N hydrolyzed - 139,0 mg/kg, mobile P - 106-119 mg/kg and exchangeable K - 93 mg/kg of soil, hydrolytic acidity - 2.8 mg-Eq per 100 g of soil, pH of salt extract - 5.7, the sum of absorbed bases - 26.0 mg-Eq per 100 g of soil). The research studied the effectiveness of different fertilizing systems: 1) without fertilizer (control); 2) N185P185K225; 3) N370P370K450; 4) N370P370K450 + foliar fertilization with complex fertilizer \"Nutrivant plus universal\" 2 kg / ha in 3 terms; 5) mold 20 t/ha + ash 1 t/ha 6) mold 20 t/ha + ash 1 t/ha + tillage planting soil fertilizer \"Hraundfiks\" (3 l/ha) + the first fertigation microbial drug \" Azotophyte ”(1 l/ha) + for the second fertigation microbial preparation“ Organic Balance ”(1 l/ha) + foliar fertilization“ Help-rost for vegetable plants ”2 l/ha in 3 terms. Foliar fertilization was carried out in three terms: 30 days after planting (III decade of June), with active growth of vegetative mass (III decade of July), with active growth of tubers (III decade of August). The research was conducted in accordance with generally accepted methods. The total area of the plot was 33.6 m2, accounting - 21 m2, repetition - three times. In the study, sweet potatoes of the Slobozhansky Ruby variety were grown under drip irrigation, planting schemes (100 + 40) x 25 cm and mulching the soil with straw. According to the results of the study, it was found that the use of mineral and organic fertilizers by improving the nutritional conditions of plants provided an increase in the yield of sweet potato tubers and had a positive effect on their biochemical properties. On average, over the years of research, the use of different fertilizer systems causes an increase in the total yield of tubers by 5.3–8.7 t / ha or 34–56%, the yield of standard tubers - by 2.9–4.6 t / ha or 27–42 %. The highest level of sweet potato yield was provided by the use of N370P370K450 in combination with Nutrivant plus universal foliar fertilizers. The total yield of such a fertilizer system is 24.3 t / ha, of which 15.5 t / ha of standard tubers. According to our data, the effectiveness of increasing the dose of mineral fertilizers from N185P185K225 to N370P370K450 has not been proven, as there is no significant difference between the options. Additional fertilization with complex fertilizers provides a positive trend to increase the yield of sweet potatoes by 3.3 t/ha. The use of an organic fertilizer system (20 t / ha of humus and 1 t / ha of ash) provides an increase in the total yield of tubers by 6.7 t / ha or 43%, while the additional use of a set of microbial drugs is not justified by a significant increase in yield (22.8 t / ha). It was found that the use of organic fertilizers in combination with microbial preparations had the most positive effect on the biochemical composition of sweet potato tubers. Under this system of nutrition optimization, the dry matter content in tubers (18.6%), starch (9.06%) increased, and the low nitrate content (28.1 mg / kg) was noted. Under the mineral fertilizer system N370P370K450 with the use of complex fertilizers significantly increased the dry matter content (17.7%), however, the nitrate content was the highest in the experiment (78.5 mg / kg). There is a tendency to reduce the total sugar in sweet potato tubers with the use of all fertilizer systems, especially with the use of mineral fertilizer system N370P370K450 in combination with foliar fertilization \"Nutrivant plus universal\" (3.4% with the value of this indicator in control - 4.74%). To adjust the doses of mineral fertilizers under sweet potatoes, we calculated the absorption coefficients of nutrients from fertilizers and soil. It was found that on chernozem, a typical low-humus light loam plant, sweet potatoes absorb up to 57% of mobile forms of N, 11.6% of mobile forms of P and up to 61.2% of mobile forms of K. Nutrient utilization factors from mineral fertilizers are 40.7% for N; P - 26.1%, K - 73.5%. It should be noted that the utilization rates of soil nutrients vary not only depending on the biological characteristics of plants, but also due to changes in soil fertility, weather conditions, level of technological support, etc., which to some extent complicates their use in determining estimated doses of fertilizers. The rate of absorption of nutrients by sweet potato plants under different fertilizer systems was established. Without fertilizers, sweet potato plants absorb 88.2% N, 60.6% P and 80.5% K from the total consumption of plant nutrients in the first two months of growth. With mineral and organic fertilizer systems, the peak of nutrient consumption occurs at 2-3 months of plant growth, ie with the active formation and growth of tuber mass. Without the use of fertilizers by the end of the growing season significantly reduced uptake by plants P (104.4 kg/ha) and K (252.4 kg/ha), which, in our opinion, affect the reduction in yield yam. It should be noted that the uptake of K by sweet potato plants in the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine is higher than in the soils of the southern regions (according to Degras [34], the removal of K with sweet potato plants is 110–135 kg/ha). It is noted that depending on the fertilizer system 56.9–76.9% of N accumulates in the leaves, 10.2–13.6% in the stems, 12.9–29.5% in the roots and tubers. P 31.2–49.9% accumulates in leaves, 13.4–20% in stems, 30.1–55.4% in roots and tubers; for K 41.6–51.9% in leaves, 13.2–21.2% in stems, 26.9–45.2% in tubers and roots.</jats:p>",

Model parameter transfers provide a new way of doing hydrological forecasts and simulations in ungauged catchments. To study the transferability of model parameters for hydrological modelling and the influence of parameter transfers on hydrological simulations, the Xin'anjiang model (XAJ model), which is a lumped hydrologic model based on a saturation excess mechanism that has been widely applied in different climate regions of the world, was applied to a low hilly catchment in eastern China, the Chengxi experimental watershed (CXEW). The suitability of the XAJ model was tested in the eastern branch catchment of CXEW and the calibrated model parameters of the eastern branch catchment were then transferred to the western branch catchment and the entire watershed of the CXEW. The results show that the XAJ model performs well for the calibrated eastern branch catchment at both daily and monthly scales on hydrological modelling with the NSEs over 0.6 and the REs less than 2.0%. Besides, the uncalibrated catchments of the western branch catchment and the entire watershed of the CSEW share similarities in climate (the precipitation) and geography (the soil texture and vegetation cover) with the calibrated catchment, the XAJ model and the transferred model parameters can capture the main features of the hydrological processes in both uncalibrated catchments (western catchments and the entire watershed). This transferability of the model is useful for a scarce data region to simulate the hydrological process and its forecasting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper handles Stackelberg game models in light of different alliance strategies in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and a third-party recycler. In this CLSC, four scenarios are examined: the decentralized case, the manufacturer and the retailer forming an alliance, the manufacturer and the third-party recycler forming an alliance, and the centralized case. And in these Stackelberg game models, a comparison between four alliance strategies is analyzed by considering greenness and service effort. The effect of alliance strategy on the decisions of the CLSC system, consumer, environment, and society is also investigated. The main objective is to find out the optimal price, greenness level, and service effort to maximize the CLSC members’ profits and give the optimal alliance strategy by using theoretical analysis. It is found that the alliance strategy improves the operation efficiency of the CLSC, and it also benefits consumers, the environment, and society. The MR alliance strategy is more effective than the MT alliance strategy, but it cannot achieve the efficiency of a centralized scenario. Finally, numerical examples are illustrated to justify the feasibility and practicability of the proposed models in reality.</jats:p>",

Docetaxel (DTX)‐entrapped CCPM, also referred to as CPC634, have demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and enhanced tumor uptake in patients. Clinical efficacy evaluation is ongoing. CPC634 is currently stored (shelf life &gt; 5 years) and shipped as a frozen aqueous dispersion at temperatures below −60°C, in order to prevent premature release of DTX and hydrolysis of the core‐crosslinks. Consequently, like other aqueous nanomedicine formulations, CPC634 relies on cold chain supply, which is unfavorable for commercialization. Lyophilization can help to bypass this issue.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and results</jats:title><jats:p>Freeze‐drying methodology for CCPM was developed by employing CPC634 as a model formulation, and sucrose and trehalose as cryoprotectants.

Subsequently, the freeze‐drying methodology was validated in an industrial setting, yielding a CPC634 freeze‐dried cake with a moisture content of less than 0.1 wt%. It was found that trehalose‐cryoprotected CPC634 could be rapidly reconstituted in less than 5 min at room temperature. Critical quality attributes such as size, morphology, drug retention, and release kinetics of trehalose‐cryoprotected freeze‐dried CPC634 upon reconstitution were identical to those of non‐freeze‐dried CPC634.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Our findings provide proof‐of‐concept for the lyophilization of drug‐containing CCPM and our methodology is readily translatable to large‐scale manufacturing for future commercialization.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This research aims to find out the characteristics of short food supply chains and their benefits to small farmers in Vietnam, which is a developing country, based on the survey results from 338 small farmers in the third quarter of 2020, with the support of Stata 14 software. The results showed that the short food supply chains in the survey sample in Vietnam were characterized by two main actors: small farmers and distributors. Farmers could sell products flexibly at the local market. There was some initial evidence to prove that these chains helped to stabilize the input, output price, and revenue; formulated sustainable income; and increased the satisfaction and confidence of farmers. They eliminated gender discrimination in rural areas and improved livelihood for ethnic minorities. These chains also enhanced the mindset on green, organic, and clean production of farmers, which in turn created environmental benefits. COVID-19 has posed a negative impact on the income of farmers and made them change their production and sales method. Therefore, the research could suggest some policies to sustainably develop the short food supply chains in Vietnam in the future.</jats:p>"
