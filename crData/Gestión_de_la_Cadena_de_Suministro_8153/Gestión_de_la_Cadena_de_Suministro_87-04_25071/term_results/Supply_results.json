The purposes of the survey were to determine the supply time of items received from the British Library Document Supply Centre (BLDSC), and to compare the performance of two transport scheme van delivery services in use. All requests sent to BLDSC over a period of 2½ weeks were monitored. BLDSC satisfied 71% of requests sent to it by the Polytechnic from stock, 51% being supplied within one week. The average supply time for an item was 5.9 days. As expected, the vast majority (98%) of items received were delivered by van. There would appear to be little to choose between the two van services used with regard to number of items delivered and speed of delivery.</jats:p>",

In 1982 the Higher Education Council (HEC) approved the centralization of university libraries, and HECDOC (HEC Documentation and International Literature Search Centre) was set up in order to develop a national collection of serials in support of university library collections. Up to now, interlending in Turkish university libraries has been largely neglected, not helped by a law which makes librarians personally responsible for all losses from their library. A survey of 28 university libraries has shown that current use of ILL services is not great, with the various libraries disagreeing in their attitudes to charging for ILL. HECDOC provides 55% of satisfied ILL requests and it is hoped that the creation of a union catalogue of serials, together with a standard photocopy request form, will increase this. Collection development in Turkish university libraries is seriously affected by declining budgets, rising literature costs and a shortage of hard currency. Resource sharing, including ILL, is seen as one way of solving these problems.</jats:p>",

Results suggest that the Japanese are more interested in western developments than other countries are in Japanese science and technology; in other words, the language barrier affects westerners far more than it affects the Japanese. Academic institutions are the predominant UK users of Japanese literature, followed closely by industry/commerce. With overseas users, most use comes from the industrial/commercial sector.

The assumption of an equilibrium market for physician services may not be realistic, at least not in the short term, because the cost of physician services is insufficiently flexible or because of the induced demand on the part of physicians. Different market assumptions will result in different model formulations and model estimations, and with different empirical implications of the estimated results. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper has used the US aggregate time-series data, 1950 to 1980, to estimate the demand and supply relationship of physician services, similar to the model specified in the Martin Feldstein article, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup> under a disequilibrium physician services market assumption. The maximum likelihood method is used for the empirical estimation. Contrary to Feldstein's earlier findings, the price elasticity of the demand for physicians is statistically significant with expected signs under a disequilibrium condition. The elasticity of supply of physician services is also, as expected, positive and statistically significant. Economic and policy implications are discussed based on these findings. This paper should fill empirically the gap that has been noted by previous researchers on the demand for physician services. </jats:p>",

Output declined thereafter and, following a brief recovery during the Second World War, had virtually ceased by 1981. Neither the methods, location nor level of production remained constant during the mining era. The widespread use of hydraulic sluicing and the proximity of many mines to the main river were major factors contributing to the high rate of sediment supply, with the Briseis mine at Derby being the dominant source. Based on data from published and unpublished papers, and mine records, the variable nature of that supply was estimated using a procedure which takes account of the effects of storage and changing practices. Many input points supplied material but the overall pattern is one in which downstream reaches made later starts and reached later peaks, suggesting that they will continue to experience the effects of an increased sediment load for some time.</jats:p>",

These studies indicated that motor potentials recorded in the trapezius muscle after stimulation of the ventral rami of cervical spinal nerves in general represented the spread of current to the contiguous portions of the spinal accessory nerve or directly to the trapezius muscle. Rarely did there seem to be evidence of motor innervation to the upper and lower trapezius by fibers conveyed by the ventral rami of cervical spinal nerves. The predominant motor input to the trapezius muscle is through the spinal accessory nerve.</jats:p><jats:p>Subjective evaluation, objective strength testing, and electromyographic evaluation were performed on patients who had undergone neck dissections. Three types of neck dissection were employed. These were modified neck dissection with preservation of the spinal accessory nerve, radical neck dissection with sacrifice of the spinal accessory nerve, and reconstruction using a cable graft and classical radical neck dissection. Regarding all of the methods of evaluation and comparison, the patients who retained function of the spinal accessory nerve in the postoperative period fared better than those who had a classical radical neck dissection with sacrifice of the spinal accessory nerve. This again supports the concept that the most important and predominant motor supply to the trapezius muscle is through the spinal accessory nerve.</jats:p><jats:p>All of this information was used to construct a model of the spinal portion of the accessory nerve and of the innervation of the trapezius muscle. The clinical implications of this model are stated.</jats:p>",
