It employs a descriptive method of study. A questionnaire survey is used to collect data for this study. The results show that the top five elements of the customer dimension of the balancing scorecard technique are believed to be customer retention, brand image, minimum customer complaints, careful staff to provide service and customer acquisition. The important factors that follow them include sufficient staff to provide services to customers, best appearance and friendliness of staff, customer profitability, distinctive product/service attributes, increasing market share, offering social/community services, in-time customer services, satisfied customers, and skillful and competent staff. However, market penetration success is thought to be the least important factor in the customer dimension of the balanced scorecard. Therefore, to be successful, today’s financial institutions must gather information from customers, use it to create a plan that will fulfill their demands, and then put that strategy into action by being receptive to their needs and desires.</jats:p>"

Clarity of corporate objectives supported by commitment to them can lead to significant performance improvements, in contrast to providing objectives that are vague or too general. The process of achieving these goals involves monitoring through performance measurement. One effective performance measurement method is using the Balanced Scorecard, which combines financial and non-financial aspects of the company. The purpose of this study is to analyze the application of the Balanced Scorecard to achieve the company's strategic goals. The research method used is qualitative, with data collection techniques through literature studies. The collected data were then analyzed through three stages, namely data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion drawing. The results showed that the use of Balanced Scorecard (BSC) can effectively assist the company in achieving its strategic goals. Good linkages between financial, customer, internal business, and growth and learning perspectives can produce optimal performance both in terms of financial and non-financial aspects for the company. The BSC approach focused on improving company performance not only encourages improvement in financial aspects, but also becomes the basis for evaluating the company's strategy to achieve continuous improvement.</jats:p>"

Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis were employed for data analysis. The results demonstrate significant positive relationships between strategic alignment, balanced scorecard, and optimal performance. Both strategic alignment and balanced scorecards were identified as significant predictors of optimal performance, indicating that higher scores in these constructs are associated with higher levels of performance. The findings underscore the critical role of strategic alignment and performance measurement frameworks in enhancing organizational performance in healthcare settings. However, the study faces limitations, including reliance on self-reported data and limited generalizability to other healthcare settings and regions. Future research should explore longitudinal or experimental designs and incorporate objective performance measures to enhance the validity and generalizability of the findings.

The research is based on the numerous public accounting firms that have been sanctioned by regulators, raising questions about the aspect of managerial performance. The study is grounded in agency theory as accountability in decision-making and contingency theory as the management role in a public accounting firm's organization. The research is quantitative with primary data from the population of auditors in public accounting firms in the DKI Jakarta region. The sample was selected using purpose sampling, and a total of 120 auditors were chosen. The research technique involves descriptive statistics using the SEM-PLS 4.0 tool. The research results yield two conclusions. The first model indicates that transformational leadership style partially influences balanced scorecard measurement, quality control system partially influences balanced scorecard measurement, transformational style partially influences managerial performance, quality control system partially influences managerial performance, and balanced scorecard measurement influences managerial performance. The second model shows that quality control system is mediated by balanced scorecard measurement influences managerial performance. Meanwhile, transformational leadership style mediated by balanced scorecard measurement does not influence managerial performance.</jats:p>"

A adequação das diretrizes estratégicas com os processos organizacionais permite a identificação, compreensão e coordenação dos processos administrativos de maneira eficiente, proporcionando o cumprimento dos princípios constitucionais da Administração Pública. Com o objetivo de contribuir para esta discussão, o presente artigo propõe a utilização do Mapa Estratégico do Balanced Scorecard para melhoria e aperfeiçoamento da gestão estratégica e orçamentária dos entes públicos. Quanto aos aspectos metodológicos, o estudo apresenta caráter científico, exploratório, com abordagem qualitativa e é classificado como um estudo de caso. Os instrumentos de pesquisa foram: a análise documental; a aplicação de questionário com a direção da Fundação Cultural de Florianópolis Franklin Cascaes (FCFFC) e coordenação do Festival Floripa Teatro Isnard Azevedo; e a observação, mediante visitas técnicas à entidade e à 18ª edição do evento, ocorrida em 2011. Ao longo do estudo ficam evidenciadas as vantagens da adaptação do Balanced Scorecard na esfera pública por meio da construção do Mapa Estratégico do festival, permitindo a interação entre as quatro perspectivas - financeira, clientes, processos internos e aprendizado e crescimento e a missão da FCFFC, bem como da percepção do papel da ferramenta como norteador das decisões estratégicas e orçamentárias do evento e da entidade.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to the application of the balanced scorecard system in the activities of an industrial enterprise using the example of Elekond JSC. The current remuneration mechanism at Elekond JSC is not related to the main goal of the enterprise. In order to increase the relationship between workers' compensation and the efficiency of the enterprise, it is necessary to increase labor productivity. The article discusses the concept of constructing a strategic map of an enterprise, which implements a system of interactions between the main business processes responsible for increasing the efficiency of the enterprise. Based on the analysis and construction of a strategic map of the enterprise's development, key performance indicators of individual divisions were identified, as a result of which it became possible to build a balanced scorecard system (BSS) for each division, highlight growth points and formulate key performance indicators (KPIs). For convenience of narration within the framework of this article, we limited the example to the motivation system of the department of labor and employment (OtiZ), which did not affect the integrity. Key indicators such as carrying out measures to reduce labor costs, improve production processes, and processing requests from departments were identified for O&amp;P employees. Each of the selected indicators was assigned ranks according to importance, and then a KPI value was set depending on the degree of implementation of the plan. Since fulfilling the plan for all indicators seems impossible, we used the KPI index and showed its impact on the amount of bonuses for individual employees. In general, the result of implementing measures to implement the BSC is positive; revenue from product sales increases, which affects labor productivity.</jats:p>",

A amostra resultou em 50 respondentes para a perspectiva clientes, 10 para a perspectiva financeira, 40 para aprendizado e crescimento e de processos internos. Os dados foram coletados por meio de questionário para captar os fatores ligados às quatro perspectivas do BSC e, posteriormente, validados em uma segunda rodada de questionários. O estudo mostrou que a cooperativa de crédito deverá desenvolver esforços para atender aos clientes e incentivar os colaboradores, afim de que a organização continue desenvolvendo com sucesso suas atividades.

The research included 24 Regional Public Sector Offices and 268 Local Public Sector Offices as part of the sample.\nFindings - The findings showed substantial causal relationships within the Public Sector Balanced Scorecard perspectives, with training significantly influencing employee performance in taxation dissemination and tax supervision activities. However, the impact of training on tax audit performance was considered insignificant. The empirical evidence suggested that tax audit was the only performance indicator positively associated with tax compliance. Determinant factors for tax revenue included tax compliance, dissemination, audit, and supervision.\nNovelty - This research contributes crucial insights by showing intricate causal relationships among performance indicators, indicating the significant impact of training on distinct facets of employee performance. Additionally, the study identifies tax audits as an essential factor positively influencing tax compliance.
