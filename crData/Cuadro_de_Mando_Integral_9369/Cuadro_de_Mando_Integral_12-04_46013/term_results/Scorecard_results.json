      "abstract": "<jats:p>This case study examines the issues in the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) implemen- tation in a business unit of a branch of an international accounting firm in Vietnam. The study described the process of the BSC system implemented a Vietnam-based international audit firm, and used Kasurinen (2002)’s model of barriers to account- ing change to analyse barriers that caused the system ineffective. The study revealed that despite a very sound implementation process, several issues were found. They are low awareness of the system among staff and seniors, and the fail- ure to use the system to align the firm’s strategy with individuals’ development plan. The reasons for these issues were classified into confusers, frustrators and delay- ers. Confusers were the lack of understanding about the system, weak sponsorship process from seniors and managers, and different views on the use of the system among managers. Frustrators were the preference for indirect communication and routine of using personal relationship in allocating staff into jobs. These were found to be culture-related and task-related barriers. Delaying factors were the inade- quate education and training process, the human resource constraint, and the gap between intended and actual uses of a component in the BSC system. The study sug- gests that the inadequate of training for staff about the system seems to be the main cause of all issues; therefore, a better focus on training for staff may help to improve the effectiveness of the system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a methodology that allows managers to define and implement a set of financial or nonfinancial indicators in a balanced way to assess an organization's performance from four viewpoints. Many companies are unsuccessful in their implementation of the BSC. This lack of success may be attributed to different factors, such as strategic problems, planning failures, and poorly defined targets and goals. However, the failed implementation may be attributed in part to the failure to institutionalize habits and routines. In this regard, this objective of this paper is to use institutional theory to determine whether the book Strategy in Action: Balanced Scorecard contains evidence that the BSC model proposed by the authors (Kaplan &amp; Norton) includes elements that favor the model's institutionalization. For this purpose, a qualitative bibliographic survey was prepared. The survey revealed 404 clues that were rated according to Tolbert and Zucker's description of the processes inherent to institutionalization and to Scott's proposed framework of legitimation/legitimizing. These findings suggest that the book primarily legitimizes the BSC by examining organizations and describes it as an acknowledged management instrument. The aspects supporting the semi-institutional stage (26% of the findings) and the total institutionalization stage (10% of findings) suggest that the authors intended to propose a tool without focusing on the institutionalization process, which may partly explain the great difficulty faced by companies attempting to implement this methodology.</jats:p>",

In addition, the paper aims to test the effectiveness level of the AIS and causality relation between the system development process and its effectiveness level. A survey using self-administered questionnaire has been carried out to achieve the study objectives. The study results reveal that Jordanian industrial companies do not have effective accounting information systems; there is no enough evidence that support the sole relationship between the system development process and its effectiveness level.</p>",
