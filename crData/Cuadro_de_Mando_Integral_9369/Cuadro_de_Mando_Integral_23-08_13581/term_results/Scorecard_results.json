Sin embargo, no contempla la integración de herramientas de gestión que se ajusten a sus perspectivas, lo cual brindaría un sistema completo de instrumentos administrativos para dirigir exitosamente una organización. Por ello, continuar profundizando en esta línea de investigación resulta importante y este estudio enfrenta el problema siguiente: ¿Cómo integrar las principales herramientas de gestión empresarial para la toma de decisiones? El objetivo del estudio fue diseñar una plataforma de gestión empresarial utilizando el BSC como base para un sistema integrado de herramientas. La metodología se enmarcó en el nivel descriptivo, de tipo transversal y observacional. Se aplicaron entrevistas a expertos y se efectuó una revisión documental apoyada en una matriz de categorías. Como resultado se diseñó un sistema integrado de herramientas de gestión que utiliza como plataforma las perspectivas del BSC, lo cual beneficia la toma de decisiones gerenciales. La propuesta representa un punto de partida para su aplicación en las organizaciones que requieran contar con una plataforma que integre herramientas de gestión en el ejercicio de sus operaciones diarias.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The prerequisite for businesses’ success, competitiveness, and non-bankruptcy is their performance. An effective performance measurement system is a suitable tool for measuring and improving business performance. The development in performance measures moved from financial measures focused on company profitability to measurement systems combining different methods, approaches, and tools. The paper aims to identify key performance indicators for Slovak heating companies based on the developed integrated performance measurement system. The analysis sampled 292 Slovak companies within SK NACE 35 (heating industry). The performance measurement system was built on balanced scorecard principles, while the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso regression) method was used to select financial indicators. Based on the combination of the above methods, a performance measurement system framework for the analyzed sample of businesses was created. The results show that when managing performance, the analyzed businesses should focus on the following financial performance indicators: Receivables turnover ratio, Return on equity, Return on costs, Total debt to total assets, Material intensity, Labor to revenue ratio, Netto cash flow to assets, Net working capital to total assets, and Short-term liabilities to assets. When building performance measurement system based on balanced scorecard principles, financial indicators were supplemented by non-financial ones. In addition to the original balanced scorecard principles, the performance measurement system was extended by environmental constituents. Also, the paper’s deliverable combines Lasso regression and balanced scorecard principles in order to select key performance indices.\nAcknowledgmentThis paper is prepared within the grant scheme VEGA No. 1/0741/20 (the application of variant methods in detecting symptoms of possible bankruptcy of Slovak businesses in order to ensure their sustainable development).</jats:p>",

In this study, we adopt a general conceptual model from innovation theory and apply it to packaging innovation. This helps identify and describe subprocesses in packaging innovation and how to measure their performance. It also links the packaging innovation process to the cost and climate performance of packaging. Based on the modified model for packaging innovation, the purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a scorecard for assessing the packaging innovation process.</jats:p><jats:p>The first step in the methodology was the conceptual development of a model describing the packaging innovation process and a scorecard for assessing this process. The second step was to demonstrate and validate the scorecard in a case study covering packaging innovation at a major retail company. Data were captured from six semi‐structured interviews and two workshops, as well as observations and site visits.</jats:p><jats:p>The conceptual model defines packaging innovation using seven interrelated subprocesses and their impacts on cost and climate performance. The scorecard that was developed in the research study describes how to measure the subprocesses and their output. The quality of each of the seven processes is measured on two to four dimensions. Each dimension can reach a score of one to four, where each score is clearly defined.</jats:p><jats:p>The case study showed that the scorecard seems to be an effective way of measuring the complex packaging innovation process and identifying concrete ways to improve packaging innovation. The case study validated the scorecard and demonstrated how it can be applied. The application also showed how the case company performs in packaging innovation compared to best practice in each subprocess. The validation showed that the scorecard is sufficiently functional and useful, although it requires input from multiple sources. The usability could only be partly assessed—it showed promising value as a basis for formulating action plans—but future studies should validate the scorecard's long‐term usefulness in creating action plans and assess their impact.</jats:p><jats:p>The theoretically‐based scorecard is novel in terms of assessing packaging innovation and its impact on packaging performance in supply chains. It links the packaging innovation process to performance and helps companies identify improvement possibilities. The paper shows how the scorecard helps address packaging issues strategically by measuring the activities conducted in the packaging innovation process. One limitation of the study is that the long‐term usefulness of the scorecard could not be validated, as the validation would take longer than the time available for this study.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the modern African state is indeed still highly confounding and the embedded puzzle is largely attributable to democracy discontents. There was the supposition that democracy would lead to development on the continent. However, it is the position of this paper that this assumption is becoming increasingly mislaid. The paper adopted the documentary method of research which entails the use of textbooks, journals, internet and other documented materials and subsequently interrogates the linkages between democracy and development among African states with specific focus on Nigeria. It tables the political indicators of development and assesses the performance of the Nigerian state against the background of these indications. The thesis of the work is that as long as the political indicators of development are in deficiencies in Nigeria, democracy and development will remain immensely disarticulated. Relying on elite theory, the study concludes that elitist personification of the state and its institutions remains the major impediment to the linking of democracy with development in Nigeria. It recommends reforms of the institutions of the state to serve as catalyst for development in the country.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organisations has recently experienced many operational difficulties hence the performance measurement systems (PMSs) have a great deal of importance in understanding organisational effectiveness in the wake of pandemic. Organisations use different types of PMSs according to their specific conditions. This situation is explained by contingency theory that the environmental and/or firm-specific factors cause organisations to use different types of PMSs. One of the organisational factors is the management's structure; particularly decentralised decision authority, is described as the delegation of decision rights throughout the organisation. In this type of an organisational structure, innovative PMS such as the balanced scorecard (BSC) is more effective to meet the information needs of organisations. Numerous studies investigated the relationship between the decentralised decision authority, different PMSs and organisational effectiveness. Nevertheless, researchers emphasise the need for a better understanding of factors influencing the use of innovative PMSs. Furthermore, previous studies only investigated organisational performance but, managerial satisfaction is another outcome of performance measurement implementation and given the received scant attention, it is needed to advance our understanding on this topic. Reviewed literature also indicates the need for more research on the firm’s contingent factors, PMS, and managerial satisfaction relationship. In light of methodological developments in PLS-SEM domain, the current study answers this call by conducting research in the hotel industry. Hotel industry is a dynamic industry hence, decentralised decision authority enables to provide effective and timely decisions for arising conditions. Therefore, using the contingency theory, this study proposes and tests a research model which investigates the BSC as a mediator between decentralised decision authority and managerial satisfaction. Data was collected from hotel managers in Turkey and analysed using PLS-SEM. The findings demonstrate that decentralised decision authority has a positive effect on the BSC use which gives rise to increase managerial satisfaction. The results thus reveal that decentralised decision authority is related with the managerial satisfaction only through the BSC. This study makes a significant contribution to the largely neglected area in the hospitality performance measurement literature by investigating the aforementioned relationships. It also provides managerial practical implications of the findings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The information system at FMIPA Unila (Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Lampung) is intended to support both academic and non-academic activities within the FMIPA Unila community. However, the system frequently faces disruptions, ranging from server shutdowns to unauthorized access by malicious individuals. Furthermore, some of the information service menus and features are currently inaccessible within the FMIPA Unila information system. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the operational efficiency of the FMIPA Unila information system from the user's point of view. The research employs the Information Systems Functional Scorecard (ISFS) method, which comprises three assessment dimensions: system performance, information effectiveness, and service performance. To gauge system performance, questionnaires were distributed to 100 student participants who represent various departments at FMIPA Unila. According to the ISFS calculations, the overall performance of the Unila FMIPA information system can be generally deemed satisfactory. Recommendations for improving and fine-tuning the FMIPA UNILA information system include the provision and completion of information services currently missing from the Profile menu, Academic menu, Research and Service menu, Student Affairs menu, and Document menu. Furthermore, enhancements should be made to the system's menu navigation features and menu buttons to ensure their proper functionality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose—This research aims to illuminate the non-financial performance level in the hotel industry in East Java cities in Indonesia. That is, it aims to analyze the impact of organizational culture on non-financial performance by investigating the effectiveness of using Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC) measurements in assessing the relation between organizational culture and non-financial performance.\nDesign/methodology/approach — This exploratory research examines a sample of 65 hotels operating in different targeted markets. In order to have a better understanding and provide a clear discussion related to these relationships in sufficient depth, the theoretical framework of this research has been designed and developed based on a wide review of relevant research, theories, and findings. The developed research framework adopts the mixed form of the contingency of  fit (selection and mediating-based interaction approaches) to investigate the contingency relationship. The survey questionnaire is distributed using an offline approach. Therefore, the collected data is analyzed by using the Partial Least Square Path Modelling (PLS-PM) method along with taking advantage of SmartPLS 3.0 Software.\nFindings — The findings indicated that organizational culture (Clan, Adhocracy, Market, and Hierarchy) has a positive and significant influence on the effective implementations and usage of Sustainability Balanced Scorecard Measurements, namely, financial, internal business process, customer, learning and growth, environmental, and community. These five perspectives of SBSC have a mediation-interaction relationship between the impact of organizational culture and the organizational non-financial performance levels. Therefore, SBSC measurements significantly and positively influence non-financial performance (product/ quality service level, customer satisfaction level, employee loyalty level, and social sustainability level).\nPractical implications—This research contributes empirically to the existing literature related to management accounting practices, and more particularly, evaluation and performance practices, by providing findings from developing countries and focusing on the SBSC’ measurements’ usage at hotel businesses operating in three cities in East Java.\nOriginality/value —  The multiple evaluations and performance measurements of BSCS proved to be innovative business measurements to enhance the decision-making process and improve a business organization's overall value and performance. Thus, this research paper adopts the contingency model to determine the main internal contingency factor that explains the extent of SBSC measurements’ usage and the effective influence of SBSC measurements on non-financial performance levels.\nKeywords — Organizational Culture, Non-Financial Performance, Sustainability Balanced Scorecard’s Measurements, Hotel Industry, East Java, Indonesia.\nPaper type — Exploratory Research</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An organization needs a strategic control system to keep tabs on how well its long-term goals are being met. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a widely adopted strategic control system with a high rate of unsuccessful implementation. OKRs, on the other hand, seem like a strategic control system with several benefits. The purpose of this research is to learn more about the factors that lead to BSC failure and the benefits of OKRs as a strategic control system. Case study analysis and other forms of qualitative research were used to compile these results. This investigation focuses on the ABC Foundation, a non-profit organization that used BSC from 2010 to 2018 before switching to OKRs. Lack of senior management commitment, insufficient BSC team capabilities, and the fact that BSC is underutilized in SMEs were all identified as causes of BSC failure in this research. OKRs are advantageous because they are simple to comprehend, promote participation from all team members, and have shorter cycles to promote flexibility and openness to change.</jats:p>"

O presente artigo apresenta um alinhamento ainda mais amplo: o alinhamento da produção intelectual com o planejamento estratégico das instituições pesquisadas. Esta inovação tem sido aplicada no Programa de Pós-Graduação Profissional em Gestão Pública (PPGGP) da Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (Ufes) desde 2018. Entretanto, constatou-se a ausência de procedimentos que apoiassem os discentes e pesquisadores do programa no processo de verificação de alinhamento estratégico. O objetivo geral da pesquisa, portanto, foi descrever um procedimento para apoiar a verificação de alinhamento estratégico do trabalho de conclusão de curso (TCC) de um programa de pós-graduação em gestão pública, com o auxílio da Ferramenta BSC e tendo por base a análise dos mapas estratégicos das instituições pesquisadas pelos egressos de 2020 do PPGGP da Ufes. Os resultados mostraram que as produções possuem alinhamento estratégico com as instituições públicas estudadas, sendo possível sua identificação. Como trabalho futuro propõe-se a aplicação da metodologia para mapear e avaliar o alinhamento estratégico da produção intelectual de outros programas de pós-graduação.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"
