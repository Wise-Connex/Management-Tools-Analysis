      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to identify and characterize the culture of the largest exporters without the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and with the BSC implemented. In addition, it confirms whether there are different characteristics in the type of organizational culture of the largest exporters without the BSC and with the BSC. To achieve this objective, data were collected through questionnaires sent to the 250 largest exporters in Portugal. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to validate the research hypotheses. This research shows that the Adhocracy (turbulent management) culture type prevails in organizations without BSC, while the Market (productivity) culture type prevails in organizations with BSC. The study is based on the characterization of the culture type of the organizations. This characterization is significant because organizational culture shapes and differentiates organizations’ actions, goal definitions, and strategic objectives, which can affect organizational performance. Although recent literature has addressed organizational culture and performance monitoring in isolation, not many studies have been found that link the topics of organizational culture, BSC, and performance.</jats:p>"

This presentation focuses on the extent to which support for family caregivers was a focus of that first report and how that focus has changed over time. In addition, the presentation will consider the extent to which the Scorecard has proved an effective policy tool in holding states accountable for progress in supporting family caregivers. Has the Scorecard achieved its stated goal to “to spark conversations, galvanize broad-based coalitions, and focus stakeholders’ attention on the factors that most directly impact consumers and their families”? What has AARP learned through its experience of developing and administering the Scorecard, and what changes are being considered with respect to the dimensions pertaining to family caregivers? The presentation will conclude by noting synergies with the work of the RAISE Family Caregiver Advisory Council and the priorities indicated in its National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers.</jats:p>",

Suwakul Ungaran Vocational School is one of the vocational schools in Semarang Regency that applies permaculture in its learning process. The permaculture principles applied at this school are capturing and storing energy, getting harvests, using and respecting resources, zero waste, and respecting diversity. Based on this background, this research focuses on learning outcomes through implementing permaculture with a sustainable agricultural system that includes the development of land processing based on natural ecosystems. The research aims to determine the ability of students at school to produce food and horticultural crops. This research applies a qualitative descriptive method to describe the results of permaculture implementation using Balanced Scorecard analysis, an evaluation strategy with four perspectives in improving an organization's goals. The research results show that learning through the implementation of permaculture at this Vocational School can improve students' abilities at school, as seen from fulfilling the perspective of the Balanced Scorecard. The study's results will be helpful for schools as a learning tool to improve students' abilities in producing agricultural products through the implementation of permaculture. </jats:p>"

Since 2019, the Council has directed in-depth information-gathering and research efforts to develop recommendations and an implementation plan for addressing our critical family caregiving crisis. The Council recently released the 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers, which highlights nearly 350 actions the federal government will take to support family caregivers in the coming year and more than 150 actions that can be adopted at other levels of government and across the private sector to build a system to support family caregivers. Integrating measures of improvement with regard to family caregiver support, across the domains identified in the National Strategy into the LTSS State Scorecard will provide a tool by which progress toward the RAISE goals can be measured. Currently, the Scorecard focuses on indicators specific to Supporting Working Family Caregivers. While these are critical, our research team has identified at least 10 additional indicators that could be included and that would address other caregiver support domains such as adequacy of direct care workforce, integration of family caregivers into care plans, direct pay to family caregivers, and more. In this session we will identify the indicators, explain how they relate to RAISE goals and discuss methods for including them in the Scorecard.</jats:p>",

Attacks, thefts and espionage using technology increase exponentially every year compared to the previous.  In order to eliminate this problem that affects the whole world, many countries give priority to creating cybersecurity strategies in order to protect their information and re-sources, and develop effective implementation methods. Despite the abundant literature, there is a large gap in the effective implementation of strategies. While evaluating the strategy, measurement is made regardless of the risks that will arise if the action plan is not fulfilled. For this reason, it is recommended to evaluate the risk that will arise if the action titles are not implemented in order to eliminate this shortcoming. The aim is to emphasize that sustainability and continuous improvement will be increased by using the scorecard based on risk analysis by implementing the proposed action plan through the strategy model. The use of scorecards to over-come the increasing challenges arising from digital transformation today will contribute to the evaluation of the strategy and eliminate its shortcomings, as well as provide self-assessment. This study suggests that measuring as a method of increasing efficiency, which has not been discussed much until now, may be the solution. In order to ensure the security of the smart world, there is a need for a sustainable and effective strategy that can keep up with digital realities, renewing itself.</jats:p>"

Using a whole farm pollinator scorecard, farmers receive ‘pollinator points’ each year based on the amount and quality of pollinator friendly habitat maintained and/or created and, each year, farmers receive a results-based payment that relates to the points.\nIrish farms have great potential to improve both the quantity and quality of biodiversity friendly habitats without negatively impacting on farm productivity. Thirty-one farmers increased their score between year one and year three of the results-based payment and four farms more than tripled their score. The median whole farm pollinator score for the 40 farms increased from 25,696 in year one to 33,572 in year two (31% increase), to, 40,211 pollinator points in year three (56% increase). Each farm type (beef, dairy, mixed and arable) increased their median score over the three years and dairy and arable farms showed the largest increase.\nThis project has helped farmers better understand and engage with nature on their land and has created a measurable system for improving habitats for biodiversity on farms that is accessible to all and has the potential to be rolled out on a wider scale.</jats:p>"

The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of Balanced Scorecard (BSC) indexes on measuring the efficiency of DMU. This was done by a new hybrid model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), cooperative game theory and Shapley value index. The initial values of the DEA model were selected from among the BSC indexes in four perspectives (i.e., financial, customer, internal processes, and growth and learning). Finally, the proposed model was experimented on a case study and the computational results were obtained. The results showed that the profitability ratio with a Shapley value of 2.903 and the percentage of satisfied audiences with a Shapley value of 0.404 had the highest and lowest reflection in performance assessment, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research aim: This research explores the impact of three independent variables, namely digital banking adoption, risk management and balanced scorecard implementation, on bank performance as the dependent variable. Design/ Methodology/ Approach: This paper is a conceptual paper. Previous studies have been extensively focused on ascertaining the determinants of bank performance. Despite the large body of literature in this respect, this article focuses on the role of balanced scorecard implementation in the banking industry. The balanced scorecard’s mediating role is deemed crucial, especially in the banking industry, which is more exposed to the digital and technological revolution. Accordingly, the paper proposes a performance model for banks and financial institutions which combines these determinants. Research finding: The current debate prevalent among researchers and practitioners, as denoted in the literature, is centred on the central argument of how banks can maximise their full potential. This research suggests that the banks’ management employs the following three measures: digital banking adoption, risk management and balanced scorecard implementation as the performance model. In the quest to further improve organisational performance, previous literature lauded balanced scores as a useful management tool. Specifically, the balanced scorecard serves as a strategic planning and performance management tool that utilises financial and non-financial assessments in determining an organisation’s administration, management and operational effectiveness. Practitioner/Policy implication: This study enriches the current state of knowledge in the literature by extending the current understanding of bank performance, especially in relation to digital banking adoption, where the issue of technological and digital matters play a profound role in the banking industry globally due to the rapid advancement in technology. With respect to practical implications, the findings in this study are relatable to the practitioners in the banking industry, whereby the performance model in the study is proposed to offer the ways in which the performance of their respective financial institutions can be improved. Research limitation: In this regard, it is hoped that the paper will shed light on understanding this matter further, especially the role of the balanced scorecard. Specifically, the paper suggests that the balanced scorecard implementation acts as the mediating role that fosters the relationship between digital banking implementation and bank performance. In addition, the balanced scorecard implementation also acts as the factor that mediates the relationship between risk management and bank performance.</jats:p>"

With the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a watershed health assessment framework was developed and applied to the Manila Bay Watershed (MBW) based on the sub-indices used by the US EPA and the Minnesota DNR. These three sub-indices were used and modified: geomorphology, connectivity, and hydrology. Geomorphology sub-index accounted for the effects of soil erosion using the Unit Stream Power-based Erosion/Deposition model (USPED). Connectivity sub-index considered the connection between habitats within three environments: terrestrial, aquatic, and riparian zone. Hydrology sub-index accounted for the effects of impervious cover and urbanization on the movement of water using three factors, namely, natural cover, tree cover, and loss of hydrologic storage. Land cover map was the most used dataset in this scorecard, where the maintained natural land covers generally received high scores and built-up areas received the lowest. The overall watershed health score of MBW is 75.713 from the mean of the three sub-indices. Pampanga River Basin, which is the largest river basin within the MBW, got the highest score of 79.462 since it consists of huge portions of maintained natural land cover. Manila River Basin, known to have dense built-up areas, got the lowest average of 60.773. On the provincial level, the province of Nueva Ecija got the highest score, and the National Capital Region (NCR) got the lowest. The developed framework successfully quantified a relative health score which can be used to rank and prioritize subwatersheds, and to measure in totality the improvement or degradation of subwatershed/s over time.\n                    </jats:p>"

This study focuses on HSEEP evaluative capacity and provides practical recommendations for program improvement using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) approach. Although HSEEP has a myriad of challenges related to its performance measurement, the study asserts that some of these limitations can be addressed by incorporating the BSC approach. The study explains and demonstrates how the four BSC approaches, internal and external stakeholders, organizational process, financial, and learning aspects, can improve the HSEEP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global economic outlook is increasingly worrying due to war, crisis and pandemic. During globalization, several countries are integrated to compete to develop and formulate economic areas that can compete and have selling points in the world market. ASEAN then formed a forum called the ASEAN Capital Market Forum (ACMF). In this forum, the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (ACGS) was created with the hope that it could be a solution to implementing Good Corporate Governance practices and increasing information transparency to the public. This research aims to analyze the implementation of the ACGS criteria in the two consumer goods companies that is included in the 50 companies with the largest capitalization in Indonesia, namely PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk. and PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk. This research uses a qualitative method. The data analysis technique used is document content review. The data analysis procedure was carried out by classifying data and calculating weights using formulas for knowing the condition of ACGS implementation in each company. The result shows that implementation of the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard which has been carried out at PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk. acquires a 80.7 score, while at PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk. acquires a 62.6 score.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Customer awareness and customer satisfaction are generally important attributes for the success and competitiveness of any business. In some sectors, they are studied very intensively; in others, they are neglected. In the field of transport services, it is important that the attitudes of customers are sufficiently monitored because public passenger transport has a lot of individual competition. Only satisfied customers can prefer public transportation over their own. In this context, this contribution analyses customer requirements and their satisfaction with bus public transport in the Slovak Republic. The opinions of customers are supplemented in this article with those of strategic managers. We ascertained customer requirements through questionnaire surveys. Using theoretical knowledge, we established hypotheses, which were subsequently verified using the selected statistical methods. Based on the findings, we proposed the concept of the target perspective of the BSC system for bus transport companies in the Slovak Republic in an effort to increase their competitiveness. Our procedure was also based on knowledge that is the output of various research studies in this area. Their results show that marketing strategies are considered the most important part of strategic management. Today, it is common in many industries that all business entities offer the same product at the same price under approximately the same technological conditions and with the assistance of equally well-equipped personnel. Therefore, a correctly set marketing strategy can also be the key to business success in transport services. The methods used in this paper were analysis, synthesis, questionnaire surveys, and the selected managerial and statistical methods. Our goal was to propose a concept of the customer perspective of the BSC system based on the analysis of customer requirements. We are convinced that the results of our survey can contribute to increasing the competitiveness of not only bus carriers in Slovakia, but also in other EU countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Measuring the performance of machine maintenance becomes very important, serves as a monitoring tool, and triggers increased performance in the production section. Losses due to engine damage will impact the company's profit, which is less than optimal because maintenance can contribute as much as 20-50% of the cost composition of the company's operational costs. This study aimed to measure performance in the maintenance section using the maintenance scorecard (MS) and determine the priority of the performance control strategy using the Urgency, Seriousness, and Growth Method (USG). The research was conducted through case studies on chemical manufacturing companies located in Indonesia. The performance assessment results with the maintenance scorecard method show that the total scorecard maintenance value is in the category of need improvement, which is 63.35. There are 3 KPIs in the very bad category: maintenance costs from a cost-efficiency perspective, work completed from a quality perspective, and self-audit from a learning perspective. The first and foremost strategy that can be done based on USG's priority is to implement reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) to reduce time loss and increase the knowledge and competence of employees. This priority is useful when a company encounters a constraint so that it cannot carry out all strategies simultaneously or can only carry out some strategies while still getting optimal benefits from continuous improvement.</jats:p>"

Ao mesmo tempo, elas estão inseridas em um contexto de incertezas e complexidade que exige flexibilidade frente às exigências e às transformações do ambiente. Nesse contexto, a elaboração de um planejamento estratégico adequado às características e pretensões da organização é essencial. O BSC é uma metodologia que auxilia na formulação do planejamento e na definição de objetivos estratégicos para as organizações, sejam elas do setor privado ou público. Assim, este estudo busca fazer uso dessa metodologia para desenvolver propostas de objetivos para o departamento de tecnologia da informação e comunicação da Prefeitura de Parauapebas. Para tanto, fez-se uso de pesquisa documental, observação participante e reuniões presenciais com a aplicação da técnica de brainstorming, buscando reunir informações que proporcionassem a elaboração desses objetivos. Por fim, pôde-se perceber que o BSC é um instrumento capaz de auxiliar o departamento em estudo no desenvolvimento de um planejamento estratégico eficiente, proporcionando uma visão sistêmica da organização e a visualização da estratégia por meio das relações de causa-efeito entre os objetivos propostos, demonstrados por meio do mapa estratégico.</jats:p>"
