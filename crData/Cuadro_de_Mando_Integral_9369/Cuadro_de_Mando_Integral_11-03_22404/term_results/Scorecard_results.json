      "abstract": "<jats:p>This self-evaluation \"Scorecard\" is intended to guide the proposed tourism project representative requesting funding in order that (a) the whole range of practices, from best to counter indicated, will be taken into account for the design, construction, and operation of the tourism project, and so that (b) the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) may understand which aspects of the tourism project are excellent, acceptable, or unacceptable before considering it for financial assessment. A project whose Scorecard has items marked in red is unacceptable for such consideration, and one having items marked in orange must be carefully analyzed by the IDB. The scorecard is online and it can be accessed through the following URL: http://www.iadb.org/tourismscorecard/index.cfm?lang=en</jats:p>"

The interview evidence was analysed using a multi‐step coding process to arrive at key themes on the functions, characteristics and outcomes of effective and ineffective boards. These themes were then used as a basis for proposing an appropriate structure and content for a BSC that reflects board members' perceptions of key factors driving board performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>New Zealand board members see behavioural measures of board performance as generally more useful than operational and financial measures. Further, strong relationships and strategic clarity are seen as both drivers of good performance and key outcomes of effective boards. Consequently, the proposed BSC incorporates multi‐dimensional outcome (i.e. lagging) measures. It also recognises the importance of including subjective measures, rather than focusing on readily quantifiable measures that board members perceive as less informative.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This paper provides insight into the perspectives of practising board members and informs the literature on board effectiveness. The proposed BSC adds to the performance management literature in regard to evaluating and managing the performance of boards. However, further studies are now required to test its practical utility.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed BSC provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating the performance of boards of directors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Few studies of board effectiveness have accessed the views and experiences of practising board members as this study does. Also, little prior research exists on the potential for applying a BSC approach to measuring and managing board performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Se pudo deducir que la implementación del balanced scorecard constituye un reto en el caso de empresas de servicios, ya que promueve la eficiencia y el aprovechamiento de los recursos y los procesos internos; es una buena forma de hacer valer la misión y de orientar la mayor cantidad de esfuerzo y dinero a la razón de su existencia.</jats:p>",
