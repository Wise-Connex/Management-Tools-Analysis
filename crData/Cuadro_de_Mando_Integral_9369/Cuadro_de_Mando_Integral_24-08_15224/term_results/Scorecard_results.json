The research method employed is qualitative, with data drawn from the annual reports of the banks in question for the period spanning 2020 to 2021. This period encompasses both the pre-merger and post-merger phases of Bank Syariah Indonesia. The findings of this study indicate that, from a financial perspective, the combined ROE ratio of the three Islamic banks, which has undergone a merger, is improving and includes healthy qualifications, approaching 15%. The customer perspective reveals an encouraging improvement in profitability, which is attributable to both customer migration from the predecessor bank to the merged bank and new customer growth. The merger has facilitated operating efficiency due to the synergy of the merger, leading to an increase in employee productivity, as measured by revenue. The establishment of several business unit networks represents an innovative form of internal business process, which can facilitate service delivery. The implications of this research provide a more detailed description of performance measurement using data from the company's published annual reports. Previous balance scorecard research employed survey methods in order to obtain information related to the growth and learning perspectives, as well as the customer and internal business process perspectives. In contrast, this study uses only data from the company's financial statements and annual reports.</jats:p>"

The study used a descriptive and causal comparative research design.  Primary data were collected through a structured 5 points likert scale questionnaire and 26 manufacturing companies in the Kailali district having higher annual turnover ware taken as sample using convenience sampling technique. The findings show that four dimensions of BSC (learning &amp; growth, internal business process, Customer perspective and financial growth) have moderate correlation with each other. Decision makers are supposed to be familiar with BSC dimensions but overall impact of BSC- dimensions and their implication in the industries to attain strategic efficiency and effectiveness is insignificant. Decision-makers in all types of business organizations can be benefited from knowing the implications of BSC-dimensions.

When integrated with regenerative agriculture strategies such as cover cropping, intercropping, agroforestry, and crop rotation, these practices can effectively enhance soil health and productivity. The aim of this research was to develop a soil health index using the CASH approach adjusted to the conditions of the coffee zone in the Caldas department (Colombia) and to adapt the index of the Rainforest Alliance Scorecard guidelines. A database containing 3,332 soil analyses from different coffee zones in the department was used, carried out between 2005 and 2021. The index obtained with historical data shows that 66% of the properties were classified as Bronze, 18% Silver, and 16% Gold, whereas the validation data showed that 49% of the properties were classified as Bronze, 21% Silver, and 30% Gold. The most important variables identified in soil health were organic matter content, organic carbon stock, CO2 equivalent, pH, bulk density, and nutrient content related to N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. CASH can be employed to evaluate the soil health status in the field using quantitative indicators linked to the Rainforest Scorecard and is a useful tool to promote regenerative practices in soil adjusted to Caldas coffee zones.</jats:p>"

Therefore, companies need to carry out analysis and identify overall company performance measurements to find out the causes of existing problems. This research will be conducted using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method. Primary data used in this research was obtained from observations, interviews and discussions with the company as well as by filling out questionnaires with the company.

This meta-analysis integrates the results of previous research to provide a comprehensive picture of how BSC affects managerial and organizational performance. The results show that the implementation of BSC significantly contributes to increasing management effectiveness, especially in aligning the company's strategy with operational goals, improving the quality of decision-making, and strengthening managerial accountability with an effect size value of 1,042 (high effect size category). Nonetheless, this study also identifies several factors that can affect the successful implementation of BSC, such as organizational culture, management commitment, and information system quality.

Несмотря на тот факт, что вопросы, посвященные ССП, рассмотрены в литературе достаточно подробно, однако, существует недостаток литературы о том, как правильно применять эту систему.

The objective was to investigate the effective of balanced Scorecard on quality services in selected public organizations. The study reveals that BSC tool is more effective compared to previously used tools. Also, the employee’s perception on effectiveness of BSC tool on provision of quality services is positive. The findings of ordinal logistic regression analysis show that the effectiveness of BSC tool increases the likelihood of employees to provide quality services. Further, extended regression namely structural equation modelling shows that the relationship between effectiveness of BSC tool and provision of quality services is distorted by high level of autocratic management style while not distorted by rules, policy and regulations. The study is strongly recommending that there is a need for government and private organisations to adopt BSC as an effective tool for provision of quality services; There is a need of introducing transformational and collaborative management styles in order to account for quality of services; Organizations should continuously enforce regulations, rules and policies; The study should be used by decision makers to set standards of introducing viable and vibrant performance management tools which are result oriented and further studies on uncovered areas on BSC to be undertaken in future.</jats:p>"

The implementation of technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence has further enriched the functions and capabilities of information sys-tems. Additionally, the development of information systems includes more intuitive user inter-faces, mobility, and connectivity that allow quick and easy access to information. In the workplace, one of the problems employees face is performance evaluations that are not objective and transparent. Therefore, companies need to conduct performance appraisals that can motivate employees to achieve rewards for their work. Based on these issues, the development of an em-ployee performance monitoring and reporting information system is needed to help companies manage employee evaluations objectively and transparently. BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, as a provider of social security programs in Indonesia, offers protection against employment risks. BPJS Ketenagakerjaan Kota Medan, in particular, plays an important role in providing social protection to workers and their families, creating a safer work environment, and contributing to national economic stability. Employee performance appraisals are conducted using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method based on four perspectives: financial, customer, internal business process, and learning and growth. The software development follows the waterfall method, with system design modeling using Unified Modelling Language (UML). The research results in an employee per-formance monitoring and reporting information system that facilitates companies in managing reporting and performance appraisals because the system implements calculations according to the BSC evaluation method.</jats:p>"

The methodology used is a descriptive case study involving qualitative and quantitative data collection through internal document analysis, workshop discussions, and in-depth interviews. The data were analyzed to develop and implement a strategy map and KPIs relevant to the organization's strategic objectives. The findings show that the proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between policy and practice, ensuring that SOE regulations are not only adhered to but strategically leveraged to enhance organizational performance. By adopting this framework, JIEP and other SOEs can align unit goals with corporate and governmental strategic objectives, creating a more effective and sustainable performance management system. This research makes a significant contribution to the development of performance management systems that can be implemented in other SOEs, offering substantial improvements over existing practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Implementing the Balance Scorecard (BSC) cannot guarantee the success of an organization in achieving its goal, this depends on how strong the determination is to implement BSC in the organization. Studies regarding the opportunities and challenges faced in the process of implementing or implementing BSC in schools are still very limited.  The aims of this research are to: 1). Know, describe and analyze opportunities and challenges in implementing BSC at SMK Negeri 4 Tasikmalaya and SMK Negeri 1 Cipaku Ciamis; 2) describe the opportunities and challenges of implementing BSC at SMK Negeri 4 Tasikmalaya and SMK Negeri 1 Cipaku Ciamis. This research uses a qualitative approach with a descriptive analysis study, collecting primary and secondary data. The analysis technique used in this research follows the Mile’s model. The research results show that as non-profit organizations, SMK Negeri 4 Tasikmalaya and SMK Negeri 1 Cipaku Ciamis are trying to implement BSC to measure their performance. The results of this assessment are contained in the Annual Work Plan (RKT) which is displayed in various strategies with the highest scores in the BSC analysis which will be implemented in the coming year period.  Conclusions are : 1) The implementation of BSC at SMK Negeri 4 Tasikmalaya and SMK Negeri 1 Cipaku Ciamis has been implemented well. Viewed from a customer perspective, internal processes, growth and learning as well as a financial perspective, Many schools have implemented the BSC concept and supported BSC-based performance development. 2) chool has challenges in its implementation, especially in terms of collaboration with Dudi. Schools rarely carry out market research to meet industry needs, there is still a lack of commitment from school management in terms of consistent implementation of BSC. Schools also have difficulty measuring and evaluating school progress performance. Schools still experience dependence on BOS and BOPD funds and still lack transparency and accountability in managing school finances.</jats:p>"

Findings indicate that, under static climate conditions, the network of plans in Tampa is well prepared across all urban growth scenarios, but less so in the face of a changing climate. Specifically, scenario outputs that consider climate change suggest the need for more resilient growth to reduce flood vulnerability compared with the current land use plan. Notably, some existing policies are likely to lead to counterproductive outcomes in a future with more extensive flooding. </jats:p>"

It also examines how management commitment moderates the relationship between these social and environmental dimensions and institutional performance. The research adopts a descriptive and explanatory design, utilizing proportional stratified sampling followed by systematic random sampling. From a population of 4990, a sample of 480 was determined using Daniel Soper's formula for structural equation modeling, accounting for an expected effect size of 0.23, a statistical power level of 0.95, and a probability level of .05. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, covariance‐based structural equation modeling, and the interaction‐term method for moderation. Findings indicate a significant positive relationship between the social and environmental dimensions of the balanced scorecard and the performance of Ethiopian financial institutions. Additionally, management commitment significantly enhances this relationship. The study confirms that incorporating social and environmental metrics into the balanced scorecard positively impacts financial institution performance, emphasizing the importance of sustainability in performance measurement frameworks. This research underscores the practical implications of integrating sustainability metrics and management commitment in enhancing institutional performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST) is a checklist tool to inform the design and evaluation of trustworthy AI systems based on the U.S. Intelligence Community’s analytic tradecraft standards. In this study, we investigate whether MAST can be used to differentiate between high and low trustworthy AI-enabled decision support systems (AI-DSSs). Evaluating trust in AI-DSSs poses challenges to researchers and practitioners. These challenges include identifying the components, capabilities, and potential of these systems, many of which are based on the complex deep learning algorithms that drive DSS performance and preclude complete manual inspection. Using MAST, we developed two interactive AI-DSS testbeds. One emulated an identity-verification task in security screening, and another emulated a text-summarization system to aid in an investigative task. Each testbed had one version designed to reach low MAST ratings, and another designed to reach high MAST ratings. We hypothesized that MAST ratings would be positively related to the trust ratings of these systems. A total of 177 subject-matter experts were recruited to interact with and evaluate these systems. Results generally show higher MAST ratings for the high-MAST compared to the low-MAST groups, and that measures of trust perception are highly correlated with the MAST ratings. We conclude that MAST can be a useful tool for designing and evaluating systems that will engender trust perceptions, including for AI-DSS that may be used to support visual screening or text summarization tasks. However, higher MAST ratings may not translate to higher joint performance, and the connection between MAST and appropriate trust or trustworthiness remains an open question.</jats:p>"
