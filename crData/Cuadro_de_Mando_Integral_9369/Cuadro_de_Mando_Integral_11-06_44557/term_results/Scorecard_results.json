However, the UN’s experience in outsourcing is limited to providing troops for peacekeeping operations.  The purpose of the paper is to develop an outsourcing scorecard for the UN and similar organisations.  Forty national and international organisations were surveyed through questionnaires, review of relevant literatures and records. The research established that by identifying core competencies, goals and objectives, risks, selection of provider as well as measurements and evaluation of providers performance using an outsourcing scorecard, support functions can be outsourced successfully. Other criteria indicated as important is peace-building, suitable for humanitarian organisations. The scorecard developed by the research could provide the UN with a number of benefits, such as maximization of efficiency and savings in costs.  The paper develops the first outsourcing scorecard to guide the UN and similar organisations in identifying services that can be outsourced successfully.</jats:p>"

The research takes a thematic approach to identify the issues, challenges and lessons learnt in relation to the design and implementation of the BSC, which is accomplished through a review of annual reports, published relevant documents and semi‐structured interviews with 13 senior managers of various programs and divisions within the LGA. Future research opportunities are also identified in this area.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

This article is structured as follows: after reviewing the background body of literature on the theme; we present the BSC methodology; its main benefits and limitations; a background literature review on ETD evaluation; and then, we address a case study on the BSC implementation within an organization. In conclusion, the main benefit of using the BSC is the possibility of obtaining a strategic alignment between training and organizational goals. On the other hand, BSC’s main limitation is the lack of scientific literature to back up the cause-and-effect relationship between ETD actions and the BSC’s perspectives. Finally, we present an agenda to tackle future research.</jats:p>"
