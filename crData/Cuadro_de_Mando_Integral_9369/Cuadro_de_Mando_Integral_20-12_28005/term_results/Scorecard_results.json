It considers the main four perspectives of the BSC evaluation approach including the financial, the  customer, the  internal processes, and the  learning and growth perspective. This study is primarily descriptive in nature. The questionnaire was delivered to nine commercial bank managers, including three state-owned banks, three joint-venture banks, and three private banks. A total of 180 questionnaires were distributed to them, and 129 (71.67%) were returned and used. The results reveal that Nepalese bank managers have a perception of a better financial position. They use the financial perspective as an important aspect of the BSC evaluation approach when measuring bank performance. In terms of customer perspective, the results show that banks have better customer connections. It also suggests that Nepalese bank managers believe that using customer viewpoints is critical to the performance of their institutions. In practice, both the internal process and the learning and growth perspective appear to be fair. As a result, Nepalese commercial banks succeed in each of the four aspects of the BSC evaluation approach.</jats:p>"

The education sector has always enjoyed the highest national development budget and this has proven that the government's commitment to the education is paramount. Growth rates for researching output and quality are among the highest in the world, and higher education institutions in Malaysia has achieved a strong ranking among their Asian counterparts. Malaysia must make adjustments, including transforming higher education systems to thrive in an increasingly challenging global economic environment. Therefore, a form of performance assessment mechanism needs to be developed to evaluate on the performance and quality of services delivered in line with the goals set. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is one of the most widely used assessment instruments in assessing the performance on the institution. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to highlight the importance of BSC in the measuring performance in the Malaysia HEIs. Many previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of BSC especially in corporate companies and the results of these studies show that BSC has a positive and beneficial impact on the organization. However, there are still fewer studies which involve the Malaysia HEIs in conducting BSC-based performance evaluations. In addition, a strategic map will be developed to guide the implementation of BSC in Malaysia HEIs. When implemented, it is hoped that the BSC can be used by management to assist in the implementation of long-term strategies as a tool in monitoring and evaluating the performance of Malaysia HEIs in addition to preparing for future educational challenges</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Upaya pengembangan usaha mikro yang dilakukan oleh perempuan ini menjadi penting, karena perempuan mempunyai kendala-kendala tertentu yang berkaitan dengan “tripple burden of women”, dimana mereka menjalankan fungsi reproduksi, produksi, dan fungsi sosial di masyarakat.  Salah satu kegagalan adalah kurangnya pengetahuan tentang bagaimana cara memisahkan pembukuan konsumsi dan usaha mikro serta kurang percaya diri terhadap kemampuan yang dimilikinya. Usaha mikro tergolong jenis usaha marginal, yang antara lain ditunjukkan oleh penggunaan teknologi yang relatif sederhana, tingkat modal dan kadang akses terhadap kredit yang rendah, serta cenderung berorientasi pada pasar lokal. Disamping itu, usaha mikro mampu memberdayakan kaum perempuan dalam meningkatkan bargaining position perempuan dan keluarga. Untuk itu peneliti tertarik melakukan kajian dengan judul “strategi pembembangan usaha mikro berbasis “balanced scorecard” di Kota Kupang. Penelitian ini dilaksanakan untuk mencapai tujuan-tujuan sebagai berikut : Mengidentifikasi potensi  kekuatan dan kelemahan Usaha Mikro Penjahit di Kota Kupang, menganalisis strategi pengembangan usaha mikro Penjahit berbasis “balanced scorecard” di Kota Kupang dan merancang model strategi pengembangan usaha mikro Penjahit berbasis “balanced scorecard” di Kota Kupang. Lingkup penelitian ini mencakup potensi usaha mikro Penjahit yang diharapkan menjadi lokomotif dalam pengembangan ekonomi daerah di Kota Kupang. Hasil penelitian bahwa Penentuan posisi perusahaan didasarkan pada analisis total skor faktor internal dan faktor eksternal. Dengan menggunakan model Internal-Eksternal Matrik yakni nilai total skor IFAS = 4.25 dan EFAS = 4.70 tampak bahwa strategi yang sesuai bagi para penjahit perempuan di Kota Kupang adalah strategi tidak berubah/strategi laba. Upaya penguatan usaha mikro (UPUM) dapat diwujudkan dalam berbagai jenis kegiatan, antara lain: permodalan melalui pemberian kredit, pelatihan, pendampingan dan fasilitator, bantuan teknis dan konsultasi, penyediaan informasi, penelitian dan monitoring dan evaluasi. Saran: Dalam memberikan pinjaman dan bantuan hibah kepada usaha mikro perlu secara cermat memperhatikan kebutuhan usaha mikro dan siapa saja yang layak menerima pinjaman dan bantuan baik teknis maupun non teknis.</jats:p>"

A literature review of Balanced Scorecard and Hoshin Kanri conducted to provide a comprehensive understanding of each approach. The article discusses six integrated Balanced Scorecard / Hoshin Kanri models identified in the literature. The research work revealed differences and convergence points between Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Hoshin Kanri (HK) approaches that the different integrated models intend to take advantage or reinforce in order to develop more robust methodologies. The study of different integration model, the difference between them and the know-how obtained in implementation and deployment of the strategy in the industry were crucial to develop the proposed model, which was conceived to overcome current identified models weaknesses. So, a new integrated framework was developed for Continuous Improvement organizations in order to leverage and combine Balanced Scorecard robustness and consistency for strategy development and Hoshin Kanri in order to added value in terms of short-term strategy, translating it to the everyday job activities, conceived and performed by all in turning of the Continuous Improvement strategy.</jats:p>"

Most of these automotive businesses have utilized Information Technology (IT) to support their operations. However, the capability in planning, managing and implementing Information Systems and Information Technology (SI/IT) that is linked to the company's business strategy has not been fully implemented. Therefore, Strategic Planning of Information Systems is currently one of the keys in achieving the company's goals that must be aligned with the business strategy set by the company.

This paper aims to evaluate the balanced-scorecard-based performance of the Turkish banking sector using the Analytic Network Process Approach. Within this scope, all 33 deposit banks were intended to analyze out of 34 banks. Within this scope, we made an analysis in order to determine which perspectives of the balanced scorecard approach are appropriate for each type of bank (state banks, private banks, foreign banks). In this study, we used Analytic Network Process (ANP) approaches so as to achieve this objective. With a balanced-scorecard performance assessment of the banking sector using the ANP approach, all the factor priorities have been extracted and normalized to one for each cluster and final priorities have been obtained. The final priorities and rankings of each perspective of the balanced scorecard and the type of bank ownership have been assessed in the model. According to the results of the analysis, Findings demonstrate that (i) financial factor of balanced scorecard approach has the first rank with 65.7 percent; (ii) Customer perceptive is in the second rank with 22.1 percent. (iii)Third and fourth ranks have close results, (iv) learning and growth stay in the third rank with 6.3 percent (v) internal factor has the weakest importance with 5.9%, (vi) state banks into bank ownership have the highest rank with 53.9 percent, (vii) Private owned banks are the second in the relative performance of the bank groups with 36.1%, (viii) Balanced scorecard based performance of foreign banks are replaced in the last order with approximately 10%.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the need for an all-inclusive and far-reaching performance measurement model is universally felt as it can provide management-oriented information and act as a supporting tool in developing, inspecting, and interpreting policy-making strategies of an enterprise to achieve competitive advantages. Hence, this paper proposes an application of the balanced scorecard (BSC) model in an insurance organization for coordinating and regulating its corporate vision, mission, and strategy with organizational performance through the interrelation of different layers of business perspectives. In the next stage, a framework to unify both BSC and best-worst method (BWM) models is implemented for the very first time in the insurance domain to assess its performance over two-time periods.
