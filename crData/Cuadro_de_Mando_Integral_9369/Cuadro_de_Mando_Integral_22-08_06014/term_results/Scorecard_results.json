      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reports of the high percentage of failed digital transformation ventures motivate the need to find a comprehensive framework with regulatory attributes to support these initiatives. Due to its structure, consistent strategy decomposition capabilities, and strategic map architecture, the assumption is that a customized version of the Balanced Scorecard can ensure the better overall success of digital transformation projects. The qualitative analysis methodology was applied to previous research, and this study identified critical issues and challenges related to the strategy and overall endeavor of digital transformation. Based on the methodology of the traditional Balanced Scorecard, a draft version of the Digital Balanced Scorecard was formulated. The Digital Balanced Scorecard is a comprehensive, primarily prescriptive model that is focused directly on the challenges, opportunities, and obstacles of transformation. The proposed BSC model can consistently interpret a digital strategy and assist organization leaders in successfully formulating and coordinating all necessary activities and projects to apply technologies. The Digital BSC provides the projection of financial results and improvements in sustainability after transformation. The proposed solution to support digital transformation can accelerate an organization’s development, improve efficiency, and strengthen efforts to achieve an organization’s sustainability goals.</jats:p>"

A framework was designed to show the relationships between the BSC's four interrelated business perspectives and the use of Blackboard in accounting education. Content analysis was used to process in-depth interview data that were collected from 13 accounting students of a college of business in the US. The results show that three of the four Blackboard-supported BSC perspectives (internal process, student value proposition, and financial) have an impact on accounting students' academic performance. However, the impact of the fourth Blackboard-supported BSC perspective (learning and innovation) on accounting students' academic performance is different because the accounting career is a continuous learning endeavor. The changing and evolving nature of the Blackboard technology does not fit into the evolution of accounting principles, regulations, and laws.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Introduction\n The balanced scorecard (BSC) was implemented to improve hospitals’ performance evaluations (PE) in the last 30 years. BSC consists of six perspectives: financial, customer, internal, external, knowledge and growth, and managerial. However, patients were seldom engaged in such implementations. This research aims to engage Palestinian patients in BSC implementations.\nMethodology\n This is a cross-sectional study. We collected data between January and October 2021 using the printed BSC-PATIENT survey. We evaluated the patients’ experiences and attitudes toward BSC dimensions (BSCP ATT). The differences in evaluations based on admission status were also analyzed using the Mann‒Whitney U test. Additionally, we analyzed the causal relationships between patients’ experiences and attitudes using multiple linear regression, and the multicollinearity of the model was tested. Finally, the path analysis was performed to understand the BSC strategic maps based on the Palestinians’ evaluations.\nResults\n  The mean scores for Palestinian patient experiences evaluation showed that the services experience factor had the highest score (87.7 ± 17.7), and the patient care experience factor had the lowest score (57 ± 34.5). The patient experiences collectively predicted 56.4% of the variance in the BSCP ATT. The experiences factors of information (β = 0.400, t = 13.543, P &lt; 0.001), patient care (β = 0.241, t = 8.061, P &lt; 0.001), services (β = 0.176, t = 6.497, P &lt; 0.001), and building (β = 0.177, t = 6.308, P &lt; 0.001) had the highest impact on BSCP ATT. The price had only a weak negative influence (β=-0.051, t=-2.040, P = 0.042). Accessibility to hospitals did not have any impact on BSCP ATT. Significant differences between inpatient and outpatients’ evaluations in regard to experiences related to patient care (P = 0.042), services (P &lt; 0.001), accessibility (P &lt; 0.001), and BSCP ATT (P = 0.003) were found.\nConclusion\n Managers of Palestinian hospitals should prioritize enhancing the patient experience, particularly the information experience. The importance of patient education programs and information sharing with patients cannot be overstated. Other experiences as patient care, services, and building are also significant. By focusing on separate evaluations of patients' experiences and attitudes, the BSC strategic maps will be easier to understand from the patients' point of view. BSC-PATIENT survey may assist hospitals managers in achieving this objective and enhancing their action plans. Palestinian hospitals must enhance patients’ feedback and engagement culture.</jats:p>"

To achieve the objectives of the study, the researchers designed a questionnaire to collect data on the extent of application of non-financial dimensions of balanced scorecard (independent variable), as well as the use of the financial statements for representative hospitals for the two years (2020 and 2021) in order to measure financial performance (dependent variable) of these hospitals through the Return on Assets (ROA). The study population was all Jordanian private hospitals listed by the Ministry of Health in 2022 (61), a sample of which was selected (18) hospitals (30% of the study population). The questionnaires were distributed to the Directors general and the directors of the departments and accountants working in Jordanian private hospitals. The number of distributed questionnaires is (167), (144) valid questionnaires to the analysis, i.e. (86.2%) of distributed questionnaires. The study received to many results, including: The keenness of the administrations of private hospitals to apply the non-financial dimensions of balanced scorecard and to a high degree, that the application of the non-financial dimensions of the balanced scorecard reflects positively on its financial performance. The researchers presented many of recommendations, including: strengthening the functioning of Jordanian private hospital administrations to provide infrastructure elements that may contribute to the satisfaction of patients, escorts and revisers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last few years, the interest in performance measurement increased within the healthcare sector. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems needed to boost performance measurement systems to become more resilient and improve their capability in monitoring key performance indicators. Since the 1990s, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) model has been widely used among private and public organizations as it is the most adopted model to measure performance. The current paper aims at understanding the evolution of BSC in healthcare. The systematic literature review has been carried out by searching keywords according to PRISMA guidelines. By analyzing papers through one classification of BSC adoption phases, the results reveal that studies focused mainly on the BSC design process, rather than BSC implementation, use, or review. However, there is no agreement about the perspectives to be adopted in healthcare. Concerning BSC implementation and use, on one side especially leadership, culture and communication enable the BSC implementation. On the other side, monitoring and strategic decision-making are the most widespread objectives for using BSC. Concerning BSC review, however, the paper highlights a need for additional research. Finally, the paper provides further research opportunities concerning the phases suitable for implementing a BSC in healthcare.</jats:p>"

Therefore, several Indonesian government institutions have practised the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), a perspective-based performance management tool, to improve their performance accountability. This paper analyses how the Indonesian central government employs BSC and strategy maps to improve its performance accountability systems. A descriptive qualitative study concluded that Indonesian government agencies use different approaches to implement perspectives in the BSC, which they think are best suited to the characteristics of each government organisation. Indonesian government institutions generally implement BSC as a strategy execution tool, a measurement tool, and a performance accountability report. Therefore, these roles of BSC lead to an improved performance accountability system. The essential factors in developing BSC implementation are explained as well. However, this paper only primarily uses data from the Ministry of Finance and focuses only on the central government due to data limitations and time constraints. Therefore, future research is suggested.</jats:p>"

Some of them are able to use the IT Balanced Scorecard and COBIT 5.0 framework. The Information Technology Balanced Scorecard has four perspectives, including corporate contribution, customer orientation, operational excellence and future orientation. With the implementation of the IT Balance Scorecard, the performance of business organizations such as life insurance companies is not only measured by the financial benefits, as has often been done, but also considers internal processes. In addition, the implementation of the COBIT 5.0 framework provides a comprehensive framework that helps companies achieve their goals for IT Governance. The purpose of the results of this study is a strategic recommendation for companies to be able to provide improvements in the governance and management environment of information technology in the company as one of the enablers in achieving business goals during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results of the IT governance design are in the form of a roadmap for the implementation of IT governance along with recommendations for 25 COBIT 5 processes which are the evaluation points based on the prioritization of the combination of impact and urgency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to create a strategy for reducing energy costs in hospitals to ensure the sustainability of health services. In this framework, a novel hybrid decision making approach is generated based on golden cut-oriented bipolar and q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFs). Firstly, balanced scorecard (BSC)-based criteria are evaluated by using multi stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (M-SWARA) approach. Secondly, alternatives are examined with the help of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) technique. The novelty of this study is to find critical factors that affect the energy costs of health institutions with an original fuzzy decision-making model. This proposed model has also some superiorities by comparing with previous models in the literature. First, SWARA method is improved, and this technique is generated with the name of M-SWARA. Hence, the relationship between the criteria can be examined owing to this issue. Additionally, golden cut is taken into consideration to compute the degrees in bipolar q-ROFSs to achieve more accurate results. These two issues have an important impact on the originality of the proposed model. The findings demonstrate that consciousness level of employees has the highest weight with respect to the energy costs in hospitals. Additionally, the type of energy used also plays a significant role for this issue. Thus, renewable energy sources should be considered in meeting the energy needs of hospitals. Although the installation costs of these energy types are higher, it will be possible to significantly reduce energy costs in the long run.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study proposes the Agile-Adaptive Balanced Scorecard (AABSC) as an integrated tool to support and improve the Management Accounting System (MAS) in Iraqi SMEs. The main objective of this study is to explore the role of the AABSC in improving the Management Accounting System (MAS) as a response to economic fluctuations. A qualitative semistructured interview was carried out in one Iraqi SME, with four top managers from different departments. The interviews are conducted online in the Arabic (Iraqi accent) and then translated into English by a linguist expert. The data were analysed and structured using content analysis and Atlas.ti 9 software. Such qualitative analysis is divided into two main categories and four sub-levels. The objectives and advantages of using the AABSC to improve the MAS of Iraqi SMEs are also examined. The adoption of AABSC as part of MAS has assisted companies in strengthening the system. Enhanced competencies are required for staff to increase productivity and improve their decision-making, which directly contributes to improving the business environment by enhancing the relationship with customers and stakeholders.</jats:p>",
