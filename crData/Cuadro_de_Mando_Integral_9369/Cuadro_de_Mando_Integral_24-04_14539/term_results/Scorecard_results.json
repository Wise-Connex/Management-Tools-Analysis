      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been studied a lot as a tool for measuring performance in corporate organizations around the world, but it hasn't been studied much in cooperatives. The goal of this research was to ascertain how multipurpose cooperatives perform using the BSC. A total of eighteen cooperatives were purposively chosen as samples for this research, where members, employees, and managers served as the respondents. The study utilized a descriptive research design whereby the researcher collected and analyzed financial statements for three years, made use of surveys to elicit responses from respondents, and conducted document analysis to further enhance the result. Results showed that the cooperatives’ financial performance obtained a \"fair performance\" rating using the Cooperative Development Authority's (CDA) performance standards. Members/customers received very satisfactory performance, while internal business processes and learning and growth received excellent results. This investigation revealed that despite financial performance issues, cooperatives met member expectations, provided outstanding business processes, and provided staff learning and development, contradicting Kaplan and Norton's assertion that optimal performance in all three areas leads to financial success. Weak areas were also identified along with the four BSC perspectives that need intervention, and strategies were devised to enhance and improve performance utilizing the BSC framework. It is recommended that cooperatives adopt strategies in terms of improving their performance, particularly in the identified weak areas, and meeting their objectives and goals as set by CDA. Future researchers may consider discovering cooperatives' performance in other social aspects.</jats:p>"

Making taxonomies easy to apply, consistent, open to innovation and comprehensive at the same time is imperative if the world’s economies are to achieve net zero, even when this dilutes technical precision in the process.We argue in favour of expanding classification systems to include (information on) transition and potential transition activities, and present a scorecard approach to meet that very objective.\n \nReceived: 23 October 2023 | Revised: 4 April 2024 | Accepted: 12 April 2024\n \nConflicts of Interest \nDirk Andreas Zetzsche is an editorial board member for Green and Low-Carbon Economy, and was not involved in the editorial review or the decision to publish this article.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In managing relationships with stakeholders within the medical services sector, it is imperative to strike a strategic balance between addressing socio-economic challenges and safeguarding the country's environment and natural resources, all while considering stakeholder needs. Consequently, it is necessary to establish a set of indicators for analyzing and managing stakeholder relationships in alignment with sustainable development objectives. The proposal entails creating a list of key indicators for each subsystem of the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBCS). These indicators will serve as our compass, guiding us in assessing the degree to which strategic objectives in managing stakeholder relationships align with healthcare companies' sustainable development goals. This alignment, we believe, holds the key to a more sustainable and prosperous future for all. Causal connections between the indicators of SBCS subsystems – \"Activators\" – \"Processes\", \"Processes\" – \"Stakeholders\", \"Stakeholders\" – \"Results\" – have been established. The results of modeling the interconnections between these subsystems have allowed conclusions to be drawn regarding the existence of statistical relationships among their elements, which are pertinent to consider in developing strategies for healthcare, structuring the goals of their sustainable development, and determining the means of achieving them. Based on the analysis results, the following indicators, exhibiting the most robust mutual relations, have been identified: under the \"Results\" subsystem – the ratio of expenditures to revenues, cash flow coefficient, utilization level of energy-efficient resources, expenses for outfitting ecological offices and premises; within the \"Stakeholders\" subsystem – the percentage of satisfied patients within the total, number of executed social projects, utility expenses (electricity, water, heat) in administrative costs; within the \"Processes\" subsystem – the growth rate of provided medical services volume, funding ratio, proportion of non-recyclable material costs in material expenses; within the \"Activators\" subsystem – training and development costs per employee, coefficient of innovative growth, dynamics of eco-awareness development measures. These indicators enable the monitoring and controlling of the achievement of economic, social, and environmentally sustainable development objectives.\nKeywords: management, stakeholders, balanced scorecard, sustainable development, strategic objectives, strategic map.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the performance measurement that is owned only pays attention to the financial aspect and is not comprehensive to overcome these problems. Based on this, the company needs to formulate performance measurements that pay attention to financial and non-financial aspects. One of the performance measurement methods is the Balanced Scorecard which pays attention to four perspectives in the company. The design of the performance measurement itself begins by considering the internal and external conditions of the company through the SWOT method to formulate a strategy based on the company's vision and mission. From the strategy is derived into strategic goals which are then formulated Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each level of importance is weighted on each indicator using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The perspective that has the greatest weight is the customer perspective with a percentage of 48.4%. The last stage is the preparation of a performance measurement table</jats:p>"

We first dive into the key concepts of the BSC, highlighting its usefulness as a tool for analyzing and measuring financial and operational performance. BSC offers a comprehensive framework for translating an organization's vision and strategy into concrete indicators, thereby facilitating informed decision-making. At the same time, this article highlights the major theoretical challenges posed by digitization for public institutions. The transition to digitalization has profound repercussions on financial management, the adjustment of strategies, and the response to the growing expectations of citizens and stakeholders. In this context, adapting financing strategies becomes crucial. BSC, as a measurement and evaluation tool, is proving to be a valuable ally for public managers, enabling them to monitor performance, identify areas requiring improvement, and adjust financial resources accordingly. The research methodology of this paper is based on an in-depth documentary analysis of scientific literature, relevant government reports, and data from national and international organizations. In conclusion, this paper aims to enlighten public decision-makers and managers on the importance of BSC in improving funding strategies in the digitization era. It offers informed perspectives and concrete recommendations, based on a solid literature review, to contribute to effective financial management and the successful adaptation of public institutions in this ever-changing context.</jats:p>"

At the same time, there is no evidence to suggest that specific technical features of the BSC influence its endurance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper contributes to the debate on the key factors for implementing and sustaining multidimensional control systems in professional organisations. It emphasises the importance of knowledge-based assets and distinctive internal capabilities for the success of the business. The implications of the BSC legacy are discussed, along with future developments of multidimensional control tools aimed at supporting strategy execution.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
