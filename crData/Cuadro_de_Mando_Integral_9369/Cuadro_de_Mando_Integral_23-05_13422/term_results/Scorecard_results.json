Using a descriptive approach, it was possible to determine that the organization in question presents some problems, in its daily operations, mainly based on the disorganization of activities, which generates delays in the provision of its services, as well as deterioration in its operation. On the other hand, it is clear that there is an inadequate strategic direction because it is not possible to meet the objectives set. The conclusion of this study is that the management of the Balance Scorecard is an appropriate tool for the generation of a strategic plan that will later serve to carry out the monitoring and evaluation of the organizational plan of the company CG Seguros.</jats:p>"

In order to reduce the impact of natural disasters on cities, Making Cities Resilient (MCR) 2030 promoted by the international community has become an important issue. This study uses the \"Ten Essentials\" Toolkit for Resistant City constructed by the UNDRR to evaluate the disaster prevention and resilience capabilities of cities. However, the key to quantifying urban resilience is to link the indicators of the Disaster Resilience Scorecard with the operations of local government departments to strengthen urban resilience. Taking Taipei City as an example, this study uses the causal loop diagram (CLD) method to explore the business relationship between \"Ten Essentials\" and various bureaus, and builds a localized disaster resistance scorecard through expert meetings. CLD provides a visual map of the links between resilience indicators and local government operations, providing a clear conceptual model of operating resilient systems.It can be seen from the analysis results that through the questionnaire survey, Taipei City's disaster prevention and resilience capabilities have achieved satisfied results in various Essentials. Among them, \"Organizational Resilience\", \"Enhancing Organizational Resilience and Disaster Resilience\", \"Increasing Infrastructure Resilience\", and \"Ensuring Effective Disaster Response\" performed best. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the actuarial calculation of disaster risks, enhance financial resilience through catastrophe funds, and implement various measures such as community disaster prevention and business continuity plans, so as to continue to strengthen Taipei's urban resilience in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Perubahan lingkungan kini semakin tidak dapat diprediksi, tanpa melakukan pengukuran kinerja maka organisasi tidak memiliki acuan dalam merumuskan strategi yang lebih baik. Penelitian ini bertujuan merancang sistem pengukuran kinerja yang komprehensif bagi sektor UKM berdasarkan kriteria standarisasi pengelolaan mutu di tingkat nasional. Perancangan pengukuran kinerja menggunakan kerangka kerja Balanced Scorecard yang dikombinasikan dengan kriteria Penilaian kinerja SNI Award tahun 2022 sedangkan pengolahan data menggunakan metode Analytic Network Process. Hasil rancangan dari penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa terdapat lima Sub kriteria yang memiliki bobot nilai &gt;10% yaitu terdiri dari: Strategi (14.55%), Kinerja Non Keuangan (13.61%), Suara Pelanggan (13.26%), Kepuasan dan Kerekatan Pelanggan terhadap Organisasi (11.74%) dan Kinerja Keuangan (11.39%). Disimpulkan bahwa kriteria Strategi (14.55%) dianggap memiliki kontribusi tertinggi dalam perancangan sistem pengukuran kinerja UKM yang komprehensif berbasis kerangka kerja BSC dan perbedaan kerangka kerja dalam sistem pengukuran kinerja akan berdampak terhadap bobot nilai setiap kriteria yang ada.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;In the United States (USA), transportation is the largest single source of\n                    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, representing 27% of total GHGs emitted in 2020.\n                    Eighty-three percent of these came from road transport, and 57% from light-duty\n                    vehicles (LDVs). Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, which still form the\n                    bulk of the United States (US) fleet, struggle to meet climate change targets.\n                    Despite increasingly stringent regulatory mechanisms and technology\n                    improvements, only three US states have been able to reduce their transport\n                    emissions to the target of below 1990 levels. Fifteen states have made some\n                    headway to within 10% of their 1990 baseline. Largely, however, it appears that\n                    current strategies are not generating effective results.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n                \n&lt;div&gt;Current climate-change mitigation measures in road transport tend to be\n                    predominantly technological. One of the most popular measures in the USA is\n                    fleet electrification, receiving regulatory and fiscal encouragement from 45 US\n                    states and federal bills. However, zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) might not be\n                    the climate change panacea for the transport sector. ZEVs are facing adoption\n                    issues ranging from affordability, equity, and charging infrastructure to\n                    vehicle class availability limitations. Despite increasing sales, US electric\n                    vehicle (EV) adoption has been behind the curve with a current market\n                    penetration of 4.5%. Outside of ZEVs, emission reduction in the US road\n                    transport sector has been sluggish.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n                \n&lt;div&gt;In road transport, which contributes the bulk of traffic-related air pollution\n                    (TRAP), there are clear gaps between policy targets, technology-based\n                    expectations, and actual results. For a sector that is struggling to meet\n                    climate change targets, broadening its scope of climate change mitigation\n                    measures for road transport would be useful. Driver behavior may be an\n                    underexplored strategy.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n                \n&lt;div&gt;Eco-driving is a known strategy and has been attributed to reducing TRAP by up to\n                    50% (through nontechnological means) in various studies in the USA and across\n                    the world. If technological eco-driving measures are included, they can improve\n                    fuel economy in excess of 100%. But the extent to which it is included in driver\n                    education and licensing protocols in US states is unclear.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n                \n&lt;div&gt;This study, therefore, evaluates eco-driving in state-sponsored non-commercial\n                    Driving License Manuals (DLMs). Provisions in state DLMs were assessed based on\n                    the &lt;i&gt;intent&lt;/i&gt; of the prescribed practices (collision safety,\n                    environmental exposure, or both), the &lt;i&gt;extent&lt;/i&gt; to which these\n                    were included, and the &lt;i&gt;strength&lt;/i&gt; of the recommended mechanisms\n                    (prescriptive or regulatory). The scores were converted into Grades A–D.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n                \n&lt;div&gt;The results are revealing. Despite thirty-three US states (66%) with extant\n                    climate change commitments, almost the same percentage (62%) of states received\n                    a “D” grade and entirely omitted to mention driver influence on fuel consumption\n                    and emissions. Only five states (10%) received an “A” grade with substantive\n                    eco-driving measures in their DLMs. There is thus significant scope for\n                    eco-driving content in DLMs, which can range from the state’s communicating\n                    climate change commitments to how drivers influence fuel consumption through\n                    their driving practices to empowering drivers with strategies they can adopt to\n                    save fuel and money and reduce emissions.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n                \n&lt;div&gt;This inclusion has the potential to improve vehicular fuel economy and help\n                    states meet their climate change goals. Driver education is the first step.\n                    Eco-driving principles can be further bolstered through subsequent inclusion in\n                    the driver training and testing phases of driver licensing.&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

A new variable<jats:italic>, the manager's perceived business performance</jats:italic>, was added in light of the unique characteristics of restaurant SMEs. We hypothesized that all three business perspectives are positively correlated since restaurant managers must have realistic perceptions of SMEs' business performance. A total of 266 questionnaires were obtained from restaurant managers, and 1,330 questionnaires were obtained from restaurant guests. SMEs' official financial reports served as the basis for the analysis of financial data. Exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to investigate the relationships among the three perspectives. Results indicate that managers' perceptions of business performance are not correlated to SMEs' actual financial performance, and managers have realistic perceptions about the quality of what restaurants offer. Interestingly, SMEs' financial performance is not correlated to guests' perceptions of quality. Introducing a new internal perspective indicates the incoherence among the three BSC perspectives. Furthermore, using selected variables highlights the necessity of raising the managerial perspective in future restaurant SME studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT.</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In 2017, the Global Task Force for Cholera Control (GTFCC) set a goal to eliminate cholera from ≥ 20 countries and to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030. Many countries have included oral cholera vaccine (OCV) in their cholera control plans. We felt that a simple, user-friendly monitoring tool would be useful to guide national progress toward cholera elimination. We reviewed cholera surveillance data of Uganda from 2015 to 2021 by date and district. We defined a district as having eliminated cholera if cholera was not reported in that district for at least 4 years. We prepared maps to show districts with cholera, districts that had eliminated it, and districts that had eliminated it but then “relapsed.” These maps were compared with districts where OCV was used and the hotspot map recommended by the GTFCC. Between 2018 and 2021, OCV was administered in 16 districts previously identified as hotspots. In 2018, cholera was reported during at least one of the four previous years from 36 of the 146 districts of Uganda. This number decreased to 18 districts by 2021. Cholera was deemed “eliminated” from four of these 18 districts but then “relapsed.” The cholera elimination scorecard effectively demonstrated national progress toward cholera elimination and identified districts where additional resources are needed to achieve elimination by 2030. Identification of the districts that have eliminated cholera and those that have relapsed will assist the national programs to focus on addressing the factors that result in elimination or relapse of cholera.</jats:p>",
