      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective – The goal of this paper is to explore using Kaplan and Norton’s balanced scorecard methodology as a systemic model for outcomes assessment. The expectations of academic accrediting agencies have shifted from measurement of inputs and outputs to that of the library’s impact on learning and demonstrating accountability. Recent literature has presented methods for performing specific aspects of outcomes assessment. However, the scorecard methodology may provide a systemic advantage beneficial to library administrators and managers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMethods – This paper provides a selective review of outcomes assessment in academic libraries and a description of the balanced scorecard methodology, focusing on its relevance to assessment and demonstration of accountability. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nResults – A theoretical scenario is outlined, including examples of a scorecard used for outcomes assessment. For each example, the benefits of using a systemic approach are examined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusions – Using a systems-thinking approach to outcomes assessment may provide significant advantages to library administrators and managers. As the model includes traditional methods of outcomes assessment, the scorecard approach adds elements of process improvement, identification of the inputs and outputs that create outcomes, and a tool for communicating accountability for resources.</jats:p>"

This study uses the 2005/6 Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey to construct an easy-to-use scorecard that estimates the likelihood that a Pakistani household has expenditure below a given poverty line. The scorecard uses 10 simple indicators that field workers can quickly collect and verify. Poverty scores can be computed on paper in the field in about 5 to 10 minutes. The scorecard’s accuracy and precision are reported for a range of poverty lines. The poverty scorecard is a practical way for pro-poor programs in Pakistan to monitor poverty rates, track changes in poverty rates over time, and target services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of multiple stakeholder performance measurement frameworks (PMF) is a complex process in the public research sector. The objective of the paper was to investigate whether the performance measurement framework (PMF) of a state owned research organization could be adapted to the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). A conceptual framework developed a hybrid form of BSC that could be applied in a research setting before describing a case study setting. A case study, as well as a survey was employed to investigate the research questions. The results suggest that the research sector PMF incorporated the properties the organization’s value chain, as well as reflected its strategies and key actions. Furthermore, suitable performance measures had been created for all the organization’s stakeholders. Further inductive analysis indicated that the PMF resembled a hybrid form of BSC based on the Moullin (2002) public sector framework. Finally, the results indicated that the PMF motivated its researchers at operations level, however, a survey of opinions suggests there was a significant difference in opinion between different categories of researchers.</jats:p>"

Organization requires a control system that measures the performance strategically. This paper gathers the literature discussion of one such popular integrated strategic performance control system, the balanced scorecard approach (BSC).  The discussion focuses on BSC approach on facilitating the implementation of organizational strategic and its link to the economic profit measures. Two popular economic profit measures, the Economic Value Added (EVA) and Market Value Added (MVA) are discussed in detail from various researchers point of view. The paper highlights the difference between these two measures and difference with the Return on Investment (ROI). The limitation of the economic profit measure is also highlighted in the discussion. As conclusion the link between the BSC strategic performance control tool and the economic profit measures are noted. This paper provides detailed discussions of both BSC strategic tool and economic profit measures based on literature review.</jats:p>"
