The functional division of labour within officialdom and the growth of professionalism seem to be long-running threads through the development of officialdom since the ninth century. The third, formalism, if we are scoring, is probably best attributed as a half mark not least because its impact, though substantial, appears to be very different from the way Weber envisaged. The very patchy progress of monocracy makes it least likely to regard this feature as a trend in bureaucratization. Two and a half ‘correct’ items might not be such a bad scorecard to end with. Yet the one and a half incorrect scores are essential to the whole notion of bureaucracy as ‘domination’.</jats:p>",

Taking a long-term perspective from the ninth century to the present, it looks beyond national institutions and includes officials involved in the provision of goods and services locally. The ‘scorecard’ is based on expected developments in four key areas of Weber’s analysis: the functional differentiation of tasks within government, professionalism, formalism, and monocracy. After discussing the character of officialdom in the ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, eighteenth, and twenty-first centuries, Weber’s scorecard appears to have a mixed record, especially weak in its account of the development of monocracy and formalism. The study goes on to set out an account of administrative development based on understanding processes of routinization, institutional integration, and the instrumentalization of law.</jats:p>",

Four main features are the structural differentiation, monocracy, professionalism, and formalism of officialdom. Weber’s approach further suggests that bureaucratization is a long-term development trend, that it is revolutionary and is the tool of the powerful in maintaining their ‘dominion’. These arguments will be developed in an examination of six territories (Hungary, England, Spain, Germany, France, and Sweden) in five different time periods (the ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, and eighteenth centuries and the period from the mid-twentieth to the early twenty-first century). The analysis will look not only at the higher administrative levels, termed ‘secretariat officialdom’, but also at ‘territorial’ and (especially neglected) ‘service’ officialdom.</jats:p>",

It does point to the fragmentation of political authority among a variety of different ‘lordships’ within a territory. Alongside this fragmentation, the period witnesses significant elaboration of forms of administrative organization consistent with Weber’s argument, above all in the elaboration of forms of service officialdom. In this period, it is possible to detect a strengthening power of royal government especially through the development of forms of territorial government with powers of supervision over other regional and local forms of administration. Yet this was not a move towards bureaucratization through creating monocratic forms of administration. The role of territorial officialdom was concerned with supervising and giving account rather than establishing command and direction.</jats:p>",

Looking primarily at the Carolingian empire and the Umayyad emirate, where available detail for ninth-century arrangements is more plentiful, this chapter offers an account of the secretariat, territorial, and service officialdoms that ran these two rather different systems. When looked at through the perspective of our three officialdoms, the similarities between the systems start to appear stronger. What we know about ninth-century England, Sweden, and Hungary fits some of the broad tendencies observed in the Carolingian and Umayyad systems. The conclusion discusses in what senses these systems can be considered ‘patrimonial’ and how far we can detect developments towards functional differentiation, professionalization, formalism, and monocracy in the structure and operation of their officialdoms.</jats:p>",

Common problems include the treatment of bureaucratization as a ‘syndrome’, the concentration on one or other period as decisive in its development, and the overestimation of the role of state reforms in creating bureaucracies. Borrowing from Francis Fukuyama’s broad insights, this chapter develops an account of the development of bureaucracy that stresses the role of routinization, institutional integration, and the instrumentalization of law. The approach helps understand what is distinctive about European bureaucracy and what is less so. It concludes with some observations about the persistence of the Weberian ideal type of bureaucracy in some areas of scholarship.</jats:p>",

When we consider the constitutional state after the nineteenth century, the limitations of Weber’s account become even more apparent as constitutionalism is less concerned with establishing a monocratic from of control than setting out limitations on the powers of different component parts of the political and administrative system.</jats:p>",

While the eighteenth century shows a marked elaboration of features of bureaucratism over the fifteenth, such changes cannot be attributed entirely to state action, still less to the fiscal-military state.

The research method used is descriptive with a quantitative approach. Data was collected through surveys, interviews, and analysis of financial documents and internal university performance reports. Financial performance indicators include income, expenses and cost efficiency, while internal business indicators include academic processes, operational efficiency and service quality. The research results show that from a financial perspective, universities experienced a significant increase in annual income, especially from PNBP and academic support. However, there is still a need to diversify income sources. The largest expenditures are allocated to academic activities, staff salaries and allowances, and despite savings efforts, cost efficiency can still be improved. From an internal business perspective, the quality of the academic process is considered good but requires curriculum innovation that is more responsive to job market needs. Campus operational efficiency is good, but several administrative processes require digitalization. The level of student and staff satisfaction with university services is quite high, although there are areas that need improvement such as IT services and supporting facilities. This research concludes that the performance of UIN KH Abdurrahman Wahid Pekalongan from a financial and internal business perspective is quite good, but there are areas that require improvement to achieve higher efficiency and effectiveness.

However, the challenge in measuring the performance of non-profit organizations often centers on financial aspects, making a more comprehensive approach necessary. This study aims to analyze the performance of BMH in managing Zakat, Infaq, and Sadaqah (ZIS) funds using the Balanced Scorecard method, which enables evaluation from multiple perspectives, including financial, operational, and service. The research methodology used is a qualitative approach, collecting primary data through interviews with BMH management leaders and direct observation of zakat management practices. Secondary data were also obtained from BMH’s internal documents and reports. The analysis was conducted using the Balanced Scorecard framework to assess the institution's overall performance. The results show that BMH has demonstrated good performance in managing ZIS, with positive scores in various evaluated perspectives. However, some areas need improvement, such as strengthening social legitimacy and improving program management. This study recommends strategic steps to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of zakat management, and to reinforce BMH’s position as a trusted amil institution in society.</jats:p>"

Specifically, this includes use of the RMNCAH indicators, trainings received on RMNCAH indicators, and factors associated with the utilization of the RMNCAH indicators.\r\nMaterials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to gather quantitative data from 119 primary healthcare workers in chosen public primary facilities via one-on-one interviews. We collected data using tablets and the Kobo Collect app.\r\nFindings: The findings revealed that 89% of the selected facilities analyzed RMNCAH variables, whereas only 13% used scorecards at the time of the study. The study found that 75% of the facilities that used scorecards did not indicate the specific type of scorecard they received training on. Further research revealed a relationship between scorecard type and utilization (p&lt;0.001, χ2= 2.365), with 84% of facilities analyzing RMNCAH indicators on a monthly basis, focusing on immunization and family planning. However, 63% of healthcare workers rated the health system's structures as either low or poor. Only 11% of facilities had monitoring and evaluation budgets, yet 78% had RMNCAH indicator targets. While most public primary facilities analyze RMNCAH indicators, only a small percentage of these facilities use scorecards due to barriers such as limited training on different types of scorecards, a lack of monitoring and evaluation budget commitments, and poor structural components of the health system\r\nImplications to Theory, Practice and Policy: While facilities appreciate the availability of RMNCAH indicators, still the main focus is on immunization and family planning, hence the need for a more comprehensive monitoring of all RMNCAH indicators.</jats:p>"

The model takes into account uncertainty, ambiguity, and incompleteness in the data. The model first calculates the neutrosophic measures of digital transformation and sustainable performance for each university. Then, it uses neutrosophic logic to evaluate the causal relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance. The results of the analysis can used to identify the digital transformation indicators that have the greatest impact on sustainable performance. This information can then be used to develop strategies for improving sustainable performance by investing in digital transformation. The neutrosophic model was applied to measure and evaluate the role of digital transformation in improving sustainable performance using the balanced scorecard in some Egyptian universities. The results showed that the percentage of courses offered online and the percentage of students using digital learning platforms were the two digital transformation indicators that had the greatest impact on sustainable performance. The neutrosophic model is a powerful tool that can be used to measure and evaluate the role of digital transformation in improving sustainable performance in Egyptian universities, taking into account uncertainty, ambiguity, and incompleteness in the data.\r\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT.</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In the Americas, onchocerciasis has been eliminated in 11 of 13 endemic foci by mass administration of ivermectin. The remaining at-risk population resides in a contiguous cross-border transmission zone located in the Amazon jungle in northwest Brazil and southern Venezuela, known as the Yanomami Focus Area. Here, we describe the development and implementation of a data-driven tool, called the Scorecard Approach (SCA), for the 393 communities that comprise the Venezuela South Focus. The SCA was first applied in 2018 and is reassessed on an annual basis. This operational strategy seeks to prioritize communities with low ivermectin coverage while taking into account the nature and variation of other epidemiological and logistical variables. Numeric scores are assigned for each factor and added together to yield a composite score for each community that is categorized as high, medium, or low priority. In this way, the SCA serves as a valuable and comprehensive strategy for planning, monitoring, and maximizing programmatic efficiency. In addition, it has allowed the country to face the main challenges of this endemic area: its remoteness, its large areas of territory to cover, the semi-nomadic nature of the Yanomami people, and their continuous cross-border movements. For 2022, the SCA categorized 54 (13.7%), 108 (27.5%), and 231 (58.8%) communities as high, medium, and low priority, respectively. The results presented here show that prioritizing communities at risk and with greatest needs increases the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of onchocerciasis by 2025 in the last endemic focus in the Americas.</jats:p>",
