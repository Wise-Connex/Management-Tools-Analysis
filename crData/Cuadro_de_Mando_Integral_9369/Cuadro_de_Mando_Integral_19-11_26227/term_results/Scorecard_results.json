This research is a qualitative descriptive study. The operational variable of this research is performance measurement with four perspective indicators in the balanced scorecard namely financial perspective, customer perspective, internal business process perspective, learning and growth perspective. Data sources used in this study are primary data obtained from questionnaire results for patients and hospital employees and interviews. Secondary data is in the form of hospital profiles and financial data and hospital data. The data analysis technique used is descriptive analysis. The results showed that Dwi Sari Lubuklinggau's Mother and Child Hospital so far in measuring financial performance is only based on financial reports by looking at revenue growth and has not yet implemented performance measurement with a balanced scorecard. The application of the balanced scorecard to the Dwi Sari Lubuklinggau Mother and Child Hospital using four perspectives on average shows good performance, there are only a few indicators of performance measurement on the customer's perspective and the perspective of internal business processes that show poor performance.</jats:p>"

Therefore, Operation Supplement Safety developed a safety rating scorecard to help individuals independently assess DS, by using 7 simple criteria. Dietary supplements that met at least 4 of the 7 criteria were classified as “less risky” compared with those scoring less than 4. We assessed the accuracy and reliability of a DS safety rating scorecard, when coupled with a DS educational session. Adults with a mean age of 46 years attended two sessions. Session I included a general overview of DS, education on DS safety, and instructions on how to use the DS scorecard. Participants then independently scored 12 DSs. During session II, participants rescored the same 12 DSs and participated in a focus group. Completed DS scorecards were analyzed for accuracy and reliability both between participants and across sessions. More than 86% of participants correctly classified the DSs using the scorecard. When provided a brief session on DS education, participants could reliably use the scorecard to correctly classify DSs as “risky” or “less risky.” Education is key for assisting individuals to make more informed decisions about DSs.</jats:p>",

Este estudo tem o objetivo de analisar a utilização prática do Balanced Scorecard como instrumento de gestão do Planejamento Estratégico na empresa Novo Nordisk Produção Farmacêutica do Brasil Ltda., identificando pontos de divergência em relação à teoria criada por Kaplan e Norton nos anos 90. Para a realização da pesquisa, foi adotada a abordagem metodológica empírico analítica, com a condução de estudo de caso em uma unidade fabril da empresa localizada em Montes Claros – MG. Foram feitas 19 entrevistas semiestruturadas com diretores e gerentes e aplicados 207 questionários aos demais funcionários. Os resultados mostraram que entre os gestores da empresa existe um conhecimento comum em relação às premissas para definição do Planejamento Estratégico e  um alinhamento sobre o Balanced Scorecard.  Contrariamente ao exposto por Kaplan e Norton sobre as etapas de criação do Balanced Scorecard, verificou-se que o processo na Novo Nordisk em Montes Claros é desenvolvido de forma inversa, primeiro são recebidas as metas advindas da matriz, para então ser desenvolvido o Planejamento Estratégico que levará ao atingimento destas metas. A pesquisa mostrou ainda as adaptações feitas pela empresa em estudo ao modelo proposto por Kaplan e Norton, de forma a minimizar as barreiras oriundas do conflito de agência que podem levar ao insucesso na obtenção dos resultados esperados para as metas definidas no Planejamento Estratégico das organizações.Palavras-chave: Balanced scorecard.

This study aims to analyze the practical use of the Balanced Scorecard as an instrument for the management of Strategic Planning in Novo Nordisk Produção Farmacêutica do Brasil Ltda (Novo Nordisk Pharmaceutical Production of Brazil Ltda), identifying points of divergence from the theory created by Kaplan and Norton in the 1990s. To develop the research, the analytical empirical methodological approach was adopted, with the conduction of a case study at a company unit located in Montes Claros - MG. There were 19 semi-structured interviews with directors and managers and 207 questionnaires were applied to the other employees. The results showed that among the managers of the company there is a common knowledge regarding the premises for the definition of Strategic Planning and also an alignment on the Balanced Scorecard. Contrary to what Kaplan and Norton presented about the stages of the creation of the Balanced Scorecard, it was verified that the process at Novo Nordisk in Montes Claros is developed in an inverse way: first, the goals coming from the head quarter are received. Then the Strategic Planning, which will lead to the attainment of these goals, is developed. The research also showed the adaptations made by the company under study to the model proposed by Kaplan and Norton, in order to minimize the barriers from the agency conflict that can lead to the failure to obtain the expected results for the goals defined in the Strategic Planning of the organizations.Keywords: Balanced Scorecard.

Measurement of IT implementation is carried out on ABC companies engaged in information technology services in every business process. To integrate business processes with the current implementation of information technology, IT measurements are needed through the concept of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) in ABC companies. In ABC companies, IT performance measurement is very important to know the extent of the company's business development stage so that it can achieve the organization's vision and mission in the short and long term. In terms of effectiveness and efficiency, ABC companies have information technology and prioritize meeting business and IT strategies. A number of business transactions carried out every day can run the risk of failure of IT implementation which impacts on the company's progress. The method used to measure IT maturity in ABC company is IT BSC combined with BTripleE Framework. From the results of the analysis conducted, there are various findings related to the risk and failure of IT implementation in the company so that an evaluation of IT is obtained which is used as a responsive action towards the IT implementation. After that, the description of the BTripleE Framework form is applied in the use of IT BSC that considers 4 perspectives through the calculation of Key Performance Indicators (KPI), including corporate contribution, future orientation, operational excellence, and customer orientation.Keywords: IT Performance Measurement, IT Balanced Scorecard, BtrippleE Framework, Key Performance Indicator</jats:p>"

The main aspects related to sustainability in these systems were defined. This allowed valuating administration variants in agricultural systems from the productive, social, environmental and economic point of view. It is concluded that the variant called Integral Control Panel is a very useful control tool for sustainable management in agricultural systems. In addition, questions were raised that indicate that the study of other integral administrative variants in these systems is deepened.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The original BSC has spread to different sectors in the last decades, including healthcare services, in numerous amended versions. The aim of our project was to identify potential indicators of BSC for performance evaluation in general hospitals.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We performed a systematic review of literature on Pubmed and Web of Science using the search string “balanced scorecard AND healthcare AND indicators”. We found 102 papers; 80 papers were removed for irrelevance, absence of full text or performance indicators. We only considered articles that followed the classic structure of BSC (Customer, Internal Processes, Financial, and Learning and Growth). The indicators listed in them were classified according to the four determinants of organisational performance.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Eight articles out of 22 followed the classic structure of the BSC. The most represented category was Internal Processes (59 indicators), followed by Learning and Growth (52), Customer (40) and Financial (33). The number of common/overlapping indicators was low (5 for Internal Processes and 4 for the three other categories).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>While BSC has spread to different settings, the list of indicators used in the classic four determinants for performance evaluation is heterogeneous. While common points can be identified between indicators, our review highlighted that every BSC is developed in a unique way which makes it difficult to identify a general framework adaptable to different hospital settings.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Key messages</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The use of the Balanced Scorecard as management tool has spread to healthcare settings in the last decade. Indicators in BSC for healthcare settings are heterogeneous and only a limited number follow the standard structure of BSC.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

With four perspectives we measure ERP performance in a company. We disseminate data to 186 respondents to see whether ERP performance is good, then we get results from these four perspectives that support the performance of the ERP system. The results of this study are given to management to see whether the ERP performance that has been used is good or not, after that we can determine what should be done by the management</jats:p>"
