The technique is based on the balanced scorecard system of the same name. Design/methodology/approach &amp;ndash; Methodologically, the study is based on Kaplan and Norton's balanced scorecard concept and the author's concept of applied strategic analysis. Findings &amp;ndash; It is shown that applied strategic analysis of learning and growth envisages comparative evaluation, diagnostics of deviations and predictions of the values of the balanced scorecard metrics of learning and growth in the dimension of strategic objectives. It includes analysis of the level of motivation in employees, the volume of authroity delegation and whether their personal goals match company goals; analysis of the expansion capacity of information systems, and analysis of the quality of retraining and the creativity level of employees. The applied strategic analysis of learning and growth with comparative evaluation of the metrics of the level of motivation in employees, the volume of delegation to them and of the match between their personal and corporate goals, and concludes with a prediction of the values of factor measures of the quality of retraining and creativity development in employees.Originality/value &amp;ndash; The author comes to a conclusion that applied strategic analysis of learning and growth is a new and sufficiently effective instrucment for studying the strategic aspects of companies' performance that is associated with the training and development of their personnel. The instrument provides analytical support to strategic management as regards personnel training and development in today's conditions. Its results might be useful when working out managerial decisions for the company's short-term, medium-term and long-term plans in the area of learning and growth.</jats:p>"

Monitoring a company's key performance indicators (KPIs) can improve organizational performance and enhance shareholder value. A survey was prepared and distributed to 60 managers from Croatian businesses to investigate the relationship between business success as assessed by a balanced scorecard system. The questions were based on the balanced goal system, a four-dimensional model for measuring business performance that covers financial performance, knowledge, and employees, processes success, and market performance. It was used to assess managers' perceptions of foreign and domestic businesses. Furthermore, a two-step cluster analysis was conducted. The results indicated that the respondents who are dominantly oriented towards the international markets share identical perspectives on the importance of the company's performance as those in the predominantly domestic markets.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, this joint EORTC Brain Tumor Group and RANO effort sought to prospectively validate a revised MRI scorecard for response assessment in leptomeningeal metastasis. Methods: Coded paired cerebrospinal MRI of 20 patients with leptomeningeal metastases from solid cancers at baseline and follow-up after treatment and instructions for assessment were provided via the EORTC imaging platform. The Kappa coefficient was used to evaluate the inter-observer pairwise agreement. Results: Thirty-five raters participated, including 9 neuroradiologists, 17 neurologists, 4 radiation oncologists, 3 neurosurgeons and 2 medical oncologists. Among single leptomeningeal metastases-related imaging findings at baseline, the best median concordance was noted for hydrocephalus (Kappa = 0.63), and the worst median concordance for spinal linear enhancing disease (Kappa = 0.46). The median concordance of raters for the overall response assessment was moderate (Kappa = 0.44). Notably, the interobserver agreement for the presence of parenchymal brain metastases at baseline was fair (Kappa = 0.29) and virtually absent for their response to treatment. 394 of 700 ratings (20 patients x 35 raters, 56%) were fully completed. In 308 of 394 fully completed ratings (78%), the overall response assessment perfectly matched the summary interpretation of the single ratings as proposed in the scorecard instructions. Conclusions: This study confirms the principle utility of the new scorecard, but also indicates the need for training of MRI assessment with a dedicated reviewer panel in clinical trials. Electronic case report forms with “blocking options” may be required to enforce completeness and quality of scoring. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard is widely used in various institutions, including hospitals because it can measure performance in a comprehensive, coherent, balanced, and measurable manner. Performance measurement at Padang Panjang Public Hospital so far focused on the financial aspect. This study aims to measure the performance of Padang Panjang Public Hospital in achieving its target with the Balanced Scorecard method. There are 14 indicators of performance that are measured in this study, namely economic ratio, efficiency ratio, and effectiveness ratio that describe performance from a financial perspective; customer satisfaction, complaint handling, customer retention, and market share that describe performance from a customer perspective; BOR (Bed Occupancy Rate), ALOS (Average Length of Stay), Bed Turn Over (BTO), and Turn Over Interval (TOI) which describe performance on the internal business process perspective and employee turnover, employee training, and employee productivity which describe performance from a learning and growth perspective. This is a mixed-method study, whereby the quantitative phase is followed by the qualitative phase. Quantitative data was taken and processed from hospital documents in 2018 and 2019. Each performance indicator is assessed by comparing it with its target. Interviews were conducted to get an explanation of the results obtained. Five of the fourteen performance indicator measurements have not reached the target, namely efficiency ratio, effectiveness ratio, BOR, employee training, and employee productivity. To improve performance, the hospital can focus on employee performance which will affect other performance indicators by providing education, training as well as employee job satisfaction.</jats:p>"

Metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah studi lapangan dan tinjauan pustaka. Teknik analisis data menggunakan aktivitas reduksi data, penyajian data, dan penarikan kesimpulan. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa evaluasi kinerja BPAP Takalar tahun 2015 - 2019 dilakukan menggunakan metode balance scorecard. Telah mampu merealisasikan setiap indikator kinerja utama yang telah diturunkan dari kinerja Direktorat Jenderal Perikanan Budidaya sebagai instansi pembina. Perspektif keuangan menunjukkan pada kurun waktu 2015-2019 di nilai baik. Capaian realisasi meningkat lebih baik pada tiga tahun terakhir. Perspektif pelanggan dengan metode balance scorecard menunjukkan selama kurun waktu 2015 - 2019 tercapai sesuai dengan capaian target yang ditentukan. Perspektif proses bisnis internal dapat dilihat dari 11 indikator kinerja. Dari keseluruhan hanya indikator  PDB Balai Perikanan Budidaya Air Payau Takalar yang masih masuk kedalam kategori kurang. Hal ini disebabkan oleh keadaan pandemi. Perspektif pembelajaran dan pertumbuhan menunjukan bahwa realisasi anggaran masih belum mencapai target yang ditetapkan. Namun pada indikator pembelajaran dan pertumbuhan yang lain seperti nilai kinerja  birokrasi dan nilai AKIP DJPB sudah menunjukan capaian kinerja sudah sangat baik dan melampaui target yang sudah ditetapkan.\nThis study aims to analyze the performance of the Brackish Aquaculture Center Takalar (BPAP Takalar) in the four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard, namely the stakeholder perspective, the customer perspective, the internal business process perspective, and the learning and growth perspective. This type of research is descriptive quantitative. Data collection methods used in this research are field studies and literature review. The data analysis technique used data reduction activities, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The results showed that the BPAP Takalar performance evaluation in 2015 - 2019 was carried out using the balanced scorecard method. It had been able to realize every key performance indicator that had been derived from the performance of the Directorate General of Aquaculture as a coaching agency. The financial perspective showed that in the 2015-2019 period, the score was good. Achievement of realization increased better in the last three years. The customer's perspective using the balanced scorecard method showed that during the 2015 - 2019 period, it was achieved in accordance with the achievement of the specified target. The internal business process perspective could be seen from 11 performance indicators. Of the total, only the GDP indicator of the Takalar Brackish Water Aquaculture Center is still in the poor category. This is due to the state of the pandemic. However, other learning and growth indicators such as the bureaucratic performance value and the DJPB AKIP score have shown that the performance achievement had been very good and exceeded the set targets.</jats:p>"

Quando um cliente está satisfeito com a compra/aquisição de um produto/serviço, há maior probabilidade de se realizar novamente a aquisição deste. Portanto, para a manutenção desta satisfação, as organizações devem levar em consideração alguns fatores. Dentre eles, destaca-se a qualidade dos serviços/produtos. Nesse contexto, o Balanced Scorecard (BSC) apresenta-se como uma metodologia que, através de seus indicadores, proporciona melhorias na gestão empresarial e no suporte ao consumidor, bem como na satisfação dos clientes e qualidade dos serviços/produtos. Sendo assim, o presente artigo, visou responder: o BSC pode ser utilizado na gestão empresarial para a melhoria da qualidade dos serviços prestados visando maior satisfação dos clientes? Tendo como objetivo geral investigar, na literatura já publicada, a utilização do BSC na gestão empresarial, visando melhoria da qualidade dos serviços e maior satisfação dos clientes. Para isso, adotou-se como metodologia a pesquisa bibliográfica. Como resultados, constatou-se que esta metodologia atua em quatro perspectivas, influenciando diretamente no desempenho organizacional, sendo elas: financeira, do cliente, dos processos internos e de aprendizado e crescimento. Demonstrou-se, também, a atuação do BSC em cada uma delas. Por fim, concluiu-se que esta metodologia, pode sim ser utilizada para a melhoria da qualidade dos serviços prestados, estabelecendo indicadores que auxiliam no alcance da satisfação do cliente e auxiliam o processo de gestão empresarial.</jats:p>"

The evaluation of public services showed a significant increase in the public service achievement index (Kemenpan RB, 2021). However, this evaluation was based on the perspective of the public as service users, whilst other crucial perspectives, namely internal processes, employee learning, and growth, and finance, are yet to be considered. For the comprehensive performance evaluation, a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) was employed in this study. This study aims to measure the performances of 11 MPP using the scorecard, in which the scores can be used as a basis for improvement and reinforcement of MPP in the future. By using a mix method approach, the results found that two aspects, finance and employee learning and growth, experience the lowest score. Meanwhile, two other dimensions (service quality and internal processes) obtained optimum results. These findings bring a main recommendation to revisit the nomenclature of MPP: expected to adopt data and authority integration, improve management clarity, and enhance organization capacity and capability.</jats:p>"

O objetivo é atualizar o lastro téorico da contribuição do Balanced Scorecard (BSC) para o alinhamento estratégico organizacional por meio de uma RSL adaptada para estudos baseados em Design Science Research (DSR). Foi utilizada a RSL adaptada para pesquisas que utilizem a DSR, metodologia baseada em Design Science e que apresenta aplicabilidade mais adequada para solução de problemas organizacionais. Nesse estudo, verificou-se que o BSC contribui para o alinhamento estratégico especialmente em relação à capacidade de comunicação das prioridades estratégicas, tradução e operacionalização dos objetivos estratégicos, bem como o balanceamento e alinhamento entre áreas e departamentos em prol de um objetivo comum. Além disso, observou-se seu papel na influência motivacional, conscientização e comportamento dos colaboradores, além da possibilidade de utilização conjunta com a lógica fuzzy para tradução de imprecisões e vagueza associadas ao pensamento humano na tomada de decisões. A RSL realizada por apenas uma pessoa em vez de uma equipe de pesquisadores e artigos revisados são de natureza ontológica e epistemológica diferentes, o que pode limitar sua comparabilidade, em consideração da vagueza e imprecisão do pensamento humano em processos de tomada de decisão (lógica fuzzy), influência do BSC na coordenação de colaboradores por meio do encorajamento de sua motivação, bem como comunicação de prioridades estratégicas e estabelecimento de consciência de responsabilidade organizacional. Nesse contexto, foi obtido um profundamento da discussão sobre o alinhamento estratégico proporcionado pelo sistema de medição de desempenho BSC, ainda amplamente utilizado, e cuja abordagem carece de atualização por já ter quase trinta anos de existência, bem como a incorporação do conceito fuzzy para resolução de problemas organizacionais.&#x0D;\nPalavras-Chave: Estratégia; Alinhamento; Balanced Scorecard; Design Science Research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A number of studies in the digitalization-organizational performance literature have evaluated airline performance from the traditional performance theory; yet, fewer studies have evaluated the role of digitalization to optimize organizational bottom line performance. In view of the importance of digitalization-organization bottom line performance, this study empirically evaluates the role of digitalization in the airline performance before and during COVID-19 using the balanced scorecard performance model in the sample study, Emirate airline between 2015 and 2020. Importantly, multiple Pearson Product Moment correlation and descriptive statistics methods were used to estimate the relationship among the balanced scorecards performance. Also, the differential impact was used to show the differential impact and recovery period between before-COVID and during COVID-19 on the balanced scorecards performance. The empirical results showed that the role of digitalization practices is more effective in non-financial bottom lines than financial bottom line at both before and during COVID-19 in this study. Further, the study concluded that digitalization practices before COVID-19 enhances non-financial bottom lines than financial bottom lines whereas the role of digitalization practices during COVID-19 enhances neither financial nor non-financial bottom lines in Emirate airline. Therefore, this study recommends the need for Emirate airline management to further intensify and integrate digitalization practices across all the balanced scorecard bottom lines, especially the financial bottom lines such as revenue, operating cost and net debts to remain immune from current and future external shocks as well as become financial and non-financial sustainable.</jats:p>",

To achieve this objective, a panel model relating to the dependent variable (Earnings quality) and independent variables (Balanced Scorecard components) with the control variable (Firm Size) was estimated, the researchers used financial reports and disclosures of the banks listed on the Palestine Stock Exchange as a tool to collect data, in addition to books, articles, and the previous studies. Descriptive quantitative research design was employed because of the use of quantitative data as proxies for both independent and dependent variables. Panel research strategy was applied for obtaining the cross sectional and longitudinal dimensions. The relationships between the study variables (Earnings quality, BSC components, and Firm Size) were estimated using Eviews version 7 (a statistical software). The results showed statistically significant negative effect of Customer perspective (CUS) on Earnings Quality (EQ); statistically significant positive effect of Internal Business Process perspective (IBP) on Earnings Quality (EQ); and statistically significant positive effect of Firm Size (FS) on Earnings Quality (EQ). In addition, the results showed no statistically significant effect of financial perspective (FP), Social perspective (SP), Learning and Growth perspective (LG), and on Earnings Quality (EQ). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that Earnings Quality of banks listed on Palestine Exchange was not high.</jats:p>"

There is a dearth of studies that have used a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism industry. The impact of COVID-19 on the performance is measured by developing a BSC including; financial, customer, learning and growth, and internal business indicators. This study collects primary data using a questionnaire from 110 tourist accommodation providers. Initially, the reliability and validity of the questionnaires are ensured and conducted the descriptive analysis to measure the impact on the performance.  In addition, due to the lack of normality in the data set of this study, the Kruskal Wallis test was performed to analyze the difference in performance between the number of employees, star ratings, and the number of years in existence. The findings revealed that there is a high-level impact on all performance indicators. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 does not change according to the number of employees and the star rating but there is a difference in financial performance with the number of years in existence. The findings of this study create the BSC to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism industry which adds new knowledge to stakeholder theory. The methodology, findings, and recommendations of the study are academically and professionally significant for a variety of hotel sector firms, the tourist board, and policymakers.</jats:p>"

The government has implemented large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) as an effort to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. With the PSBB, it causes disruption to the hospital supply chain management. As a step to anticipate the hospital's impact on the PSBB, the hospital needs to evaluate the performance of supply chain management. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the performance evaluation of hospital supply chain management using a balanced scorecard approach. A new finding from this study is to measure the performance of hospitals experiencing various disruptions in their supply chain management caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with a balanced scorecard. The author concludes that measurements with the balanced scorecard approach can provide information about the performance of hospital supply chain management broadly in areas experiencing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </jats:p>",

Several types of health problems can hinder the growth process of children under five, one of which is stunting. This study aims to develop a scorecard model for early detection of stunting risk based on stunting factor analysis in the Surabaya City Health Centre work area. The design of this study is conducted in several phases, including the first phase of analyzing risk factors using a case-control design, and the second phase of compiling a scorecard for early detection of stunting risk with a panel of experts. The sample in this study consisted of several mothers and infants, both with and without stunting risk. The sample size is 175 mothers and children under five years of age. The sampling method used was systematic random sampling. The risk factor data were analyzed using the multinomial logistic regression test, and the scorecard was created based on the OR value. The result of this study is the scorecard able to make early detection of stunting risk with a cut-off value is 3.50. It is mean that using the scorecard has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75% to detect the stunting risk of children. The scorecard can be used to determine whether a child is at low or high risk for stunting. This study implies that the scorecard can be used for early detection of stunting risk by mothers, health cadres, and health workers. It is hoped that by using the scorecard, early identification of the risk of stunting can be addressed immediately and interventions can be implemented according to the recommendations and problems that children are experiencing.</jats:p>"

The AMR Scorecard provides laboratories with a technical assessment tool for strengthening the quality of bacterial culture, identification, and antimicrobial testing procedures.Objective: To evaluate the performance of the AMR Scorecard in 11 pilot laboratory evaluations in three countries also assessed with the Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) checklist.Methods: Pilot laboratory evaluations were conducted in Cameroon, Ethiopia and Kenya between February 2019 and March 2019. Assessors with previous SLIPTA and microbiology experience were trained. Assessors performed the laboratory assessments using the SLIPTA and AMR Scorecard tools.Results: Weaknesses in technical procedures and the quality management systems were identified in all areas and all laboratories. Safety had the highest mean performance score (SLIPTA: 68%; AMR Scorecard: 73%) while management review had the lowest (SLIPTA: 32%; AMR Scorecard: 8%) across all laboratories. The AMR Scorecard scores were generally consistent with SLIPTA scores. The AMR Scorecard identified technical weaknesses in AMR testing, and SLIPTA identified weaknesses in the quality management systems in the laboratories.Conclusion: Since the AMR Scorecard identified important gaps in AMR testing not detected by SLIPTA, it is recommended that microbiology laboratories use SLIPTA and the AMR Scorecard in parallel when preparing for accreditation. Expanding the use of the AMR Scorecard is a priority to address the need for quality clinical microbiology laboratory services in support of optimal patient care and AMR surveillance. </jats:p>"
