      "abstract": "<jats:p>Os impactos negativos resultantes da ocorrência de eventos extremos nas cidades têm aumentado cada vez mais nos últimos anos. Por isso é necessário que os gestores locais considerem a Gestão de Desastres como parte de suas atividades, a fim de buscar por uma resposta e uma recuperação eficaz na ocorrência desses eventos. O objetivo principal dessa pesquisa foi analisar a gestão municipal de proteção e defesa civil de União da Vitória quanto à sua atuação nos desastres de inundação, já que esse é o município que apresenta o maior número de registros desse tipo no Estado do Paraná. A metodologia utilizada se baseia na tradução, adaptação e aplicação do indicador global da Organização das Nações Unidas: Scorecard Detalhado de Resiliência a Desastres. Ao todo, foram avaliados 21 itens juntamente com a coordenadoria municipal de proteção e defesa civil e áreas setoriais estratégicas (saúde, educação, meio ambiente, infraestrutura etc.), que permitiram observar o perfil da gestão atual de desastres do município. Como destaques, União da Vitória apresentou uma resposta eficaz na ocorrência de inundações; forte cultura de convivência com as enchentes; novas construções nas áreas de cheias e a comodidade das pessoas em perder todos os bens e batalharem para conseguir tudo outra vez depois das inundações. Concluiu-se que a utilização de indicado­res que avaliam a gestão de desastres dos municípios é essencial para que os gestores possam auto-avaliar suas ações de resposta e recuperação de eventos extremos, encontrando assim, medidas que os auxi­liem a tornar suas cidades cada vez mais resilientes.</jats:p>"

The public has low capability to scrutinise candidates for their knowledge/experience in public health governance. As a result, there is low voting turn-out for elections. So, 3 PHA branches developed scorecards for 2019 candidates. Our aims addressed 3 problems: 1. How to raise public awareness about local DHB elections 2. How to engage voters and provide them with information about candidates from a public health perspective 3.Can we encourage candidates to discuss public health issues/ preventative measures publicly. We hoped to promote democracy by increasing informed voter turnout. Scorecards were based on candidates' responses to a survey with 3 dimensions: alignment with public health values; health sector governance experience; views on a specific public health issue (water fluoridation). Survey responses were scored by panels of branch members. Southern branch sent the survey to 28 DHB candidates across 2 DHBs, and 24 replied in time. Wellington branch sent it to 23 CCDHB candidates and 16 replied in time. Canterbury's response rate was just over 50%, 11 of 21 surveys were returned.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We produced scorecards for results in formats for printing and sharing online. We shared them on PHA's website, social media and featured them in the e-newsletter. Each branch launched them at local Meet the DHB Candidate events where hundreds of paper copies were distributed. There was good online interest in the scorecards: 3453 previews, 287 downloads for further printing/distribution. Many candidates committed, if elected, to policy solutions presented them at our events. There was significant increase (684 in Southern, 698 in Wellington, 2006 in Canterbury) in DHB voter turnout in 2019, compared to last election with no scorecards. Not all top-scoring candidates were subsequently elected onto respective DHBs, but for Wellington and Southland all elected had high scores.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Key messages</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>PHANZ plays a role in supporting NZ democracy by filling a gap in public information about election candidates, whether they are fit for purpose when scrutinised through the public health lens.

Therefore, it was widely adopted in entities in developed and developing countries. As a relatively new form of banks in the banking sector, exploring the extent of implementation of the BSC perspectives in Islamic banks in developing countries, and its impact on their performance will shed the light on the weaknesses and strengths in the strategic planning systems in these banks. Accordingly, these banks could improve their strategic planning systems. To attain that, two integrated questionnaires were designed and distributed to 355 employees and clients in 3 Jordanian Islamic banks (JIBs). The results showed that the extent of implementation of the BSC perspectives in JIBs ranged between 55% - 93%. In addition, the results showed that there is a significance positive relationship between the BSC and the financial performance (ROA/ROE) of JIBs. Accordingly, the researcher recommended JIBs to increase their interest in implementing the BSC perspectives and to create an effective alignment between all perspectives of the BSC.</jats:p>"

To get the variables, authors approached with the synthesizing method or Knowledge Synthesis Method from 25 papers related to the credit scorecard development in SMEs and Agriculture. This study used 5 C’s of credit concept to group related variables and eliminated which are not. It is found that from the five aspects of 5C’s, the character aspect consists of management, relationship, credit history, good corporate governance (GCG), behavior, and innovation. The capacity aspect consists of liquidity, profitability ratio, indebtedness degree, repayment history, activity ratio, financial growth, and expense ratio. The capital aspect consists of one indicator, namely capital structure. The conditioning aspect comprises of external factors of PESTEL, industry, and scope of a region in terms of monitoring. The collateral aspect consists of one indicator, which is a guarantee. All of these indicators will be a basic determinant of variables to appraise credit risk quality of a borrower in the agriculture sector. The limitation of this study is the scope limitation of conducting literature synthesize in particular papers which are related to appraising borrowers who are proposing productive loan, particularly in SMEs and the agriculture sector. The finding of this study will be useful for financial institutions that are responsible for developing assessments for borrower candidates in SMEs or the agriculture sector.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An animal’s action, or inaction, is the direct result of a stockman’s action or inaction. The Stockman’s Scorecard is a novel observation instrument that has been proven to be a valid and reliable tool to measure the quality of beef cattle stockmanship. Specific handler actions have been weighted based on their perceived negative relationship to cattle stress from handling. The purpose of this article is to 1) document the initial use of the scorecard in a beef cattle feedlot setting and 2) provide further support to its validity by establishing an association with other quantitative and qualitative means of evaluating stockmanship. The Scorecard was used at 39 beef feedlots in Texas between March 2018 and April 2019. Eighty-four stockman were observed, and the average score received was 84.5 (SD = 14.73, range = 20 to 100). The most frequent mistakes observed were as follows: fills crowd pen/tub over half full (n = 39), slow to remove pressure (n = 29), uses unnecessary noise (n = 25), stands in front and taps rear (n = 24), and fails to regulate animal flow through a pinch point (n = 22). A strong negative association (ρ = −0.51) was found between the points deducted from the Noise and Physical Contact theme of the Scorecard and the number of animals touched with an electric prod from the BQA Feedyard Assessment. Moderate negative associations were found between the Scorecard final score and the number of animals that vocalize in the chute prior to procedures (ρ = −0.31). Those stockmen that scored above average on the Scorecard were qualitatively observed to be calm and quiet while working with the cattle (Kappa = 0.44). The qualitative disposition of cattle had little effect on the final score of stockmen using the Scorecard (Kappa = 0.17). The use of the Scorecard in a feedlot setting has demonstrated that as stockman scores decrease, there is an increase in the number of negative actions toward cattle and a negative behavioral response of the cattle themselves. Establishment of an association between a stockman’s score using the Stockman’s Scorecard and the animal-based observations from the BQA Feedyard Assessment further strengthens the validity of the Stockman’s Scorecard as a tool to measure the quality of beef cattle stockmanship. The Scorecard has application as a tool to identify specific stockmanship deficiencies in order to target stockmanship training.</jats:p>",

An organisation must formulate a new strategy and find out what parts or departments that should be prioritised to be improved more than others. To be able to formulate the new strategy that is adequate to improve employee performance, the company must be able to identify the source of the main problems that could be obstacles in improving employee performance. This paper presents development of hybrid method between Fuzzy Balanced Scorecard (FBSC) and Performance Prism (PP) to analyse performance of a company. This study took place at a multimedia company with big projects mostly from Indonesia and United States. Result of the study showed that the proposed hybrid method could be used to evaluate the company from 4 perspectives that are customer’s satisfaction, finance, internal business process and learning and growth in PP framework. The fuzzy logic was incorporated in an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to determine weight for every perspective based on experts’ judgement. Result of this study showed that the investigated company has performance score very high that is 9.938, with the lowest score is employee stakeholder factor. With this result, the company would be able to track down the root cause of the problem and an effective strategic plan could be formulated in order to improve employee and overall company performance.</jats:p>",

However, designing and implementing such performance management system has been associated with many challenges like lack of top management support, perception of the process as time-consuming, failure to communicate clear and specific goals and expectations, lack of consistency, etc. (Managing employee performance, 2019). Hence most organizations have been increasingly looking for effective ways of assessing employee performance that can promote stakeholders' satisfaction, employee engagement and continuous improvement.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose - This study aims at developing a framework of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) in public educational organizations.Theoretical framework – There are 3-sections: Strategic planning in public sector, Balanced Scorecard and BSC in the public sector. Strategic management in public administration is an important issue, with the BSC as one of the most widely used tools. Although, the application of this technique in public schools is still unexplored and uncommon, it does possess the potential to improve their effectiveness.Methodology - A 3-stage qualitative approach: (i) 8 semi-structured interviews with the principals of participating schools; (ii) 4 stages of focus groups with 3 of the principals from different schools; and (iii) non-participant observation using a field diary. Also, the data were analyzed through content analysis and cross-referencing the different forms of data collected.Findings - The results do not indicate a vast knowledge concerning the BSC’s techniques and tools, or an alignment between management planning posture, principles nor objectives of BSC application. Also, school planning is realized through the expertise of the Principal, without instruments of strategic management. Finally, adapted BSC models and strategic maps were proposed in public schools to collaborate and facilitate the strategic management process.Research, Practical &amp; Social implications - The paper contributes towards developing new research agendas for strategic management in Brazil, with the possibility of improving public results and to appoint new practices in public schools.Originality/value - We have collaborated with the creation of a tool to use in the strategic planning of primary schools and pushing BSC studies into public sectors.</jats:p>"
