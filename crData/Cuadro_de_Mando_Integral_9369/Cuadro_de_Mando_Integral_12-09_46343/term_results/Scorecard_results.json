      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT:</jats:title><jats:p>This position paper proposes a viable alternative to higher education's current focus on student ratings as the primary metric for summative teaching evaluations (i.e., for personnel decisions). In contrast to the divergent opinions among educational researchers about the validity of student ratings, a strong consensus exists that summative measures derived from the student ratings process represent a necessary rather than a sufficient source for evaluating teaching performance (Cashin 1990; Berk 2005). Accordingly, to more completely describe annual teaching performance, we propose a multisource, multiple-perspective Teaching Balanced Scorecard (TBSC), fashioned from the “classic” Balanced Scorecard developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992a). The TBSC can guide academic administrators to expand their conceptual view of teaching performance beyond the boundaries of the classroom, while coherently communicating the department's teaching expectations to the faculty; consistent with this proposition, we provide supporting evidence from a successful TBSC implementation in an academic department.</jats:p>",

The sales employees of these four firms were selected for empirical testing, since in these firms, emphasis is placed on leadership and on how the employees' job satisfaction is reflected in the reduction of internal process costs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Consistent with earlier predictions, the authors attained significant results, but they did find that group maintenance, group goal achievement behaviors, and their complementarity truly helped enhance employee job satisfaction. This suggests that group maintenance and group goal achievement behaviors, including their complementarity, will provide a more accurate prediction of the relation between intrinsic and extrinsic components of employee job satisfaction and achieving the objective of an internal business advantage.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Only four firms have been examined in this study. It would be worthwhile to see whether the inclusion of other firms would show similar results. When these four firms are placed in a dynamic environment, TL is a key source for providing an internal business advantage: employee capability to react positively to change provides a very important advantage. Although the integration of both TL and change‐oriented action by the TL and employees to provide employee job satisfaction has not been tested before, it would be useful for future researchers and practitioners to do so.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper is of both theoretical and empirical value. Theoretically, it has tried to make use of the business perspective of the BSC. Empirically, this paper has demonstrated the influence of TL in gaining an internal business advantage. There is a dearth of research on how firms successfully integrate the business perspective of the BSC to gain an internal business advantage. The paper investigated the effects on intrinsic and extrinsic components of employee job satisfaction of group direct behaviors as motivated by transformational leadership (TL), including examining group maintenance, group goal achievement, and the interaction between the two (their complementarity).</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Indicators are minimal gauges that convey the state of a single data value at a glance, and most are used to represent the state of Key Performance Indicators. Manage and harmonize the performance of an institution's educational institutions, especially universities with the performance of individuals or resources, no doubt is one of the essential elements for the success of an entity of the institution. Integrate the performance of an educational institution with individual performance is not an easy process, and therefore required a systematic approach to manage it. Implementation of a strategic management system based Balanced Scorecard can be used as a performance measurement system that will continuously monitor the successful implementation of the strategy of any public educational institution and measure the performance of its resources in a comprehensive and balanced, not the quantity but the emphasis is more concerned with the quality, so the performance of educational institutions at any time can be known clearly. Contribution of Key Performance Indicators to manage and harmonize the performance of any public institution is a solution in providing information to realize the extent of work that has set targets, identify and monitor measures of success, of course, with performance indicators show a clear, specific and measurable.</jats:p>"

This study surveyed entry-level employees and those working in section-chief or higher-level positions at Taiwan-listed LED manufacturers’ production, marketing, human recourse, research and development (R&amp;D) and finance departments. Samples were selected from the population by simple random sampling. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was adopted to verify the goodness-of-fit effects of the overall model, structural model, and measurement model, with the models’ path effects (of the mediator-moderator variable) tested by way of the General Path Analytic Approach (GPAA) and Control Non-Linear Regression (CNLR). The results indicated that the BSC implementation, intellectual-capital accumulation and organizational commitment exert a significant interaction effect on Taiwan-listed LED manufacturers’ organizational performance. Hence, organizational commitment has the moderating effect (only among first-order constructs); intellectual-capital accumulation has no more than a mediating effect and remains un-moderated (among second-order constructs). However, the indirect effect of intellectual capital proved moderated, with the direct effect un-moderated and the total effect moderated.</jats:p>"

A população da pesquisa compreende as empresas listadas nas revistas Valor 1000 e Exame Maiores e Melhores, e, para a amostra, as empresas de capital aberto listadas nas duas revistas, correspondendo a 169 empresas. Na sondagem realizada para saber se a empresa utiliza ou não o BSC, das 169 empresas contatadas, 65 responderam e 104 não responderam ao questionamento. Das 65 respondentes, 19 utilizam e 46 não utilizam o BSC. Os índices financeiros foram extraídos das demonstrações contábeis e os não financeiros dos relatórios da administração e notas explicativas. Foram selecionados três indicadores financeiros e, para as perspectivas não financeiras, no caso das empresas com BSC, por meio da análise de conteúdo, identificaram-se indicadores que caracterizam as perspectivas do cliente, processos internos e aprendizado e crescimento. Para análise dos resultados das empresas antes e após a implantação do BSC, hipóteses foram levantadas para os indicadores que apresentaram coeficiente de correlação mais expressivo. O teste unicaudal indicou maior correlação nos indicadores da perspectiva aprendizado e crescimento e menor nas perspectivas do cliente e processos internos. Ainda que as evidências não sejam plenas, conclui-se que há diferença na rentabilidade de empresas que utilizam indicadores de desempenho financeiros e não financeiros comparativamente as que somente utilizam indicadores de desempenho financeiros. </jats:p>"
