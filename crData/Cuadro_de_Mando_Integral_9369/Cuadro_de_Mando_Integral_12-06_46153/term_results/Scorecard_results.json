      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>The use of a balanced scorecard (BSC) for performance evaluation is meant to help evaluators make more complete decisions, as they have a variety of financial and non‐financial measures to assess. The problem is that users have difficulty taking all of the measures into consideration. The tendency to place more weight on common measures (measures that are the same across divisions) while either ignoring or placing very little weight on unique measures (measures are unique to a particular division) has become known as a “common measures bias”. The purpose of this paper is to extend a line of research that works to understand how this common measures bias might be mitigated.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This study examines whether the presence of task property feedback, a form of cognitive feedback, prior to a performance evaluation task, can help evaluators overcome the tendency to rely primarily on common measures. This study used a 2×2 experimental design where subjects were asked to evaluate the performance of two managers under either feedback or non‐feedback conditions. In the feedback condition, subjects were provided with their supervisor's suggestions about performance evaluation in the use of BSCs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>This study finds that when subjects were given task property feedback, a form of cognitive feedback, they tended to use more unique measures than if they were not given any feedback information at all.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>In practice, more straight forward and simple feedback information is likely easier for companies to implement and easier for evaluators to follow. Feedback information that is too complex or that requires too much effort may frustrate evaluators, at which point they may abandon the effort. The authors' findings also indicate that direct and clear guidance from the top manager of a business may be seen as pressure by lower‐level managers. It is important for top managers to create such a performance evaluation environment so that all BSC measures are considered.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper finds that when evaluators judge the performance of managers through the use of a BSC, they tend to weight common measures more heavily than they do unique measures, unless they are provided cognitive feedback to cue them into the importance of using all measures. This study is one of many, following LS (2000), documenting a finding of common measures bias in the use of BSCs. Where this study contributes to the literature is in the use of task property feedback, a form of cognitive feedback, to overcome this bias. Since the use of unique measures is a key attribute of BSCs as they help users capture the nuances of a specific division's or firm's strategy, it is crucial that performance evaluators pay careful attention to them.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Pri izboru softverskog paketa za BSC treba imati u vidu da BSCCol (Balanced Scorecard Colaborative) certifikuje samo one softverske pakete koji zadovoljavaju Kaplan-Nortonova ograničenja. Imajući u vidu da je broj raspoloživih softvera na tržištu ogroman, za implementaciju BSC-a neophodno je izvršiti sistemske analize kako bi se za konkretnu organizaciju izabralo najpogodnije rešenje. Standardom ISO/IEC 9126-1 koji se koristi za ocenu kvaliteta softvera neophodno je ispuniti sledeće kriterijume i to: funkcionalnost, pouzdanost, efikasnost, održavanje, portabilnost, upotrebljivost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a staggering decline in the capitalization of intellectual property (IP) and low levels of investment in R&amp;D, particularly with respect to emerging nations within the global IP environment, which limits accelerated industrial growth. In most emerging markets, this necessitates that management address multiple competencies better, that exploit organizational resources, knowledge, and management ability, to adapt faster than the competition. Our research offers a management model to address this management challenge strategically. </jats:p><jats:p> This research also indicates that IP as a value creation mechanism is currently not a top management priority although investors increasingly look toward good IP management as an indicator of future organizational growth. The research presents the IP Scorecard, a further inductive development of Kaplan and Norton's traditional Balanced Scorecard. The IP Scorecard is a strategic management tool that enables management to drive a robust industrial growth strategy that is explicitly positioned within the knowledge economy, identifying target areas for organizational development around knowledge and IP management, in order to achieve the competitive higher-ground, by strategically creating and capitalizing on value arising from innovation and R&amp;D activities. </jats:p><jats:p> The IP Scorecard sensitizes management on where and how to carve out competitive turf, particularly from a knowledge and IP value creation perspective, seeking ultimately to enhance corporate/shareholder and product-life-cycle value. The paper encompasses limited field research findings on key IP-related strategic management considerations that promote leadership in innovation and R&amp;D, across the product life cycle. </jats:p>",
