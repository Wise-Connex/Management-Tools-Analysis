      "abstract": "<p>Vietnam is well known as a country in successful transition to a market economy with a high concentration of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs contributed significantly to overcoming the “shocks” associated with the transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy with the collapse of the socialist bloc in Eastern Europe. Although they are major contributors to Vietnamese socio-economic success, SMEs in Vietnam have to deal with many difficulties in their survival and development. To solve these problems, SMEs need to understand how their business is operating, identify where improvements should be made, and have a clear strategic planning process. Applying a performance measurement system provides SMEs with a more complete view of an organization through the different measures and perspectives that link together and enable the development of a dynamic system that monitors both internal and external contexts and supports the organization’s objectives. The Balanced Scorecard introduced by Kaplan and Norton in 1992 is a relevant tool that provides SMEs with a framework for dealing with today’s business environment. There have been extensive calls for research into the use of the Balanced Scorecard by SMEs in different national contexts.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>This case study determines the value of student athletic programs at Canadian universities, using Vancouver Island University (VIU) as a reference case. First, the study compares Canadian varsity athletics to American collegiate athletics to consider the relative economic value of collegiate athletics between the two countries. Second, the study assesses graduation rates and retention of student athletes in Canadian varsity programs as an indicator of the academic value of these programs. Graduation rates and ten-year trends were found using data retrieved from VIU records of past athletes and the credentials they received. Finally, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) strategy was also employed to explore ways for institutions to create more value for their athletic departments. The BSC strategy focuses on four main pillars of business that have unique objectives and measures to ensure goals are completed. These strategies can be used to create value by reliably predicting outcomes. Value can be perceived in several non-financial ways from an institutional standpoint, including student success, athletic reputation, or pride in school culture among students and staff. Using the BSC could help Canadian collegiate athletic programs overcome the many barriers that stand in the way of sustainable operations. In this case study, we discovered that, with the overwhelming difference in resources between the US and Canada, Canadian varsity athletics may need to find new ways to engage stakeholders after a year of low activity due to the pandemic. Moreover, results of the graduation data indicate that VIU, the test institution, has had a dramatic incline in academic success since 2016 and that the strategies that have been set in place have fostered a more nurturing educational environment for its athletes. It will be important to continue this type of research among all institutions in the U-Sport/Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) to refresh the current systems in place that yield little return on investment (ROI) for stakeholders. With the suggested strategies in this case study, user groups and stakeholders should see noticeable improvement from four different perspectives: internal, external, financial, and innovation/learning and growth. The BSC is a great tool because it does not require a massive modification of operations. It is a cost-effective solution to scoping in on one area of need at a time if necessary. The information gained may be incredibly useful for determining how to improve one’s athletic department.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"VIU logo.jpg\">\n              <jats:alt-text>VIU logo</jats:alt-text>\n            </jats:inline-graphic>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"WLCE logo.jpg\">\n              <jats:alt-text>WLCE logo</jats:alt-text>\n            </jats:inline-graphic>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Information</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Vancouver Island University World Leisure Centre of Excellence</jats:p>\n            <jats:p>© R.E.R.

The author studied the way in which two factors that are representative of institutional pressures in the real estate sector – namely, “ecology” and “digital innovation” – were incorporated into the BSC causal chains.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The author’s methodology is that of action research. To analyze the balance of indicators between short and long term, the author classified the companies according to their strategic acuity, i.e. their ability to balance an organizational vision (near vision) and an environmental one (distance vision) when choosing their performance indicators. This resulted in a company classification with three categories: emmetropic, hypermetropic and slightly myopic.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This research enabled to observe that the selected ecological indicators in BSCs derive mainly from coercive institutional pressure. Hence, in companies with fewer legal requirements in ecological matters, the selected ecological indicators are included in the BSC causal chain, in that they are used as a commercial argument with a view to improving financial performance. These results are similar to the reactionary and reputational perspectives of the sustainability business case. With regard to the incorporation of digital innovation indicators into BSCs, the author found that the companies that have the most digital innovation indicators are those that mobilize the most ecological indicators. Digital innovation indicators are part of the companies’ internal process perspective and are linked to organizational learning indicators. These results are similar to the responsible and collaborative perspectives of the sustainability business case. The author also found that the companies incorporate digital indicators into their BSCs by institutional mimicry insofar as the selected indicators are not always consistent with a strategic rationale but are chosen by copying what is done in other companies.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The author’s research has two main limitations related to the methodology used. On the one hand, the mobilization of part-time management students to have access to companies can influence the emergence of mimetic isomorphisms. Indeed, these students follow the same training and advise the companies that welcome them according to the training they have followed. On the other hand, the author’s research stops at the development of the BSC. The author does not study the impacts or changes that occurred after the implementation of the tool. This could be the subject of future research on the appropriation and use of the BSC by the company’s actors and their impact on the optimization of global performance measurement system.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study may be of interest to researchers and managers who wish to reconcile sustainable development and digital innovation in global performance management.

It responds to a preoccupation of recent years in academic research on how to reconcile corporate social responsibility and technological innovation.

A five-point Likert scale questionnaire and structured interview were used as a data collection tool. The questionnaire was administered to employees and an interview was held with leaders. The findings of the study generally indicate that the contribution of a balanced scorecard in measuring service performance in land management is minimal because performance indicators are poorly designed, standards are unrealistic, which ignores the nature of the service, and performance data is not properly recorded. Finally, the study presented some recommendations, including redesigning the scorecard, setting realistic time standards, allocating adequate resources, strengthening training and awareness programs, and strong leadership support and commitment.\nKeywords: Balanced Scorecard; land management; performance.</jats:p>"

However, existing diagnostic tools employ broad indicators, neglecting the detailed assessment of the policy, legal and institutional frameworks for each step along the FSM chain. This paper presents a web-based integrated diagnostic tool for evaluating the quality and adequacy of policy in guiding equity, targeting of resources, quality of service, financial considerations and institutional roles and responsibilities. The tool evaluates the legal framework based on laws, standards and regulations emphasizing on means of enforcement. It evaluates the institutional framework based on investors, service providers, regulators and consumers as guided by the literature. Each indicator is assigned a score of 1: green (effective), 0.5: yellow (limited) and 0: red (poor) for the user interface, containment, emptying, transport, treatment, disposal and reuse of faecal sludge. Built on Laravel Framework Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), the tool links the scores into a single index averaged into terciles as 0–0.33 (poor), 0.34–0.66 (limited) and 0.67–1 (effective). This helps to identify areas of priority in a given context. The tool successfully facilitated a participatory pilot study in Kenya based on individual stakeholders' opinion. However, the tool does not provide the specific details leading to a given score. Therefore, its application should precede a detailed evaluation of each indicator in order to generate specific details per indicator per step of FSM.</jats:p>",

The results from the customer's perspective are rated poorly. This can be seen from the acquisition of new customers every year which always decreases and the expected target is not achieved. performance measurement results from the perspective of internal business processes are generally considered poor. This can be seen from the innovations that are developed every year. Outcomes from a learning and growth perspective are considered poor. This can be seen from the decline in profitability and employee productivity from year to year which is not as expected. Although the employee satisfaction score of 88.4% is considered good or positive, it is necessary to evaluate the level of satisfaction in terms of organizational culture and leadership which gets the highest negative score.

O objetivo é atualizar o lastro téorico da contribuição do Balanced Scorecard (BSC) para o alinhamento estratégico organizacional por meio de uma RSL adaptada para estudos baseados em Design Science Research (DSR). Foi utilizada a RSL adaptada para pesquisas que utilizem a DSR, metodologia baseada em Design Science e que apresenta aplicabilidade mais adequada para solução de problemas organizacionais. Nesse estudo, verificou-se que o BSC contribui para o alinhamento estratégico especialmente em relação à capacidade de comunicação das prioridades estratégicas, tradução e operacionalização dos objetivos estratégicos, bem como o balanceamento e alinhamento entre áreas e departamentos em prol de um objetivo comum. Além disso, observou-se seu papel na influência motivacional, conscientização e comportamento dos colaboradores, além da possibilidade de utilização conjunta com a lógica fuzzy para tradução de imprecisões e vagueza associadas ao pensamento humano na tomada de decisões. A RSL realizada por apenas uma pessoa em vez de uma equipe de pesquisadores e artigos revisados são de natureza ontológica e epistemológica diferentes, o que pode limitar sua comparabilidade, em consideração da vagueza e imprecisão do pensamento humano em processos de tomada de decisão (lógica fuzzy), influência do BSC na coordenação de colaboradores por meio do encorajamento de sua motivação, bem como comunicação de prioridades estratégicas e estabelecimento de consciência de responsabilidade organizacional. Nesse contexto, foi obtido um profundamento da discussão sobre o alinhamento estratégico proporcionado pelo sistema de medição de desempenho BSC, ainda amplamente utilizado, e cuja abordagem carece de atualização por já ter quase trinta anos de existência, bem como a incorporação do conceito fuzzy para resolução de problemas organizacionais.\nPalavras-Chave: Estratégia; Alinhamento; Balanced Scorecard; Design Science Research.</jats:p>"

Public discourse about the practical and ethical implications of AI has mainly focussed on the societal level. There is an emerging knowledge base on AI risks to human rights around data security and privacy concerns. A separate strand of work has highlighted the stresses of working in the gig economy. This prevailing focus on human rights and gig impacts has been at the expense of a closer look at how AI may be reshaping traditional workplace relations and, more specifically, workplace health and safety. To address this gap, we outline a conceptual model for developing an AI Work Health and Safety (WHS) Scorecard as a tool to assess and manage the potential risks and hazards to workers resulting from AI use in a workplace. A qualitative, practice-led research study of AI adopters was used to generate and test a novel list of potential AI risks to worker health and safety. Risks were identified after cross-referencing Australian AI Ethics Principles and Principles of Good Work Design with AI ideation, design and implementation stages captured by the AI Canvas, a framework otherwise used for assessing the commercial potential of AI to a business. The unique contribution of this research is the development of a novel matrix itemising currently known or anticipated risks to the WHS and ethical aspects at each AI adoption stage.</jats:p>",

One of these crucial elements is the implementation of organizational changes. There has been a wide-spread adoption of AI techniques in the private sector, whereas in the public sector their use has been recently extended. One of the greatest challenges that European governments have to face is the implementation of a wide variety of European Union (EU) funding programs which have evolved in the context of the EU long-term budget. In the current study, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are intertwined with forecasting the outcomes of a co-financed EU program by means of its impact on the non-financial measures of the government body that materialized it. The predictive accuracy of the present model advanced in this research study takes into account all the complexities of the business environment, within which the provided dataset is produced. The outcomes of the study showed that the measures taken to enhance customer satisfaction allows for further improvement. The utilization of the proposed model could facilitate the decision-making process and initiate changes to the administrational issues of the available funding programs.</jats:p>"

However, current research still lacks a holistic and systemic approach for measuring building retrofitting. The paper presents the results of a systematic literature review on the current state‐of‐the‐art of retrofit measures and their related KPIs for buildings, with the aim to develop a comprehensive and integrated scorecard. In particular, the paper considers several perspectives of building retrofitting, spanning from the areas of sustainability performance to measurement systems in the building industry, and presents and discusses a multidimensional scorecard of KPIs that clusters—from an economic, environmental, and social perspective—the current state‐of‐the‐art of retrofit measures on buildings.

The lag of indicators used by PP. Kecap Maja Menjangan is a net profit/loss margin and sales growth rate and a level of customer satisfaction index regarding the quality, price, and reputation of the product from the customer perspective. The internal business process is measured through revenue per cost (R/C) growth and the proportion of new product revenue to TR, while the level of employee satisfaction is measured through initiatives, risk tolerance, direction, integration, supervision, identity and motivation, and reward system as the lag indicator for learning and growth. The final score of 72,91 percent indicates the good overall performance of the company (although not optimal). The company performed well on all three non-financial perspectives marked by achievements above 75 percent. While the achievement of a financial perspective that showed below average results in this research period indicates the influence of external factors outside the analysis (such as the increase in the price of raw materials and fuel) that indirectly affect financial performance. Implementation of BSC plan on PP. Kecap Maja Menjangan could be done with the following stages: (1) Review of BSC design, (2) communicate the design and setting individual objectives, (3) strengthen the annual plan and budget, and (4) conduct monthly evaluations. The failure and success of BSC implementation should be viewed positively</jats:p>",
