In this paper, we analyse whether a technique used in Management Accounting Systems (MAS), known as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), represents a bureaucratic order. We propose the following set of concepts to identify a bureaucratic order: authority, jurisdiction, professional qualiﬁcations, knowledge, rationality, discipline, accountability, systematization and transparency. We discuss the presence of such a set of concepts in the design and implementation of the BSC and conclude that the BSC is an example of a neo-bureaucratic order.

Pada STIMIK Sepuluh Nopember Jayapura terdapat masalah dalam hal belum menyadari pentingnya untuk meningkatkan efisiensi biaya. Sehingga perlu dilakukan pengukuran untuk mengetahui tingkat kematangan lembaga dalam hal pengelolaan efisiensi biaya. Tata kelola TI sangat dibutuhkan untuk mengetahui sejauh mana pemanfaatan TI demi tercapaianya visi dan misi lembaga. Salah satu proses penting dalam penerapan tata kelola TI adalah melakukan evaluasi untuk mengetahui sejauh mana institusi menerapkan tata kelola yang baik. Penelitian ini menjelaskan bagaimana lembaga pendidikan dapat meningkatkan efisiensi biaya dan kontribusinya terhadap profitabilitas bisnis.

This model combines a balanced scorecard (BSC) with a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytical network process (ANP). After the arrangement and classification of perspectives and indicators from a literature review, the strategy map of the BSC is designed with DEMATEL. Furthermore, this study used a survey with in-depth interviews of seven expert respondents to make a pair-wise comparison between perspectives and indicators in order to determine the weights of indicators, perspectives, and sustainability aspects on ANP. The study finds the following. First, the innovation and learning perspective that reflects intangible assets has the most influence on the others but is not important, while the customer perspective has the most importance for SHSC performance. Second, the economic aspect has the greatest weight, followed by social and environmental aspects. Finally, indicators of the financial and customer perspectives as drivers of SHSC performance consist of profit, quality of service, revenue, customer satisfaction, and stakeholder satisfaction. Further, indicators of the economic aspect of sustainability have the most effect on SHSC performance, followed by social and environmental aspects. Furthermore, human resources, as an intangible asset and key factor in social aspects, are main factor in improving SHSC performance.</jats:p>"

The results of the survey with the balanced scorecard approach show that the performance of PT. Natra Raya is good with an index number of 103.4% (green code). The balanced scorecard method shows that the performance of PT. Natra Raya cannot only be measured in a limited way. This method can show that there are parts of the indicator that need special attention, namely KPIs with poor performance evaluation results shown in the sub-KPI of employee capability due to the KPI's focus on resources getting a bad score. The sub-KPI, when completing the project, gets a poor performance evaluation result, but outside of the three sub-KPIs, the results of PT. Natra Raya is good and very good.</jats:p>"

This note proposes a model that bridges the strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) literature – which is one of the most widely recognized strategic performance evaluation approaches intended to foster organizational alignment by translating the firm's strategy into a multidimensional set of financial and non‐financial measures. After having briefly discussed the main differences between the return on investment (ROI) model, which represents one of the major attempt to make training strategic within the existing evaluation research, and the BSC model applied to training management, this note highlights multiple forms of strategic training fit and suggests how to manage training through various scenarios of BSC development. Specifically, the note illustrates four forms of strategic fit – the vertical fit, the horizontal inter‐functional fit, the horizontal intra‐functional fit and the human capital readiness – and discusses their pursuit in terms of six scenarios of training management through the BSC. The note expands some exploratory empirical evidence on the feasibility and usefulness of training scorecards (i.e. the application of the BSC to training) in order to develop some theoretical insights and practical guidance on how they can be leveraged to foster the strategic alignment of training.</jats:p>",

Indeed, this paper presents a case study to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Second, quantitative targets have been determined to help in achieving the long-term goals. This task has been accomplished through a combination of SES, the three-stage least squares regression analysis and optimization by using weighted goal programming method.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Integrating the strategies of various units adds a new dimension that differs from rationalizing the superior’s and the subordinate’s goals. The proposed model considers input from all value chain functional managers involved in implementing an organizational strategy. A methodology is provided to operationalize (Hope and Fraser, 2003) beyond the budgeting model principles.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the labor market consequences of attending a Historically Black College/University (HBCU). With 2015 U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard Data, we use a matching estimator to identify and estimate the treatment effect of HBCU attendance on median earnings, earnings relative to a high school graduate, and income relative to that of the household at the time of initial enrollment, 6 and 10 years after attendance. Our treatment effect parameter estimates suggest that once we account for the differential return to college majors, the urban wage premium, and the proportionality/dependence of the labor market return of Black student college attendees on the share of a college/university’s student population that is Black, there is a long-run earnings premium associated with HBCU attendance. In addition, for HBCUs in general, we find that there is a population of students who would realize a positive labor market premium—as high as approximately 42%—and earn more than a high school graduate if they were to attend an HBCU. With respect to intergenerational income mobility, we find that HBCU attendance enables their actual and potential attendees to move to a higher quantile of income relative to their households in the long run. </jats:p>",
