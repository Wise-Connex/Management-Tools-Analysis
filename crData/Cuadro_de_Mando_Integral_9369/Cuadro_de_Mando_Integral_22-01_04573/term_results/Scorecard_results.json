Penelitian ini adalah penelitian yang menggunakan metode deskriptif. Hasil dari penelitian ini menyarankan bahwa perusahaan sebaiknya menerapkan pengukuran berbasis balanced scorecard agar perusahaan dapat mengetahui sasaran yang akan dicapai kedepannya. Sehingga tidak hanya dilihat dari sisi keuangan saja.Dalam hal ini penulis mengambil sampel data dari setahun terakhir dari bulan september 2020 samapai Agustus 2021. Dari hasil pengukuran yang dilakukan dapat disimpulkan bahwa kinerja PT magnesium Gosari Internasional baik ini terlihat dari nilai score yang didapat dari masing-masing perspektif balanced scorecard. Kesimpulan yang dapat diambil melalui analisis yang sudah dilakukan adalah bahwa Balanced Scorecard merupakan metode yang terbaik dalam melakukan penilaian terhadap kinerja perusahaan, karena Balanced Scorecard mengangkat aspek-aspek penting yang diabaikan oleh pengukuran kinerja secara tradisional, seperti aspek sumber daya manusia, sistem yang digunakan dalam perusahaan, proses operasional, dan aspek kepuasan pelanggan, sehingga hasil pengukuran dengan Balanced Scorecard akan lebih akurat.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Comparing diversified agri-environmental (AE) collective schemes in their capability to provide AE public goods faces great challenges, mostly because of their diversified nature and relatively new way to approach the provision of AE public goods. The state of the art is that there are not yet any common quantitative indicators or data to build a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to compare it with other practices and to set the strategic plan for the scheme’s improvement. Nevertheless, some qualitative common data of SWOT analyses are available, but the question remains how to simultaneously compare several SWOT analyses in an MCDM model. This study introduces a new way of transforming the qualitative results of SWOT analyses to fit in the MCDM Decision Expert (DEX) model using a special transformation technique SWOT scorecard. The SWOT scorecard evaluates the importance of qualitative results of several SWOT analyses simultaneously in a quantitative way, describing with points how supportive the environment is to each criterion in the DEX model. The SWOT scorecard keeps track of the original results from SWOT analysis and considers the diversity of AE schemes, which results in an appearance of the convergence points. This gives a key for comparing the AE collective schemes in providing AE public goods. Furthermore, it gives a solution for discussing the synergy between aspects that affect AE public goods provision for every AE scheme investigated. The technique is tested via five AE collective schemes in the DEXi program and gives deeper insight into factors that affect each scheme’s performance.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the study applies mainly the method of scientific literature synthesis and compares studies carried out in various Central and Eastern European countries. They are related to the use of the Balanced Scorecard performance measurement method applied in stock companies. In parallel, the perspectives of key stakeholders are also reviewed based on their published reporting practices. The comparison shows that the Balanced Scorecard method is really suitable for external users. Important information, measures and performance indicators can be reported and analysed using the company’s annual reports.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pengukuran kinerja tradisional yang lebih menitikberatkan pada sisi keuangan dan manajemen yang berorientasi pada keuntungan jangka pendek mulai dipertanyakan kekuatannya. Disadari bahwa pengukuran kinerja tradisional mempunyai keterbatasan yaitu tidak mampu mengukur kinerja harta-harta tidak berwujud (intangible asset) dan harga-harga intelektual (sumber daya) perusahaan. Untuk itu diperlukan suatu mekanisme dalam mengimplementasikan strategi baru tersebut agar dapat berjalan dengan baik. BSC memiliki keistimewaan dalam hal cakupan pengukuran yang cukup komprehensif, dimana selain mempertimbangkan kinerja finansial (tolak ukur keuangan), juga mempertimbangkan kinerja non-finansialnya (tolak ukur operasional). Informasi nonfinansial merupakan salah satu faktor kunci untuk menetapkan strategi yang dipilih guna pelaksanaan tujuan yang telah ditetapkan. Hal ini dapat dihubungkan dengan informasi finansial dalam merancang sistem pengukuran kinerja. Informasi ini hanya untuk meningkatkan pelaksanaan operasi perusahaan dan kinerja organisasi agar lebih berhasilInformasi nonfinasial menjadi sesuatu yang penting untuk menghasilkan informasi kinerja perusahaan. BSC adalah alat perencanaan strategik yang sangat berdaya untuk meningkatkan kemampuan organisasi dalam melipatgandakan kinerja keuangan berkesinambungan. Implementasi BSC sebagai alat perencanaan strategik pada hakikatnya menuntut perubahan secara radikal gaya manajemen (management style) yang meliputi perubahan alat (toolset), perubahan pengetahuan manajemen (skillset) dan pergeseran sikap mental (mindset).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is one of the best-known strategic planning and evaluation tools that uses both monetary and non-monetary data. This paper focuses on empirically testing whether the four dimensions of the BSC predicts organizational performance of Ghanaian public universities. The study adopted a cross-sectional, descriptive survey design and the primary sources of data was gathered through hand-administered structured questionnaires from both academic and administrative staff of 10 accredited public universities in Ghana. The study also employed structural Equation Model (SEM) with SmartPLS to analyze 134 samples. Results of the boostrapping method for the structural model and the t-values of the four dimensions of the BSC were significantly and statistically different from each other, but all showed a positive relation on perceived organizational performance. The results showed that non-financial measures have better outcomes for employees’ performances which corroborates the central proposition of the Balanced Scorecard. It is recommended that public universities that want to maintain and improve organizational performance must pay attention to the customers’ perspective by providing relevant and high-quality education that acquaints students with knowledge and transferable basic skills and also identify opportunities for special initiatives, collaborative partnerships, and accountability to constituents.</jats:p>"

As the O&amp;G industry has a key role in many countries, its evaluation of performance is crucial. We utilize BSC for this purpose considering the traditional financial, customer-oriented, internal, and learning-oriented and growth perspectives and adding the social responsibility perspective.  As it is usually not possible to implement all found performance indicators, we use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods for prioritizing them. We employ the Best-Worst Method (BWM) which has several advantages compared to other MCDM methods. Due to uncertainties in the considered decision-making environment, we use hesitant fuzzy sets as a suitable method. Our results indicate that among the considered five perspectives of BSC, the customer and internal process perspectives are the most important ones, and the cost of R&amp;D indicator is the most important sub-criterion.</jats:p>",

On the basis of pointing out the specific problems and deficiencies existing in the enterprise, suggestions for improving the performance level of the enterprise are put forward. Then, a detailed analysis of the performance evaluation of Company A is carried out. Through the analysis of various aspects of Company A’s performance, the problems and deficiencies in its performance evaluation are found. According to the specific problems of Company A, a performance evaluation system is designed based on the balanced scorecard. The Balanced Scorecard is a management tool for measuring performance in multiple dimensions. Starting from multiple aspects, scientifically combining strategic objectives with multiple dimensions, this management method not only is suitable for the current market environment, but also improves the company’s internal management system. Through the investigation of the company’s performance management, it is found that there is a problem in the company’s performance management. In view of the existing problems, the Balanced Scorecard of management accounting is used as a management tool to design a feasible performance appraisal plan for the company from the four dimensions of finance, customer, internal process, and learning and growth. Recommendations for full participation can be made for its implementation. The results show that the comprehensive score of Company A’s performance in 2022 is 70 points. It can be seen from the evaluation results that the financial performance evaluation level of the company is average. The company’s customer performance levels are average as well. The internal operation level of the enterprise is at a high level. The level of learning and growth performance of the business is very good. At the same time, according to the reliability test standard, the reliability coefficient of the questionnaire is 0.866, indicating that the reliability is acceptable.</jats:p>",

However, it is worth noting that many of the studies reflected a high RoB, which may have affected the impacts on the three primary outcomes measured. As such, this systematic review reflects the necessity for further focus on this area in the future. Moreover, future research is encouraged to measure the real and current impact of implementing BSC in HCO during the pandemic since we did not find any.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

To achieve the research objective a qualitative approach is used. The research data were gathered by conducting 12 semi-structured interviews with the managers and senior staff of 10 banks working in Sudan. The findings of this research demonstrated that the major barriers of the BSC implementation in the Sudanese banking sector are as follows: absence of top management motivation and commitment, lack of awareness, lack of training, the high cost of the BSC implementation, the claim of current system sufficiency, difficulties in measuring BSC perspectives, and insufficient IT support. The findings suggest that the top management of the banking sector should be encouraged by the Central Bank of Sudan to consider using the BSC as a priority and include it within their strategic plans, initiate budgets and other resources for better BSC implementation (Gowindasamy &amp; Jantan, 2018). This study contributes to the literature and practice in the field of management accounting by outlining the barriers to implementing the BSC in the banking sector located in a developing African country. The information obtained can enhance our understanding of BSC implantation in emerging economies.</jats:p>"

In non-profit organizations, financial and cost indicators have relatively less weight in the BSC. Indicators related to the quality of human resource management occupy a priority place in the BSC. The article analyzes the balanced scorecard in relation to two organizations: the Presidential Grants Fund and the Kursk Institute of Management, Economics and Business. The article analyzes examples of the use of the BSC in the Presidential Grants Fund, the use of the BSC in the process of accounting for the scientific and methodological activity of the departments based on the individual report of the teachers of the Kursk Institute of Management, Economics and Business. Taking into account the peculiarities of scientific and educational public unions, the authors propose a model for organizing a balanced scorecard system in this new and promising form of organizing non-profit activities. The transition to the BSC will improve productivity and performance indicators in scientific and educational unions, as well as find a balance in solving the \"efficiency-fairness\" dilemma in the process of human resource management. For the activities of relatively large non-profit organizations, such as a scientific and educational public union, the effect of the introduction of the BSC will bring a significant increase in efficiency and effectiveness in the work of the organization.</jats:p>"

An urgent issue is how to integrate sustainability strategy-related goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) into performance evaluation and compensation systems, and how to integrate employees’ awareness of environmental protection and social contribution into their daily work. This study examines management tools that can link sustainability strategies with sustainability performance evaluation and compensation systems. Specifically, the balanced scorecard (BSC) is positioned as a management tool for measuring, evaluating, and managing sustainability performance, with a particular focus on the sustainability balanced scorecard (SBSC), which incorporates economic, environmental, and social factors. The purpose of this study is to clarify the role of sustainability performance assessment and management in sustainability management based on previous studies and cases of advanced companies that have introduced SBSC, such as the Generali Group, and to systematically evaluate the functions and usefulness of SBSC as a sustainability performance assessment and management tool. The findings indicate that the SBSC is an effective management tool for improving sustainability performance and implementing sustainability strategies</jats:p>"

Since this paper focuses on banks as representatives of specific,\n   modern financial organizations, the subject of research is to examine the\n   possibility of applying this model in the analysis of banking performance.\n   The aim of the research is to analyze, by using the qualitative methodology\n   (review of existing papers in the literature), whether the BSC model is\n   applicable for the analysis of banking performances; and then, by using the\n   quantitative methodology, through connecting two perspectives of the same\n   model (perspective of internal business processes and perspective of\n   customers), to examine how the determinants of TAM model (perceived\n   usefulness, ease of use) and determinants of SERVQUAL model (perceived\n   security and privacy, responsibility) affect electronic banking customer\n   satisfaction. The empirical research was conducted through the survey method\n   on the territory of the Republic of Serbia at the end of 2020, and the\n   sample included 324 respondents.
