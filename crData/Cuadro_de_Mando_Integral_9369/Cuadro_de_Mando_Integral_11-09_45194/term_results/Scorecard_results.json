Research has revealed that the term “balanced scorecard” may be understood differently by managers both within as well as across organizations implying that the performance measurement systems implemented in organizations may not be similar to the construct envisioned by Kaplan and Norton. Using Kaplan and Norton's Balanced Scorecard construct as a basis, the paper aims to develop and test a five‐level taxonomy to classify firms' performance measurement systems.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A Balanced Scorecard taxonomy is validated using a large sample of professional accountants working in Canadian organizations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The five‐level taxonomy is used to categorize the performance measurement systems of 149 organizations. It is found that 111 organizations' (74.5 percent) performance measurement systems met the criteria to be classified as a Basic Level 1 BSC, while 61 (40.9 percent) organizations have structurally complete Level 3 BSCs, and 36 (24.2 percent) organizations have fully developed Level 5 BSCs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Some models of strategic HRM promote the idea of linking HRM's practices so they “fit” line managers' needs for implementing their strategies and objectives. We tried to apply the idea of “fit” by using the HR Scorecard in two public sector organizations: the Victoria Cool Aid Society and the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection. In our applications, we took each of the organization's strategic themes and asked a series of questions to identify HRM objectives, activities, initiatives, and measures to respond to internal client needs. The projects focused on the long range outcome of helping each organization achieve its strategies and objectives in an effective and efficient way. It did this by helping develop a better “fit” between HRM's systems, procedures and practices and what various line departments needed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The National Patient Safety Agency developed an Intrapartum Scorecard for labour ward coordinators to record the demand on their service and the resources available to meet that demand. The evaluation of the pilot at 11 maternity units found that staff valued having this information in one place to support decision‐making in real time. However, nearly half the labour ward coordinators reported difficulty in finding time to complete the Scorecard. Units also used information recorded on the Scorecard as an aid to understanding the pressures on the labour ward over 24 hours throughout the week. The Scorecard was launched in February 2010 as part of the National Patient Safety Agency's Intrapartum Toolkit. In a follow up survey of Heads of Midwifery, over half the respondents were either using the Scorecard or planning to use it. Maternity units would like to adapt the tool in light of their particular requirements. </jats:p>",

Para tanto, foram realizadas reuniões de análise de oportunidades, ameaças, forças e fraquezas do programa, além da definição de missão e visão, havendo por fim a construção do mapa estratégico a partir destas informações. Como resultado, os objetivos estratégicos foram definidos em quatro perspectivas: financeira, relacionada ao apoio financeiro ao programa; processos internos, relacionada ao controle e planejamento das ações, bem como definição e aprovação das idéias; desenvolvimento e comunicação, relacionada à divulgação interna e externa de aspectos importantes do programa; e participação, relacionada ao envolvimento dos servidores com ações concretas do programa de responsabilidade ambiental. Como perspectiva futura, espera-se que o mapa seja comunicado e detalhado para que possa tornar-se referência na instituição.</jats:p>"
