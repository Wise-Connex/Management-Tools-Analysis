This paper aims to present a sport tourism sustainability management model (STSM) for the development of assessment indices when selecting a city to be developed as a sport tourism city. The model consists of five perspectives, namely the financial perspective, customer perspective, internal process perspective, learning and growth perspective, and sustainability perspective. By using the Delphi technique to obtain a consensus from experts, university lecturers, independent organizations/associations, and business entities in relation to sport tourism management, the researchers define elements to assess complex perspectives for the sustainable development of sport tourism. The results show that there are five perspectives and eighteen elements in relation to the sustainable development of sport tourism. All perspectives and elements have a high consensus, as measured by Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (W), of 0.488. To validate the model, the researchers examined the correlation among the five perspectives using a structural equation model and found that both the absolute fit and the incremental fit are satisfactory. As the model aligns and explains empirical data, it can support decision making for management teams, be used to effectively and efficiently draft a strategy for sustainable development in sport tourism, and improve the livelihoods of residents.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Emergency Department (IGD) is the face of a hospital (RS). Good hospital emergency room services will result in patient satisfaction and the community around the hospital, so that the hospital becomes an option as a health facility. The performance of a hospital emergency room needs to be assessed objectively so that continuous efforts can be made to improve services. Balanced Scorecard (BSC) assessment can be used in service assessment in organizations such as hospitals or parts of organizations such as emergency room hospitals. This study aims to determine the components in emergency room services that play the most role in achieving the performance of emergency room services that support hospital performance. This research method is a scoping review using literature studies using keywords from the Balanced Scorecard AND Hospital AND Emergency with literature search strategies from the databases Ebsco Host, Embase, Scopus, Pubmed, Proquest, and Google Scholar. The results of the study contained 6 (six) appropriate articles after screening using PRISMA 2020 Flow Diagram. BSC either independently or combined with other methods can be used as performance monitoring in the health sector both in hospitals and in one of the units such as the Emergency Installation. There are 4 perspectives, namely: finance, customers, internal business processes and growth learning, where it is found that the education factor of staff training is the most widely intervened approach that results in improving the performance of emergency rooms and hospital finances. Further research suggestion is that further research is needed to assess the other three factors in the Balanced Scorecard that will effectively improve performance in other units of RS.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research background &amp;ndash; Effective management of modern business is impossible without the systematic development and implementation of solutions aimed at changing it, due not only to market demands and competitive conditions, but also to the requirements of various social groups. Corporate governance should be focused on ensuring that all stakeholders perform their functions in the best possible way and satisfy their needs while maintaining a balance of interests between them.Purpose &amp;ndash; This article is devoted to the consideration of the possibility of using the integrated business analysis developed by its author, based on a balanced scorecard, in the process of studying the strategic aspects of a company's activities.Design/methodology/approach &amp;ndash; The methodological basis of the study was the concept of business analysis as such and the concept of a balanced scorecard by R. Kaplan and D. Norton.Findings &amp;ndash; It is shown that an integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard involves a comparison with the target value, identifying the causes of deviations and predicting the company's strategic rating. It includes a comprehensive analysis of financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance, and learning and development performance of a company's balanced system. Integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard begins with the analysis of the indicators of training and development of the company's personnel and ends with the forecasting of its strategic rating. His methodological tools are expert- score rating, comparison method, graphical and tabular methods, factor analysis techniques and various forecasting methods. Development of an integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard is the result of further development of the concepts of business analysis and a balanced scorecard and is aimed at further improving the information support of the strategic management of the company, ensuring its sustainable development in the long term.Originality/value &amp;ndash; The author comes to the conclusion that integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard is a new and quite effective tool for studying the strategic aspects of a company's activities, forming the analytical support for its strategic management in modern conditions. Its results can be used in the development of management decisions not only long-term, but also medium-term and short-term, providing a sufficient degree of stability of the company from the point of view of its main stakeholders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of the times, the usage of loan-related business is increasing. However, most of the credit score card portfolio methods used nowadays are manually designed and supplemented with computer calculations, so the bank yields are low. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the application of quantum computers in credit score card portfolio optimization for better rating of customer credit ratings. Based on the given credit score card data, a linear programming model is developed. Firstly, the data is processed into two sets of one-dimensional data by Python and the working range of the two sets of data is found. Secondly, after deriving the objective function expressions according to the given conditions, the data were visualized by building a 3D grid matrix with the pass rate and bad debt rate as the XOY plane and the final benefit to the bank as the Z axis. Subsequently, the decision variables in the linear programming model are converted into binary variables, and the original model is transformed into a QUBO model by converting the constraints into binary variables. After analyzing the QUBO model, the quantum annealing method is chosen to solve the optimal solution of the objective function. And based on this, the case of three selected credit score card combinations and any three credit score cards are considered.</jats:p>"

On the other side, the SAMP is a guide to set the asset management objectives while describing the role of the Asset Management System (AMS) in meeting those objectives. While SAMP is the central figure of AMS, it is important to measure its performance and needs to be build and improved through an iterative process, what means that is not just a document, it is “the document”, and should be treated as a “living being” that needs to adapt to internal and external changes quickly.

First, they can open new markets or explore markets that have not been optimally exploited through a map strategy. In addition, they can also develop new products or product variations of existing products, as well as product diversification. In addition, companies need to improve production processes, increase the efficiency of resource use, improve product quality, and improve production technology in order to reduce high production costs and increase production efficiency. By implementing these strategies, PT. TA can increase competitiveness and ensure the continuity of the company's business in the long term. PT. TA can adopt a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) design to continuously monitor strategy implementation. By using BSC, companies can ensure that all important aspects of business are well integrated in the company's strategy.

Puskesmas Bandar Baru, sebagai salah satu Puskesmas terbesar di Kabupaten Pidie Jaya dengan pendapatan terbesarnya bersumber dari JKN, dituntut untuk memiliki mutu pelayanan kesehatan berkualitas sekaligus mampu melakukan efisiensi dalam penggunaan sumber daya. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui kinerja Fasilitas Kesehatan Tingkat Pertama (FKTP) pemerintah dalam hal ini Puskesmas Bandar Baru di era JKN saat ini dengan menggunakan pendekatan deskriptif kuantitatif guna mengumpulkan data primer dan data sekunder untuk perspektif finansial, pelanggan, bisnis internal dan pengembangan. Hasil studi menunjukkan antara lain bahwa Puskesmas Bandar Baru kurang bertumbuh dari perspektif finansial dikarenakan adanya pemekaran puskesmas pembantu di bawahnya. Di sisi lain, Puskesmas tersebut memiliki nilai tingkat ekonominya yang ekonomis (Tek &lt; 100%) di tahun 2019-2020, namun di tahun 2021 tidak ekonomis (Tek =100%). Sementara, nilai tingkat efektivitas-nya tidak efektif (Tev &lt; 100%; 2019-2021), dan nilai tingkat efisiensinya tidak efisien (Tef =100%;2019-2020), dan efisien pada tahun 2021(Tef &lt; 100%). Dari sisi perspektif pelanggan indeks kepuasan terendah pada sarana dan prasarana Puskesmas. Sedangkan, pada perspektif bisnis internal, turn over pegawai tidak tinggi meskipun pelatihan pegawai masih kurang. Diperlukan upaya peningkatan program kesehatan inovatif yang dapat memperbaiki capaian puskesmas, di mana hal ini dalam waktu bersamaan juga dapat meningkatkan jumlah pasien baru guna mencapai pertumbuhan keuangan maksimal Puskesmas Bandar Baru.</jats:p>"

The Balanced Scorecard method and the interaction between ITB Swadharma's management and the PMB entity's management can be used to create a Balanced Scorecard strategy map. This map involves three strategic objectives from the perspective of development and advancement of learning, three strategic objectives from the perspective of internal business process efficiency, four strategic objectives from a customer satisfaction perspective, and two strategic objectives from the perspective of financial stability. To achieve these two strategic objectives in terms of financial aspects, a lagging indicator is required. Each strategic objective from the customer perspective requires actions. Strategic Objective 1 from the internal business process perspective requires 5 measurements, Strategic Objective 2 requires 3 measurements, and Strategic Objective 3 requires 3 measurements. Meanwhile, from the perspective of learning and growth, Strategic Objective 1 requires 1 measurement, Strategic Objective 2 requires 3 measurements, and Strategic Objective 3 requires 1 lagging indicator measurement and 1 leading indicator measurement.</jats:p>"
