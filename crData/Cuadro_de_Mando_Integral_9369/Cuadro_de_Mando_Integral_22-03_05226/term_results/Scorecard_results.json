      "abstract": "<jats:p>The credit scoring industry has a long tradition of using statistical models for loan default probability prediction. Since this time methodology has strongly evolved, and most of the current research is dedicated to modern machine learning algorithms which contrasts with common practice in the finance industry where traditional regression models still denote the gold standard. In addition, strong emphasis is put on a preliminary binning of variables. Reasons for this may be not only the regulatory requirement of model comprehensiveness but also the possibility to integrate analysts’ expert knowledge in the modelling process. Although several commercial software companies offer specific solutions for modelling credit scorecards, open-source frameworks for this purpose have been missing for a long time. In recent years, this has changed, and today several R packages for credit scorecard modelling are available. This brings the potential to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial practice. The aim of this paper is to give a structured overview of these packages. It may guide users to select the appropriate functions for the desired purpose. Furthermore, this paper will hopefully contribute to future development activities.</jats:p>"

However, comprehensive performance measurements are costly. Organizations need to expend time, resources, and personnel to design the metrics, to gather evidence for the metrics, to assess the metrics' value, and to determine if any actions should be taken as a result of those metrics. Consequently organizations need to be strategic in selecting their portfolio of performance indicators for evaluating how well their data initiatives are producing value to the organization. This paper proposes a balanced scorecard approach to aid organizations in designing a set of meaningful and coordinated metrics for maximizing the potential of their data assets.

It was found that the organization under analysis has defined the main pillars for building the BSC: the mission, values and vision. It was also found that this is an organization with an open culture, concerned with developing efforts to create and implement tools that allow clear and fluid communication of strategic objectives in all sectors that incorporate it. It was also possible to assess that the BSC is a tool known to all employees. Everyone recognized that it would be a useful tool for improving organizational performance to meet strategic objectives.

As a result of the literature research, it is seen that employee welfare is examined in 3 different areas: Job Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment, and Job Engagement. One of the most important factors for the success of an organization is the happy employees who contribute tremendously to the improvement of the organization's performance. Both qualitative and quantitative measurement methods were used for this study. The surveys that have used for this study included 27334 employees in the state of Michigan and the surveys data were analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 28. The study revealed that the BSC strategies implemented in the State of Michigan improved organizational performance in the four perspectives of financial, customer, internal process, and learning &amp; growth. The statistical results of employee satisfaction surveys show that BSC increases job satisfaction by 68.30% (R-squared: 0.683), work engagement by 71.00% (R-squared: 0.710), and organizational commitment by 21.30% (R-squared: 0.213). With the BSC strategy and learning-growth perspective that has been in effect for 20 years, employee satisfaction has been increased, organizational commitment and job engagement have been prioritized in the State of Michigan. The result of this study will help leaders and HR departments measure and increase employee well-being with performance measurement tools.</jats:p>"

Organizations worldwide utilize the balanced scorecard (BSC) for their performance evaluation (PE). In the BSC implementations, some health care organizations (HCOs) assessed the satisfaction of health care workers (HCWs), but none considered their loyalty. Furthermore, none of them explored the causal links between BSC dimensions and HCWs’ satisfaction based on HCWs’ observations. This research aims to provide a tool to assess the performance of BSC dimensions and their impact on HCWs’ satisfaction and loyalty (BSC-HCWSL). Additionally, it seeks to translate the BSC-HCWSL to Arabic and validate it at Palestinian hospitals.<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>This is a cross-sectional study. Two expert committees performed the BSC-HCWSL item development. We performed forward and reverse translations from English to Arabic and vice versa. Pretesting was performed on 13 HCWs at one hospital. Then, between January and October 2021, 540 questionnaires were retrieved in the other 14 hospitals. To detect redundant and poorly correlated items, the composite reliability (CR), interitem correlation (IIC), and corrected item total correlation (CITC) were evaluated. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to assess the construct validity.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>In both EFA and CFA, the scales demonstrated a good level of model fit. All the items had loadings greater than 0.50. All constructs passed the discriminant validity. Although certain constructs’ convergent validity was less than 0.50, their CR, IIC, and CITC were adequate. The final best fit model had nine constructs and 28 items in CFA.<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>The BSC-HCWSL is the first self-administered HCW questionnaire designed to assess BSC perspectives and dimensions and their impact on HCWs’ satisfaction and loyalty. The questionnaire scale was completed following all applicable rules and regulations. The findings revealed that this instrument’s psychometric characteristics were adequate. Therefore, BSC-HCWSL can be utilized in future BSC implementations. It can also be used to assess the influence of BSC factors on HCWs’ satisfaction and loyalty and examine differences depending on HCWs and hospital characteristics.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Performance measurement that only focuses on the financial health aspect as applied by most BMT, does not provide comprehensive results.  Contemporary performance measurement known as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is more comprehensive because it does not only focus on aspects of financial health but also non-financial aspects. This study aims to measure and evaluate the performance of BMT Amanah with approach BSC consisting of financial, customer, perspectives internal business processes, as well as growth and learning. After processing and quantitative descriptive analysis, the results show that: 1) the performance of the financial perspective has a score of 2.3, which means that it is not good; 2) the performance of the customer perspective has a score of 3.4 which means it is quite good; 3) the performance of the internal business process perspective has a score of 2.2 which means it is not good; 4) the performance of the growth and learning perspective has a score of 3.1 which means it is quite good. Thus, BMT Amanah's strategic objectives, which are too people-centric, resulting in the neglect of the business process and financial perspectives, must be evaluated. Pengukuran kinerja yang hanya fokus pada aspek kesehatan keuangan seperti yang diterapkan oleh kebanyakan BMT, tidak memberikan hasil yang komprehensif.  Pengukuran kinerja kontemporer yang dikenal dengan Balanced Scorecard (BSC) lebih komprehensif karena menekankan keseimbangan dan keterkaitan antar aspek keuangan dan non keuangan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengukur dan mengevaluasi kinerja BMT Amanah dengan pendekatan BSC yang terdiri dari perspektif keuangan, pelanggan, proses bisnis internal, serta pertumbuhan dan pembelajaran. Setelah dilakukan pengolahan dan analisis deskriptif kuantitatif, hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa: 1) kinerja perspektif keuangan skornya 2,3 artinya kurang baik; 2) kinerja perspektif pelanggan skornya 3,4 artinya cukup baik; 3) kinerja perspektif proses bisnis internal skornya 2,2 artinya kurang baik; 4) kinerja perspektif pertumbuhan dan pembelajaran skornya 3,1 artinya cukup baik. Dengan demikian, sasaran strategik BMT Amanah yang terlalu people-centric sehingga mengakibatkan perspektif proses bisnis dan perspektif keuangan menjadi terabaikan, harus dievaluasi.</jats:p>"

This study aims to determine how the company's performance benchmarks and stakeholder value propositions use the balanced scorecard approach. The type and approach of this research are descriptive qualitative. The data analysis model is carried out in two ways: First, qualitatively, namely by describing according to language, sentences and perspectives to get a logical understanding and relevant to the research objectives. Second, using the balanced scorecard approach, namely data analysis made in numbers based on the balanced scorecard approach. This study explains how the general concept of the balanced scorecard, the four perspectives of measuring the balanced scorecard, the implementation of the balanced scorecard, and the balance of stakeholder value propositions. The results showed the measurement of the balanced scorecard at PT. \"X\" indicates that the company has a good set of benchmarks in implementing the balanced scorecard. The results also show that several balanced scorecard perspectives are proven to positively impact company performance in all views, including financial perspective, customer perspective, internal business process perspective, and learning and growth perspective.

To develop scorecard, specific keyparameters such as production, economics, egg quality, welfare and behaviour were considered. The scores for these key parameters were assigned on the basis of the performance of the commercial laying hens maintained in different stocking densities in cages (387, 484, 548 and 645 cm2/b) for an experimental period of 20 weeks. The range for each parameter was decided and based on it four groups were formed and the treatment with the best performance received the highest weightage, that is how scoring of each treatment was done according to the range they fitted in. The scoring, weightage and guidelines were devised by Delphi technique, by a panel of national experts from the academics and experts working in the poultry industry. At the end of the experimental period, laying birds maintained at stocking density of 548 cm2/b scored the highest weightage with 84 out of total 100; 48 weightage for production and economics, 12 weightage for egg quality and 40 weightage for welfare and behaviour. From all above results, it could be summarized that this innovative scorecard can be used to determine the best performance of laying birds taking welfare into consideration.</jats:p>"
