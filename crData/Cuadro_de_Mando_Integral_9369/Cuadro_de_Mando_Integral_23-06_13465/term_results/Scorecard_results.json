      "abstract": "<jats:p>An integration between the principles in supply change management in sport tourism and sustainability balanced scorecard leads to development of guidance and assessment criteria for a city to be a sustainable sport tourist destination. This paper aims to present a sport tourism  sustainability management model (STSM), consisting of 5 perspectives, namely financial perspective, customer perspective, internal process perspective, learning and growth perspective and sustainability perspective. By using Delphi technique to obtain a consensus from experts, university lecturers, independent organization/association and business entities in relation to sport tourism management, the researcher defines elements to assess complex perspective for sustainable development of sport tourism. The result shows that there are 5 perspectives and 18 elements in relation to sustainable development of sport tourism. All perspectives and elements have high   consensus as measured by Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (W) of .488. To validate the model, the researcher examines correlation among the five perspectives with structural equation model and finds that the absolute fit is satisfactory, with the value of CMIN/DF at 1.830, RMSEA at .046, GFI at .951, AGFI at .919 and RMR at .038. In addition, the incremental fit also demonstrates positive result with the value of NFI at .962, CFI at .982, TLI at .973 and IFI at .982. As the model aligns and explains empirical data, it can support decision making for management team, effective and efficient strategy drafting for sustainable development in sport tourism and improving livelihoods of residents.</jats:p>"

A proposição é motivada pelo pressuposto de que sistemas de avaliação de desempenho podem ser importante para organizações religiosas para ajudá-las a melhorar as condições de gestão de seus programas e serviços. A proposição partiu da análise de documentos internos e de entrevistas com os líderes religiosos e administrativos da instituição. A aplicação dos procedimentos metodológicos resultou na elaboração de um modelo composto por mapa estratégico, indicadores de desempenho aderentes às perspectivas do modelo PVSC, metas de desempenho e a atribuição dos grupos responsáveis pelo alcance de cada meta. O processo de modelagem evidencia como principal direcionador estratégico da instituição a criação de valor público por meio da realização de atividades religiosas, sociais e culturais, bem como a importância das atividades de gestão operacional e financeira e de comunicação com meios necessários para o alcance de sua missão social. O processo e resultados apresentados podem contribuir principalmente no aspecto prático como subsídio para modelagens e aplicações de ferramentas de avaliação de desempenho em organizações religiosas e assemelhadas.</jats:p>"

The research aimed to design the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as a performance measurement tool at Sekolah XYZ. The research applied a qualitative method with Simple Research Design (SRD) as an analytical model. For data analysis, the research applied the stages of preparation in BSC. The primary data collection method was conducted through interviews with five key informants. The measurement indicators consisted of five indicators from a financial perspective (weight: 25%), three indicators from a customer perspective (weight: 25%), nine indicators from an internal business process perspective (weight: 30%), and five measurement indicators from the learning and growth perspective (weight: 20%). In addition, the BSC design was equipped with a validation system and an evaluation system to support the BSC implementation at Sekolah XYZ. The results show that based on the vision and mission of the organization, there are 12 objective strategies to be achieved, with 22 measurement indicators that are appropriately implemented at Sekolah XYZs. The BSC at Sekolah XYZ is necessary to be designed so its management can easily trace and find the causes of the school’s success or failure. The results of the BSC design at Sekolah XYZ can be used as recommendations for other schools that want to implement BSC, with adjustments according to the conditions of each school.</jats:p>"

Open‐access documents available on different websites were used as data sources combined with semi‐structured personal interviews, which took place at the highest level of the organisation from September 2021 to December 2022. The strategy developed by this government unit has changed over the years, until 2018 when a new review, led by the Planning and Management manager, established a turning point in its sustainable strategy with the introduction of the Balanced Scorecard, resulting in a major internal change for the organisation. The creation of the Strategy Planning Office, external advice from strategy‐expertise consultants, IT solutions acquisition adapted to the new scenario, and several internal organisational changes, have been vital in this successful process. The Balanced Scorecard has been shown to be helpful in disseminating the sustainable strategy at all levels of the company: environmental and social actions were confined for years to the Sustainability Department, functioning as isolated actions, but now, they have reached the strategic level involving the whole organisation as part of the company's strategy. This successful process has put this organisation at the forefront of other Spanish ports, providing other port authority managers with a useful framework that can help them in their attempt to implement sustainable strategies by using the Balanced Scorecard—a framework not only valid for ports but which can also be extended to other government units.</jats:p>",

The research site is the Bethlehem Garden Hospital in Kiyose City, Tokyo, Japan, and it is a case study based on interviews, action research, and document analysis. This paper analyzes based on the framework of corporate communication and obtains several findings regarding BSC. In particular, it shows that using BSC as a tool for communication management may decrease the turnover rate. The case study shows that a balanced scorecard promotes strategy cascade and alignment for hospital staff. Furthermore, it suggests the possibility of leading to a decrease in turnover rate and an improvement in reputation. Namely, it indicates that BSC is a practical and sustainable communication management tool.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Due to the level of complexity of healthcare organizations, many factors play a role in improving health services. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a systematic approach to evaluate their efficiency and management system.  Balanced scorecard can play a role in this field as an evaluation system by examining the cause-and-effect relationship of goals and drawing a strategy map.  Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a strategy map for healthcare centers with a balanced scorecard approach.\r\nMethods: This was a qualitative and applied research conducted using mixed methods in 2019. The statistical population of the research included all health experts from medical sciences universities across the country, 15 of whom were selected based on a targeted snowball sampling. First, through the review of texts and articles related to the literature on the subject with a general search in foreign and domestic electronic databases, a list of balanced scorecard views and the goals related to health and treatment centers of comprehensive health service centers was identified. After that, through a researcher-made questionnaire, by asking experts their opinions using fuzzy Delphi method in 2 steps, the views and goals related to comprehensive health service centers were identified. Then, through the relationships of improved network analysis process technique based on DEMETEL, in 4 steps by Excel 2016 and Matlab 2014 software, the relationships between them were examined. Finally, the effect of goals and views on each other was determined, and a strategy map was drawn.\r\nResults: In this research, social responsibility, as a new perspective and the attitudes of patients and society, financial status and performance improvement, growth and development, and internal processes, replaced the main perspectives of the balanced scorecard, and social responsibility was designated as a new perspective. By examining the relationship between them, the perspectives of growth and development, intra-organizational processes, social responsibility, and other views were found to be effective.\r\nConclusion: Considering the complexity of the activities regarding comprehensive health service centers, replacing the views appropriate to the comprehensive health service centers with the main views provided by Kaplan and Norton (2004) can obtain the best results regarding the goals and strategy. Based on the cause-effect relationship of views, strengthening views and effective goals creates value for effective goals. Investing on influential views and goals will empower and promote the development of balance between income and expense, and the optimal use of resources will improve the views of society and patients and the quality of services, which is the main goal of comprehensive health service centers.</jats:p>"

The purpose of safety management is to prevent accidents, so organizations need to develop, plan, implement, and track risks related to personal, environmental, or property safety in order to minimize risks. The rapid development of China’s economy has promoted the increase of economic, trade, and ship navigation between Taiwan and Chinese mainland, and the number of ships in Taiwan and other countries has also increased. Maritime transportation plays a significant role in the integrated transportation system, especially in international trade system. Safety is a crucial factor due to the fact that various accidents like ship collisions and groundings often result in great economic loss, fatalities, and the environmental contamination. This information shows that Taiwan plays a key maritime role in Asia and the world. Previously, several frameworks for assessing the effects of organizational aspects on risk or safety have been published within different domains (Embrey 1992; Pate-Cornell &amp; Murphy 1996; Oien 2001; Roelen et al. 2003; Mohaghegh et al. 2009) and in the maritime transportation field (Trucco et al. 2008). However, these have not addressed the navigation safety process management through systematic concepts and empirical study, they only emphasized the reducing risk on the maritime safety.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The apparel export industry is one of Sri Lanka’s most significant contributors to the country’s overall economy. The multiple case study method was employed in conjunction with a qualitative approach in this study. This study also used data triangulation, which comprised both primary and secondary data from interviews and observations. Secondary information was gathered from annual reports and other documents. The population of this study is the apparel export industry and selected three apparel companies as the sample and interviewed nine managers from these companies. The interviewed data were transcribed into the transcript and analyzed through narrative analysis. By considering all the practices in three companies, this research constructed a sustainability balanced scorecard which can be used for other companies to build up their sustainability practices. The main issues identified in this research can be summarized as follows, Manual system of data entering and performance evaluation, there is no sufficient Hazardous Waste Management and disposal facilities in the country, Financial constraints prevent best-in-class equipment and procedures from being implemented. Sri Lanka has no solid waste recycling facilities for its primary waste type, fabric waste. As a final point, this research can be concluded that the regulators and policymakers can use the constructed sustainability balanced scorecard for the policy development on sustainability practices.</jats:p>",

In order for hospital management to run well, it is necessary to measure hospital performance, namely the Balanced Scorecard method. : The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is used as a decision-making tool regarding the actions that must be taken to correct deficiencies and advance the hospital. Purpose: This study aims to determine the application of the balanced scorecard (BSC) in analyzing the performance of hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: This study used the library research method. . Results: a literature review of ten journals shows that all conclude that localization and conceptual use of the BSC can greatly improve hospital performance. The results of performance analysis with the BSC at the hospital can also provide clear direction in determining policies, resources and routine activities, as well as in building systems in each unit in the hospital. Conclusion: BSC can not only be applied in private hospitals, but government hospitals also need to apply BSC to measure their performance and be used as a guide in making policies and designs or work plans. Findings from existing studies must also be enriched by the literature and by empirical evidence about the benefits of BSC application in hospitals. It will also provide experience for a number of hospitals in Indonesia which can be a reference for expanding the implementation of BSC in hospital administration.</jats:p>"

The business environment of the 1990s has been subjected to rapid and accelerated change that creates more and more uncertainty and complexity. Most markets are becoming increasingly dynamic. Organizations can no longer rely on a traditional analytical approach to understand their industry or market, since that market is changing in rapid and unexpected ways. Despite its worldwide dissemination, balanced scorecard (BSC) has demonstrated inadequacy in certain circumstances. Some of the original advantages of the BSC can nowadays be interpreted as weaknesses. By using a case study, the authors suggest that in business dynamic environments the benefits management approach, by using the benefits dependency network, can help BSCs to guide and support the benefits achievement related with investments, in a complementary way.</jats:p>",
