The balanced scorecard provides a financial, marketing, operations, and human resources perspective of a firm’s performance. When used to implement strategy, the balanced scorecard approach prompts managers to think about what needs to happen in different elements of the business for the strategy to take hold. It encourages managers to think about how the strategy will impact the customer, operational, and people processes to ultimately affect financial results. This chapter discusses the underlying theory, core idea, depiction, process, insight or value created, and risks and limitations of the balanced scorecard. The chapter also continues the illustration of the Chocolate Moose and applies the steps of the balanced scorecard to this case.</jats:p>",

For this reason, Niven (2003) emphasizes that it is time to manage performance in government institutions that can always translate the vision into outcomes to improve performance results by using Balanced Scorecard (BSC). But the planning of the performance in the perspective of balanced scorecard in BSN is still inconsistent so that the performance results cannot be seen in an ongoing manner every year. This study aims to analyze performance planning in a BSC perspective at BSN based on the Nine to Steps Success Balanced Scorecard theory from Rohm (2003). In addition, this study also identifies the constraints and supporting factors that influence the planning. The result is known that the planning of the performance in BSC perspective at BSN does not go through the stages of strategic initiative and automatitation so that it affects the performance.</jats:p>",

CTCU has four Branch Offices (BO), meanwhile this study was conducted on one of the CTCU at Condong Catur 01 Branch Office. The risk assessment was based on the framework model of ISO 31000 and Balanced Scorecard. The result of the risk identification showed that the risks faced by CTCU were financial risk (credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk), operational risk, and business risk. In the risk analysis process, the result stated that the credit risk was the highest risk, meanwhile the market risk was the medium risk. Based on the evaluation results, the financial risks needed urgent priority to be handled because the risks had the highest impact on the performance degradation. Those risks were managed by doing risk mitigation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard(BSC) developed in the 1990s as a performance management tool finds significant applications in several areas including healthcare. Healthcare Industry though was slow in utilising the BSC due to complications in data sourcing and its management. The varied nature of data generated and handled in the process of healthcare delivery poses a challenge in measuring and prioritising the Key Performance Indicators(KPI). In the present study, to tackle this challenge the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) which uses mathematical modelling and powerful synthesis for combining data and judgement to effectively rank options and predict outcomes has been applied. Here, the AHP was used to develop a comprehensive BSC that will not only give priorities within each perspective of the BSC but also provide an overall ranking list to aid performance management. Twenty senior administrators from a Corporate Hospital in India took part in the AHP exercise to give their pairwise choices for all the KPIs. The eigenvector method of the AHP aided in consolidating and processing their collective opinions to give a scientifically designed BSC framework. To ensure data validity in terms of consistencies and to perform the complex calculations involved, the Business Performance Management Singapore (BPMSG) template was used. By adopting the Row Geometric Mean Method this template provided the final output in an easy-to-read graphical form which can be displayed on a digital dashboard. The primary advantage of this method of display is the flexibility it permits in modifying the target values of the KPIs, real-time. The outcome of this study is expected to provide strategic directions to the hospital. The developed BSC framework is also expected to provide a benchmark for other similar healthcare institutions across India.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the application of TQM generates directly some organisational improvements—or outputs—which help model a decisional ANP network constituted by all three building blocks—TQM elements, strategic objectives and outputs—and their interrelationships. The application of the methodology to an oil firm carried out by an expert group offered, from a decision-making point of view, meaningful results that were developed following three different analyses: Global analysis, which identified the global weight of each variable; Analysis of Influences, which established sound cause–effect relationships between the variables to identify the elements—TQM and outputs—that are more important to achieve the strategic objectives; and the Integrated analysis, which pointed out which TQM elements should be fostered in order to achieve the most important sustainable strategic objectives. Finally, it is suggested to apply the methodology to other types of size and sector activity organisations, as well as to use other techniques that introduce fuzzy elements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to apply the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) concept to the sustainable performance evaluation of emerging family farms in Jilin, China. A sustainable performance evaluation system was constructed based on the BSC. A questionnaire survey was used with a sample of 156 emerging family farms involved in the production of planting (grain, horticultural crops) and breeding (animal products) enterprises in Jilin, China. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method (FCE) was used for the sustainable performance evaluation by different BSC dimensions, farm types, and regions. This empirical study revealed that the BSC is applicable for the farm sustainable performance evaluation in the Chinese context. The key is selecting suitable indicators for the evaluation index system while considering the particularity of market, resources, management, and personnel. The sustainable performance of the investigated family farms is in the slightly above moderate level as a whole. Financial performance and market performance are above moderate, while internal business process performance is moderate, and learning and growth performance is below moderate. They are facing difficult challenges to upgrade in terms of marketing and financing channels, branding, and organic production. Industrial differences existed in the farms’ sustainable performance. Farms combining planting and breeding have better sustainability, which could be a signal for transformation of the traditional single planting or breeding modes in China. The internal business process performance of grain farms is significantly less, due possibly to long-term policy support and protection with less of an emphasis on ecological outcomes. Subtle regional differences in the overall sustainable performance of surveyed family farms suggest that farm performance depends more on management than on external environment.</jats:p>"
