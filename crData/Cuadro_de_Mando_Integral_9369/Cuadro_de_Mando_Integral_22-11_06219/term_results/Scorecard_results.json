      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Introduction\n A balanced scorecard (BSC) is a thorough performance evaluation (PE) instrument. A recent review concluded that hospitals must take into account PE from six perspectives: financial, customer, internal, external, knowledge and growth, and managerial. However, healthcare workers (HCWs) were seldom involved in BSC deployments. This study attempts to involve Palestinian HCWs in BSC implementation to generate health policy recommendations.\nMethodology\n In this cross-sectional study, the BSC-HCW1 survey was distributed to engage HCWs in the PE of 14 hospitals between January and October 2021. The differences between physicians’ and nurses’ evaluations were assessed by the Mann‒Whitney U test. The causal relationships between factors were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Multicollinearity of the model was checked. Path analysis was performed to understand the BSC strategic maps based on the Palestinian HCWs’ evaluations.\nResults\n Out of 800 surveys, 454 were retrieved. We found low performing factors and KPIs. Specifically, the financial incentives, the sufficiency of time spent with the patients, the HCWs’ education updates on medications and diseases, the hospital equipment quality and maintenance, the inclusion of strengths and weaknesses explanations in HCWs’ appraisals, the HCWs’ intent to stay or leave, and their satisfaction rate. No evaluation differences among physicians and nurses were found. HCWs’ work-life balance and time management (WTLB), quality and development initiatives (QUALDEV), and managerial performance evaluation (MGMTEVAL) have a direct effect on improving HCWs’ loyalty attitudes (LOY). HCW engagement (ENG), MGMTEVAL, and LOY have a direct effect on enhancing the respect toward managers (MTR). QUALDEV, WTLB, LOY, and MGMTEVAL had a direct effect on improving the perceived patient respect toward HCWs. Financial incentives had an indirect effect on improving LOY and PTR. Technology had an indirect effect on QUALDEV improvement.\nConclusion\n BSC-HCW1 successfully engaged HCWs in BSC PE at Palestinian hospitals. This research highlights gaps in the PE of Palestinian hospitals and provides evidence on the importance of improving HCWs’ work-life balance, quality development initiatives, managerial performance, engagement, financial incentives, technology, and loyalty attitudes. Hospital managers should enhance HCWs’ feedback and engagement culture in Palestinian hospitals and link PE with practical action plans and targets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the global warming problem threatens the whole world, it is understood that countries should develop energy policies that will increase their sustainable and clean energy investments. Compared to other alternatives, the high cost of renewable energy projects is an essential obstacle in this process. Therefore, priority should be given to developing distributed energy projects to minimize this problem. The scope of the present paper is to identify the most critical items that affect the performance of distributed energy projects to have knowledge-oriented competencies. In this way, companies can focus on more critical items to provide efficiency for distributed energy projects. As a result, clean energy usage is improved, and the global warming problem is handled more successfully. A novel decision-making model is generated to examine the competencies of the knowledge economy based on collaborative filtering and bipolar q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) with the golden ratio. The analysis concludes that learning and growth are the most critical balanced scorecard perspectives. Moreover, it was also determined that information and communication technology is the most critical competency of the knowledge economy. Therefore, it would be appropriate for investors who plan to invest in distributed energy projects to form a research and development team. Hence, new technologies will be followed instantly. In this way, companies will be able to gain a cost advantage. In this context, improving distributed energy projects is important to increase efficiency in clean energy investments.</jats:p>"

For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen the strategy implemented by the company starting from measuring performance to find out the root of the company's problems. Performance measurement is carried out through field observations and data collection through distributing questionnaires to employees who have worked for 2 years. The results are then processed using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) approach, namely the translation of the vision and mission which is divided into 4 perspectives, namely Finance, Customers, Internal Business Processes, and Learning and Growth. The weight of each perspective is 0.318, 0.229, 0.175, and 0.278, respectively. This study resulted in 12 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and then processed using the Objective Matrix (OMAX) and the Traffic Light System assessment system. There are 4 performance indicators that are good, 3 performance indicators that have not been achieved, and 5 indicators of poor performance. To overcome this condition, Hoshin Kanri's integration strategy planning is carried out by identifying the company's goals, targets, and actions that need to be taken to strengthen the company's condition. Through these proposals and strategic planning, it is expected that the company will gain a 13% increase in profits.</jats:p>"

The paper uses the balanced scorecard (BSC) for organizational performance assessment. The paper proposes a theoretical model that integrates the traditional and digital information systems and human resources engagement with the BSC dimensions for sustainable organizational development. The theoretical model is tested in an empirical study involving a questionnaire-based survey of 387 employees with management experience in the healthcare sector. Based on structural equation modeling, the research results showed that the efficiency and effectiveness of strategic human resources management and the accounting information system significantly positively affect the BSC dimensions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Успешное и устойчивое развитие кооперации невозможно без грамотного стратегического менеджмента. Представленная статья посвящена рассмотрению реализации стратегии устойчивого развития кооперации с применением системы сбалансированных показателей. Balanced Scorecard (BSC) — это система, отражающая  финансовые и нефинансовые показатели, а также включающая внутренние и внешние аспекты развития организации. Система сбалансированные показателей позволит преобразовать стратегию устойчивого развития кооперации в конкретные стратегические мероприятия. На основе эмпирического опыта характерные для представления сбалансированной системы показателей «перспективы» («Финансы», «Клиенты», «Процессы», «Потенциал») адаптированы для развития стратегии устойчивого развития кооперации. Преимуществом системы сбалансированных показателей является тот факт, что она выходит за рамки финансовых целей и показателей и уделяет внимание потенциалу сотрудников. Следование системе сбалансированных показателей позволит как отдельным организационным кооперативным единицам, так и кооперации в целом, достигать поставленных целей в соответствии со стратегией устойчивого развития. Применение системы сбалансированных показателей в целях реализации стратегии устойчивого развития кооперации позволит руководству транслировать стратегические цели на нижние уровни организационных структур, входящих в состав кооперативного объединения. Для кооперативных организаций исследуемая проблема имеет особое значение. Система потребительской кооперации социально ориентированная, она обеспечивает необходимыми товарами и услугами пайщиков и население, в основном, сельской местности. Это предназначение обеспечивается многоотраслевым содержанием системы, которая включает закупки, переработку, производство товаров, их реализацию населению и оказание услуг бытового характера. Стратегическое планирование и система сбалансированных показателей позволит рационально использовать ресурсы и добиться максимальной эффективности деятельности.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>Successful development of cooperation focused on sustainable development is impossible without competent strategic management. The presented article is devoted to the implementation of the strategy of sustainable development of cooperation with the use of a balanced system of indicators. Balanced scorecard (BSC) is a system reflecting financial and non-financial indicators, as well as including internal and external aspects of the organization’s development. The balanced scorecard will transform the strategy of sustainable development of cooperation into specific strategic measures. Based on empirical experience, the “dimensions” characteristic of the balanced scorecard concept (“Finance”, “Clients”, “Processes”, “Potential”) are adapted for the sustainable cooperation development strategy. The advantage of the balanced scorecard is the fact that it goes beyond financial goals and indicators and pays attention to the potential of employees. Following the system balanced indicators will allow both individual organizational cooperative units and cooperation as a whole to achieve their goals in accordance with the sustainable development strategy. The application of the balanced scorecard in order to implement the strategy of sustainable development of cooperation will allow the management to transfer strategic goals to the lower levels of organizational structures that are part of the cooperative association. For cooperative organizations, the problem under study is of particular importance. The system of consumer cooperation is socially oriented, it provides the necessary goods and services to shareholders and the population, mainly in rural areas. This purpose is provided by the diversified content of the system, which includes procurement, processing, production of goods, their sale to the public and the provision of household services. Strategic planning and the balanced scorecard will allow rational use of resources and achieve maximum efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research examines the association between CEO messages and current and future corporate value on the websites of fashion companies. The research methods of this paper are as follows: First, we extract the fashion firm samples among companies listed in Korea’s KOSPI and KOSDAQ in 2020. Second, CEO messages’ text data on the homepage of the fashion companies are obtained by hand-collecting. The repeated words with high TF-IDF values are selected as keywords using text-mining techniques. Third, the CEO messages of the fashion firms are classified with one of finance, customer, internal management process, learning and growth, and corporate social standpoints by the SBSC framework. This research investigates through regression analysis whether firms that emphasize certain factors affect their future or current corporate value. As an additional test, using social network analysis, CONCOR analysis, and 2SLS analysis, the paper checks the objectivity and robustness of the empirical results. The results of this paper are as follows: The first finding presents that all the standpoints of the CEO messages of fashion firms had no significant association with current company value. These results imply that CEO messages posted on the company homepage are generally expressed from a long-term standpoint, and a long time is needed to realize their visions or goals expressed in the CEO message to actually effect corporate value. The second finding shows that the future firm value can be improved as firms mention more words related to the corporation’s social responsibility among CEO messages of the company homepages disclosed by fashion companies. This result implies that if a fashion firm shows its vision and goals related to corporate social responsibility and makes an effort to achieve them, the company value will be increased in the future. The results of the additional tests support the fact that there is a significant positive association between the mention of social responsibility in the CEO message of the company’s website and future firm value. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, on research topics in the field of accounting, this study utilizes text mining and the SBSC framework and quantified qualitative data to perform empirical analysis. Introducing this new and innovative methodology contributes to the development of convergence research. Second, the results of this study suggest that the contents of the company’s CEO message contain symbolic and implicit important information. In particular, this study proved through empirical analysis that companies’ effort and achievement related to social responsibility help increase corporate value in the long run.</jats:p>"

The O &amp; G industry has a key role in the economies of many countries. Hence, the evaluation of the performance of the O &amp; G industry plays an important role. We utilize BSC for this purpose, which usually considers the financial, customer-oriented, internal, learning-oriented, and growth perspectives. In our research, the social responsibility perspective will be added. After finding multiple performance measurements, many companies cannot implement all of them because of limited resources. Therefore, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods can be applied for prioritizing and selecting the most important measurement criteria. One of the MCDM methods is the best-worst method (BWM). This approach has several advantages compared to other MCDM methods. Due to uncertainties in decision-making, a suitable method for decision-making in an uncertain environment is necessary. Hesitant fuzzy approaches are applied as one such uncertainty-based method in this research. Our results indicate that among the five perspectives of BSC that we considered, the customer and internal process perspectives are the most important ones, and the cost of the R &amp; D indicator is the most important subcriterion among these.</jats:p>",
