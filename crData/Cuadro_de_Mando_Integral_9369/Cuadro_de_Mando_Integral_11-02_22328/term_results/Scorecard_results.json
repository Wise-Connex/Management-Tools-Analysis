      "abstract": "<jats:p>Concern over the development of new performance measurement systems that that are in line of a complex business environment has increased. Problems with relying solely on financial measures have proven counterproductive. Recently, interest over non-financial measures has dramatically increased. Non-financial measures, however, are not problem-free. The issues are to translate improvements in these non-financial indicators into improvement in the bottom line. To overcome these problems, Kaplan and Norton have developed a new system called the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Some French scholars argue that the BSC is a mere reproduction of the French Tableau de Bord (TDB) developed in the 1950s by French engineers. This paper seeks to draw a comparison between the BSC and The TDB.</jats:p>"

The evaluation and measurement of this core property needs to include a wide range of critical factors. This paper suggests the use of the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach as a powerful tool to link faculty research activity to university strategic planning. Though widely embraced by the corporate sector, BSC has not been applied in the higher education sector of the economy, in part because of the lack of quantitative performance measures. This paper presents application of BSC to a Canadian university, including a quantified performance measurement system. The development of the system, its components, the intended outcomes, and the necessary characteristics that should enable BSC to be applied generally to any universitys overall strategic plan are described.</jats:p>"
