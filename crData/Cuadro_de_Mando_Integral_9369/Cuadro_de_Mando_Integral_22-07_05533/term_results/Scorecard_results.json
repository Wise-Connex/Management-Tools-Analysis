      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance of the study is due to the need to implement tools of strategic municipal management in local self-government authorities in order to successfully complete the reform of decentralization. Foreign experience testifies that one such tool is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) of Kaplan and Norton, which was evolved from a performance management tool for business to a dominant system of strategic management in the public setor. This tool allows use of non-financial indicators, take into account social aspects and environment as well as manage risks under uncertainty.  The article argues that the BSC implementation in local self-government authorities will ensure the solution of the following tasks: 1) aligning the strategic and tactical goals with measures for their implementation; 2) increasing the institutional capacity of authorities (through development and motivation of personnel, formation of innovative organizational culture, introduction of performance management system, improvement of internal processes, development of information systems); 3) increasing the transparency and stakeholders confidence, in particular foreign investors, to attract financing in the post-war period. It was found that the structure of the BSC model and the algorithm of its implementation depend on the field of activity, size, tasks and features of the organization. An algorithm for developing the BSC model of the city council executive committee (its structural unit for the pilot project implementation) is proposed and the main strategies for the four components of this model (stakeholders, finance, internal processes, training and development) are identified. Based on the experience of Canada, Denmark, the Czech Republic and other countries, the main advantages, conditions of success and challenges of implementing the BSC concept in local self-government authorities are identified, taking into account political, organizational, financial and other aspects. It is proposed to define the ways to solve considered challenges using the design thinking methodology.</jats:p>",

It allows banks to maintain a high level of returns and reach their targets while staying competitive. In this context, sustainable performance management has emerged as essential for the banking sector. Indeed, the sustainable management of performance, while increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of organizations, also ensures sustainable measurement based on balanced scorecard practices. Purpose: This study aims to examine the assessment of internal indicators on the balanced scorecard of sustainability in the banking system in North Cyprus, which is one of the sustainable performance evaluation methods. Moreover, it aims to evaluate and reveal the effects of innovation performance, organizational culture, intrapreneurship, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the accounting information system on overall business performance in terms of the performance scorecard to achieve sustainable balanced scorecard systems. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study (BSC), which focuses on the banking industry in North Cyprus, was motivated by the recent and limited usage of a balanced scorecard. The questionnaire was used to gather data from 350 employees and managers of 21 banks in North Cyprus. Analyses of the collected data were conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM, AMOS 25). Findings: The findings of the research established that organizational culture, intrapreneurship, and accounting information system effectiveness have positive effects on a balanced scorecard and its sub-dimensions. Innovation performance does not affect the balanced scorecard and its sub-dimensions. Originality/Value: In identifying the advantages and contributions in BSC introduction and implementation, the study contributes to the current state of knowledge, enabling organizations which intend to use this tool to adopt it and develop it. This study takes organizations’ culture, innovation and intrapreneurship performance, and development on accounting and information systems into consideration in relation to the implementation process of BSC.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the wavelet modulus maximum filtering method is employed to divide the vibration signal into structural vibration components and motion-generated vibration components. Secondly, the evaluation index (EI) is designed based on the processed data to judge whether the vibration signal of the moving process is stable. Finally, the scorecard model is proposed to evaluate the stability of vibration samples, including the process of attribute extraction, binning, WOE coding, feature selection, logistic regression, and score transformation. Additionally, an endpoint localization method is employed to segment the vibration signal of a continuously moving manipulator into single-step motion segments, making it possible to score the motion subprocesses. Experiments are conducted on physical robotic arms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and the results show that the model can reasonably score the motion stability of robotic arms for robot training.</jats:p>"

Vendor Anak Indonesia is a company that was founded in 2018, and is engaged in on demand procurement services such as convection, interior design, contactors, and so on. Currently PT. Indonesian Subsidiary Vendors only see their performance based on the Company's financial aspects and have never conducted a comprehensive performance measurement. Measurements are only carried out on parts that are considered necessary by the company, so it does not inform the efforts that must be taken now and in the future to improve company performance. The purpose of this research is to design and measure the company's performance at PT. Indonesian subsidiary vendors need a company performance measurement system with the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method, which is able to obtain overall performance measurement results based on financial aspects, customers, internal business processes, as well as learning and growth. In the early stages of designing the BSC, the vision, mission, goals and strategies are explained by analyzing internal and external factors using SWOT analysis to obtain strategies that will produce strategic objectives, and 8 strategic objectives are obtained which will be included in 4 BSC perspectives. After that, determine the benchmarks, targets and strategic initiatives for each strategic goal, then create a Strategy Map to describe the interrelationships between strategic goals. Prior to measuring performance, a Weighting Rating Scale is determined for interrelated strategic objectives using the Pairwise Comparison method. The final stage is the measurement of performance by calculating the score of each perspective and the company as a whole, and the results of the measurement of the company's performance on the financial perspective with a weight of 0.25 and a score of 5.00 with a rating scale, on the customer perspective it has a weight of 0.25 with a score of 4.73, on the internal business process it has a weight 0.25 with a score of 4.19 and a growth learning perspective with a weight of 0.25 with a score of 4.56 and an overall average of 4.62 belonging to the \"Very Good\" category from a scale of 4.21 - 5.00 on a Likert scale assessment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The institutional framework designed to protect the environment demands a growing involvement of companies. The new environmental paradigm drives the business community to embrace corporate sustainability more broadly and effectively. This trend is especially pronounced in the petroleum sector since, to a greater degree than in other industries, modern society demands that wealth creation be conducted while guaranteeing social and environmental wellbeing. To achieve this aim, it is necessary to implement an environmental management model that links sustainability planning with a control and supervision system. One of the most effective is the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard approach. This method will be used in this article to evaluate the sustainable performance of a Spanish company whose activity is focused on the marketing and distribution of petroleum products. The objective of this article is to analyze the environmental management of the hydrocarbon company and whether the four perspectives of its strategic vision have satisfactorily incorporated variables that promote sustainability. 2021 is the reference year for the indicator values, which will be compared with the target values for 2022. The results show that, while financial performance reveals a margin for improvement, as well as staff education and training in sustainability, the degree of environmental satisfaction of consumers is acceptable.</jats:p>",
