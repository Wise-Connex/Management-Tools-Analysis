Kajian ini bertujuan untuk membuat rancangan arsitektur atau model perspektif BSC yang relevan dengan konteks Lembaga pendidikan TK Islam mengingat arsitektur perspektif BSC orisinil hanya relevan untuk konteks organisasi bisnis. Kajian ini merupakan basic research dengan menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif rasionalistik yang menghasilkan temuan bahwa untuk konteks Lembaga pendidikan TK Islam maka model perspektif  BSC yang relevan terdiri dari enam perspektif meliputi perspektif pelanggan, perspektif kurikulum pendidikan dan pembinaan agama, perspektif pembelajaran dan penilaian, perspektif administrasi, perspektif sumber daya, dan perspektif keorganisasian. Perspektif pelanggan menjadi perspektif yang berada pada hierarki teratas yang ditopang oleh tiga perspektif yang masuk dalam kategori jalan mencapai tujuan yaitu perspektif kurikulum pendidikan dan pembinaan agama, perspektif pembelajaran dan penilaian, dan perspektif administrasi. Keseluruhan perspektif yang mewakili jalan mencapai tujuan perlu ditopang oleh perspektif yang mencerminkan kepabilitas organisasi yaitu perspektif sumber daya dan perspektif keorganisasian.</jats:p>"

However, there are problems in the product sales process caused by the pandemic in 2020, resulting in a decrease in product sales compared to previous years. In order to improve the quality of competitiveness in terms of financial and non-financial aspects, it is necessary to design a company performance measurement tool that takes into account the company's internal and external factors. This allows for the development of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) using the Balaced Scorecard (BSC) method. Through interviews and questionnaires with management, a SWOT evaluation was conducted. Evaluation in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that exist in the company is used to determine strategies and strategic goals using four balanced scorecard perspectives. The goal is to realize the company's vision and mission from the measurement of key performance indicators. Furthermore, using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a comparison is made to determine which components have the highest priority level.</jats:p>"

One of the efforts to prevent LBW births is to detect risk factors in pregnant women. This study aimed to test the accuracy of an early LBW detection scorecard based on maternal risk factors.\nMethods: The research design used was observational analytical. The sample in this study was 177 mothers who were registered and delivered at hospitals and public health centers in Surabaya and were selected using a purposive sampling method. The research instruments used were LBW scorecard, maternal medical records, and baby’s scale. The accuracy of the scorecard was measured with Mann-Whitney test, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\nResults: The LBW scorecard which was based on maternal factors analysis can significantly predict LBW births (p = 0.000). Based on the ROC curve analysis, it was known that the early detection scorecard has a cut-off point of 3.5, and an accuracy of 88.70%, which indicated that the scorecard has high accuracy in predicting LBW.\nConclusions: The LBW early detection scorecards is  able accurately to predict the incidence of LBW births. Through analysis and calculation of maternal risk factor, it can be seen whether the mother is at risk of giving birth to a LBW or normal weight baby. Early detection of LBW can improve services for at-risk babies, resulting in a positive impact on their health outcomes.</jats:p>"

This study explores the adoption of CE principles and the role of the balanced scorecard (BSC) as a facilitative tool. By contextualizing the significance of CE adoption, this paper reviews existing BSC models that incorporate sustainability aspects and evaluates software solutions for BSC implementation. Subsequently, a novel methodological framework was proposed. As a novelty, the strategic analysis included the use of a SWOT analysis. Once the situation was identified, BS 8001:2017 was used to define strategic objectives oriented towards the principles of a CE. Moreover, the proposed objectives were prioritized using the analytic network process tool. After completing the organizational and strategic analyses, the UNE 66175:2003 norm was incorporated to decide on the most appropriate indicators for each objective. Finally, to illustrate the proposed framework, a theoretical detailed case study was developed within the context of an industry specializing in the design and manufacturing of plastic packaging. The developed BSC was implemented using the selected software. This study demonstrated the convenience of establishing a methodology to guide decision making in the development and monitoring of the BSC.</jats:p>"

The implementation of BSC is described as a holistic approach that allows companies to measure and manage their performance through four main perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. In discussing the application of the BSC, this paper highlights how this framework helps companies to reconcile strategic objectives with operational actions. An in-depth understanding of each BSC perspective is provided, with a particular focus on how non-financial aspects can support improved long-term financial performance. Cases of BSC use in companies as illustrative case studies are also included to provide a practical overview. The results show that the implementation of BSC can guide companies in achieving strategic balance, enabling management to make more informed and comprehensive decisions.

To assess the scorecard’s usability, appropriateness, and context for use, we interviewed 15 immunization officers working across five global regions. To further understand the implementation context, we also reviewed the characteristics of 15 public platforms visualizing population health data. We integrated thematic findings across both methods. Many platforms highlight service gaps and enable comparisons between geographies to foster political pressure for service improvements. We observed heterogeneity regarding the platforms’ focus areas and participants’ leading concerns, which were management capacity and resourcing. Furthermore, one-third of platforms were out of date. Results yielded recommendations for the scorecard, which participants felt was well suited to focus the attention of decision makers on key immunization data. A simpler design coupled with implementation strategies that more actively engage policymakers would better align the scorecard with other public platforms engaging intended users. For population health platforms to serve as effective accountability mechanisms, studying implementation determinants, including usability testing, is vital to meet stakeholder needs.</jats:p>"
