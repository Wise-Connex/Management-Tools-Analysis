This research used a quantitative approach with a survey method by distributing questionnaires at SMP N 27 Bandar Lampung. The data sources used are primary data (questionnaire) and secondary data. Data is processed using the SmartPLS application. The population in this study were all employees of SMP N 27 Bandar Lampung with a total sample of 40 people. The results of this research are that the customer perspective has no significant effect on the employee performance of SMPN 27 Bandar Lampung, meaning there is no effect of customer perspective on the employee performance of SMPN 27 Bandar Lampung, the Internal Business Perspective has no significant effect on the employee performance of SMPN 27 Bandar Lampung, the Growth and Learning Perspective has a significant effect on employee performance at SMPN 27 Bandar Lampung. This research used a balanced scorecard approach by limiting it to the customer perspective, internal business perspective and learning, and growth perspective. This research can be useful for companies and government offices in assessing employee performance.</jats:p>",

Dadas as limitações dos indicadores de gestão tradicionais para avaliar o desempenho das organizações, quer sejam públicas quer sejam privadas, é necessário o desenvolvimento de modelos de indicadores de gestão que traduzam todos os factores críticos de êxito. Assim, distintos autores sugeriram novos sistemas de avaliação do desempenho e de gestão estratégica das organizações questionando a utilidade dos tradicionais sistemas de gestão.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Teaching hospitals (THs) simultaneously serve three different roles: offering medical treatment, teaching future doctors and promoting research. The international literature recognises such organisations as ‘peaks of excellence’ and highlights their economic function in the health system. In addition, the literature describes the urgent need to manage the complex dynamics and inefficiency issues that threaten the survival of teaching hospitals worldwide. In this context, traditional performance measurement systems that focus only on accounting and financial measures appear to be inadequate. Given that THs are highly specific and complex, a multidimensional system of performance measurement, such as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), may be more appropriate because of the multitude of stakeholders, each of whom seek a specific type of accountability. The aim of the paper was twofold: (i) to review the literature on the BSC and its applications in teaching hospitals and (ii) to propose a scorecard framework that is suitable for assessing the performance of THs and serving as a guide for scholars and practitioners. In addition, this research will contribute to the ongoing debate on performance evaluation systems by suggesting a revised BSC framework and proposing specific performance indicators for THs.

Children in these communities experience victimisation or witness crime and violence on a daily basis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Aims/Objectives/Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>To understand neighbourhood disparities in safety and community equity, the Violence Prevention Coalition and the Advancement Project created a Community Safety Scorecard, ‘snapshot’, of risk and protective factors to compare neighbourhoods and communities within Los Angeles.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>Approximately 1400 indicators identified as relevant to community safety. Using regression analyses four domains were identified with the greatest correlation to desired outcomes. These domains are; community safety, risk-factors, protective-factors, and school conditions. Three to five indicators in each of the domains provided sufficient information to generate a meaningful score. Indicators were then aggregated and indexed to create a standardised score by ‘zip code’, and letter grades from A to F, similar to school report cards were assigned.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results/Outcomes</jats:title><jats:p>Inequity in public safety and investment was revealed and solutions suggested. Zip-codes with little investment and those in danger of becoming ‘hot zones.’ were identified. Recommendations for a multi-layered violence reduction model were designed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance/Contributions to the Field</jats:title><jats:p>The Scorecard helps to identify solutions and provides direction to the type of solutions needed. It shows that focusing attention only on one domain is not sufficient to turn high risk neighbourhoods into safe communities. This methodology is adaptable to other locations and provides a tool for community progress. It calls attention to community inequities and can guide policymakers towards equitable resource distribution.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
