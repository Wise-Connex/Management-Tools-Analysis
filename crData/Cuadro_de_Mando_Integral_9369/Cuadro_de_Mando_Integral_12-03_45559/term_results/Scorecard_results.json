Bodies Operating Certification of Person that implement ISO 9001 documentation system should have quality objective. Quality objective is wished to be appropriated with institution performance indicators.Therefore, when quality objective is achieved, the institution performance is also good. The problem is quality objective in ISO 9001 is generally explained. This condition pushes Bodies Operating Certification of Person to identify the appropriate quality objective framework. Balance Score Card, a strategic performance measurement management framework that consist of 4 perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth) that effectively proven could be solution for that problem. This research is to implement Balance Score Card performance management framework in Bodies Operating Certification of Person’s quality objective. This research is important considering there is no previous research that implement Balance Score Card in a Bodies Operating Certification of Person. The research result shows Balance Score Card based quality objective design with totally 12 quality objectives that consist of 1 financial perspective’s quality objective, 5 customer perspective’s quality objectives, 3 internal process perspective’s quality objectives, and 3 learning and growth perspective’s quality objectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) claims to maximize organizational performance through the management of different perspectives (e.g., financial, customers, internal processes, learning &amp; growth). Most of the chosen measures are usually non-financial, as they are supposedly leading indicators of financial success. The developers of the BSC Kaplan and Norton see these perspectives as related, but not as linked to each other by accounting logic. Moreover, Kaplan and Norton recommend cascading the BSC across the organization by breaking up the BSC into sub-targets for each organizational unit.Inevitably, this can lead to situations where actors in an organization focus on a subset of non-financial indicators. In their attempt to maximize these indicators, unit-egoism may lead to sub-optimal overall performance of the organization. This is because the link from non-financial indicators at lower levels of the organization to the overall financial goals have been disjoined. This problem, however, has been largely ignored in the BSC-literature. Therefore, this paper addresses the rationality and limits inherent in the usage of multiple performance measures. For this, we conduct an analytical study based on a literature review.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates whether the balanced score card has contributed to regaining practice relevance of management accounting research. The paper subscribes to Kaplan’s claim that accounting research should increase its relevance by directing more attention to accounting in contemporary business practice and strive to develop improvements for this practice. We also believe that Kaplan is fundamentally right when he states that even though efforts have been made to overcome the problem, the issue remains important for management accounting research. However, the paper is wondering why was the relevance gap not somehow covered by the widespread interest in and use of BSC?The increased demand for research that is relevant to managerial practice can be seen as an example of the traditional change of a profession from being a craft to becoming a scientific practice; a transition that has characterized all professions in modern society. Accordingly, the problem of relevance is not considered to be a limited technical problem, but it is seen as a general problem of incompatibility between the speech genres of managerial practice and scientific research. Therefore, we address the speech genre in use in the major works on BSC.Our analysis uncovers that the BSC is defined in a way that can provide management with some kind of generally overarching model, but the model lacks realistic scientific characteristics and favors some strong characteristics of myth. The extreme focus on cause-and-effect statements in BSC that makes everybody involved draw arrows in all directions seems especially arbitrary or mythical. The mythical nature of the BSC speech genre, on the one hand, may be handy to use in practice because it generates hypothetical managerial imperatives, but on the other hand it is incompatible with research and thereby it actually increases the relevance gap. Our analysis consequently points towards methodological issues that are to be solved especially with respect to the usage of cause-and-effect statements if research is to become more relevant and replace the use of somewhat unrealistic myth. To overcome this problem and regain research relevance the article recommends a more scholarly speech genre that pays more attention to various usages of inferential statements and specifically a pragmatic constructivist perspective for analyzing construct causalities.</jats:p>"
