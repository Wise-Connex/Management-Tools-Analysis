      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are often blanket claims that the world is facing more problems than ever but there is a lack of empirical data to show where things have deteriorated or in fact improved. In this book, some of the world's leading economists discuss ten problems that have blighted human development, ranging from malnutrition, education, and climate change, to trade barriers and armed conflicts. Costs of the problems are quantified in percent of GDP, giving readers a unique opportunity to understand the development of each problem over the past century and the likely development into the middle of this century, and to compare the size of the challenges. For example: how bad was air pollution in 1900? How has it deteriorated and what about the future? Did climate change cost more than malnutrition in 2010? This pioneering initiative to provide answers to many of these questions will undoubtedly spark debate amongst a wide readership.</jats:p>",

This induces a sense of meaningfulness in the employees about work. The periodic review of performance indicators develops a sense of seriousness and can lead to a performance-oriented work culture. When performance is linked to rewards and incentives and is administered fairly, employees perceive the organization as being just and fair. This leads to enhanced employee engagement and improved contribution to the strategy implementation process. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The study has limitations that are usually associated with a case study, such as generalizability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the recent years the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and EFQM Excellence Model (EFQM) became very popular performance management (PMM) models. However, many studies showed their flaws, especially in communicating, integrating and aligning Key Performance Indicators (KPI) with strategy, setting targets and conducting benchmarking. BSC or EFQM have always been used alone and regarded as exclusive PMM tools. In contrast, this study introduces a novel PMM framework that relies on the strengths of both BSC and EFQM. The framework uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to connect these two models. At first, AHP is used for setting priorities among competitive strategic objectives and afterwards for selecting KPIs against SMARTER (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound, Encouraging and Rewarding) criteria. By verifying the framework on the construction industry we discovered that companies can integrate EFQM and BSC to conduct benchmarking, identify best practice, align strategy with the competitive surroundings and selecting strategy aligned KPIs. Using this framework, construction companies can thus achieve strategic control that otherwise by just using BSC could not be achieved. These findings are important because they bring a new perspective on managing organizations and confront many authors who have put EFQM and BSC against each other.</jats:p>",

We focus on two factors predicted to influence strategic performance judgments: (1) the presence or absence of an explicit timeline for strategy implementation, and (2) the evaluator's perceptions of the effectiveness of the new strategy. One hundred eleven M.B.A. students averaging over eight years of work experience participated in the study. Consistent with predictions, we find that (1) absence of an implementation timeline was associated with fixation on lagging financial performance measures outside of the subordinate's time span of control, and (2) evaluator perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness were positively associated with evaluations of strategy-congruent performance. These results extend prior research by highlighting the importance of the time dimension and perceptions of strategy effectiveness in performance judgments. Implications for future research in strategic performance evaluation are discussed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Contact the authors.</jats:p>",

A abordagem da pesquisa é qualitativa e quanto aos objetivos se considera exploratória. As estratégias de pesquisa utilizadas foram bibliográfica, documental e estudo de caso. Os resultados da pesquisa indicam que: (i) as estratégias da organização estão traduzidas em iniciativas e ações; (ii) os objetivos estratégicos foram transformados em metas operacionais; e (iii) o mapeamento estratégico da clínica gerou uma visão holística e alinhada das estratégias.</jats:p>"
