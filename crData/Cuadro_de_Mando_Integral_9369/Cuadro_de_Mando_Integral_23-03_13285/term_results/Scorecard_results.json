      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"tr\">Performans yönetimi ve stratejik yönetim olgularının yaygınlaşmasıyla beraber ilk olarak özel sektörde değerlendirilen, stratejileri hayata geçiren ve uygulanmalarını sağlayan finansal olan ve olmayan bütün ölçütleri barındıran dört boyutuyla kurumsal performansı ölçmeyi hedefleyen stratejik yönetim tekniği olan balanced scorecard yöntemi tüm işletmelerde olduğu üzere yerel yönetimlerde de stratejik planlama da önemli bir yere sahiptir. Bu teknik örgütlerin vizyon ve stratejilerini hayata geçirmelerini sağlayan bir sistem ve bir örgütte ölçülmesi gerekli olanları düzene sokan bir araçtır. Balanced scorecard yöntemi kuruluşun iş stratejilerini ve hedeflerini tespit etmesine, izlemesine ve yapmasına imkân veren bir yöntem olarak değerlendirilebilmektedir. Yerel yönetimlerde etkin ve verimli kaynak kullanımı ve faaliyetlerin sürdürülmesinde, stratejik planlama önem taşımaktadır. Stratejik planlamanın doğru bir şekilde yapılması ve uygulanması, yerel yönetim faaliyetlerinde etkinlik ve beraberinde vatandaş memnuniyetinin yükseltilmesi açısından önemlidir. Yerel yönetimlerin etkili ve verimli hizmet sağlaması vatandaşların refah düzeyinin yükselebilmesi açısından gereklilik arz etmektedir. Günümüzde yerel yönetimlerin hedef ve amaçlarını ne ölçüde gerçekleştirdikleri, değerlendirmelerini bir zorunluluk haline getirmektedir. Bu çalışmanın amacı Balanced Scorecard uygulamasının sürecini ortaya koymak ve yerel yönetimler kapsamında konuyu değerlendirmektir. Çalışmanın yönteminde nitel araştırma kapsamında betimsel analiz tekniği seçilmiştir. Çalışmanın sınırlılıklarını İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi’nin 2019 yılına yönelik stratejik hedefleri ve buna yönelik gerçekleştirdiği performans değerleri oluşturmakta olup Belediyenin 2019 faaliyet raporunda yer alan gösterge hedefleri ve gerçekleşme düzeyleri incelenmiştir.</jats:p>"

We introduce the Ending Preventable Stillbirths (EPS) Scorecard for High- and Upper Middle-Income Countries, a tool to track progress against the Lancet’s 2016 EPS Series Call to Action, fostering transparency, consistency and accountability.\n<jats:underline>Methods:</jats:underline><jats:bold> </jats:bold>The Scorecard for EPS in High- and Upper-Middle Income Countries was adapted from the Scorecard for EPS in Low-Income Countries which includes 20 indicators to track progress against the eight Call to Action targets. The Scorecard for High- and Upper-Middle Income Countries includes 23 indicators tracking progress against these same Call to Action targets. For this inaugural version of the Scorecard, 13 high- and upper-middle income countries supplied data. Data were collated and compared between and within countries.\n<jats:underline>Results:</jats:underline> Data were complete for 15 of 23 indicators (65%). Five key issues were identified: (1) there is wide variation in stillbirth rates and related perinatal outcomes, (2) definitions of stillbirth and related perinatal outcomes vary widely across countries, (3) data on key risk factors for stillbirth are often missing and equity is not consistently tracked, (4) most countries lack guidelines and targets for critical areas for stillbirth prevention and care after stillbirth and have not set a national stillbirth rate target, and (5) most countries do not have mechanisms in place for reduction of stigma or guidelines around bereavement care.\n<jats:underline>Conclusions:</jats:underline> This inaugural version of the Scorecard for High- and Upper-Middle Income Countries highlights important gaps in performance indicators for stillbirth both between and within countries. The Scorecard provides a basis for future assessment of progress and can be used to help holding individual countries accountable, especially for reducing stillbirth inequities for disadvantaged groups.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>              In light of the general inadequacy in the performance of the economic units operating in Iraq, and the contemporary developments in all the various sciences, Iraqi economic units have become obligated to use modern technologies applied around the world. Keeping abreast of these developments is done by moving away from traditional methods of evaluating performance and applying approved and accepted methods of evaluating performance. This will lead to an increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities of economic units. In addition, this drives to reduce production costs. Accordingly, this study aims to clarify the application of the balanced scorecard technique and its role in evaluating the overall performance of the economic unit and the performance of total productive maintenance in particular. The study also aims to highlight the role of the balanced scorecard technique in evaluating the performance of total productive maintenance in order to develop the Iraqi industrial sector. The research selects the sulfuric acid factory in Al-Furat Company for Chemical Industries and Pesticides as a sample for the study. The most important finding is that the application of the balanced scorecard technique, based on the measures that have an impact on the overall productive maintenance, contributes to evaluating the total performance of the economic unit and evaluating total productive maintenance activities.&#x0D;\nPaper type: Research paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>PT Pos Logistik Indonesia is a subsidiary of PT Pos Indonesia. This research focuses on PT Pos Logistik Indonesia Unilever Cakung warehouse, which later researchers will determine warehouse performance indicators using the Balanced Scorecard method. In the current conditions, the company only measures performance on employees and internal business activities and only focuses on one financial indicator. Therefore, it is necessary to have indicators that cover all aspects in realizing the vision and mission of the company. This study aims to compile appropriate indicators and propose additional indicators that need to be applied by companies for each perspective on the Balanced Scorecard method and determine priority weights for each perspective. The thing to do is to solve it by determining a strategy that is in accordance with the company's vision and mission that is adjusted to the company's activities, then by being able to determine suitable performance indicators to be implemented in the company PT Pos Logistik Indonesia. Then you can weight the interests of each performance indicator from four perspectives to find out which indicators are the most important to implement and prioritize. After calculating using Super Decision software, it is found that the customer perspective has a priority weight value of 0.333, the finance perspective has a priority weight value of 0.298, the internal process perspective has a priority weight value of 0.257 and the learning and growth perspective has a priority weight value of 0.113. The highest weight is on the customer perspective so that this perspective is more important than other perspectives</jats:p>"

For Palestinian hospital managers to be respected more, they must include HCWs in their action plans and explain their evaluation criteria. Patients will respect Palestinian HCWs more if they prioritize their education and work quality, spend more time with patients, and reflect more loyalty.

Samples of rural companies located in the State of Pernambuco have been investigated considering the adoption of strategic goals associated with innovation, improvement and continuity, carrying out the use of 48 performance indicators, classified from four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard. The data was collected through surveys structured from a questionnaire. Two different statistical techniques were used to analyze the results: descriptive statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results obtained demonstrate the identification of traits regarding the group of performance indicators that have obtained high percentages of use in the three strategic goals tested. It was observed that the companies that adopt strategic goals regarding continuity, presented declared standards of use that are lower than those presented by companies that adopt strategic innovation and improvement goals. No statistically significant discrepancies were found regarding the intensity of use of the indicators of the Balanced Scorecard perspectives when the joint analysis of internal balance considering each of the strategic goals.</jats:p>"

For the purposes of the present study, the prospect for the development of an electronic platform by a technology firm providing financial services is explored. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the ways in which a start-up can predict the success of an online platform prior to its market launch. The prediction is achieved by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from the customers’ perspective, as shown in the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The research methodology was quantitative and online questionnaires were used to collect empirical quantitative data related to bank loans. Subsequently, KPIs were created based on the collected data, to measure and assess the success of the platform. The effectiveness of the model was calculated up to 91.89%, and thus, it is estimated that the online platform will be of great success with 91.89% validity. In conclusion, prediction was found to be crucial for businesses to prevent a dire economic situation. Finally, the necessity for businesses to keep up with technological advances is highlighted.</jats:p>",

The research problem is that some companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia face severe regional competition, which requires them to increase work by increasing their marketing capacity in line with the importance of the role they play in attracting customers by developing the various operations they carry out to meet their needs and desires and develop work methods according to Modern management concepts, the most important of which is the balanced scorecard, which leads to increased marketing creativity within these organizations. Organizations are well aware of the importance of evaluating the performance of their activities in general, and marketing creativity in particular. Although the balanced scorecard enjoys a privileged position among performance appraisal tools, and has witnessed wide application in European and American organizations, the application of this tool still witnesses clear shortcomings in developing countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study population included a group of private sector companies in the industrial area of Dammam, Saudi Arabia. The descriptive analytical method was used to analyze the data. The results indicated that there is a statistically significant effect of at least one of the dimensions of the balanced scorecard in promoting marketing creativity in the organizations under study, and that there is a statistically significant effect of the customer dimension as one of the dimensions of using the balanced scorecard in promoting marketing innovation, and that there is a statistically significant effect of the value dimension Additive for stakeholders in promoting marketing innovation.</jats:p>",
