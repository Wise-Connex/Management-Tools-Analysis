The balanced scorecard is often used as a measurement tool and not as a management system. In most cases, participating organisations have an unexpected viewpoint with regard to their attitude towards the balanced scorecard, as they did not sufficiently adapt it to the distinct requirements of non‐profit operations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The findings are based on a sample of 20 non‐profit organisations in the field of social services.

      "abstract": "<p>This case presents a best-practice in higher education, whereby a balanced scorecard approach was used to assess the effectiveness of a distance education (online) course in an accredited business degree program at an Australian public university. The assessment rubric was created by applying the concept of the balanced scorecard (from management science) to measure student performance, satisfaction, as well as content and delivery effectiveness. Performance was derived from the course grades while a validated survey instrument was utilized to gather estimates of all other factors from the students. One of the key lessons-learned in the case was that rather than reinvent the wheel, it was better to reuse accreditation surveys designed for the classroom to assess online courses and leverage the management science philosophy of measuring more than just performance to evaluate program success. Similar scorecard concepts have already been applied in U.S. universities, thus their differences with this case are also discussed.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Corporations often engage in corporate community involvement (CCI) in order to improve the social and environmental conditions in their local communities. Firms also become involved in strategic alliances with non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) to guarantee that the initiatives are meaningful. At the same time, such alliances strengthen business impacts resulting from employee and customer proximity to CCI, which is defined as the awareness of, perceived credibility of, and active involvement in CCI activities. Though these effects are strategically relevant, strategic alliances for CCI mostly remain separate from corporate strategy. We propose the community‐enabled balanced scorecard (CBSC) as a conceptual framework for integrating both community and business goals in the strategic management of the firm. We use a case study research approach covering qualitative interviews and action research at Merck Ltd, Thailand, a subsidiary of a large German chemical and pharmaceutical corporation, to demonstrate the practicability of the framework.
