This paper takes a novel approach for the integration framework by identifying the integration leverage points through the strengths and weaknesses of both the BSC and Six Sigma. The key contribution of this paper is that it provides new insights in understanding how the BSC can be integrated with Six Sigma. In addition, the paper provides direction for future research that will address weaknesses in the way organisations execute integration of the BSC with Six Sigma today.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This is an assessment and analysis about the Singapore government’s management of its multiethnic, plural society; particularly its ethnic minority, the Malays. It appears that, in spite of its relative success in pursuing the national integration quest, the State (read: Government) is still grappling with some pertinent socioeconomic and religious identity issues besetting its Malay citizens. Not only has the latter’s malaise lagged behind their Chinese and Indian counterparts but have also persisted since Independence. Arguably, the State, given its dominant and preponderant power, could mitigate the Malay dilemma if it acknowledges the reality that in Singapore’s globalizing culture, the Malay minority, if left without greater State intervention, has little chance to progress and keep pace with other citizens – thereby impeding, if not impairing the Republic’s hard-won stability and prosperity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s competitive global environment it is becoming increasingly difficult for small and medium size manufacturers to survive. In the past, low labor and overhead costs coupled with more favorable currency exchange rates have allowed quality Chinese manufacturers to dominate word markets. In time, Chinese manufacturing grew into a dominant player in various markets cross the globe. But things are changing making it more difficult for Chinese manufacturers to maintain their growth, and in fact, have caused plant closings for some companies that were quite successful in the past. These changes have included higher labor costs, higher raw materials costs, and an exchange rate that makes Chinese goods more expensive in the world marketplace. To help their companies to prosper or at least survive, many manufactures have focused on the financial aspects of their businesses. This is not uncommon in the world, as it makes sense to focus on finances first and foremost because businesses cannot survive without the financial resources. A focus on the financial aspect of business, however, has caused some manufacturers to do the wrong things. For example, some companies have gone on cost-cutting campaigns aimed at reducing costs whenever and wherever possible. Unfortunately, such cost cutting measures often result in lower product quality and loosing other important company resources, such as experience managers and staff. When faced with difficult times, in order to maintain long-term health and viability manufacturing business leaders must broaden their focus beyond the financial statements. A sharp focus on the financial aspect of a company may do more to harm the company’s prospects for a bright and successful future than to help. The balanced scorecard is a management technique developed by Harvard professor Robert Kaplan and consultant David Norton that, instead of focusing solely on financial objectives, broadens management attention by providing an integrated set of performance measures organized around four distinct perspectives – financial, customer, internal, and innovation and learning. [1] The balanced scorecard helps business leaders maintain successful operations by managing their businesses and achieve full execution of their strategies through the use of objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives. The balanced scorecard is a way to help manufacturing firms survive even in a difficult changing global marketplace. This paper presents an introduction to the balanced scorecard so manufacturing managers or their consultants are able to understand how the balanced scorecard works. Finally, the paper presents a basic example that can be used as a starting point for a simple balanced scorecard implementation in a small or medium size manufacturer.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study is based on a global survey of municipal websites conducted by the E-Governance Institute at Rutgers University New Jersey and the Global E-Policy E-Government Institute at Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. The survey evaluated municipal websites in five distinct e-governance categories: (1) security and privacy, (2) usability, (3) content, (4) services, and (5) citizen participation. This chapter examines the area of citizen participation in detail and the analysis found that online citizen participation was highly correlated with both the percentage of Internet users and the percentage of mobile users in a country. In the analysis Seoul, Korea achieved the highest score in this category. Unlike previous research the population of a country was not found to be statistically significant. Overall, this research indicates a strong relationship Internet users and education have with online citizen participation. As the percentage rate of Internet users increases across the globe, along with the rising literacy rates, more countries will progress towards adopting and implementing e-democracy strategies.</jats:p>",
