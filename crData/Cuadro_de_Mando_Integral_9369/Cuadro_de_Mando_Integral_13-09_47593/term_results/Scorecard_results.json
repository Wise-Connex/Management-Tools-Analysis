      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Frac packing is one of the preferred completion techniques for deepwater wells in need of sand control. Frac pack completion performance and reliability can have a significant impact on the economic viability and profitability of a project, particularly for deepwater developments where the cost of intervention and completion failure can be very high. This work discusses key lessons learned and best practices identified from look back studies conducted on frac pack completions in deepwater fields across the world. The frac pack completion scorecard, a tool that provides a normalized means to evaluate the quality of the completion, thus avoiding possible bias based on reservoir parameters or wellbore architecture, focuses on key aspects of the well design and installation process, including rock stresses and well orientation, debris management, perforating, frac design and execution, fluid loss management, and mechanical issues with hardware components. The tool has been validated with data collected from more than 100 wells over a period of eight years, and has proved to be a valuable workflow for root cause analyses to identify probable causes for sand control completion failures, increasing skins and declining productivity index (PI) values over time. It has also been effectively used as a predictive tool for future well performance and to make data-driven, risk-weighted decisions concerning well deliverability thresholds. When the design and installation processes and procedures are shaped around scoring well on the scorecard, the results are better wells not only initially, but for the life of the project.</jats:p>",

Pada penelitian sebelumnya telah dihasilkan rancangan peta strategi yang memuat tujuan-tujuan strategis (&lt;em&gt;strategic objectives&lt;/em&gt;) dan indikator (&lt;em&gt;lead dan lag&lt;/em&gt;) dari FT Unika Atma Jaya (UAJ) yang terbagi dalam empat perspektif &lt;em&gt;balanced scorecard&lt;/em&gt; (BSC), yaitu:  Perspektif Pelayanan, Perspektif Pelanggan, Perspektif Proses Bisnis Internal, serta Perspektif Pembelajaran dan Organisasi. Peta tersebut kemudian direklasifikasi lagi sehingga lebih sesuai dengan konsep indikator kinerja (&lt;em&gt;Performance indicator &lt;/em&gt;– PI) dan indikator hasil (&lt;em&gt;Result Indicators &lt;/em&gt;– RI).  Terdapat 8 indikator proses yang diubah letaknya menjadi indikator hasil. Lebih lanjut, dari 120 indikator, terpilih 35 indikator yang dinyatakan sebagai KPI dan KRI, dan akan digunakan sebagai input di pembuatan aplikasi manajemen &lt;em&gt;dashboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract &lt;strong&gt;- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The paper is related to research about dashboard management development in Faculty of Engineering, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia. Previous research has resulted a strategy map with subsequent strategic objectives and indicators (lead and lag) for the Faculty of Engineering, which comprises of four Balanced Scorecards (BSC) perspectives as follows: Service, Customer, Internal Business Process, and Learning and Growth. The map then reclassified so that it fits to Performance indicators (PI) and Result Indicators (RI) concepts. which at the end of the day will be the basis for choosing key indicators (KPI and KRI). Finally, there are 8 process indicators that relocate to result indicators. Further, from 120 indicators, 35 indicators are chosen as KPI and KRI, which will be used in the next step of dashboard management application development.  &lt;/strong&gt;</jats:p>"

The research in this area was never completed about evaluating of these universities all these years. The aim of this research is to make a framework for evaluating these universities with Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and MCDM methods. Three MCDM methods are applied in this research. DEMATEL is applied for research on cause and effect relations of perspectives of BSC, ANP is applied to calculate weights of indices in perspectives and finally VIKOR for ranking universities that is selected as a case study. This research totally used 38 experts in two groups for evaluating of universities. Results of this research are: (1) Internal Process is the most effective perspective of BSC. (2) Brand, Academic Excellence, Product Quality, Student Satisfaction and Budget Control are five more important indices that calculated with ANP. (3) Shomal University of Amol is the best university among five universities that were selected for this research and they have been established more than ten years.</jats:p>",

In this scenario, the economic agents seek business management tools that allow connecting individual performance to organizational performance. Taking these in considerations, this study aims to analyze if the criteria for the use of pay-for-performance is in accordance with the organization's strategy expressed by the indicators and goals used in the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). A qualitative approach was through a field survey of descriptive character, using, for data collection, a structured questionnaire with open and closed questions. The sample consists of 17 Brazilian companies in three business segments (heavy construction, industry and technology / services) and leaders in the market in which they operate. The results showed that, although it was clear the use of indicators associated with the use of BSC, the pay-for-performance models studied did not included in a balanced way, the indicators associated with BSC. There is a dissonance between corporate rhetoric and practice and mainly, the non-recognition of compensation management as a tool for alignment and support business strategies</jats:p>"

Essa pesquisa buscou conhecer os fatores que colaboraram para a institucionalização e/ou desinstitucionalização do BSC numa grande empresa de saneamento básico. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida por meio da investigação com questionários junto aos gestores, com os quais foi possível identificar, à luz da teoria institucional, mais especificamente da nova sociologia institucional, as motivações de ordem sociológica que contribuíram para a institucionalização e/ou desinstitucionalização do BSC na organização. Concluiu-se que os efeitos conjugados da força de diversos agentes que atuaram em função de interesses próprios, a falta de formação de um ambiente técnico institucionalizado e, desde um dado momento, a falta das condições que sustentavam e mantinham os ambientes técnicos (saída da principal liderança) foram as principais causas que contribuíram para o processo de desinstitucionalização do BSC.</jats:p>"
