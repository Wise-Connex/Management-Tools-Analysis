      "abstract": "<jats:p>Management processes directed primarily to the user and thus improve theefficiency and effectiveness of operations in exceeding user demands andexpectations. So that organizations realize the benefits on all levels, as compared withexternal partners and business environment, as well as internally within theorganization. But in practice, systems for managing corporate change often point tothe shortcomings and lack of commitment at the level of corporate governance inorder to improve the efficiency of the process. Taking into account the problems theyface at the same company, Balanced Scorecard - BSC stands out as especially suitabletool for the management of corporate change. BSC translates mission and strategy ofthe organization in the comprehensive set of measures that provide a framework forthe implementation of the strategy. But many senior managers recognize that nosingle measurement can provide enough information about the critical areas of thebusiness. Therefore, a balanced set of measurements is needed. Organizations todayuse decentralized business units that focus on intangible knowledge, capabilities, andrelationships created by employees. Some organizations understand that strategy mustbecome a continual and participative process. The change from centralized command,and financial measures that come from past actions can no longer measure theobjectives that need to be addressed. We must measure the strategy and the best toolto do this is balanced scorecard. BSC makes it possible to establish a model in theprofit organization, so that the strategic aspects of the observed set relevant objectivesand include features that will be measured. BSC aims to improve business processesfor a streamlined process can improve product quality to customer satisfaction. Sosatisfied and loyal customer is a guarantee of higher profits. The balanced scorecardcombines an effective measurement system that helps solidify a company’s strategicobjectives with a management system that can help drive change in key areas such asproduct, process, customer, and market development. The measures of the balancedscorecard helps focus a company’s strategic vision, encourages thinking about currentand future success and helps provide a balance between external and internalmeasures. This paper presents BSC modeling of key success factors represented instrategy map of profit organization and how it affects the organization's measurementsystem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>PT.XYZ perlu untuk mengembangkan metode Balanced Scorecard (BSC) yang saat ini digunakannya menjadi System Dynamics-Based Balanced Scorecard (SD–BSC) karena keterbatasn dari metode BSC untuk memetakan hubungan timbal balik antara indikator-indikator yang digunakan dan ketercapaian target-target yang telah ditetapkan. Berdasarkan hal tersebut, studi ini memeliki beberapa tujuan. Pertama, menyusun causal loop diagram (CLD) dari indikator-indikator BSC yang telah dikembangkan oleh PT. XYZ; kedua, menyusun skenario kebijakan dan melakukan simulasi; serta ketiga, mengusulkan sejumlah rekomendasi kepada PT. XYZ atas dasar hasil simulasi tersebut. Studi ini menggunakan metode survai yang berupa wawancara dan penyebaran kuesioner untuk mengidentifikasi dan memvalidasi indiktor-indiktor yang nantinya berfungsi sebagai variabel dalam CLD. Studi ini juga menggunakan data sekunder berupa catatan perusahaan untuk mengetahui kondisi masing-masing indikator dan data-data lain yang dibutuhhkan. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa indikator yang memberikan pengaruh terbesar pada pendapatan dan laba adalah jumlah produksi listrik sehingga indikator tersebut perlu diprioritaskan. Skenario terbaik dari hasil simulasi adalah skenario gabungan dengan memperoleh laba kumulatif sebesar Rp 5.875.297.558 dan pendapatan kumulatif sebesar Rp 40.959.313.558. Pencapaian laba dan pendapatan tersebut diperolah dari meningkatkan produktivitas operator sebesar 22,2%. Peningkatan produktivitas operator dapat dilakukan dengan meningkatkan kepuasan karyawan sebesar 25,69% dan meningkatkan jumlah karyawan mengikuti training menjadi 30 – 35 orang. Singkatnya, PT.XYZ perlu memberikan perhatian lebih pada Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM) untuk mengoptimalkan perolehan pendapatan dan laba. Abstract PT. XYZ needs to develop a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method which is currently used as a Dynamics-Based Balanced Scorecard (SD-BSC) because of the limitations of the BSC method to map the causal relationshi between indicators used and the achievement of targets has been established. Based on this condion, this study have several purposes. First, develop a causal loop diagram (CLD) of an indicator-indicator of BSC that has been developed by PT. XYZ; second, compile and stimulate several policy scenarios, and third, propose several recommendations to PT. XYZ based on the simulation results. This study uses survey methods in the form of interviews and questionnaires to identify and validate indictors which is used as variavle in CLD. This study also use secondary data in form of company record to know the condition of each indicator and the other data needed. The results of this study indicate the importance indicator which has the greatest influence on income and profits is the amount of electricity production. This indicator need to be prioritized. The best scenario from the simulation results is a combined scenario with a cumulative profit of Rp. 5,875,297,558 and cumulative income of Rp. 40,959,313,558. The achievement of profit and income is obtained from increasing operator productivity by 22.2%. Increased operator productivity can be done by increasing employee satisfaction by 25.69% and increasing the number of employees participating in training to be 30-35 people. In short, PT. XYZ needs to pay more attention to Human Resources (HR) to optimize revenue and profit.Keywords: PT.XYZ; indicator; scenarios; system dynamic; dynamic-based balanced scorecard</jats:p>"

However, the BSC concept’s use and application in local governments and municipalities remains relatively understudied. This is particularly the case for the Norwegian context. Therefore, the aim of this article is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the diffusion and implementation of the BSC in the Norwegian municipality sector. The article draws on two sources of data: (1) an electronic survey sent to all 428 municipalities in Norway, yielding a response rate of 26%, and (2) follow-up interviews with representatives from 15 municipalities. In the empirical analysis, the article first provides an overall overview of patterns related to the diffusion and implementation of the BSC in the Norwegian municipality sector. With respect to BSC diffusion and implementation, the data show that the BSC is still widely used among Norwegian municipalities and has not yet entered a clear downturn phase. With respect to adoption and implementation, a more fine-grained analysis of five categories of respondents (non-adopters, planners, implementers, current users, ex-users) is also carried out, focusing on the motives, perceptions and applications of the concept. The analysis reveals considerable variation when it comes to perceptions and experiences associated with BSC adoption and implementation.</jats:p>"

The existing performance appraisal system has not been able to accommodate these HR capabilities. This study aims to design an HR performance assessment system with Human Resource Scorecard approach. The method used with Human Resource Scorecard approach is formulated based on vision, mission, corporate culture, business actors and business paradigm into 4 perspectives of Human Resource Scorecard namely financial, customer, internal business process and learning and growth. The performance criteria of lagging indicator and leading indicators are analyzed based on DOCS (Degree of Compliance to Standard). The results of the design are 11 HR strategy, 34 Key Performance Indicator (KPI), which consists of 14 lagging indicators and 20 leading indicator. The leading performance indicator measurement is 71% greater than the lagging indicator of 70.3%. The results of priority analysis of short-term human resource performance improvement with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach result 4 proposals of lag indicator main priority and 1 main priority suggestion of lead indicator.</jats:p>",

This new approach to strategic management for the first time in detail was introduced in a series of articles and books by Kaplan and Norton (2004)[1] with four perspectives: Finance, customer, internal business processes and Learning and growth. The financial perspective is intertwined with a management perspective with the aim that the vision and mission can be achieved by summarizing all internal and external problems by forming a function group discussion in determining objective strategies and Key Performance Indicators.</jats:p>",

Methods: To validate the LM-RANO scorecard, cerebrospinal MRI of 22 patients with LM from solid tumors were rated by 10 neuro-oncologists and 9 neuroradiologists at baseline and during follow-up after treatment. The original scorecard and its instructions were sent to the raters. The inter-observer agreement for the evaluation of single items was assessed using the Krippendorff alpha coefficient. The agreement between numerical parameters including scores at baseline and at follow-up after treatment and total scores was determined using the intraclass coefficient of correlation (ICC). Results: Instructions of the scorecard were not clear for the majority of raters. The alpha concordance coefficients obtained for the rating of single items at baseline and at follow-up were low (Krippendorf alpha coefficient &lt; 0.61 for all raters). The best concordances were noted for spinal nodules (0.60). The worst concordances were obtained for brain linear leptomeningeal enhancement and cranial nerve enhancement. The concordance was better among neuroradiologists than among neuro-oncologists. A poor agreement was also noted when evaluating changes between baseline and follow-up and for total scores (ICC &lt; 0.65 for the best score for all raters). Conclusions: Assessing response of LM by MRI remains challenging. The definition of a measurable lesion and the determination of response were the most important challenges. A central review is therefore recommended for clinical trials in LM. Based on this study we propose a new scorecard that will require a similar assessment as conducted here. </jats:p>",
