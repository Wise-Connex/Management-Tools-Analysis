      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under decentralization, local governments gain more rights and opportunities to use various types of resources, thus, increasing their level of responsibility (including social responsibility) for the use of resources. The paper aims to reveal the consequences of decentralization reform for the indicators of united territorial communities (UTCs) budgeting that reflect their general socio-economic condition, as well as the nature of the latter one; to adapt the balanced scorecard (BSC) to the feature of UTCs’ functioning, and to develop the UTCs strategic map. The paper indicates that the system of balanced indicators is an analytical tool for ensuring the realization of the concept of social responsibility of the UТСs. The research resulted in the development of the balanced scorecard of indicators for UTCs. It includes the following blocks: internal business processes, funding, service providers, service consumers, and environment. The research contributed to the development of UTCs strategic map based on BSC adapted to the peculiarities of UTCs. The strategic map provides an opportunity to link strategic goals of UTCs with the developed BSC blocks and allows for a successful implementation of the concept of UTCs’ social responsibility in conditions of the need to achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Balanced scorecard is a highly effective method for performance measurement and strategic management in organizations and enterprises. The number of companies applying this method in Vietnam currently is not very high. For this reason, this paper aims to determine key factors for success when implementing balanced scorecard in Vietnamese enterprises. Then, it assesses the possibility for applying the method in companies who are planning to apply it. The data was collected from a survey of 6 companies who have applied balanced scorecard successfully and 19 companies who want to apply it. The data analysis result from the 6companies who have had success with the balanced scorecard shows four major success factors, including balanced scorecard usefulness, balanced scorecard design, company human resource capacity, and balanced scorecard implementation process. Then, these factors were applied into 19 companies who have interest in implement the balanced scorecard to evaluate the ability to apply balanced scorecard. The result show that senior leaders’ point of views, strategy planning and execution, performance assessment, human resource capacity, and operation management of the company could affect to balanced scorecard implementation. Therefore, business leaders need to focus on these factors in order to successfully implement balanced scorecard in Vietnamese enterprises. Qualitative analysis were applied in this study.</jats:p>"

Kurumsal karne yöntemindeki finansal ve finansal olmayan göstergeler setinin kurumsal risk yönetimi ile belirlenmesi ve daha sonra izlenmesiyle her iki yöntemin bir sinerji oluşturacağı düşünülmektedir.

Data were gathered from a sample of 723 respondents in public sector organizations in South Vietnam via convenience sampling method. Structural equation modeling was employed to validate the goodness of model fit and examine the hypotheses. These findings revealed that integration of corporate social responsibility activities into the public sector scorecard management framework was significantly and positively related to the corporate social responsibility disclosure and organizational performance. Additionally, it also asserted that corporate social responsibility disclosure was considerably associated in a positive manner with organizational performance. Thus, some detailed implications in connection with each causal relationship and several orientations were underlined to ameliorate the capacity of managing and measuring the organizational corporate social responsibility practices in a strategic manner.</jats:p>"

From the resulting mathematical model, it can be used to make predictions and make strategies in the implementation of information technology in the future. The concept was developed from the IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC) theory which was developed by constructing each of the existing perspectives to obtain indicators which are then used as a research instrument in the form of a questionnaire. Data were collected by distributing questionnaires to 75 respondents, but only 70 questionnaires were complete and valid for this study. The data obtained were then analyzed using the factor analysis method. The analysis shows that there are four factors that affect the performance of IT implementation, namely: IT Competency, IT Service Capability, Business Continuity, and IT improvement.</jats:p>",

Drawing on 15 interviews and five focus group discussions conducted with the staff members and community members of Frontier Organization for Rural Development, a participatory NGO in Pakistan, I argue that it uses clouds intra-household power and resources distribution thereby furthering gender, class, and ethnic inequalities. Instead of solely relying on the PSC, the paper suggests supplementing it with participatory methods. </jats:p>",
