      "abstract": "<jats:p>The professor Robert Kaplan and consultant David Norton proposed the Balanced Scorecard nineteen years ago. From that time, the concept has been adopted by all sorts of organizations - manufacturing and services, for-profit and nonprofit, public and private - in almost all developed and developing nations in the world. During this period, the Balanced Scorecard has evolved from its original purpose as an improved system of performance measurement to become the basis of a new management system that aligns and focuses the organization on actions meant to establish and refine their strategy. This evolution and refinement of the concept of the Balanced Scorecard have been documented by Kaplan and Norton in additional articles in the Harvard Business Review at Harvard University and in several books. But because of the changes that have occurred over the past nineteen years, we seek to highlight the current state of the art and to explain how to become an organization focused on strategy using the Balanced Scorecard. To this end, we review the Scorecard’s literature in recent years, to understand the extent of these applications and the interdependence between tangible and intangible resources, considering not only the performance of the company at one point in time, but its time path and system dynamics.</jats:p>"

We conduct two experiments investigating the role of strategy information and strategically linked performance measures in eliminating this bias and establish a boundary condition for the common measures bias. We demonstrate that when strategy information is provided to managers and only some measures are strategically linked, the common measures bias exists (consistent with Banker et al. 2004). We find that when all the performance measures are strategically linked, but no strategy information is provided, the common measures bias also exists. However, if strategy information is provided and all measures are strategically linked (a condition which did not exist in previous research), the common measures bias is eliminated.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, IT is perceived as a center of cost and investment. Therefore, IT benefit values become very important to measure and communicate. Using Balanced Scorecard method, this study aims to design IT strategy map aligned with the corporate strategy and effective measurement of IT performance in its contribution to achieve corporate objectives. The method is designed based on the results of data and information analysis gathered from executive interviews, focus group discussions and workshops at the company. Balanced Scorecard is a comprehensive and effective tools to measure, monitor and evaluate the performance of IT critical success factors (CSFs) to support the corporate objectives. </jats:p>"

However, the BSCs of many firms include both strategically linked and non-strategically linked measures. Banker et al. (2004) provide initial evidence on evaluators' weightings of strategically linked (SL) and non-strategically linked (NSL) measures when evaluating performance in settings in which managers always performed better than the target level on every performance measure. They found that when evaluators have a sufficient understanding of the firm's strategy, they weight SL measures more than NSL measures when evaluating performance. The purpose of the current study is to examine performance evaluations when, relative to the target level of performance, managers exhibit favorable performance on some measures and unfavorable performance on other measures. We contend that evaluators will exhibit a negativity bias such that negative performance information is weighted more heavily than positive performance information for both SL and NSL measures. Consequently, we predict that the findings from Banker et al. (2004) will not hold in settings involving unfavorable performance. Specifically, when performance on NSL measures is unfavorable for one manager, we find that NSL measures are weighted more than SL measures. Implications of this finding for theory and practice are discussed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available upon request.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Though logistics security only took care of trading phase in the past, many countries in the world have begun to introduce logistics security system as its coverage has been extended from production stage to delivery at the final destination. Logistics security system has become indispensable element for global corporations involved in international trading and studies on logistics security keep going on. Most of the studies, however, are focused on discussion of system, cost and influence of logistics security and few of them have been specifically dealing with substantial effectiveness thereof. This study developed the models of supply chain security activities and their outcome by means of using Balanced Scorecard (BCS) which is a well known performance indicator to identify relationship between supply chain security activities and their accomplishment. In this study we have presented 8 supply chain frameworks, human resources management, information system management, facilities/freight management, security process, crisis management capability, relationship with partners, sharing of logistics information and logistics security accomplishment, with reference to standards of C-TPAT and AEO based on WCO framework, 10 supply chain security capabilities. This study further indicates that relationship with partners has more effect on logistics security accomplishment than sharing of logistic information. Just as relationship between corporations in chain of supply and sharing of information among them are important elements in management of supply chain, relationship with partners and sharing of logistic information will have positive effect on supply chain security accomplishment and raise its effectiveness.</jats:p>",
