      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facing today's increasingly complex business environment, requires performance measurement that can accurately and thoroughly evaluate the performance of a company. In this case, the balanced scorecard method is used. In this case, the balanced scorecard method is used. The purpose of using the balanced scorecard method is to evaluate the strategic plan at PT. Jamsostek (Persero) Pematangsiantar Branch. The data analysis method used is descriptive qualitative and quantitative descriptive analysis to analyze the financial aspects of roi, liquidity ratios, profit margins, and operating ratios. From another perspective, are the results of customer acquisition, customer retention, company data on customer profitability, and interviews with customers and employees of PT. Jamsostek (Persero) Pematangsiantar Branch. Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that the effect was measured using the balanced scorecard of PT. Jamsostek (Persero) Pematangsiantar Branch overall is quite good. But from a financial point of view, for example, the level of ROI and profit margins has a more narrow view, which requires more attention when planning the next strategy for further improvement. The application of the balanced scorecard can be considered when evaluating strategic plans, because the balanced scorecard perspective can interpret the impact of changing trends on the company's vision, mission and goals in the future in a complex business environment</jats:p>"

Perancangan sistem pengukuran kinerja dapat membantu pimpinan dalam memonitoring dan memperbaiki kinerja perusahaan. Metode pengukuran kinerja yang paling populer saat ini adalah Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Metode tersebut tidak hanya mempertimbangkan aspek finansial saja namun juga aspek non finansial, sehingga lebih komprehensif dan perusahaan dapat memperoleh gambaran mengenai performansinya secara akurat.Pada studi ini, dari keempat perspektif pada BSC tersebut diperoleh 17 key performance indicator (KPI). Hasil analisis menggunakan metode Objective Matrix (OMAX) dan Traffic Light System (TLS) terdapat 13 KPI kategori hijau (sangat baik), 3 KPI kategori kuning (baik), dan 1 KPI kategori merah (buruk) dengan total indeks pencapaian kinerja sebesar 7,604 yang artinya kinerja perusahaan saat ini cukup baik namun perlu ditingkatkan agar dapat mencapai target perusahaan. Hasil perancangan sistem pengukuran kinerja dengan metode Balanced Scorecard (BSC) menghasilkan 12 tujuan strategis. Dari 12 tujuan strategis yang telah ditetapkan didapatkan 17 Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Hasil pembobotan antar perspektif, perspektif keuangan mendapat bobot tertinggi yaitu 0.554, perspektif pelanggan 0.262, perspektif proses bisnis internal 0.103, dan perspektif pembelajaran dan pertumbuhan 0,081 yang artinya perspektif dengan bobot tertinggi lebih diutamakan daripada perspektif lainnya.</jats:p>"

The current research examines whether or not Lebanese banks apply the Balanced Scorecard by its four main dimensions (financial, client, internal operations, and learning-growth perspectives) in evaluating their performance. To achieve the objective of the study the researchers adopt the descriptive-analytical approach utilizing a five-point Likert style questionnaire as the study tool to collect information from the sample that consisted of 165 executives who work in different managerial positions of various departments at branches of banks listed in the Lebanese stock market. The study reached some important findings, mainly that there are potentials for applying the Balanced Scorecard with its four perspectivesâprimarily the financial perspectiveâin varying degrees in commercial banks listed in the Lebanese stock market. Based on the findings, the researchers had a set of recommendations directed to decision-makers in the banking sector.</jats:p>"

The sustainability-balanced scorecard (SBSC) for sustainability evaluation is more difficult than an internal evaluation and it requires more serious investigation in the green energy companies. This paper objectives to mix this sustainability evaluation and use fuzzy information with the SBSC. The study presents a fuzzy DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) method to develop an assessment model that integrates triangular fuzzy numbers, and DEMATEL to develop a fuzzy assessment, which prioritizes the relative influence of SBSC for green energy companiesâ elements. First, this paper conducts a literature review on SBSC regarding sustainability issues to generate 15 elements with five aspects, which are used to measure the sustainability assessment. Next, fuzzy DEMATEL is employed to manage the uncertain linguistic terms, then to set up an influential network relationship map (INRM). This suggested model provides a structure for the related green energy companies to select the evaluation method and could arrange the sustainability approach according to future competitive pressure. The result shows that environmental aspect is the most direct effect and social aspect is the most important effect aspect to the other aspects.</jats:p>",

These firms work almost exclusively for the owner financial group developing their software, but they have to demonstrate that they are so profitable and competitive like any other firm. The organizational structure of these firms has some differential features. Top level tasks (software design and project management) are usually performed by the IT firm but the development is usually subcontracted to other software companies. Although financial corporations have always paid a special interest to investing in management and organizational policies to improve their efficiency, there have being always an important lack regarding to the control and monitoring of the software projects. They do not have suitable tools for monitoring actual process effectiveness. Adapting scorecards to this environment could be a useful tool for monitoring and improvement the process.

The emergence of dynamic use of BSC was traced over a different combination of social, political, economic and organizational realities. A deeper understanding of these realities requires the adoption of a holistic approach to BSC use. Henri's types of system use (i.e., monitoring, attention focussing, strategic decisionâmaking and legitimizing) frame this approach in a more concrete manner.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Findings</jats:title><jats:p>This study adds to the debate on whether BSC is used for aspects other than monitoring in public contexts. The case study offers the first example of a legitimizing use of the system and a first longitudinal case study that traces a dynamic use of BSC: the use evolves from monitoring and attention focussing to monitoring and legitimization. Norms, political parties and top managers play a determining role in this process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Originality/Value</jats:title><jats:p>Through a longitudinal approach, this study presents how BSC can be a dynamic tool steered by legitimacy pressures. The longitudinal study explores how social, political, economic and organizational context shape the implementation and the revision of BSC affecting the use of the tool by top managers. The browse of this dynamism is supported by Henri's type of use along with an inâdepth analysis of the BSC literature evolution in terms of its âstatic, dynamic and expectedâ use.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The article interrogates if data visualization, despite its inherited subjectivity, can be used not only as a tool for data representation but also as a research platform to facilitate an iterative exploratory process to identify new themes, raise new questions, and generate new knowledge. It addresses this task by pursuing a twofold research goal. On the one hand, it confirms previous findings that have documented the political power of data visualization specifically in the field of scorecard diplomacy. It critically discusses Portland Soft Power 30 Index that measures soft power of selected countries on the annual basis to reveal how the scorecard diplomacy works through the ranking dashboard. On the other hand, the article reflects on the experience of designing a geo-visualization system that, by contrast, intended to overcome shortcomings of data visualizationâs politics to build a platform for an inductive academic research. It discusses a new deep mapping framework of soft power visualization that intended to address several critical problems of Portlandâs measurements and shares research insights from the project âDeep Mapping: Creating a Dynamic Web Application Museum Soft Power Map.â </jats:p>",

Among single leptomeningeal metastases-related imaging findings at baseline, the best median concordance was noted for hydrocephalus (Kappa = 0.63), and the worst median concordance for spinal linear enhancing disease (Kappa = 0.46). The median concordance of raters for the overall response assessment was moderate (Kappa = 0.44). Notably, the interobserver agreement for the presence of parenchymal brain metastases at baseline was fair (Kappa = 0.29) and virtually absent for their response to treatment. 394 of 700 ratings (20 patients x 35 raters, 56%) were fully completed. In 308 of 394 fully completed ratings (78%), the overall response assessment perfectly matched the summary interpretation of the single ratings as proposed in the scorecard instructions.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This study confirms the principle utility of the new scorecard, but also indicates the need for training of MRI assessment with a dedicated reviewer panel in clinical trials.
