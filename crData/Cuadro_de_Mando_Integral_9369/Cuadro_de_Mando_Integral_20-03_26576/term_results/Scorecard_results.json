      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investment decisions on land imaging data buys, partnering opportunities, technologies, and system acquisition are becoming increasingly complex as the number of Earth-observing satellites increases rapidly, aircraft sensors and unmanned aerial system platforms improve, the community of data providers and users grows, and the pace of technology development, computing, and data storage expansion accelerates. Building on a growing foundation of user needs, the USGS is developing an architecture scorecard system comparing capabilities to user needs to meet the following objectives:&amp;amp;#160; (1) help identify gaps in meeting needs, (2) evaluate proposed and notional land imaging architectures, and (3) study the evolution of enterprise-wide land imaging capability as existing systems reach end of life and new systems become available over timescales of years to a decade. This flexible evaluation system can adapt to changing land imaging needs and capabilities and will evolve from an early, basic capacity to support near-term decisions to increasingly higher fidelity to enable more comprehensive and precise assessments under conditions of increasing complexity. The system will support the evaluation of land imaging systems as standalone capabilities or as suites of capabilities, beginning with a core architecture and expanding to supporting and proposed capabilities. It will be easily adaptable to different evaluative frameworks such as societal benefit areas, organizations, departmental strategic goals and objectives, and technologies (e.g., lidar, radar, optical, satellite, or aircraft).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

This paper depends on an exhaustive writing audit from BSC and Six Sigma. The writing survey gives the premise to another joining system dependent on the PDCA cycle. The discoveries of this paper show how coordinated frameworks can add further esteem contrasted with the autonomous execution of either BSC or Six Sigma. This investigation gives a structure that can fill in as a reason for the reconciliation of Six Sigma with BSC. This paper adopts another strategy to joining structures by recognizing purposes of incorporation influence through the qualities and shortcomings of BSC and Six Sigma. The fundamental commitment of this paper is that it gives new experiences into seeing how BSC can be coordinated with Six Sigma. In addition, this paper gives guidance for future research that will defeat shortcomings in the manner associations are coordinating BSC with Six Sigma today.</jats:p>"

System of strategic risk, in order to be effective, must comprehensively integrate all issues that may be essential to the economic results of the company. That is why risk should be considered in strategic plans and there shall be created effective instruments for strategic risk reaction. Therefore,\nthe risk area should be considered in the BSC. Operationalization of the strategy completed by risk and described by appropriate indicators, will correctly orient the concentration of managers on issues relevant to the success of the company. Correctly coordinated actions regarding the reaction to strategic risk should allow them flexibly adapt to the dynamics of changes in the business environment. In the article, the author indicates that enterprises shall increase the focus on strategic\nrisks that may threaten the future existence of the enterprise and attempted to determine the direction of risk response in perspectives of Balanced Scorecard used in the strategy operationalization.\n\n</jats:p>",

The data used in this research is quantitative data sourced from secondary data, financial report, and data published by PDAM Tirta Benari Bajawa from 2015 to 2017. Measurement of Financial Perspective performance using profit margins and return on invetment, measurement of customer perspective performance using customer acquisition aspects, customer retention, and pelagic profitability. Measurement of internal business process perspective performance using water-meter replacement aspect. Measurement of growth and learning perspective performance using employee training aspects. The results showed that the financial perspective is poor, because the company has not increased the sales volume of water well, causing the water sales turnover could not cover the cost-operational costs. The performance of the customer's perspective is poor, due to the average every year the number of new customers is not comparable to the number of subscribers as a result of the unoptimized service provided. Performance of internal business perspective is less good, this is due to management less attention to the change of meter whose economic age is over, causing a lot of water meter that is not functioning properly.  The performance of the growth and learning erspective is lacking, this is because management pays attention to the development of employee-specific employee skills through technical training training. In general, the performance of the PDAM management Tirta Benari Bajawa is said to be less good, so that the management of the company should improve the service to customers through the distribution of water continuously every day so as to increase the volume Water sales and cover operational costs.</jats:p>"

According to the needs of the 4th generation BSC creating added value for the enterprise as a central issue in the financial perspective has been determined, so all other perspectives should be coordinated with value-based management.

One of the concerns relates to the corporatization of public sector entities, which can lead to the erosion of the public interest. Sensitivities are especially high with higher education. However, increasing budget deficits and a focus on financial stewardship is driving more public entities toward the adoption of these techniques. One tool that has become widely adopted in this regard is the balanced scorecard (BSC). We attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the BSC model to publicly funded post-secondary institutions by developing a strategy map based upon stakeholder expectations. Multi-dimensional relationships between key success factors (KSFs) are explored with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. Our paper contributes to the public policy debate on the purported role of higher education while identifying causal relationships between KSFs for the purpose of strategy implementation.</jats:p>",

A total of 34 out of 40 post academic staffs completed the questionnaire, representing a response rate of 85 percent. This study found that attributes for deliver value (V2), attainment and retain people with key competencies (V6), capture knowledge to improve performance (V10), stakeholder satisfaction (V11), reach economies of scale (V17) , deliver successul IT project (V19), understand business unit strategies (V20), and understand emerging technologies (V22) show no significant difference (p 0.05) between mean interests and performance. In addition to these, other 15 attributes show significant differences in the t-test in the negative direction. This points to the fact that actual control of IT governance in colleges is monitored less than expected. Therefore, five higher education institutions in East Java should pay more attention to the identified attributes important to balance the gap between the importance and performance of these attributes. </jats:p>"

Penulis akan mengukur tingkat kematangan pada bagian penerapan pengaturan dan perencanaannya. Penulis menggunakan 10 domain yaitu PO1, PO2, P03, PO4, PO5, PO6, PO7, PO8, PO9 dan PO10. Untuk BSC modelnya, penulis menggunakan perspektif internal perusahaan. Untuk tingkat kematangan didapat pada domain PO1 dan PO6 dengan nilai 3, sedangkan terendah terdapat pada domain PO7 dengan nilai 1,5. Rekomendasi untuk domain PO adalah mematangkan lagi rencana penerapan TI pada perusahaan, terutama dalam menetapkan hubungan proses TI dengan organisasi, memaksimalkan investasi TI yang ada, serta lebih memperhatikan lagi resiko resiko yang ada dari kehadiran TI. Berdasarkan hasil yang didapatkan penulis, penulis memberikan saran kepada perusahaan untuk memperhitungkan resiko TI pada masa mendatang agar perencanaan perusahaan kedepannya lebih baik. Penulis juga menggunakan Balanced Scorecard untuk melihat perspektif dari proses bisnis internal dan perspektif pembelajaran, dan pertumbuhan. Dari perspektif proses bisnis internal, perusahaan sudah cukup baik dalam menjalankan proses bisnis, sedangkan dari perspektif pembelajaran dan pertumbuhan, perusahaan juga sudah cukup baik.

This idea paper is especially supported secondary resources on the balanced scorecard published by other researchers. The approach of balanced scorecard model helps to the assessment of quality and safety practice of public universities. It helps public universities to create decisions and to enhance services. It translates the mission and strategy of a security practice into a system of performance indicators. A useful model is proposed that may be adapted with appropriate modifications to evaluate/managing safety practice and organizational performance of public universities in Malaysia. The study may help to those universities, who are seriously inquisitive about evaluating/managing internal safety practice, customer satisfaction, finance of universities and innovation and learning growth.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As supply chain management involves several criteria, its performance evaluation is a challenge for industrial managers. Researchers have proposed several approaches for such evaluations, among them, Balanced Scorecard (BSC) highlights. Academic papers on BSC applications for evaluating supply chain performance has an expressively increased in recent years. Considering that examining published papers on a topic is a way of monitoring the emergence of a new field, this study aims to explore, through bibliometry, papers published in indexed journals (SCOPUS and Web of Science databases). This paper weaves an overview of academic production and study trends on BSC for performance evaluation of supply chains. Findings help researchers and managers to understand the state of the art, to identify gaps and to identify future trends. The results also showed the maturation of studies over the years. The predominance of publications in journals with impact factor (Thomson Reuters) also has been noticed. The development of the theme in emerging countries can be useful for increasing the competitiveness of their companies. In summary, this study is helpful for influencing future studies and publications of researchers interested in performance evaluation of supply chains based on BSC and may orient new researchers so that they directly know which journals to consult and which technical procedures to explore.</jats:p>"

Como objetivos específicos: a) analisar a realidade estratégica da instituição; b) identificar quais os pontos de melhorias do batalhão na visão dos policiais militares que fazem parte de seu efetivo; c) analisar o plano estratégico atual do batalhão, enfocando a formulação dos objetivos nas quatro perspectivas estabelecidas no BSC e relações de causa e efeito. Utilizou-se uma abordagem qualitativa por ter sido realizada uma entrevista semiestruturada com o analista criminal da Secretaria de Estado da Segurança e da Defesa Social da Paraíba (SESDS), para entender a realidade estratégica da instituição e quantitativa por ter sido aplicado questionários com amostragem de 146 policiais que respondem ao 1° batalhão na intenção de identificar o ponto de vista dos policiais militares frente a instituição. Assim, foi possível propor o BSC e suas relações de causa e efeito, traçando estratégias e métricas para todas as perspectivas, mas com ênfase na perspectiva sociedade, pois se trata da principal razão de criação de valor. Espera-se que os resultados apresentados contribuam tanto para o meio acadêmico como para a PMPB, uma vez que a aplicabilidade do BSC pode influenciar na melhoria de gestão.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of defining the prospects, opportunities, limitations and methodological format of assessing the competitiveness of an enterprise in a transitive economy using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) concept has been considered. The relevance of the issue is due, on the one hand, to global trends in innovative development, and on the other hand, to the incompliance of performance of the post-socialist industrial enterprises with the characteristics of innovative development. The creation of mechanisms for improving the enterprise’s competitiveness and its appropriate assessment based on the use of advanced management practices and technologies is becoming increasingly relevant.&#x0D;\nThe purpose of study is to improve methodological approach to the BSC-based assessment of competitiveness of a value-oriented enterprise, and to substantiate the prospects of effective integration of the BSC into the existing enterprise management system. This research paper justifies the possibility of using various methodological forms, including the simplest ones, of the Balanced Scorecard, which features a transformational nature, in the process of forming a balanced strategic management of enterprise. Methodical approach has been proposed for identification of the enterprise strategy directed at increase of its market value and strategic competitiveness. Matrix analysis was applied to assess the enterprise performance indicators; it revealed a relationship between the enterprise's competitive position and class of its innovation BSC-based strategies. To assess the enterprise’s competitiveness, an integral index of its investment attractiveness has been proposed, and to assess the class of the enterprise innovative strategies, an integral index of the enterprise innovations was calculated. The proposed methodological approach was used to perform expert sampling within the frame of indicators for determining the investment attractiveness and innovativeness of a metallurgical enterprise by the criteria of strategic orientation, efficiency and functionality. The study has analyzed the experience gained by the leading enterprises of Ukraine’s metallurgical complex in using BSC in a limited methodological format as a tool for identifying the strategy of an enterprise, assessing its competitiveness, innovativeness and investment attractiveness. The result of the study was the conclusion about the possibility of applying the simplest Balanced Scorecard forms as a catalyst for innovative transformations and developing balanced enterprise management in transition economies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Researchers work on facility location problems in different structures and solve them by developing different models over the years. In this study, we focus on the automated teller machine (ATM) site selection problem for a public bank in İstanbul. Twenty-five districts, which are located at the European side of İstanbul, are designated as ATM candidate districts. The balanced scorecard (BSC) model is modified to determine the criteria according to the literature review and experts’ judgments for this problem. Internal, Customer, and Financial perspectives of the traditional BSC model are used as the main criteria and an external perspective is considered as the fourth criterion for modified balanced scorecard. The experts’ criteria evaluations are gained and consolidated by the Modified Delphi Method. The criteria weights are determined by the Pythagorean Fuzzy-AHP method using the final pairwise comparison results obtained from the Modified Delphi Method. Subsequently, the Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to determine the best alternative site among alternatives to locate the ATM according to these criteria. Finally, the results are presented and discussed by sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>",
