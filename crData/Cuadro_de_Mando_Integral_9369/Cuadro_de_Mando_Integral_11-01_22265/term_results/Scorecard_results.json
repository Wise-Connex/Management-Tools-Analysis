      "abstract": "<jats:p> The study on ‘Widening Participation in Higher Education in Ghana and Tanzania: developing an Equity Scorecard’ is a contribution to making higher education more socially inclusive in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings reinforce some of the policy initiatives taken in Ghana and Tanzania, and underscore the importance of widening participation in higher education, as well as addressing associated issues of equity and quality. Although the higher education sector has expanded tremendously during the past two to three decades, enrolment at the tertiary level falls behind levels obtained in most developed countries. Access and equity continue to be issues, particularly in rural areas. This article responds to some of the findings in the research study. It identifies some of the policy initiatives by government and interventions taken by the tertiary education institutions to address the issue of access and equity in the provision of tertiary education. As a result of these initiatives, some students in rural areas have not only had the opportunity to enrol in competitive professional programmes like medicine and engineering, but have also been provided with avenues for upward social mobility. A number of recommendations are made towards canvassing support for broader involvement of all stakeholders in the process of promoting access and addressing inequalities. </jats:p>",

To survive in this competitive environment, it is necessary for enterprises to develop tools capable of defining their position within the market; defining their internal processes taking into consideration their own objectives and prospects for the future. Such tools must be capable of identifying strengths and weaknesses in order to galvanize their position, and determine the best path to follow, even if that means opting for a complete change in direction. This study aspires to describe and analyze the stages concerned with developing performance indicators, integrated and based on the company’s global strategies, using the Balanced Scorecard method. These focus on the sustainability of the organization, and the achievement of goals previously established by the corporate administration. The present research utilizes bibliographical data of themes related to Corporate Management, Control, and Performance Measurement and Models of Performance Indicators. Using the case study method, it can be concluded that performance indicators are vital tools when structured to meet the financial perspectives, of consumers, internal processes and learning and organizational growth.</jats:p>"
