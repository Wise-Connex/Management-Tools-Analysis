The purpose of this study is to analyze the Importance-Performance Matrix and designing performance measurement systems and measure of Solusi Esia performance, then propose development program of Solusi Esia for the next year. Designing a CRM Scorecard start from cascading the vision, mission and strategy of the company to the vision, mission and strategy of Solusi Esia, then translate into fours CRM Scorecard perspective, setting strategic objectives, building a strategy map, set targets, and strategic initiatives and weighing of each strategic objective as lag indicators relative to a leading indicator in each perspective using pair wise comparisons. The score of Solusi Esia Performance is 3.46 considered good.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the rise and use of balanced scorecard performance measurement systems in Australian government departments. Through a survey of all Australian federal, state and territory government departments we find that Australian government departments include a broad set of financial and non‐financial measures within a balanced scorecard approach. Theoretically, our findings lend support for both economic and ‘external’ institutional rationales for the implementation and use of balanced scorecard measures. We find that those government departments reporting greater implementation of balanced scorecard performance measures also report greater benefits for organisational decisions. Our findings shed light on the use, and further potential, of BSC performance measurement systems as part of the management control system in Government departments.</jats:p>",

Survey results reveal that staff's perceived usefulness (at the individual level) and perceived ease of use (PEU) have a significant influence on general attitudes, and intention to use the BSC. Participation also had a significantly positive relationship with PEU, and directors, managers and non‐clinicians have a more positive perception of BSC usefulness. The implications of these findings and areas for further research are then discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>O estudo do presente artigo tem o objetivo de identificar indicadores de desempenho, baseados na metodologia do BSC, aplicados a uma pequena empresa do ramo de equipamentos do Rio Grande do Norte. A metodologia utilizada baseou-se em uma pesquisa aplicada, descritiva e explicativa, a partir da utilização de um questionário composto por perguntas abertas e fechadas. A análise de dados se deu de forma qualitativa. Os principais resultados foram o mapeamento das estratégias do negócio adotadas pela empresa e, ao mesmo tempo, traçar diretrizes para a mesma, configurando-se, dessa forma, em um estudo de caso. Constata-se que a aplicação do modelo proposto poderá contribuir e alavancar os processos de negócio-chave, monitorar o desempenho, traçar diretrizes que proporcionem vantagens competitivas mais eficazes, alicerçadas por dados reais do mercado, além de reduzir custos inerentes às atividades meio e fim, propiciando, dentre outras vantagens, consolidar processos inovadores e empreendedores.</jats:p>"
