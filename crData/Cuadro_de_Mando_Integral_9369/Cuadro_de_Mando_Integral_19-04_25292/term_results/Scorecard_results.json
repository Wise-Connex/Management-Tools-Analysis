El objetivo del artículo es analizar las ventajas, contribuciones y barreras que han limitado su éxito. La investigación tuvo un carácter descriptivo-explicativo, con un diseño longitudinal, teniendo como punto de partida la pregunta: ¿Qué ha aportado el Balanced Scorecard a la gestión organizacional? Se buscaron documentos primarios en las bases de datos de impacto mundial (Scopus y Web of Science) y bases regionales (Redalyc, Scielo y Latindex), seleccionándose como descriptores dos palabras clave: Cuadro de Mando Integral y Balanced Scorecard, a través de los textos completos de los artículos, desde el surgimiento del tema hasta diciembre de 2018. Se proponen los principales hitos y generaciones en su evolución, particularizándose en el uso de software y de consultores para su diseño. Entre sus principales ventajas se destacan generar el aprendizaje estratégico; rentabilizar el uso del sistema de información; comunicar perceptiblemente la contribución individual; alinear los objetivos estratégicos a largo, mediano y corto plazo, relacionándolos con los presupuestos; y clarificar el sistema de compensación del desempeño. El estudio revela que esta herramienta ha realizado un importante aporte a la gestión organizacional, contando con una alta satisfacción por su uso, recomendándose directrices para nuevas investigaciones centradas en el análisis de las causas de las malas prácticas en su diseño e implementación. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban water pricing is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid rate of urbanization and the expansion of water reclamation and reuse. The mounting evidence of failures of current pricing schemes makes analyzing their performance essential for understanding the adequacy of economic and sustainability policies in water management. However, urban water pricing policies are complex, serve multiple objectives, and vary widely across regions and countries. This paper presents an assessment framework for urban water pricing policies based on common conditions advocated for well-functioning pricing policies. Using a simplified scorecard, it compares the performance of urban water pricing policies in Jordan and Iran, two countries under growing scarcity pressure. Both countries show serious deficiencies with regard to the economic valuation of water services and the cost recovery of utilities. Public policies are rather oriented towards access and affordability, with Jordan showing a higher level of transparency and competition in tariff-setting. The assessment tool indicates a high potential for experience-sharing in future reforms, which should promote water as a scarce good. Such reforms need to prioritize full cost valuation, participation, and scientifically based designs of local and regional water tariffs.</jats:p>"

La recherche s’appuie d’abord sur un cadre conceptuel qui tend à suggérer que le BSC, en invitant à repenser la stratégie, peut devenir un levier d’apprentissage organisationnel. Ensuite, la méthodologie choisie mobilise une approche processuelle fondée sur la recherche intervention et une étude longitudinale de deux cas d’entreprises industrielles. Les résultats des deux études de cas ont d’abord montré que, durant la conception du BSC, les interactions multiples entre les acteurs ont engendré un triple processus d’acquisition de connaissances, de distribution de l’information et d’interprétation de l’information. Pourtant, il est apparu aussi, qu’en dépit de l’abandon du BSC quelques années après sa mise en œuvre, les deux entreprises ont capitalisé la connaissance acquise durant les phases de conception du dispositif. La discussion des résultats montre alors le rôle déterminant de la phase de conception du BSC et de sa carte stratégique dans les apprentissages qui s’en sont suivis. Elle révèle également les fragilités du BSC et de ses apprentissages face à un contrôle prioritairement financier.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The issue of sustainability in company strategy has assumed crucial relevance in recent years. Many companies have implemented specific environmental and sustainability management systems such as the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC), which integrates sustainability and the traditional Balanced Scorecard (BSC). However, environmental and sustainability aspects are often not linked to economic success, and qualitative analysis is not considered adequately by managers. Therefore, these dimensions remain unclear, because it is necessary to analyze the conditions under which the SBSC represents a suitable tool for sustainability value creation in more depth. In this context, the purpose of the study is to propose a new strategic framework to provide a way to manage critical issues connected to the SBSC. Thanks to the information obtained from a survey and interviews conducted with managers of Italian companies, we created an adjusted SBSC (ASBSC) that allows us to consider the critical aspects from a new perspective, named the critical perspective. The conceptual model is developed in five dimensions (conceptual, structural, environmental, social, and economic). Research findings suggest that considering the critical perspective makes it possible to build the ASBSC in order to achieve sustainability and economic success of the company. The proposed framework contributes to the existing literature on improving the performance of the SBSC.</jats:p>"

With this purpose it has also been used in healthcare organizations and institutions but there are not many studies on the implementation of BSC methodology in the day-to-day clinical laboratory. This review shows the strategy for the development of a BSC, which includes theoretical perspective objectives, as well as some indicators and goals with which the monitoring and quantitative measurement of the achievements of a strategic plan in a clinical laboratory can be done. Moreover, the results of the indicators allow the prioritization of the initiatives to be implemented each year.\nThe methodology for the development of the proposed BSC includes the following steps: definition of theoretical objectives of each of the perspectives most used in the management of a clinical laboratory (customers, financial, internal processes and learning) taking into account the vision and the organizational model of the laboratory; creation of a strategic map of perspective objectives; definition of the relevant indicators to follow up on the objectives in a quantitative manner and establishment of the goals. Whether or not the laboratory is a reference laboratory, in which specific and infrequent analysis and health population programs are performed, is another fact to take into account. In this review a BSC for a reference clinical laboratory of the Spanish public sector is shown.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Critical aspects of the environment can reduce the efficiency of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) when applied to Marine Transport. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the improvement of the traditional EMS approach through the usage of Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The BSC represents a managing tool able to measure and increase organizational performance, taking into consideration environmental aspects. The proposed method, based on the ISO 14001 standard, allows management of environmental metrics through conventional BSC systems and it is applied to the biggest organization for marine transport in Montenegro as a case study methodology. In this qualitative investigation, particular attention was paid to creating EMS criteria able to orient the complete business operation of the organization but also to test their potential linkage to the conventional BSC approach. Four models of the BSC were created, each one including to a different extent the issue of environmental protection. Finally, an expert’s evaluation of model efficiency, based on the ISO 9126, was carried out. As a result, the best ranked model is recommended for the selection of an approach toward environmental protection based on the use of the EMS metric in a conventional BSC system. This method—in short ECO-BSC—was developed for the specific benefit of those organizations operating on the marine transport market.</jats:p>"

According to the author, it does not depend on the field of work or the type of activity of the enterprise. The field of hydropower is exposed to risks, perhaps, to a greater extent, because in addition to the main business risks, risks associated with the implementation of projects that depend on renewable energy sources are added. The purpose of this study is to find the main indicators of the performance of hydropower enterprises to assess the risks of their international projects. The study used an analytical method. One of the risk assessment tools is a balanced scorecard. In this article, the author reviewed the work of a similar subject of the authors, published in the journal “Problems of Risk Analysis”. Some aspects of the formation of the system as a tool for assessing the risks of business structures and businesses operating in the field of hydropower are covered. The scope of the results obtained can be a set of management decisions made by the management of hydropower enterprises, as well as in the development of a risk management methods. It is a conscious and rational attitude to risk that expands the possibilities for successful management of international hydropower projects.</jats:p>"

Observa-se que as micro, pequenas e médias empresas (MPME) têm mais dificuldades em utilizar as ferramentas de medição. Diante dessa realidade, o presente estudo tem como objetivo identificar, a partir de uma pesquisa bibliográfica, as principais barreiras encontradas no uso do Balanced Scorecard (BSC) nas MPME. Para tanto, foi realizado um levantamento a partir da bibliografia clássica, evoluindo para publicações contemporâneas, finalizando com a apresentação de um quadro comparativo da utilização do BSC, vantagens e desvantagens de acordo com cada obra estudada. O estudo aborda as dificuldades mais frequentes para a utilização dos indicadores de desempenho, em particular o BSC, que abrange perspectivas relacionadas ao tomador de decisão e fatores relacionados às limitações de recursos. Como destaque para os resultados alcançados cita-se a diversidade dos aspectos abordados, o que possibilitou o entendimento mais completo do BSC como uma ferramenta de contribuição para o tomador de decisão dar os primeiros passos na medição de desempenho.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Performance measurement is a necessity for private hospitals as they need to be efficient, attract customers, increase profitability, and survive in the competitive environment of the health care industry. Hospitals typically struggle to identify appropriate performance measures because of lack of reliable source of performance measures for private hospitals. Despite numerous studies on performance measurement, few studies have focused on performance measures in private hospitals. This paper aims to fill that gap by identifying and ranking a specific set of performance measures that are feasible and relevant for private hospitals. Forty‐four health care performance measures in four balanced scorecard (BSC) performance perspectives (financial, customer, internal business processes, and learning and growth) were compiled and filtered based on “feasibility” and “relevance” criteria using a questionnaire survey in private hospitals in the Klang Valley area, Malaysia. Since all collected data were in numeric format, data analysis was performed quantitatively. Consequently, 31 BSC performance measures were identified for private hospitals. Next, the 31 performance measures went through a ranking survey in Klang Valley private hospitals. Therefore, a weight between 0 and 1 with a range of 0.095 to 0.207 was obtained for each performance measure to help hospitals quantify their overall performance more accurately.</jats:p>",
