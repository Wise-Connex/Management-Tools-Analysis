      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to analyze the performance of Islamic philanthropic institution during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021) by using a balanced scorecard approach. The balanced scorecard assesses a company or institution based on four perspectives: finance, customer, internal business, and growth and learning. For internal business and growth and learning performance perspectives, data were taken from interviews, and the annual report of the institution was taken for a finance perspective. For customer perspectives, the study used a questionnaire distributed to 100 respondents who are regular donors to philanthropic institution. They play an essential role because regardless of the economic conditions that occur, they are still obliged to donate as a form of the obligation of a rich Muslim to pay zakat. The results showed that the customer perspective had the highest value in its performance results compared to the other three perspectives. Islamic philanthropic institution has a high orientation to customers where customer satisfaction is prioritized in improving the performance of zakat institutions, especially during the pandemic. This is in line with the performance of Islamic philanthropic institution, which continues to increase performance during the pandemic. Despite experiencing a decline in zakat funds in the second wave of COVID-19, Islamic philanthropic institution increased infaq and sadaqah funds during the same period.\nAcknowledgmentThe authors thank the Research and Innovation Institute (LRI), Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta, for the enormous financial support in writing this research through the HIT funding scheme with number 01/A.6-II/FAI/1/2022.</jats:p>",

The questions are empirically tested with survey data obtained from 276 midwives, specialist doctors and nurses, and mothers who recently gave birth in a cross-section of Iranian public healthcare organizations. The results from a structural equation model suggest that an improved performance assessment system leads to higher quality midwife services. In addition, the results indicate that midwife job satisfaction and intra-organizational information increases the quality of midwife services, both directly and indirectly, through the mediating effect of a performance assessment system. Our study contributes to the growing research exploring the interface between accounting and health issues by recognizing the importance of a performance assessment system of midwifery services via the balanced scorecard framework for understanding the quality of midwife services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital transformation has a significant impact on efficiency and quality in hospitals. New solutions can support the management of data overload and the shortage of qualified staff. However, the timely and effective integration of these new digital tools in the healthcare setting poses challenges and requires guidance. The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a managerial method used to translate new strategies into action and measure their impact in an institution, going beyond financial values. This framework enables quicker operational adjustments and enhances awareness of real-time performance from multiple perspectives, including customers, internal procedures, and the learning organization. The aim of this study was to adapt the BSC to the evolving digital healthcare environment, encompassing factors like the recent pandemic, new technologies such as artificial intelligence, legislation, and user preferences. A strategic mapping with identification of corresponding key performance indicators was performed. To achieve this, we employed a qualitative research approach involving retreats, interdisciplinary working groups, and semi-structured interviews with different stakeholders (administrative, clinical, computer scientists) in a rheumatology department. These inputs served as the basis for customizing the BSC according to upcoming or already implemented solutions and to define actionable, cross-level performance indicators for all perspectives. Our defined values include quality of care, patient empowerment, employee satisfaction, sustainability and innovation. We also identified substantial changes in our internal processes, with the electronic medical record (EMR) emerging as a central element for vertical and horizontal digitalization. This includes integrating patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarker, prediction algorithms to increase the quality of care as well as advanced language models in order save resources. Gaps in communication and collaboration between medical departments have been identified as a main target for new digital solutions, especially in patients with more than one disorder. From a learning institution’s perspective, digital literacy among patients and healthcare professionals emerges as a crucial lever for successful implementation of internal processes. In conclusion, the BSC is a helpful tool for guiding digitalization in hospitals as a horizontally and vertically connected process that affects all stakeholders. Future studies should include empirical analyses and explore correlations between variables and above all input and user experience from patients.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The competition between Jordanian Small and Medium Manufacturing Enterprises (SMMEs) and imported products from foreign countries especially from China is increasing, so Jordanian SMMEs have to use different strategic tools to be able to compete with imported products. Therefore, this research purpose is to explore the effect of using a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as a strategic tool on Jordanian SMMEs’ competitive strategies. The study uses a quantitative descriptive and cause-effect approach, and it is cross-sectional research. Exactly 120 managers and owners from 100 SMMEs completed a questionnaire. Then questionnaires were checked and coded against SPSS. The results show that implementing the BSC affects the competitive strategies of Jordanian manufacturing SMMEs, where the BSC has assigned the greatest weight to the focus strategy, the cost leadership strategy, and finally the differentiation strategy. Moreover, the customer perspective has the highest impact on competitive strategies, then the financial perspective, followed by the learning and growth perspective, and finally the internal processes perspective. This article illustrates how using a BSC is essential to measure and manage organizational performance via analyzing weaknesses and strengths, which helps to achieve competitive strategies. Therefore, owners and managers should use BSC as a strategic tool before setting strategic goals and objectives to achieve a competitive strategy. Finally, this research will help managers and owners of SMEs to improve their competitive position compared to foreign companies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to propose a tool to measure the performance of a Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) based on a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The SAMP converts organizational objectives into asset management objectives, as well as specifies the role of the asset management system, providing support to achieve asset management objectives. The SAMP becomes the heart of the organization and integrates the long-term, medium-term, and short-term plans. In the SAMP, the balance among performance, costs, and risks are taken into consideration in order to achieve the organization’s objectives. On the other hand, the SAMP is a guide to set the asset management objectives while describing the role of the Asset Management System (AMS) in meeting these objectives. Since the SAMP is the central figure of AMS, it is important to measure its performance and should be built and improved through an iterative process. This indicates that it is not just a document, it is “the document” that should be treated as a “living being”, which needs to adapt to internal and external changes quickly. The BSC is an excellent tool where, through the appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), the progress can be measured, and is supported by four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Business Process, and Learning and Growth.</jats:p>"

Routine parameters such as demographics, admission status, CT findings, and blood tests can be used to predict aSAH outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of traditional logistic regression with several machine learning algorithms using readily available indicators and to generate a practical prognostic scorecard based on machine learning. Eighteen routinely available indicators were collected as outcome predictors for individuals with aSAH. Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVMs), and fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) were compared. A scorecard system was established based on predictor weights. The results show that machine learning models and a scorecard achieved 0.75~0.8 area under the curve (AUC) predicting aSAH outcomes (LR 0.739, RF 0.749, SVM 0.762~0.793, scorecard 0.794). FCNNs performed best (~0.95) but lacked interpretability. The scorecard model used only five factors, generating a clinically useful tool with a total cutoff score of ≥5, indicating poor prognosis. We developed and validated machine learning models proven to predict outcomes more accurately in individuals with aSAH. The parameters found to be the most strongly predictive of outcomes were NLR, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, hypertension status, and SEBES. The scorecard system provides a simplified means of applying predictive analytics at the bedside using a few key indicators.</jats:p>"
