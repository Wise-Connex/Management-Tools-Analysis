      "abstract": "<jats:p>Este estudo descritivo estatístico, baseado em pesquisa realizada pela Fundação Dom Cabral, apresenta uma comparação da abrangência dos modelos BSC, TQC e PNQ, como ferramentas de controle de desempenho, a partir dos resultados de pesquisa realizada com as 500 maiores empresas privadas que atuam no mercado brasileiro, de acordo com a Revista Exame de Junho de 2000. O estudo também procura identificar as características destes três modelos de avaliação de desempenho empresarial, visando estabelecer uma matriz comparativa que possa servir de base para orientar a seleção de um modelo de controle de desempenho adequado à realidade de cada empresa.

Many organizations develop a balanced scorecard without first developing a strategy map, from which key performance indicators (KPIs) for the balanced scorecard should be derived.
