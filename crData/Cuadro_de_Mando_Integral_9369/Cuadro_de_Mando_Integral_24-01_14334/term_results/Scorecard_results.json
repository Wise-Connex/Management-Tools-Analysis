      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many businesses use non-financial and financial measures to evaluate their performance. Financial measurements alone are not enough to measure company performance in the current global competitive environment, so company management must also use non-financial measurements to measure their performance. Currently, the Tuban Regency Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) is trying to implement a balanced scorecard to assess its business performance. Based on this background, this research aims to show the advantages of implementing the Balanced scorecard as a benchmark that complements measuring tools that only measure profitability with added dimensions. This will enable management to make the right strategic decisions to achieve company goals. The variables used include company performance as measured by Return on Investment, company financial perspective as measured by Net Profit Margin, customer perspective as measured by the percentage of complaints, and an internal business process perspective as measured by employee productivity. This research uses primary data. Due to a lack of data, learning and growth perspectives were not included. Purposive sampling techniques and multiple linear regression analysis were used to collect data from 2018 to 2022. The t-test results showed that the financial perspective, customer perspective, and internal business process perspective did not influence company performance; however, the financial perspective, customer perspective, and internal business process perspective influenced company performance.&#x0D;\nABSTRAK: Banyak bisnis menggunakan pengukuran non-keuangan dan finansial untuk mengevaluasi kinerja mereka. Pengukuran finansial saja tidak cukup untuk mengukur kinerja perusahaan dalam lingkungan persaingan global saat ini, sehingga manajemen perusahaan harus menggunakan pengukuran non-keuangan juga untuk mengukur kinerja mereka. Saat ini, Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM) Kabupaten Tuban sedang berusaha menerapkan Balanced Scorecard untuk menilai kinerja bisnisnya. Berdasarkan latar belakang ini, tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menunjukkan keuntungan dari penerapan Balanced Scorecard sebagai tolak ukur yang melengkapi alat ukur yang hanya mengukur profitabilitas dengan dimensi yang ditambahkan. Ini akan memungkinkan manajemen membuat keputusan strategis yang tepat untuk mencapai tujuan perusahaan. Variabel yang digunakan termasuk kinerja perusahaan yang diukur dengan Return on Investment; perspektif keuangan perusahaan yang diukur dengan Net Profit Margin; perspektif pelanggan yang diukur dengan prosentase keluhan; dan perspektif proses bisnis internal yang diukur dengan produktivitas karyawan. Penelitian ini menggunakan data primer. Karena kurangnya data, perspektif pembelajaran dan pertumbuhan tidak disertakan. Teknik purposive sampling dan analisis regresi linier berganda digunakan untuk mengumpulkan data dari tahun 2018 hingga 2022. Hasil uji t menunjukkan bahwa perspektif keuangan, perspektif pelanggan, dan perspektif proses bisnis internal tidak memengaruhi kinerja perusahaan; namun, perspektif keuangan, perspektif pelanggan, dan perspektif proses bisnis internal memengaruhi kinerja perusahaan.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Determining strategic targets for Private Higher Education (PHEI) has an impact on the growth and reputation of the organization, which is a key factor in the successful performance of private universities. One method of setting strategic targets can be to adopt the conceptual framework of the Balance Scorecard (BSC) perspective, namely the Internal Process Perspective, Customer Perspective, Learning and Growth Perspective, and Financial Perspective. Therefore, it is important to carry out this research to analyze the relevance of BSC adoption to the goals or targets of PHEI. The aim of this research is to analyze and explore the use of BSC in setting PHEI goals and objectives as a strategic management review. This research method uses a systematic, transparent, and replicable literature review to analyze the literature on the BSC concept. The research objects are 12 private universities in Indonesia that are accredited A and Superior. The results of the research show that of the 4 BSC perspectives that are most dominantly mentioned in the goals or objectives of PHEI, the Learning and Growth Perspective is mentioned 28 times, the Internal Process Perspective is mentioned 15 times, the Customer Perspective is mentioned 13 times, and the last is the Financial Perspective was mentioned 10 times. So, there are some PHEI that do not mention the Financial Perspective and Customer Perspective aspects of their strategic goals or objectives. Therefore, the findings of this research can be used as a future evaluation study of strategic targeting that adopts the BSC conceptual framework perspective.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nKeywords: Balance Scorecard, Private Higher Education, Internal Process Perspective, Customer Perspective, Learning and Growth Perspective, Financial Perspective</jats:p>"

Taking School H as an example, this study utilizes the balanced scorecard to construct a system for evaluating school education performance at four levels: financial, customer satisfaction, internal operation processes, and learning and growth. Based on this basis, the weights of the educational management performance evaluation indicators at all levels are calculated by combining the entropy method and hierarchical analysis method, and the comprehensive evaluation scores of all indicators are derived. In addition, the multiple concurrent causal relationships and realization paths of the high-level development of educational management are also explored using the qualitative comparative analysis model. The results show that the evaluation score of educational management quality is 4.108, and the scores of each dimension of the secondary indexes are 4.102, 4.05, 4.13, and 4.15, respectively, which are above 4, indicating that the quality of educational management in the sample universities is good. This study provides the implementation steps of balanced scorecard performance evaluation for colleges and universities and, at the same time, provides a reference for other colleges and universities‚Äô performance evaluations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the causal relationship between a comprehensive reporting system (balanced scorecard ‚Äî BSC) and managerial time allocation when incentives are involved. The study examines whether managers adjust their time according to different performance areas when both financial and non-financial indicators are used for evaluation and reward. An experimental methodology was employed, involving managers from private and state-owned enterprises in Indonesia. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The findings indicate that managers do not spend more time on non-financial areas when a BSC is used, and do not spend less time on financial areas when bonuses are based on both financial and non-financial goals. These results challenge agency theory, which suggests that performance-based incentives align managerial behavior with organizational objectives. The study concludes that BSC and financial incentives do not significantly affect managerial time allocation as expected. Overall, the results of the research support Lipe and Salterio (2000), and Ullrich and Tuttle (2004), but the study also highlights that additional factors may need to be considered to fully understand how incentives and reporting systems influence managerial behavior. This paper contributes to the understanding of performance measurement and incentive systems in Indonesian enterprises by offering ideas for the design of effective management control systems.</jats:p>"

Good practices must be implemented to achieve sustainable marketing. The objective of this study is to achieve a clear vision in the short, medium, and long term, illustrating the strategic planning and key performance indicators of the company in a straightforward manner, and demonstrating that the management is achieving the desired results. Once the issue was identified, a descriptive and qualitative methodology was developed to analyze the impact of the BSC on the sustainability of the Cebu Minimarket market, situated in a municipality in Colombia. Primary sources were used in this process. A mixed-methods approach was employed to assess its effectiveness. This entailed conducting interviews with customers to gauge their perceptions of the business and with employees to obtain detailed insights into the marketing of the distributed products. This allowed for the development of a robust research foundation and the ability to effectively deploy the tool. The results are contingent on the implementation of effective financial and administrative management strategies, which are instrumental in fostering a stable economic environment, developing customer loyalty, promoting sustainable consumption, and optimizing internal processes. As a scientific novelty, this tool seeks to transform organizations into new administrative approaches where timely methods are fundamental for the generation of income and decision-making, thus energizing an economy where new technologies have become fundamental catalysts through the improvement of productivity and competitiveness. The results of this research enabled the measurement of the added values perceived by customers and employees. There was an innovative approach based mainly on commercial indicators, which was inadequate for comprehensive and effective strategic management.</jats:p>"

However, there are not many studies of CGQ in the Vietnamese public sector. In this regard, this study adopted and adapted the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) corporate governance scorecard and the Vietnamese Listed Company Awards scorecard to evaluate the CGQ of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Vietnam. Data from 220 equitized SOEs were collected from a self-administered survey and double-checked with information from in-depth interviews with the company‚Äôs managers and their documents. Collected data were analyzed to score the CGQ of surveyed companies. Results showed that the CGQ of survey companies met the basic requirements that comply with the legal framework. The analysis also showed the differences between two groups of state-owned enterprises: listed versus unlisted joint-stock companies. Based on the findings, we suggested companies improve and adjust their governance policies following 77 scorecard criteria and apply international best practices in corporate governance to promote their brand value to become more appealing to investors.</jats:p>",

Most markets are becoming increasingly dynamic. Organizations can no longer rely on a traditional analytical approach to understand their industry or market, since that market is changing in rapid and unexpected ways. In spite of its worldwide dissemination, balanced scorecard (BSC) has demonstrated inadequacy in certain circumstances. Some of the original advantages of the BSC can nowadays be interpreted as weaknesses. The authors suggest that in business dynamic environments, the benefits management approach, by using the benefits dependency network, can help BSCs to guide and support the benefits achievement related with investments, in a complementary way. By using a case study, they try to show how a BSC exhibits limitations to deal with business disruptive environments and how a benefits management approach brings a strengthened business implementation vision, from strategy down to operations.</jats:p>",

SN Electronics faced a 6% sales revenue decline for coolers and freezers in 2020, contrasting with competitors‚Äô growth. Thus, this analysis assesses the company‚Äôs performance, particularly its ISO 9001:2015 certification. Our evaluation uses the balanced scorecard method to analyze both financial and non-financial aspects of the company‚Äôs performance. The study also examines ISO 9001:2015 compliance and its impact on overall performance. Primary data gathered through interviews and observations involving top management and employees, analyzed with NVivo 12 Plus software. Results indicate strong non-financial performance but underperformance in financial aspects. Nonetheless, the company maintains robust ISO 9001:2015 compliance, positively influencing overall performance. This research underscores the necessity for top management to address financial issues, including price adjustments, while preserving satisfactory non-financial performance. This pioneering research integrates ISO 9001:2015 compliance with the balanced scorecard method, a novel approach. The findings reaffirm ISO 9001:2015‚Äôs significant role in enhancing company performance, aligning with its seven management principles.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The quality audit system for healthcare in various countries is based on the quality of medical services, the satisfaction of the patient and his relatives, as well as the quality of medical documentation. At the same time, quality indicators of healthcare facilities include criteria of the social and economic efficiency. Often these groups of indicators are considered by researchers separately from each other, and the literature available does not show balanced approaches to combining indicators from different groups within one process, which served as the basis for this work.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Aim</jats:bold>. The article is devoted to identifying the specifics of quality balanced scorecard for outpatient clinic using the example of the results of preventive examination for children in the first year of life.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Material and methods</jats:bold>. The study of quality indicators of the outpatient clinic was carried out from 2019 to 2023. The base of the study was the Clinical Consultative and Diagnostic Clinic ‚Ññ 27 in Novosibirsk. The study of the Clinic development was carried out from 2012 to 2023. The work used data from a social and expert survey of managers (20122018), as well as comparative modeling, general logical methods and techniques.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> The longest multi-level and complex medical service is the process of preventive examination of children in the first year of life. Therefore, using his example, a quality balanced scorecard for the outpatient clinic was developed. At the first stage, medical quality criteria were determined. Patients were interviewed and quality criteria important for the patients' parents were determined. The complexity, multi-stage nature and short time frame for providing medical services determined the criteria for the economic efficiency. At the second stage, criteria for the management effectiveness and criteria for quality monitoring were developed, which allow department heads to track key performance indicators, as well as build coordinated work between various departments. At the third stage, the quality criteria were developed, which, on the one hand, reflect the clinic work, and, on the other hand, are not redundant and can be used to assess the effectiveness of the organization as a whole.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> The study showed that to increase the sustainability of the clinic development, effective monitoring based on key performance indicators is necessary. The classical approach to determining the effectiveness of medical facilities is based on general performance indicators to the quality criteria of individual processes, which does not allow identifying violations in individual medical and auxiliary processes, and, accordingly, does not allow identifying ways to solve them. It also does not indicate the level of violation. The use of a process and system approach in developing quality criteria allows developing a quality balanced scorecard with respect to the criteria of various groups, which ultimately reflects the effectiveness of processes as a whole, provides an understanding of cause-and-effect relationships and identifies the root cause of destabilization.</jats:p>"

The enterprise is considered from the point of view of modeling business processes in accordance with the concept of a balanced scorecard (BSC). The importance of modeling the business process of workers remuneration in the context of digital transformation of the enterprise is shown. The efficiency of the entire production process largely depends on the business process of remuneration, which has a significant impact on the efficiency of the enterprise as a whole. The use of computer equipment and information technologies allows not only to form reasonable shift tasks on a daily basis and objectively take into account their implementation, but also to build a fundamentally new remuneration system. In the developed management systems in the conditions of digital transformation, it becomes possible to quickly, differentially and reliably assess the labor results of each employee and the workshop or site as a whole, ensuring economic interest in strictly performing planned shift tasks. The implementation of this method leads to increased motivation and productive, high-quality work, to economical use of material, energy and other resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main purpose of this research is to examine the effect of balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives (financial, customer, internal business process, and learning and growth) on banks‚Äô performance. The required data was collected through a questionnaire from 15 Jordanian banks. Using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) to analyse the data, the results show that financial, customer, and internal business process perspectives significantly positively affect the banks‚Äô performance. While perspectives of learning and growth have an insignificant influence on banks‚Äô performance. This result indicates that Jordanian banks have to pay more attention to the learning and growth perspective whenever they want to enhance their performance. This research contributes to the current literature regarding the association between the BSC and the firm‚Äôs performance by determining how the BSC perspectives affect the performance of the firms in one of the developing countries (Jordan). Implications of this study are multifaceted for the banks‚Äô managers, regulatory bodies, and decision-makers. The current research suggests that decision-makers and managers have to use BSC as a strategic tool since it positively affects firms‚Äô performance, due to the firms struggling to develop and enhance their performance. BSC perspectives can be considered as a suitable and useful tool to resolve such issues.</jats:p>"

Adaption of BSC is common among large and medium enterprises, but rare in micro-enterprises. This study quantitatively assessed the readiness of micro-enterprises in 4th and 5th class municipalities in Nueva Vizcaya in adapting BSC using the four perspectives: financial, customer, internal business process, and learning and growth, and their relationship among profile categories: initial capitalization, number of employees, years of business operation, and average annual sales. Snowball sampling was used to select 100- Department of Trade in Industry (DTI) accredited businesses in Ambaguio, Diadi, Quezon and Villaverde who were given survey questionnaires to accomplish. The study finds out that profile of respondents in terms of initial capitalization, number of employees, years of business operation, and average annual sales. The study revealed that micro-enterprises are most ready to adopt BSC based on financial perspective. Moreover, there is a moderately significant relationship in terms of initial capitalization and average annual sales and their readiness in adapting BSC, nonetheless, there is no indicator of connection in number of employees and longevity. Recommendations were crafted for business owners, future researchers and faculty for the use of the results and revisions of this study.</jats:p>"

Community care plays an important role in public health, but the association between community follow-up of key life characteristics and diabetes risk remains unclear.

The raw data underwent preprocessing and imbalance handling. Subsequently, features relevant to diabetes were selected and optimized to determine the optimal subset of features associated with community follow-up and diabetes risk. We established the diabetes risk assessment model. Furthermore, for a comprehensible and interpretable risk expression, the Weight of Evidence transformation method was applied to features. The transformed features were discretized using the quantile binning method to design the risk scorecard, mapping the model's output to five risk levels.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>In constructing the diabetes risk assessment model, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy.
