Here an atom can only be excited to a Rydberg state when one of its neighbors is already excited. Once two or more atoms are simultaneously excited mechanical forces emerge, which couple the internal electronic dynamics of this many-body system to external vibrational degrees of freedom in the lattice. This electron-phonon coupling results in a so-called phonon dressing of many-body states which in turn impacts on the facilitation dynamics. In our theoretical study we focus on a scenario in which all energy scales are sufficiently separated such that a perturbative treatment of the coupling between electronic and vibrational states is possible. This allows to analytically derive an effective Hamiltonian for the evolution of clusters of consecutive Rydberg excitations in the presence of phonon dressing. We analyze the spectrum of this Hamiltonian and show --- by employing Fano resonance theory --- that the interaction between Rydberg excitations and lattice vibrations leads to the emergence of slowly decaying bound states that inhibit fast relaxation of certain initial states. </jats:p>"

Therefore, the present study examined the relationship between core self-evaluations (CSE) and conspiracy mentality. Based on data of 596 participants, a small negative correlation was found using structural equation modeling (r = -.13, CR 95% [-.22, -.04]). People with a high conspiracy mentality tend to have relatively negative self-views. Future longitudinal studies could help clarify the causal link and maximum effect magnitude.</p>"

However, the collapse and fragmentation of the fuel rods as well as the melting and re-solidification of the core material during the core degradation process lead to complex changes in the core geometry, making it difficult to accurately simulate the relocation process of the melt in the core. Based on TMI-2 and Phebus FPT series experiments, a porous media model with transient flow and heat transfer both in the rod bundle region and debris bed region was established in this paper. The VOF and LEVEL SET methods were used to track the movement front of the corium in the core, as well as the coalescence process of local separate molten pools to form a large-scale core molten pool. Moreover, the efficient and stable IDEAL segregated algorithm was adopted to deal with the coupling problem of flow and heat transfer. The VOF and LEVEL SET methods were verified by the dam break problem, and the deviation of the results is within 10%. Using the above methods, the formation of a large-scale molten pool in the core and the relocation process of corium in the core region were simulated.</jats:p>",

In realistic gapped materials where interactions and disorder render the Bloch state not a viable starting point, we generalize these concepts by introducing dressed Berry curvature and quantum metric at finite temperature, in which the effect of many-body interactions can be included perturbatively. These quantities are extracted from the charge polarization susceptibility caused by linearly or circularly polarized electric fields, whose spectral functions can be measured from momentum-resolved exciton or infrared absorption rate. As a concrete example, we investigate Chern insulators in the presence of impurity scattering, whose results suggest that the quantum geometric properties are protected by the energy gap against many-body interactions. </jats:p>"

Remarkably, wave packets with non-zero energies bounce back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon.\nWe additionally observe a power-law localization of all eigenstates, each bordering a region of exponential suppression. These forbidden regions dictate the closest possible approach to the horizon of states with any given energy.\nThese numerical findings are supported by a semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories, which are shown to coincide with the geodesics expected for the effective metric emerging from the considered lattice models in the continuum limit.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fractional-slot PMSM motors allow for obtaining high values of power density factors, but at the same time, they are characterized by high values of rotor losses—in the rotor core and permanent magnets. The main causes of rotor losses in this type of motor are subharmonics and a high content of higher harmonics in the distribution of the magnetomotive force MMF. The use of a solid rotor core simplifies the construction and technology of the rotor but eddy current losses in the core account for a significant percentage of the total rotor losses. It is well known that a laminated core reduces eddy currents, while for motors with an outer rotor, it complicates the construction and increases weight. Thus, the question arises about the necessity to use a laminated core in a high power density motor and the real benefits of this. The article presents a comparison of the motors with a solid rotor core and a laminated rotor core, considering the value of rotor losses, power density factor, efficiency and the range of rotational speed and range of current load. The analysis was carried out for various types of sheets for laminated core and solid steel and SMC (Soft Magnetic Composite) material for solid rotor core. FEM models were used in the analysis, and the results were partially verified with the results of laboratory tests of motor models. The object of the analysis is a fractional-slot PMSM motor with an external rotor with surface permanent magnets (SPM). Motor weight is about 10 kg, and the maximum power is 50 kW at 4800 rpm.</jats:p>"

Consequently, telemetry data are the primary way to verify the status of the satellites in operation. The monitoring and interpretation of telemetry parameters relies on the operator’s experience. Therefore, telemetry data analysis is less reliable, considering the data’s complexity. This paper presents a Machine Learning (ML) approach to detecting anomalies in solar panel systems. The main challenge inherited from CubeSat is its capability to perform onboard inference of the ML model. Nowadays, several simple yet powerful ML algorithms for performing anomaly detection are available. This study investigates five ML algorithm candidates, considering classification score, execution time, model size, and power consumption in a constrained computational environment. The pre-processing stage introduces the windowed averaging technique besides standardization and principal component analysis. Furthermore, the paper features the background, bus system, and initial operational data of BIRDS-4, a constellation made of three 1U CubeSats released from the International Space Station in March 2021, with a ML model proposal for future satellite missions.</jats:p>"

Answers to this question shed light not only on infants but on children and adults in all cultures, because the core knowledge possessed by infants never goes away. Instead, it underlies the unspoken, commonsense knowledge of people of all ages, in all societies. By studying babies, researchers gain insights into infants themselves, into older children’s prodigious capacities for learning, and into some of the unconscious assumptions that guide our thoughts and actions as adults. To share these insights, the author distills the findings from research in developmental, comparative, and cognitive psychology, with excursions into studies of animal cognition in psychology and in systems and cognitive neuroscience, and studies in the computational cognitive sciences. Weaving across these disciplines, she paints a picture of what young infants know, and what they quickly come to learn, about objects, places, number, geometry, and people’s actions, social engagements, and mental states.</jats:p>",

Data from ground- and space-based instruments suggest that no single process is responsible and instead point to a cascade of mechanisms linking the solar interior with the solar wind. Electromagnetic energy derived from the Sun’s convection zone, and mediated by pseudo-Taylor column spin, gives rise to ohmic heating in the chromosphere raising its temperature to ~ 30,000 K. This triggers Joule-Thomson heating to 250,000 K in the transition region, whereupon plasma expansion in the near-vacuum of space takes over and brings the temperature to &gt;1-2 million K. Besides accounting for the zonation of the solar atmosphere, the proposed sequence helps to explain how temperature increases stepwise away from the solar core and why the solar wind and photospheric sunspots share periodicities. Tokamak theory and practice complement astronomical modelling as the basis for an explanation. The scheme may apply to other solar stellar coronae.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Deep learning (DL) applications, representing an emerging form of new software, are gaining increasing popularity by their intelligent and adaptive services. However, their service reliability depends highly on the prediction accuracy of their internally-integrated DL models. In practice, DL models are often observed to suffer from ill predictions upon abnormal inputs (e.g., adversarial attacking samples, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, and etc.), and this could easily lead to unexpected behaviors or even catastrophic consequences (e.g., system crash). One promising way to guard the application reliability is to reveal such abnormal inputs in time before they are fed to the DL models integrated in the concerned applications. Then remedy actions (e.g., discarding or fixing these inputs) can be done to protect applications from acting abnormally. Existing work addressed this revealing problem by either making sample distance-comparison based analysis or generating sufficient model mutants for comparative analysis. However, such treatments caused a restricted focus on samples only, while overlooking the DL models themselves, or had to analyze massive mutants, incurring non-negligible overheads to applications. In this article, we propose a novel approach, NetChopper, to conducting a core analysis on the target DL model, and then partitioning it into two parts, one associating closely with the training knowledge being the model core (expected to be important and thus stable), and the other being the remaining part (expected to be immaterial and thus changeable). Based on such partitioning, NetChopper proceeds to preserve (or freeze) the model core, but mutate the remaining part to produce only a small number of model mutants. Later, NetChopper becomes able to reveal abnormal inputs from normal ones by exploiting these model-relevant and light-weight mutants only. We experimentally evaluated NetChopper by widely-used DL subjects (e.g., MNIST+LeNet4, and CIFAR10+VGG16) and typical abnormal inputs (e.g., adversarial and OOD samples). The results reported NetChopper's promising AUROC scores in revealing the abnormal degrees of inputs, generally and stably outperforming, or comparably effective as, state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., mMutant, Surprise, and Mahalanobis), and also confirmed its high effectiveness and efficiency (with only marginal online overhead).</jats:p>"

A small satellite platform could provide global network coverage in low Earth orbit to these remote locations at a low cost. This paper describes the overall mission architecture and the implementation of remote IoT using a 1U volume in 6U CubeSat platform named KITSUNE. In KITSUNE, one of the missions is to leverage IoT for building a network of remote ground sensor terminals (GST) in 11 mostly developing countries. This paper evaluates the capacity and coverage of a satellite-based IoT network for providing remote data-collection services to these countries. The amount of data that could be collected from the GSTs and forwarded accurately to the users determines the actual capacity of the Store and Forward (S&amp;F) mission. Therefore, there are several proposed parameters to estimate this capacity in this study. In addition, these parameters are retrieved from the simulations, ground test results, and on-orbit observations with the KITSUNE satellite. The proposed IoT system, which is composed of the GSTs and IoT subsystem onboard KITSUNE satellite, is determined to be capable of providing valuable information from remote locations. In addition, the collected data are achieved and analyzed to monitor sensory data specific to each country, and it could help to generate prediction profiles as well.</jats:p>"

After 30 years of theoretical speculation and technological advances the internet is finally on the way to transforming in ways envisioned with the concept of ‘cyberspace’. The key analogy is no longer the magazine with separate pages but the city and its seamless web of spaces. The paper argues that this immersive internet delivers a superior, more productive platform for social exchange and communication. Co-location synergies will unfold and order the distribution of sites and enable an intuitive browsing navigation full of discoveries and serendipitous encounters, as well as creating sites for vivid crowd interactions. It is this superiority that will lead to architects taking over from graphic designers as profession owning the design of all online interaction frames.

AFM and MFM mode micrographs of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4/Ag powders confirm the formation of Fe3O4 particles in the nano-scale range. Both Fe3O4 and Fe3O4/Ag composite powders represented the superparamagnetic behavior due to the formation of nano-sized Fe3O4 particles. Furthermore, in-situ synthesis of Ag on the surface of magnetite nanoparticles increased the particle size, resulting in a decrease in the saturation magnetization. Moreover, based on the Maxwell-Garnet effective medium theory, a theoretical model was developed to determine the optical properties of suspended core-shell nanoparticles. A very good agreement may be found between the theoretical and experimental results. In addition, the local electric field in the particles, evaluated using the numerical Finite Element Method, showed that the electric field in the magnetite core may be amplified up to 20 times at the symmetrical SPR wavelength mode, depending on the silver shell thickness.</jats:p>"

In phase 2, qualitative interviews with parents and carers will aim to identify the outcomes of importance to these stakeholders. Phase 3 will see a comprehensive list of outcomes collated from the first two phases, grouped into domains according to an outcome taxonomy. Phase 4 will invite parents, health care professionals and researchers to participate in a two-round Delphi study to rate the importance of the presented outcomes.

Consequently, the Python-based framework consolidates a lot of work previously managed using a range of methodologies and technologies including Talend, Java and unix based scripting. Alongside the Darwin Core archive manipulation tools, it has handlers for harvesting data from secure external web services, web hosts or file servers.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The standardised approach to data loading paves the way for improved automation and workflow.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The performance growth in processors has been continuing toward increasing the number of processing cores on the chip and scaling the feature size of transistors. However, in the nano era, side effects of the scaling, such as induced heterogeneities in the performance, power, and soft error rate of identically designed cores, prevent the potential performance from being fully utilized. In this paper, we harness the mentioned side effects in shared-memory multicore processors with unpredictable workloads by a dynamic heuristic scheduling algorithm called HDSAP. The aim of HDSAP is to maximize performance, i.e. the average response time, under power and reliability constraints in presence of induced heterogeneities. In this regard, we use a mathematical model to quantify task to core assignments based on performance variation. We also consider the variation in power to change selected cores when the power constraint is missed. To meet the reliability constraint, we use N-Modular redundancy while being aware of the variation in soft error rate of cores to prevent under/over reliability estimation. To evaluate HDSAP, we run SPLASH benchmark suite on Sniper and MACPat simulators. As a result, the response time of HDSAP reduces by 6%, 8%, and 25% in comparison with similar algorithms under the same power and reliability constraints.</jats:p>"

If core stability properly controls postural stability during distal segment movements, trunk motion should be symmetric. Based on the assumption that head motion partially represents trunk motion, we developed a system that measures head angle and provides feedback music on head motion. If the head angle exceeds a predefined threshold, the music is muted in the earbud on the side of the head tilt. To investigate the relationship between core stability and asymmetric trunk motion, we measured mediolateral head angles during cycling using a self-developed system and compared them between individuals with good and poor core stability, and we investigated the effects of feedback music on mediolateral head motion during cycling. The poor-core-stability group showed significantly greater amplitude of, and less symmetry in, mediolateral head motion than the good-core-stability group. Furthermore, feedback music significantly reduced the amplitude of mediolateral head motion in the good- and poor-core-stability groups and improved symmetry in mediolateral head motion in the poor-core-stability group. Our findings imply that core stability is important for maintaining symmetry in head motion during cycling. Feedback music could be useful for establishing symmetry in head motion during cycling.</jats:p>"

In multi-core systems, aggressive prefetching may harm the system. In the past, prefetching throttling strategies usually set thresholds through certain factors. When the threshold is exceeded, prefetch throttling strategies will control the aggressive prefetcher. However, these strategies usually work well in homogeneous multi-core systems and do not work well in heterogeneous multi-core systems. This paper considers the performance difference between cores under the asymmetric multi-core architecture. Through the improved hill-climbing method, the aggressiveness of prefetching for different cores is controlled, and the IPC of the core is improved. Through experiments, it is found that compared with the previous strategy, the average performance of big core is improved by more than 3%, and the average performance of little cores is improved by more than 24%.</jats:p>"

Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have been extensively used for the exploitation of these unconventional resources. According to engineering practice, some shale gas wells with low flowback rate of fracturing fluids may obtain high yield which is different from the case of conventional sandstone reservoirs, and fracturing fluid absorbed into formation by spontaneous imbibition is an important mechanism of gas production. This paper integrates NMR into imbibition experiment to examine the effects of fractures, fluid salinity, and surfactant concentration on imbibition recovery and performance of shale core samples with different pore-throat sizes acquired from the Longmaxi Formation in Luzhou area, the Sichuan Basin. The research shows that the right peak of T2 spectrum increases rapidly during the process of shale imbibition, the left peak increases rapidly at the initial stage and changes gently at the later stage, with the peak of the left peak shifting to the right. The result indicates that water first enters the fracture system quickly, then enters the small pores near the fracture wall due to the effect of the capillary force, and later gradually sucks into the deep and large pores. Both imbibition rate and capacity increase with increased fracture density, decreased solution salinity, and decreased surfactant concentration. After imbibition flowback, shale permeability generally increases by 8.70–17.88 times with the average of 13.83 times. There are also many microcracks occurring on the end face and surface of the core sample after water absorption, which may function as new flowing channels to further improve reservoir properties. This research demonstrates the imbibition characteristics of shale and several relevant affecting factors, providing crucial theory foundations for the development of shale gas reservoirs.</jats:p>"

OpenMC is a community-developed Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport simulation code. CTF is a subchannel thermal-hydraulics code designed for Light Water Reactor analysis. In this work, OpenMC and CTF are coupled for the analysis of light water reactor fuel assembly. OpenMC provides axial and radial fuel pin normalized power distribution to CTF, and CTF gives the fuel temperatures and coolant properties to the neutronics simulation of OpenMC. The windowed multipole temperature method is used in OpenMC to match the accurate temperature distribution of fuel rods and coolants obtained from CTF. In this study, the OpenMC/CTF is applied and validated using the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA) core physics benchmark problem 6, from the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors. The problem involves a three-dimensional fuel assembly in Hot Full Power conditions. The Keff eigenvalue, pin power distribution, fuel temperatures, and coolant properties are obtained and compared with VERA’s reference results (MPACT/CTF). Our converged results showed good consistency with the reference solution, eigenvalue differences agreed within 183 pcm, axially-integrated normalized radial fission distribution difference agreed within +1.4%/−1.9%, local volume-averaged fuel pin temperatures agreed within +26.3°C, and local subchannel exit coolant temperatures agreed within +3.6°C/−0.4°C. These preliminary solutions prove that OpenMC coupled to CTF method has shown high-fidelity results in the three-dimensional fuel assembly neutronics and thermal-hydraulics coupled problems.</jats:p>",

These viruses share inner core particles (ICPs) that conform to icosahedral, T=2*, symmetry, but differ in two major respects: first, the presence or absence of RNA-capping turrets at each icosahedral vertex; second, the number of additional host-specific capsid layers that are often lost upon cell entry. While the role of these additional layers in host infection is generally understood, the absence of asymmetric ICP structures from turreted, multilayered reoviruses has obfuscated our understanding of how successive removal of these external layers impact the structural organization of the ICP and transcription initiation. Here, we present the 3.3 Å resolution structure of the aquareovirus (ARV) ICP, and atomic models of the capsid proteins VP3 and VP6, transcriptional enzymatic complex (TEC) subunits VP2 and VP4, and RNA-capping turret protein VP1. These structures reveal significant differences when compared to those of the coated ARV, as well as their counterparts in single-layered cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV). Compared to the double-layered ARV virion and infectious subvirion particle structures, the ARV ICP undergoes significant capsid expansion and widening of the nucleotide processing channels in its TEC and turret. Thus, the loss of outer capsid layers may regulate transcription initiation in ARV, unlike CPV which relies solely on allosteric regulation by binding transcriptional cofactors. These results shed new light on the mechanism of transcription initiation amongst turreted, multilayered members of <jats:italic>Reoviridae</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

I consider the jittering jets explosion mechanism where there are several stochastic jet-launching episodes, each lasting for about 0.01–0.1 s. The collapsing core material passes through the stalled shock at about 100 km and then slowly flows onto the proto-neutron star (NS). I assume that the proto-NS launches jittering jets, and that the jets break out from the stalled shock. I examine the boosting process by which the high-pressure gas inside the stalled shock, the gain region material, expands alongside the jets and does work on the material that the jets shock, the cocoon. This work is crudely equal to the energy that the original jets carry. I argue that the coupling between instabilities, stochastic rotation, magnetic fields, and jittering jets leads to most CCSN explosions. In other cases, the pre-collapse core is rapidly rotating and therefore ordered rotation replaces stochastic rotation and fixed jets replace jittering jets.</jats:p>",

In this study, we characterized the ability of a specific variant of the human cGAS-encoding gene MB21D1, rs610913, to alter cGAS-mediated DNA sensing and viral infection. rs610913 is a frequent G&amp;gt;T polymorphism resulting in a P261H exchange in the cGAS protein. Data from the International Collaboration for the Genomics of HIV suggested that rs610913 nominally associates with HIV-1 acquisition in vivo. Molecular modeling of cGAS(P261H) hinted toward the possibility for an additional binding site for a potential cellular cofactor in cGAS dimers. However, cGAS(wild-type [WT]) or cGAS(P261H)-reconstituted THP-1 cGAS knockout cells shared steady-state expression of IFN-stimulated genes, as opposed to cells expressing the enzymatically inactive cGAS(G212A/S213A). Accordingly, cGAS(WT) and cGAS(P261H) cells were less susceptible to lentiviral transduction and infection with HIV-1, HSV-1, and Chikungunya virus as compared with cGAS knockout or cGAS(G212A/S213A) cells. Upon DNA challenge, innate immune activation appeared to be mildly reduced upon expression of cGAS(P261H) compared with cGAS(WT). Finally, DNA challenge of PBMCs from donors homozygously expressing rs610913 provoked a trend toward a slightly reduced type I IFN response as compared with PBMCs from GG donors. Taken together, the steady-state activity of cGAS maintains a baseline antiviral state rendering cells more refractory to IFN-stimulated gene–sensitive viral infections. rs610913 failed to grossly differ phenotypically from the WT gene, suggesting that cGAS(P261H) and WT cGAS share a similar ability to sense viral infections in vivo.</jats:p>",

A common approach to phylogenomics is to extract related genes from each organism, build a multiple sequence alignment and then reconstruct evolution relations through a phylogenetic tree. Often a set of highly conserved genes occurring in single-copy, called core genes, are used for this analysis, as they allow efficient automation within a taxonomic clade. Here we introduce the Universal Fungal Core Genes (UFCG) database and pipeline for genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of fungi. The UFCG database consists of 61 curated fungal marker genes, including a novel set of 41 computationally derived core genes and 20 canonical genes derived from literature, as well as marker gene sequences extracted from publicly available fungal genomes. Furthermore, we provide an easy-to-use, fully automated and open-source pipeline for marker gene extraction, training and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The UFCG pipeline can identify marker genes from genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data, while producing phylogenies consistent with those previously reported, and is publicly available together with the UFCG database at<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://ufcg.steineggerlab.com\">https://ufcg.steineggerlab.com</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>"

In some other LSNe the total energy of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and these two extra sources combined is smaller than the kinetic energy that the fitting yields. These difficulties suggest that, like earlier claims that jets power superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), jets also power the less luminous LSNe. A magnetar might also supply energy. However, in most cases jets supply more energy than the magnetar, during the explosion and possibly at late times. I strengthen an earlier claim that jets launched at magnetar birth cannot be ignored. I explain the trend of maximum rise time for a given luminosity of hydrogen deficient core collapse supernovae, in particular LSNe and SLSNe, with a toy model of jets that are active for a long time after explosion.</jats:p>",

Finally, we compare the NUV characteristics of these families with (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. In this work, we also study systematic effects due to the use of the five commonly used stars in Landolt’s catalog as solar analogs to obtain the asteroid reflectance in the NUV wavelength range.

We also find that, even though the Themis family and the PolanaEulalia family complex show a similar blueness at visible wavelengths, the NUV absorption of the Themis family is much deeper than that of the Polana-Eulalia family complex. We did not find significant differences between the New Polana and Eulalia families in terms of the NUV-VIS slope. (162173) Ryugu’s and (101955) Bennu’s spectral characteristics in the NUV-VIS overlaps with those of the Polana-Eulalia family complex which implies that it is the most likely origin of these two near-Earth asteroids.</jats:p>",

Underlying all political practice is the logic of a ‘new dualism’ between the governing majority on the one hand and the parliamentary opposition on the other. This influences how the involved actors contribute in different ways to the key functions of parliament: election, legislation, control, and communication—all of which are aimed at achieving representation and consequently legitimacy. For a complete understanding, both publicly visible and invisible interactions and influences between parliament and the executive as well as the political parties need to be considered.

In this work, we propose a feasible experiment scheme using three legs superconducting circuits with transmon qubits to realize a Hall tube. Then we first investigate its topological properties. Since the time–reversal, particle–hole, and chiral symmetries are all broken for the system, the Hall tube belongs to the A class of the Altland–Zirnbauer classification. We obtain the corresponding topological phase transition both numerically and analytically. Since the chirality is a key character of the quantum Hall effect, we secondly investigate the chiral physics in the Hall tube. We find the topological protected chiral edge currents and discuss its robustness. Finally, we give the possible experimental observations of the topological state and topological protected chiral edge currents.</jats:p>",

The author aims to broaden those observations and to answer the following question: can the portrayal of the female protagonist in Ōshima’s film — in the light of contemporary standards of pornography — be viewed as emancipated? In order to resolve this issue, the article concludes with a comparison between In the Realm of the Senses and Anne W. Eaton’s model of a feminist pornographic film.</jats:p>"

Here, we have introduced a new approach to directly synthesis the core-shell of Au@Cu and its Au@Cu<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O oxides on an FTO electrode for non-enzymatic glucose detection. Physical vapor deposition of Au thin film followed by thermal annealing has been used to fabricate Au nanocores on the electrode. The Cu shells have been deposited selectively on the Au cores using an electrodeposition method. Additionally, Au@Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and Au@CuO have been synthesized via post thermal annealing of the Au@Cu electrode. This binder-free and selective-growing approach has the merit of high electrooxidation activity owing to improving electron transfer ability and providing more active sites on the surface. Electrochemical measurements indicate the superior activity of the Au@Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O electrode for glucose oxidation. The high sensitivity of 1601 μAcm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>mM<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and a low detection limit of 0.6 μM are achieved for the superior electrode. Additionally, the sensor indicates remarkable reproducibility and supplies accurate results for glucose detection in human serums. Moreover, this synthesis approach can be used for fast, highly controllable and precise fabrication of many core-shell structures by adjusting the electrochemical deposition and thermal treatment parameters.</jats:p>"

For space gas-cooled reactors, the impact of the submerged accidents after a launch abort situation must be considered. In such an accident, the core void is filled with seawater and wet sand, the neutron spectrum in the reactor is thermalized, and the reactivity increases significantly and probably making the reactor supercritical. In this paper, the research focuses on a novel control system named the control ring. Two different neutron-absorption materials are doped in the control ring, and the reactivity control effect of the control ring in submerged accidents is analyzed with different enrichments of fuel. Also, the burnup and neutron spectrum of these two materials are also studied. The result shows that the performance of the reactivity control effect of gadolinium in the submerged accidents is equal to boron-10, and the control effect of the control drums will slightly increase when gadolinium is doped in the control ring. In addition, the reactivity penalty of gadolinium is smaller than boron-10. These results can provide a reference for the design of space gas-cooled nuclear reactors.</jats:p>",

Currently, only limited research has been focusing on compressive membrane action in prestressed concrete elements, or on concrete elements with large cavities, such as precast concrete hollow core slabs. Therefore, a novel real-scale test setup has been developed in order to assess this effect in precast hollow core slabs, and how it can enhance the load-carrying capacity in accidental events. In parallel with these tests, a numerical finite element model has been developed in order to perform a more detailed structural analysis of this phenomenon, and to study the influence of various input parameters. The details of this test setup are briefly explained, and some relevant experimental test results are provided. Considering the experimental findings and validated numerical model, this contribution aims to quantify the influence of compressive membrane action on the structural reliability of precast concrete hollow core slabs. To this end, probabilistic models for the most important material and geometric variables are gathered, and the structural reliability is assessed using Latin Hypercube sampling. Overall, the results indicate that considering the formation of compressive membrane action strongly influences the variability of the ultimate load-carrying capacity of precast concrete hollow core slabs.</jats:p>"

The target molecules show biological activity. So, the current work is aiming to improve the activity and the properties of the benzo indole by attaching with a naturally occurring, and biodegradable compounds represented by 2-deoxy-2-amino -d-glucose and 6-deoxy-6-amino-d-glucose to synthesis both mono and di-saccharides derivatives of benzo indole. Two steps synthesis were used for mono-saccharide derivatives and three steps for di-saccharide derivatives, the first is the functionalization of 1,1,2-trimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indole [1] via the reaction with POCl3 to  produce 2-(1,1-dimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indol-2(3H)-ylidene) malonaldehyde [2] with two aldehydes reaction centers, while in the second step the latter was coupled with sugar via amino groups to get the two monosaccharide derivatives [3,5], while the disaccharides molecules [4,6] taken one more step with harder conditions to  overcome the steric hindrance at the other reaction center. The purity and characterization of the target molecules was confirmed using spectroscopy methods including 1H NMR and 13 NMR.

Based on the flow-induced vibration test of the RVI scale model, the fluctuating pressure data of the CB is obtained. The parameters such as power spectral density (PSD), correlation length and coherence function are obtained by processing the test data. Thus, the cross-power spectral density between any two points is got through these parameters. The root mean square (RMS) response of the CB is obtained by random vibration analysis (frequency domain). Then, the CFD model is established and large eddy simulation (LES) is used to obtain the time history of the fluctuating pressure of the CB. The response of the CB is obtained by time integration method (time domain). The calculation results by using these two methods are in good agreement with the experimental results.</jats:p>",

Yet, studies evaluating various core exercise programs on core muscle function and ball-throwing velocity yield varying results. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the effects of these programs on ball-throwing velocity and trunk muscle function based on the focus of the training program. Searches were conducted using MEDLINE on November 24, 2020, and updated on April 27, 2022. Articles were included if the training was administered to overhead-throwing athletes, targeted the core musculature, and had at least 1 comparison group. Of a total of 875 articles retrieved, 11 were selected for analysis. The synthesis of evidence suggests that (a) commonly used spinal stabilization exercises may improve trunk muscle endurance and isometric strength, but not ball-throwing velocity; (b) advanced spinal stabilization exercises performed on a sling suspension system can improve ball-throwing velocity; and (c) trunk plyometrics using medicine balls can improve trunk rotational strength, power, and ball-throwing velocity. More challenging core exercises that incorporate unstable surfaces, higher resistance, and dynamic trunk movement seem necessary to promote improvement in ball-throwing velocity.</jats:p>",

The core barrel is connected to the interior walls of the reactor vessel at or adjacent to the area where the cylindrical and hemispherical portions of the reactor vessel meet. Below the main core support, i.e. the core barrel that is capped at its lower end with the lower core support, the hemispherical vessel defines a lower head or lower plenum. A generally annular downcomer surrounds the reactor core barrel between the core barrel and an inner wall of the reactor vessel. Cooling fluid, typically water, is pumped into this annular downcomer. The coolant fluid circulates downward into the lower plenum. The hemispherical shape of the lower plenum assists in evenly circulating the coolant fluid therein.

According to patent filing history, dozens of devices have been proposed to uniform the distribution of coolant flow. Those device could be categorized several kinds. As coolant flow in the fringe of low core plate, firstly the cylinder shape has been applied to prevent the vortex. This biggest vortex is formed by that the downflow from core barrel has 180° direction diverting with the upflow into LCP, diverting between the high speed flows. In order to maintain adequate and uniform cooling throughout the core, it is important that a uniform coolant flow and pressure be maintained across all of the reactor core coolant inlet openings in the lower core support plate. The second way to is put some device in the bottom of lower plenum to prevent vortex. The third is changing flow distribution of LCP by setting some flow limiting devices.</jats:p>",

In ATHENA, full-scale systems and their mutual interactions will be tested in steady state and relevant transient conditions. The Core Simulator is the electrical heating system and aims to be representative of an ALFRED average fuel assembly (FA). CFD codes are gaining attention for the analysis of complex systems in pool-type reactors, since they are able to reproduce with high accuracy 3D TH phenomena. In this paper a multiscale approach based on porous media (PM) is proposed to reduce the computational cost of the Core Simulator CFD model. Firstly, the PM hydraulic behavior is characterized by means of CFD simulations on the infinite lattice domain. Then PM are applied in the system model in place of fuel assemblies (FAs). Three different approaches are investigated: (1) adopting a single porous domain for the entire FA ; (2) representing the FA with two porous domains; (3) adopting the so-called hybrid medium model. The results obtained with the PM models are validated against a detailed CFD simulation of the Core Simulator to evaluate the performance of the three approaches. Then, the best solution is applied on a model of the entire ATHENA Core Simulator integrated with the feeding region. The model is tested in simple transient conditions. The numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the multiscale approach in reducing the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy in representing the quantities of interest.</jats:p>",

The results show that the thickness inhomogeneity affects the confinement loss spectrum through confinement loss increase and frequency red- and blue-shift of the high loss spectral regions. The magnitudes of the confinement loss increase and the high-loss region frequency shift strongly depend on the spatial distribution of the thickness inhomogeneity. The study provides insight into the loss mechanism of non-ideal tube lattice fibers, it allows quantifying the impact of such kind of structural deformations, identifying the route to make fibers more resilient to such fabrication imperfections, and highlighting once again the importance played in inhibited-coupling fibers by the interaction between core modes and the intricate set of cladding modes.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The reason for filling the core with different refractive index of liquids is that changeable refractive index of the core is an option to adjust the sensor performance at different intervals of analyte refractive index. Due to changes in the core refractive index, a large RI detection range from 1.38 to 1.53 is obtained and the sensor exhibits maximum spectral sensitivity of 10,000 nm/RIU. The properties of the sensor are calculated by the finite element method. The geometrical parameters of the sensor such as analyte height and gold thickness are also evaluated.

While the role of RAS/MAPK genes have been well studied in cancer, less is known about their function during neurodevelopment. There are many genes that work in concert to regulate RAS/MAPK signaling, suggesting that if common brain phenotypes could be discovered they could have a broad impact on the many other disorders caused by distinct RAS/MAPK genes. We assessed the cellular and molecular consequences of hyperactivating the RAS/MAPK pathway using two distinct genes in a cell type previously implicated in RAS/MAPK-mediated cognitive changes, cortical GABAergic interneurons. We uncovered some GABAergic core programs that are commonly altered in each of the mutants. Notably, hyperactive RAS/MAPK mutants bias developing cortical interneurons towards those that are somatostatin+. The increase in somatostatin+ interneurons could also be induced by elevated neural activity and we show the core RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is one mechanism by which this occurs. Overall, these findings present new insights into how different RAS/MAPK mutations can converge on GABAergic interneurons, which may be important for other RAS/MAPK genes/disorders.</jats:p>"

The original rationale of core inflation was to remove volatile items with transitory shocks. But aside from gasoline, the list of excluded items is far from optimal. Core inflation also su˙ers from other severe deficiencies, common to all exclusion indexes. Excluded items often have persistent trends; thus excluding them imparts a significant time-varying bias. Items that are not excluded can experience high volatility, and will cause exclusion indexes to depart notably from trend inflation—as core PCE has done at crucial moments. Two other prominent trend inflation measures, trimmed mean PCE inflation and median PCE inflation, gracefully address these issues (though neither is perfect). A wide variety of evidence comparing these three trend measures is provided. The findings indicate that, for a variety of considerations that are relevant for both trend inflation estimation and for monetary policy deliberations and communication, either trimmed mean PCE inflation or median PCE inflation are superior measures.</jats:p>"

A successful design methodology for sandwich panels should aim at maximising this potential for weight reduction while considering the various possible failure mode in a simple yet accurate manner. This paper investigates the application of steel sandwich panels as two-way deck systems. Near-optimal designs for all-steel Rectangular Honeycomb Core Sandwich Panels (RHCSPs) under general out-of-plane loading are achieved using a gradient-based optimisation method. The method relies on continuously optimising the design limit state constraints while the response constraints are considered a priori in the analysis stage using simplified analytical assessment. Plate bending solutions and sandwich bending solutions are used as alternatives to estimate the internal stresses on each layer of the sandwich panel under out-of-plane loads, where comparisons are made between these two analysis methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. The internal stresses are then used to formulate design limit state equations for each relevant failure mode, including material yielding, plate buckling and deformation control. The Method of Moving Asymptotes is used for the optimisation of RHCSPs, considering the limit states as the constraints of the optimisation problem and weight as the objective function to be minimised. The proposed methodology for simplified assessment is verified against detailed nonlinear finite element models for optimal design solutions. The implications of the results of the proposed optimisation strategy on the development of a systematic design methodology for RHCSPs are also highlighted, making specific reference to critical failure modes.</jats:p>",

It employed a researchers’ validated and reliability-tested core value awareness and practice questionnaires. In data analysis, Mean, Standard Deviation, Kruskal Wallis, and Spearman Rank Correlation were used.&#x0D;\nResults: Generally, the level of awareness (M=4.38, SD= 0.40) is very high. Particularly, all core values of maka-Diyos (M=4.43; SD=0.50), makatao (M=4.32; SD=0.52), makakalikasan (M=4.25, SD= 0.57), and makabansa (M=4.54, SD= 0.45) were rated very high.

It is also showed that there were no significant differences in terms of religion [U=2967.0, p=0.323] and family structure [χ2(2)=1.798, p=0.407]. Meanwhile, in terms of sex [U=4553.5, p=0.004], there was a significant difference in the students' awareness while there was no significant difference in the extent of practice when grouped according to sex [U=5075.5, p=0.072], religion [U=2848.5, p=0.184], and family structure [χ2(2)=3.253, p=0.197]. In terms of correlation, there was a significant relationship between the awareness and practice [ρ(219)=0.761, p=0.000] of public school core values.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The core value awareness and practice of maka-Diyos, makatao, makakalikasan, and makabansa is sustainably established among the students when the public school strongly implements and promotes this Department of Education (DepEd) mandate. Making these values visible in the school environment can help the learners recognize their importance.</jats:p>"

In the world, the special supply-demand relationship and flexibility requested by users of the energy market make small and micro nuclear reactors a key development trend, while small and micro lead-cooled fast nuclear reactors show great competitiveness. In the present paper, a micro LBE (lead-bismuth eutectic) - cooled Fast Reactor is proposed, on which a preliminary conceptual core design has been conducted. This micro LBE-cooled Fast Reactor has thermal power of 12 MW, while the reactivity controlled by 12 control drums. Neutronics analysis was performed by a Monte-Carlo code cosRMC jointly developed by State Power Investment Corporation Research Institute of China and Tsinghua University. The calculation results showed that the reactivity control performance meets the safety criteria, giving a coolant reactivity of −0.0976 pcm/K at BOL, −0.1955 pcm/K at MOL, and −0.1195 pcm/K at EOL, coolant voiding coefficient −31.24 pcm/% at BOL, −24.16 pcm/% at MOL, and −17.72 pcm/% at EOL, and fuel Doppler coefficient −0.6981 pcm/K at BOL, −0.7239 pcm/K at MOL, and −0.6902 pcm/K at EOL. The power distribution was flattened enough with a radical power peak factor 1.185 at BOL, 1.136 at MOL, and 1.155 at EOL.</jats:p>",

A fifth subunit, Gon7, is found only in Fungi and Metazoa. Mutations in all five genes encoding human KEOPS subunits leads to Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a severe genetic disease causing childhood lethality. Here, we describe the discovery and biochemical characterization of the archaeal fifth KEOPS subunit. This protein, dubbed Pcc2, is a paralog of Pcc1 and is widely conserved in Archaea. Pcc1 and Pcc2 form a heterodimer in solution, show modest sequence conservation but very high structural similarity. The 5-subunit KEOPS lost its capacity to form dimers but its tRNA binding and t<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>A synthetic activity remained robust. Pcc2 can substitute Pcc1 but the resulting KEOPS complex is inactive suggesting a distinct function for the two paralogs. Comparative sequence and structure analyses point to a possible evolutionary link between archaeal Pcc2 and eukaryotic Gon7 proteins. Our work thus reveals that Pcc2 has evolved to regulate the oligomeric state of KEOPS complex thus adding another layer of complexity to the biosynthesis of t<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>A that seems to be conserved from Archaea to Eukaryotes.</jats:p>"

Public service with better quality can be provided. This study adopts the “survey techniques.” The survey is based on the “managerial core competency items of the mid and high-level management positions in the agencies under the Executive Yuan.” There are 6 items of core competency aspects (problem analysis, project management, performance management, information management, communications and coordination, and team building) established and there are 16 items as basic competencies. Testing is applied to the middle manager, the director and deputy director and chief of staff of the service units of the K City government based on the survey highlights. It is hoped to discuss the managerial core competencies and their training requirements for the middle manager of the local government. The purpose is to enhance the competency at the job in order to strengthen the managerial core competency of the middle manager of the City government.

The theory that cancer is caused by bioelectrical circuitry malfunctions in cells is now widely acknowledged. This opens up the possibility of using bioelectronic medicine to develop new cancer treatments by influencing the disease's bioelectrical properties. To meet societal and technical obstacles, today's individuals aspire to better their quality of life. So, in the midst of all of this, bioelectronic medicine has altered the way we practice medicine and has proven to dramatically enhance healthcare outcomes.  This technique employs a variety of procedures, such as neuromodulation, to treat a specific disease, ailment, or damage. Interfacing electronics with nerves to specifically target the biological processes underlying diseases. In cancer, screening and early detection are crucial for the patient's therapy to be successful and for the patient's survival percentage to grow. For illness diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up, the development of analytical methods for non-invasive detection through the analysis of cancer biomarkers is crucial. Tumor biomarkers are substances or processes that indicate the existence of cancer in the body in clinical situations. These biomarkers can be detected using biosensors, which are popular alternatives to traditional approaches due to their speed, accuracy, and point-of-care applicability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study, the effect of plasmon resonance on magneto-plasmonic  spherical core-shell nanocomposite enclosed in a dielectric host medium is theoretically investigated by applying electrostatic approximation (esa) and Maxwell-Garnet effective medium theories to obtain magneto-optical parameters such as; effective electric permittivity and magnetic permeability as well as the corresponding extinction cross-sections. Likewise, for a fixed size of QDs (of radius  nm) numerical analysis was performed to determine the plasmonic resonance effect by varying the parameters such as the metal fraction (β) and the dielectrics (εh) of the host medium on the magneto-plasmonic nanostructures (nss). The results depict that graphs of absorption, scattering, and extinction cross-sections as a function of wavelength have two positions of resonance peaks. The first set of peaks are in the ultraviolet (uv) and the second located in visible regions. These peaks originated from the strong coupling between a regular periodic vibrations of surface plasmons of silver (Ag) with the excitonic state of the dielectric/semiconductor at the internal ( ) and external (Ag/host) interfaces. As β increases, the absorption and scattering cross-sections are blue-shifted in the first peak and red shifted the second set of peaks. Similarly, as εh increases or as β decreases, the sets of resonance peaks for extinction cross-section gets enhanced; while keeping one of these parametric quantities fixed at once. The resulting surface plasmon resonance effect might be utilized in a variety of applications that combines both the plasmonic and magnetic core-shell nanostructures ranging from UV to Visible spectral regions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In recent years, With the development of computer hardware, the supercomputer industry has ushered in a stage of rapid development, and its architecture has also evolved from traditional multi-core to many-core and heterogeneous many-core. Among them, sunway Many-Core Platform series with completely independent intellectual property rights is the representative of China’s supercomputing heterogeneous many-core processors. As a computing kernel, SpMV (sparse matrix-vector multiplication) is of great significance in scientific and engineering computing whose computing performance often has a great impact on the overall performance of applications. The article analyzes the master-slave acceleration architecture of the SW26010p Many-Core Platform processor and the implementation of the sparse matrix in the CSR storage format on the SW26010p Many-Core Platform. Due to the limited memory of the slave core of the SW26010p, the vector data stored in large-scale SpMV cannot be satisfied, resulting in a long memory access time and reduced performance. To solve this problem and optimize the calculation performance of SpMV, this paper has launched a research on the optimization strategy of SpMV for SW26010p Many-Core Platform. Firstly, we propose a method of assigning tasks by the number of rows in which the non-zero elements are located to solve the load balancing problem among slave cores. Secondly, we propose an adaptive memory allocation algorithm for LDM to achieve the optimal use of LDM memory. Thirdly, according to the refined division of the LDM space, various algorithms such as the dynamic and static double cache algorithm based on the secondary core architecture LRU and LUR-k, and the dynamic and static cache elimination algorithm based on the secondary core architecture ARC are proposed to improve the hit rate of vector <jats:italic>x</jats:italic> respectively. the performance of SpMV is optimized by reducing communication time and improving calculation and memory access ratio. Finally, several representative sparse matrices are selected from matrix set (Market) and tested, and the performance of several algorithms is analyzed. The results show that compared with the traditional method, the overall <jats:italic>x</jats:italic> hit ratio of our scheme is greatly improved, and the master-slave acceleration ratio is also greatly improved, the maximum acceleration ratio can reach more than 20 times and the average speed-up ratio can reach 10.5 times, which has a very good optimization effect. Meanwhile, the optimization methods adopted in this paper can be used for reference for other complex applications of SW26010p.</jats:p>"

Self-development in the form of understanding their fundamental attributes, personality and defence mechanisms is essential for one's growth and development. Individuals can objectively evaluate their strengths and areas they need to improve in if they have a solid understanding of their core-self evaluations, personality traits, and coping abilities. One is more likely to feel fulfilled in their personal lives by enabling themselves to investigate important areas of self-improvement which in turn could help them professionally. The aim of the current research is to study the effects of core self-evaluation, personality and coping in college students and working professionals. Standardized scales were used to measure the variables. A total of 40 college students falling in the age category 18-25 years and 40 working professionals belonging to the age group 20-40 years participated in the study. The results found out that core self-evaluation is positively correlated with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism while there is no correlation between coping and core self-evaluation and personality. No significant difference could be drawn between students and working professionals in core self-evaluation, personality and coping. Therefore, aiding individuals in gaining more knowledge about how CSE, personality, and coping shape a person can benefit the forthcoming generation to understand what aspects can help them develop successful career and personal growth plans.</jats:p>"

Using a lectin array on biotinylated protein, we found that the prototypic galectin-1 negatively influenced the expression of galactose epitopes on the surface of monocytic cells. On the other hand, the tandem-repeat galectin-8 and, to a certain extent, the chimeric galectin-3 promoted the expression of these residues. Jacalin flow cytometry and pull-down experiments further demonstrated that galectin-8 causes a profound upregulation of mucin-type O-glycosylation in cell surface proteins from primary monocytes and THP-1 cells. Overall, these results highlight the emerging role of the galectin signature on inflamed tissues and provide new insights into the contribution of extracellular galectins to the composition of the glycocalyx in human monocytes.</jats:p>"

A grinding temperature prediction model was established using the circular contact moving heat source model, and the grinding temperature of the workpiece surface was predicted and the control strategy was studied in conjunction with the grinding experimental results to evaluate the dry grinding adaptability of the MOX core block based on the workpiece surface grinding temperature. The results show that when the grinding wheel linear speed Vs = 60 m/s, the workpiece feed linear speed Vwt = 627mm/s, and the grinding depth is in the range of 0.01mm∼0.04mm single side grinding depth, the grinding temperature of the workpiece surface is below 200°C, and the oxidation temperature of the workpiece is not reached, therefore, the dry grinding method is considered suitable for the machining of MOX core blocks.</jats:p>",

Isotope-selective photodissociation of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is then a crucial process to understand <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N fractionation, as already found in protoplanetary disks.

The Plant Dynamics Test Loop (PLANDTL-DHX), an experimental device built in Japan, can simulate core coolant flow process and decay heat transfer phenomenon under decay heat discharged accident condition. In the present work, the numerical modeling of the experimental device is carried out based on the method of modular modeling and integrated coupling calculation, and the CFD commercial software FLUNET was used for calculation. The rod bundles of different forms in the core are modeled in fine detail. The initial conditions of transient are obtained under the steady boundary condition operation. Then, the change of key thermal parameters such as the temperature of the core and the temperature of IHX inlet and outlet are obtained by simulating the transient accident condition. In addition, there are obvious inner-flow and interflow in the core, meanwhile, the local backflow occurs at the core outlet. The influence of these phenomena on the heat transfer of the whole model is analyzed. The key results of simulation are compared with experimental data. The results can provide numerical references for the discharge of decay heat in the sodium-cooled fast reactor under power blackout accident.</jats:p>",

It remains unclear, though, which depths the giant dynamo is operating. Both concentrations of active giants in the HRD are related to stellar evolution phases with core contraction and spin-up, and presumably the dissipation of angular momentum into the convective envelope above. At the same time, the latter has a small Rossby number by virtue of its increasing convective turn-over time—i.e., favourable conditions to run an alpha-omega dynamo. Since coronal X-ray emission appears to give an incomplete picture of stellar activity across the HR diagramme, we here focus on the observed chromospheric emissions across the giant branches and find good agreement with the magnetic field Zeeman-detections there. Stable evolution phases—solar-type main sequence stars with central hydrogen burning and moderate mass, central Helium burning K giants—by contrast demonstrate a decline in activity, apparently imposed by magnetic braking, as such stars are also slower rotators. In that sense, the observed picture of two magnetic activity strips across the HR diagramme could empirically be explained as an interplay of magnetic braking during the stable phase of core helium burning and supply by internal angular momentum during episodes of fast core contraction with core spin-up and angular momentum dredge-up, while meeting dynamo-friendly envelope conditions. At the same time, the sporadic external supply of angular momentum by the engulfment events of a planet, in the course of the evolutionary envelope expansion, may explain some cases of exceptional activity outside the here-described general picture.</jats:p>"

The data collection was conducted using classroom observations, in-depth interviews, lesson plan analyses, and a questionnaire about how CLIL core features were integrated into the class. The results revealed that the teachers performed some core features of CLIL, as defined by Mehisto et al. (2008), such as multiple foci, active learning, scaffolding, and cooperation. However, the teachers reflected that cooperation between content and language teachers should be enhanced to improve CLIL materials. In addition, the teachers argued that they needed more training to improve their competence to conduct effective CLIL practices. The practical application of the current study is summarized in the presentation of some pedagogical suggestions to offer a more efficacious learning process, especially in TEYL practice Hence, the emerging outcomes of the study should serve as practical guidance for the improvement of TEYL acivities by adapting CLIL in the primary schools of Indonesia.</jats:p>",

Ubiquitination, which can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays important roles during brain development. Furthermore, deregulation of the Ub system is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. We used a publicly available RNA-seq database to perform an extensive genome-wide gene expression analysis of the core components of the ubiquitination machinery, covering Ub genes as well as E1, E2, E3 and DUB genes. The ubiquitination network was governed by only <jats:italic>Uba1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Ube2m</jats:italic>, the predominant E1 and E2 genes, respectively; their expression was positively regulated during cortical formation. The principal genes encoding HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus), RBR (RING-in-between-RING), and RING (really interesting new gene) E3 Ub ligases were also highly regulated. <jats:italic>Pja1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Dtx3</jats:italic> (RING ligases) and <jats:italic>Stub1</jats:italic> (U-box RING) were the most highly expressed E3 Ub ligase genes and displayed distinct developmental expression patterns.

In the numerical simulation of the reactor, both neutron and thermal-hydraulics have a great influence on the calculation results. At the same time, because the neutron energy spectrum and the power distribution of the reactor strongly depend on the thermal-hydraulic properties of the coolant, neutronic and thermal-hydraulic coupling (N/TH) allows for a more precise analysis of the reactor. In this paper, based on the Picard method, a set of implicit and high-precision neutronic and thermal-hydraulic coupling codes is developed, which connects the Monte Carlo code RMC (Reactor Monte Carlo code) and the computational fluid dynamics code STAR-CCM+, processes the files and data generated during the coupling process, and transfers them to thermal-hydraulic and neutron simulation. The accuracy and reliability of the coupling code developed in this paper are verified by comparing it with the calculation results of the single rod model of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). In this paper, a conceptual design of a lead-bismuth-cooled solid reactor is proposed, and an optimal design is obtained through the multidimensional and full-scale optimization of the reactor. Then the coupling code developed in this paper is used for coupling simulation to study its neutron and thermal-hydraulic properties under various transient conditions.</jats:p>",

However, there is still ambiguity in the English and Chinese studies on the concept and measurement tools of school support. The data for this study were sourced from the literature on school support included in the China National Knowledge Network (CNKI) and Web of Science (WOS) from 2000 to 2021. A systematic literature review was conducted through literature inclusion and data extraction according to the PRISMA guidelines. Finally, 36 core-journal articles with high academic reference value and authority are identified, including seven in Chinese and 29 in English. The following results were obtained: (1) Related research in both Chinese and English showed an overall increasing trend. (2) The concepts and measurement tools of school support were not clear, and most studies used concepts and measurement tools of “social support” or “school climate” as substitutes for school support. (3) Most of the previous studies were based on social support theory, ecological system theory, and school climate theory. (4) The research mainly adopts quantitative research methods and focuses on special student populations or students below the high school level. Overall, previous studies indicated that school support has a positive impact on student development. Therefore, future research should be broadly extended to the knowledge system in higher education. On the basis of clarifying the concept of school support, it is necessary to try to develop and validate school support measurement tools with great reliability, validity, and general applicability to provide a practical reference for educators around the world.</jats:p>"

In 2018, the environmental dose of the core instrument room increased significantly, resulting in higher radiation protection costs in the core instrument room during the overhaul and absorption dose of equipment maintenance person, etc. After the abnormality of the environmental dose of the core instrumentation room was found, the investigation into the reasons for the increase of the ambient dose in the core instrumentation room of Unit 3 found that because the room was only designed with an air inlet and no air outlet, a large amount of radioactive dust escaped from the room. The neutron flux detector was rusted for the first time and the material analysis of the radioactive dust found the activation products Fe-59 and Co-60. Aiming at this problem that has never occurred in the field of nuclear power, this paper firstly analyzes and studies the reasons for the increase of the environmental dose in the core instrument room. On this basis, the four environmental dose reduction measures adopted are described, including the improvement of the cleaning method of the flux thimble tubes, the decontamination of the equipment surface, the overall cleaning of the mechanical equipment, and all-round cleaning of room radioactive dust. From the practical results, the ambient dose in the core instrument room was reduced from nearly 1mSv/h to about 0.1mSv/h, and the room surface pollution and equipment radiation hot spots were almost eliminated.</jats:p>",

The Zn metal plate was dipped in Ethanol, Acetone, and Distilled Water, respectively. The UV-Vis results shows sharp and single peaks at 320, 341, and 333 nm for Zn/ZnO NPs in Ethanol, Acetone, and Distilled Water respectively. FTIR testing shows peaks at about 500 cm−1 for Zn/ZnO NPs in Ethanol, Acetone, and Distilled Water, which indicates Zn-O stretching vibrations. XRD investigation shows low-angle peaks at 23.31˚, 23.81˚, and 19.20˚ for Zn/ZnO NPs in Ethanol, Acetone, and Distilled Water, respectively. In addition, a sharp peak of high intensity was observed at 13.54˚ for Zn/ZnO Core/Shell NPs in Acetone. These peaks indicate that the structure is stable and undistorted. These patterns emphasize compact pore arrangements. The lower intensity of the gradient peaks indicates that ZnO formed at a preferred site. Nor did high-angle XRD patterns appear, indicating that the formed ZnO NPs are so small to be distinct from background noise or undetectable by widish angle XRD. The broad XRD peak at 2θ angles from 20° to 30° can also confirm that ZnO is low-crystalline. The TEM images show the presence of Zn/ZnO NPs in Ethanol, Acetone, and Distilled Water with a size of less than 50 nm, and TEM analysis confirms that the primary structure of Zn/ZnO NPs is a Core/Shell.\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, we proposed a new orbital analysis method, natural reaction orbital (NRO), which automatically extracts orbital pairs that characterize electron transfer in reaction processes by singular value decomposition of the first-order orbital response matrix to the nuclear coordinate displacements [Ebisawa et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 24, 3532 (2022)]. NRO analysis along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) for several typical chemical reactions demonstrated that electron transfer occurs mainly in the vicinity of transition states and in regions where the energy profile along the IRC shows shoulder features, allowing the reaction mechanism to be explained in terms of electron motion. However, its application has been limited to single configuration theories such as Hartree–Fock theory and density functional theory. In this work, the concept of NRO is extended to multiconfigurational wavefunctions and formulated as the multiconfiguration NRO (MC-NRO). The MC-NRO method is applicable to various types of electronic structure theories, including multiconfigurational theory and linear response theory, and is expected to be a practical tool for extracting the essential qualitative features of a broad range of chemical reactions, including covalent bond dissociation and chemical reactions in electronically excited states. In this paper, we calculate the IRC for five basic chemical reaction processes at the level of the complete active space self-consistent field theory and discuss the phenomenon of electron transfer by performing MC-NRO analysis along each IRC. Finally, issues and future prospects of the MC-NRO method are discussed.</jats:p>",

Slope water intrusion into the GoM is affected by Gulf Stream warm-core rings (WCRs) impinging onto the nearby shelf edge. This study combines long-term mooring measurements, satellite remote sensing data, an idealized numerical ocean model, and a linear coastal-trapped wave (CTW) model to examine the impact of WCRs on slope water intrusion into the GoM through the Northeast Channel. Analysis of satellite sea surface height and temperature data shows that the slope sea region off the GoM is a hotspot of ring activities. A significant linear relationship is found between interannual variations of ring activities in the slope sea region off the GoM and bottom salinity at the Northeast Channel, suggesting the importance of WCRs in modulating variability of intruding slope water. Analysis of the mooring data reveals enhanced slope water intrusion through bottom-intensified along-channel flow following impingements of WCRs on the nearby shelf edge. Numerical simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed WCR impingement processes and associated episodic enhancement of slope water intrusion in the Northeast Channel. Diagnosis of the model result indicates that baroclinic CTWs excited by the ring–topography interaction are responsible for the episodically intensified subsurface along-channel inflow, which carries more slope water into the GoM. A WCR that impinges onto the shelf edge to the northeast of the Northeast Channel tends to generate stronger CTWs and cause stronger enhancement of the slope water intrusion into the GoM.</jats:p>",

This study has conducted event tree analyses emphasizing key phenomena in the lower plenum based on available experimental knowledge as well as design measure effectiveness. Criticality assessment has also been performed for the event tree analysis. In this paper, the approach to event tree development and the scope of the event tree analysis are described with key points on the loading conditions on the core catcher. For the analytical conditions, two loading conditions on core catcher were given as bounding and conservative cases. For the important heading of the event tree, key important phenomena were included: strong back design, fuel-coolant interaction and quench in the sodium plenum design, jet attack, criticality and coolability of molten core materials on the core catcher. In this study, preliminary trial quantification was attempted using a probability ranking table which is based on engineering judgement. This event tree analysis has identified the dominant sequence, and clarified the effect of the loading condition on the core catcher and effectiveness of design measures. This study suggests that the criticality measure is very important for the core catcher study.</jats:p>",

The core‐modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (≤2), i. e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure–antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free‐base (metal‐free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. β‐Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions.

One hundred and sixty-eight core porosity and permeability data were used to establish reservoir zones from the flow zone indicator (FZI) and Winland’s methods. Storage and flow capacities were determined from the stratigraphy-modified Lorenz plot (SMLP) method. The effects of the mineralogy on the flow zones were established from mineralogy composition analyses using quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results reveal five flow zones grouped as high, moderate, low, very low, and tight reservoir rocks. The high flow zone is the best reservoir quality rock and has porosity and permeability values ranging from 12 to 20% and 100 to 1000 mD. The high and moderate zones contribute more than 60% of each well’s flow capacities. The moderate and low flow zone extends laterally to all the wells. The tight flow zone is an impervious rock and has the lowest rock quality with porosity and permeability values less than 8% and 1 mD, respectively. This zone contributes less than 1% to flow capacity. The impact of minerals on flow zones is evident in plagioclase and muscovite content increases. An accompanied decrease in quartz content is observed, which implies that low plagioclase content ≤4% and muscovite content of ≤1% corresponds to the low, moderate, and high flow zones, while plagioclase content of ≥4% and muscovite content of ≥1% belong to the tight flow zone. Consequently, the quantity of plagioclase and muscovite can be used as a proxy to identify better quality reservoir rocks. The diagenetic process that reduces the rock quality can be attributed to quartz overgrowth and the accumulation of mica flakes in the pore spaces. In contrast, the fracture in the high flow zone is the reservoir quality enhancing process. The flow zones are generally controlled by a combination of facies and diagenetic factors.</jats:p>"

Here we evaluate the effect of critical care and illness on transcription, focusing on the functional organization of the core circadian oscillator.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> We downloaded RNAseq count data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Treating mechanical ventilation as a marker for intensive care, we stratified samples into acute death (AD) and intensive care (IC) groups based on the documented Hardy Death Scale. We restricted our analysis to the 25 tissues with &amp;gt;50 samples in each group. Using the edgeR package and controlling for collection center, gender, and age, we identified transcripts differentially expressed between the AD and IC groups. Overrepresentation and enrichment methods were used to identify gene sets modulated by intensive care across tissues. For each tissue, we then calculated the delta clock correlation distance (ΔCCD), a comparative measure of the functional organization of the core circadian oscillator, in the both the AD and IC groups. The statistical significance of the ΔCCD was assessed by permutation, modifying a pre-existing R package to control for confounding variables.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Intensive care, as marked by ventilation, significantly modulated the expression of thousands of genes. Transcripts that were modulated in ≥75% of tissues were enriched for genes involved in mitochondrial energetics, cellular stress, metabolism, and notably circadian regulation. Transcripts that were more markedly affected, in ≥10 tissues, were enriched for inflammation, complement and immune pathways. Oscillator organization, as assessed by ΔCCD, was significantly reduced in the intensive care group in 11/25 tissues.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our findings support the hypothesis that patients in intensive care have impaired molecular circadian rhythms. Tissues involved in metabolism and energetics demonstrated the most marked changes in oscillator organization. In adipose tissue, there was a significant overlap between transcripts previously established to be modulated by sleep deprivation and fasting with those modulated by critical care. This work suggests that intensive care protocols that restore sleep/wake and nutritional rhythms may be of benefit.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Latimer Core (LtC) schema, named after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, is a standard designed to support the representation and discovery of natural science collections by structuring data about the groups of objects that those collections and their subcomponents encompass. Individual items within those groups are represented through other emerging or current standards (e.g., Darwin Core, ABCD). The LtC classes and properties aim to represent information that describes these groupings in enough detail to inform deeper discovery of the resources contained within them.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The standard has been developed under the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Collection Descriptions (CD) Interest Group, and evolved from the earlier work of the Natural Collection Descriptions (NCD) group. Version 1 of the standard includes 23 classes, each with two or more properties (Fig. 1 and Suppl. material 1).</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The central concept of the standard is the ObjectGroup class, which represents 'an intentionally grouped set of objects with one or more common characteristics'. Arranged around the ObjectGroup are a set of classes that are commonly used to describe and classify the objects within the ObjectGroup, classes covering aspects of the custodianship, management and tracking of the collections, a generic class (MeasurementOrFact) for storing qualitative or quantitative measures within the standard, and a set of classes that are used to describe the structure and description of the dataset.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Latimer Core is intended to be sufficiently flexible and scalable to apply to a wide range of collection description use cases, from describing the overall collections holdings of an institution to the contents of a single drawer of material. Various approaches are used to support this flexibility, including the use of generic classes to represent organisations, people, roles and identifiers, and enabling flexible relationships for constructing data models that meet different use cases. The collection description scheme concept is introduced to enable adopters to specify rules in the use of LtC within each specific implementation, demonstrated in Fig. 2. Guidance and reference examples for different modelling approaches to suit different use cases are provided in the LtC guidance documentation.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The LtC standard has significant overlap with existing data standards (Suppl. material 2) that represent, for example, individual objects and occurrences, organisations, people and activities. Where possible, LtC has either borrowed terms directly from these standards or less formally aligned with them. Achieving a balance between offering a standard that is sufficiently comprehensive to stand alone and maintains a low technical barrier to adoption whilst minimalising duplication of effort in the context of the wider standards landscape is a notable challenge in the standard development process.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n          The draft standard was submitted to the TDWG Executive in June 2022 to begin the process of formal review and ratification. This includes a list of standard terms and a GitHub wiki of guidance on the concepts behind and use of the standard. In the meantime, the Task Group will continue working on reference examples and serialisations, and working with infrastructures such as the Distributed System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo) consortium, the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) Registry of Scientific Collections, the CETAF (Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities) Registry of Collections and the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) on potential roadmaps towards adoption.\n        </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n          In this presentation, we will introduce the key Latimer Core deliverables, highlight some of the challenges faced in the development process, and discuss the potential for community adoption.\n        </jats:p>"

Under emergency conditions, natural circulation occurs and consequent thermal stratification appears in CMT system. However, rolling motion will directly affect the natural circulation and destroy the formation of thermal stratification, so there will be uncertain and unknown change of the safety injection capacity of CMT. Based on above analysis, this work carried out experiments under rolling conditions to reveal natural circulation and thermal stratification characteristics in CMT. A temperature detecting matrix formed by thermocouples is deployed in CMT. It is concluded that thermal stratification distribution is affected by the rolling conditions. Rolling conditions increase the thickness of thermal stratification and reduce the temperature gradient. The CMT natural circulation has two stages, the influence of rolling motion on the average flow in the first stage of natural circulation is very weak, but rolling motion will significantly affect the second stage of natural circulation and advance the decline time of direct vessel injection (DVI) flow rate. The transition time of natural circulation stage and the flow change in the second stage of natural circulation are related to the thermal stratification in CMT. The impact of rolling conditions should not be ignored when evaluating the performance of CMT.</jats:p>",

The stiffeners of the core were considered with I and box cross sections to investigate the cross section effect of ribs. The results showed that materials with high density and low mechanical properties are not suitable for reducing cost and weight. Geometrically, the use of cross-section and box has a significant effect on the buckling load capacity of the structure. Although two different criteria have been used to design the structure, the end results are almost the same. Moreover, the First-order Shear Deformation Plate Theory and the Ritz method were utilized to obtain the buckling load. Finally, the optimal alternative was found among the existing ones using the continuous genetic algorithm approach. </jats:p>",

The other objective of this study is to investigate the flow field under different injector configurations, including both co-rotating and counter-rotating swirler arrangements, different swirl intensities, and vane areas. A comparison of the results with experimental data shows that the predicted velocity and temperature profiles follow the experimental data reasonably. In these studies, a precessing vortex core is found in the shear layer of the inner recirculation zone for all injector arrangements considered, and a co-rotating vortex exists in the outer shear layer for some of these arrangements. OH mass fraction field shows that the reactions take place mostly near the vortex core. Furthermore, it is shown that the build-up process of H2O2 and CH2O inside the cold jet has an important effect on combustion initiation. In addition, the formation and consumption of the H atoms in the recirculation zones and the balance between OH and H2O2 are shown to have important roles in the flame formation process. Finally, the precession frequency of the PVC is found to scale almost linearly with the spatial gradient of swirl velocity in the inner swirler and almost independent from the inclusion of the combustion reactions.</jats:p>",

This study aims to determine the concordance between biomarker status assessed as part of clinical workup on a CNB compared to a medically untreated surgical specimen. Paired CNB and surgical specimens from 259 patients that were part of the SCAN-B cohort were studied. The concordance between immunohistochemical (IHC) and gene expression (GEX) based biomarker status was investigated. Biomarkers of interest included estrogen receptor (ER; specifically, the alpha variant), progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67, HER2, and tumor molecular subtype. In general, moderate to very good correlation in biomarker status between the paired CNB and surgical specimens was observed for both IHC assessment (83–99% agreement, kappa range 0.474–0.917) and GEX assessment (70–97% agreement, kappa range 0.552–0.800), respectively. However, using IHC, 52% of cases with low Ki67 status in the CNB shifted to high Ki67 status in the surgical specimen (McNemar’s p = 0.011). Similarly, when using GEX, a significant shift from negative to positive ER (47%) and from low to high Ki67 (16%) was observed between the CNB and surgical specimen (McNemar’s p = 0.027 and p = 0.002 respectively). When comparing biomarker status between different techniques (IHC vs. GEX) performed on either CNBs or surgical specimens, the agreement in ER, PgR, and HER2 status was generally over 80% in both CNBs and surgical specimens (kappa range 0.395–0.708), but Ki67 and tumor molecular subtype showed lower concordance levels between IHC and GEX (48–62% agreement, kappa range 0.152–0.398). These results suggest that both the techniques used for collecting tissue samples and analyzing biomarker status have the potential to affect the results of biomarker assessment, potentially also impacting treatment decisions and patient survival outcomes.</jats:p>"

Although some of these effectors have been characterized, none have yet been shown to target the host’s secretion machinery. Here, we used an extended library of NLR plant immune receptor integrated domains (IDs), to identify new effector targets. The screen uncovered that the core effector RipE1, of the<jats:italic>R. solanacearum</jats:italic>species complex, among other targets, associates with Arabidopsis exocyst component Exo70B1. RipE1, in accordance with its predicted cysteine protease activity, cleaves Exo70B1<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>and also promotes Exo70B1 degradation<jats:italic>in planta</jats:italic>. RipE1 enzymatic activity additionally results in the activation of TN2-dependent ectopic cell death. TN2 is an atypical NLR that has been proposed to guard Exo70B1. Despite the fact that RipE1 has been previously reported to activate defense responses in model plant species, we present here a<jats:italic>Nicotiana</jats:italic>species, in which RipE1 expression does not activate cell death. In addition, we discovered that RipE1 is recognized by Ptr1, a<jats:italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</jats:italic>CC-NLR, via its cysteine protease activity. Overall, this study uncovers a new RipE1 host target and a new RipE1-activated NLR while providing evidence and novel tools to advance in-depth studies of RipE1 and homologous effectors.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Author Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Bacterial wilt disease caused by<jats:italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</jats:italic>, poses a serious global threat for a wide range of agriculturally important plant species.

The participants were divided into two groups: mat Pilates exercise group (MP, n=10) and non-Pilates control group (CON, n=10). The MP group participated in the mat Pilates exercise program for 60 minutes a day, 3 days per week for 8 weeks. Back pain and basal physical fitness were assessed before and after the experimental period. Left and right core stabilities at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180° were measured using Centaur (BFMC, Germany). Isokinetic muscle function (60°/s) of both the knee and trunk was also measured using the isokinetic dynamometer Cybex.RESULTS: After mat Pilates exercise for 8 weeks, there was a significant interaction between the MP and CON groups in back pain during daily activity and lower back stiffness (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.05), respectively. There was also a significant interaction between the two groups in the left and right core stability at 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180° (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.001), respectively. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between the two groups in the right knee and left knee isokinetic extensor muscle strength (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.001, respectively). However, there was no significant interaction between the two groups in trunk isokinetic extensor and flexor muscle strength (NS). There were no significant interactions between two groups in the muscle mass of total body, trunk, and legs (NS), respectively. Regarding basic physical fitness, there were significant interaction effects between the two groups in cardiovascular fitness, sagittal reach, and sit-ups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;.05).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that continued mat Pilates exercise can improve back pain and core stability with enhancement of leg isokinetic muscle strength independent of the muscle mass of the total body, trunk, and legs.</jats:p>"

A series of low density damping cores were prepared by blending epoxy/polyurethane graft copolymer (E‐g‐U) and epoxy/poly mercaptan block copolymer (E‐b‐M) with different contents of hollow glass beads (HGM). The damping properties, mechanical properties, density, and interface morphology of the core layer were studied. The damping response and flexure properties of the sandwich composite structure were studied by modal analysis and three‐point flexure test. The experimental results show that optimal damping performance of matrix appears at 60% E‐b‐M ratio, the peak loss factor is 0.88, and the damping temperature range covers −2 ~ 52°C. When the HGM content in the core is 10 phr, the density can be comparable to that of the buoyancy material. Under flexural load, the ultimate shear strength and shear modulus of the sandwich structure increase maximum at 15 phr and 10 phr, respectively. Compared with the unfilled HGM sample, the first three modal damping ratios of the sandwich structure are increased by 133.2%, 56.6%, and 56% by 10 phr damping core, respectively. The results are compared with those in other reference. The research shows that the design of lightweight damping core is expected to provide a core material selection for the vibration reduction of sandwich structures.</jats:p>",

The balance scores of the Tinetti POMA and total Tinetti POMA scores in both the PG and CSG were higher after the 8-week exercise program. In particular, the gait score of the Tinetti POMA in the PG was higher than that in the CSG.

In particular, considerable progress has been made on the fundamental theories of topological magnets and has had a widespread impact on related fields of applied research. An important advance in the field of quantum manipulation is the development of the technology to control the quantum phase of conduction electron wavefunctions through the spin structure. This new technology has led to the realization of phenomena that had been considered infeasible for more than a century, such as the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and the giant magneto-thermoelectric effect in ferromagnets. This review article presents the remarkable properties of Weyl antiferromagnets and topological ferromagnets, which have been discovered recently. Additionally, this paper examines the current status of how advances in the basic principles of topological magnetism are facilitating the development of next-generation technologies that support the DX era, such as energy harvesting, heat flow sensors, and ultrafast nonvolatile memory.</jats:p>"

The Plant Dynamics Test Loop (PLANDTL-DHX) experimental facility can simulate the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the pool-type sodium-cooled fast reactor with an independent decay heat removal system in a natural circulation state. However, the natural circulation experiments based on the PLANDTL-DHX facility are difficult to present the detailed flow characteristics in the core completely. So it is necessary to adopt numerical simulation analysis to obtain the flow characteristics in the core. While due to the complex structure of the core with wrapped wire bundles, the modeling and calculation of the pool-type fast reactor need very rich computing resources. To reduce the demand for computing resources, the model can be simplified to some extent. In this study, two modeling methods are adopted for the core: 1. The model of the rod bundles and wrapped wires are simplified by the porous media model; 2. The wrapped wires are simplified by the porous media model, while the rod bundles are retained. The PLANDTL-DHX experimental facility modeled by two different core modeling methods is numerically simulated. By analyzing and comparing the experimental data of PLANDTL-DHX, the feasibility of two different modeling methods for numerical simulation research is verified. By analyzing and comparing the calculation results of two different modeling methods, the flow characteristics in the core during natural circulation are also obtained, and the characteristics of different modeling methods are summarized. This work can provide a reference for the safety analysis and simulation calculation of pool-type sodium-cooled fast reactor.</jats:p>",

Coaxial electrospinning was exploited to create the core-sheath structure, by which the delivery regulation of the active substance was achieved. Resveratrol (RE) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were loaded into electrospun zein/polyethylene oxide ultrathin fibers to ensure a synergistic antibacterial performance. Under the assessments of a scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope, the ultrathin fiber was demonstrated to have a fine linear morphology, smooth surface and obvious core-sheath structure. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared analyses showed that RE and AgNPs coexisted in the ultrathin fibers and had good compatibility with the polymeric matrices. The water contact angle experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity of the fibers. In vitro dissolution tests revealed that RE was released in a sustained manner. In the antibacterial experiments against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, the diameters of the inhibition zone of the fiber were 8.89 ± 0.09 mm and 7.26 ± 0.10 mm, respectively. Finally, cherry tomatoes were selected as the packaging object and packed with fiber films. In a practical application, the fiber films effectively reduced the bacteria and decreased the quality loss of cherry tomatoes, thereby prolonging the fresh-keeping period of cherry tomatoes to 12 days. Following the protocols reported here, many new food packaging films can be similarly developed in the future.</jats:p>"

We fabricate both electron-type and hole-type carrier samples by tuning epitaxial strain and, then, control the carrier density in a CaIrO3 layer via electric double layer gating technique. As the Fermi energy of CaIrO3 is tuned close to the Dirac line node, anomalous Hall conductivity is enlarged in both carrier-type samples. This result reveals that the anomalous Hall effect comes from the intrinsic origin, reflecting the Dirac-like dispersion in CaIrO3. We propose that band splitting induced by the interface ferromagnetism yields several band crossing points near the Dirac line node. These points act as a source of the Berry curvature and contribute to the anomalous Hall effect.</jats:p>",

AM enables the freedom of design, and makes full use of complexity of geometry which “comes for free”. Applying AM technology to nuclear industry can yield advanced reactor designs with function and structure matched for the best thermal, hydraulic and mechanical performance. In this work, an AM-informed reactor core design with silicon carbide (SiC) matrix and tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel is proposed and analyzed. The core is an integrated 3D-printing SiC bulk with helical cruciform coolant channels, and the UO2-bearing TRISO fuel particles are dispersed in the bulk. A multi-physics analysis framework for irregular geometry is developed to analyze and further optimize the reactor design. The TRISO particle positions are generated with discrete element method (DEM). The Reactor Monte Carlo code (RMC) and the commercial CFD software STAR-CCM+ are used for the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic analyses, respectively. RMC simulates the neutron transport to predict the effective multiplication factor and power distribution. STAR-CCM+ calculates the flow and heat transfer in coolant channels and heat conduction in solid matrix with the power distribution as the heat source. Preliminary results show that the power peaking factor FQ decreases below 1.65, the heat transfer area increases by 30.3% and the fuel peaking temperature decreases by 25 K. The optimized AM-informed design enjoys better neutronic and thermal-hydraulic performance than those with regular geometry.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a vehicle–track–subgrade finite element model was established to analyze the dynamic responses of a ballastless track, and results showed that the concrete base and roadbed were detached because of the whipping effect arising from the rainwater intrusion channel. An in-situ soil core test showed that the intruded rainwater accumulated in roadbed to form standing water and saturated the roadbed. The flapping action of the concrete base caused by the whipping effect led to mud formation mixed with fine particles and rainwater, which migrated upward under the pore-water pressure (PWP) gradient. Mud pumping resulted from continuous particle migration in the saturated roadbed under moving train loads: under normal roadbed condition, coarse and fine particles were uniformly distributed in the roadbed; in early period of mud pumping, fine particles migrated downward to bottom of the roadbed because of the rainwater infiltration flow; in middle stage of mud pumping, fine particles migrated upward and gathered at the roadbed surface under PWP gradient; in later period of mud pumping, fine particles were entrained and removed with the dissipation of excess PWP. Moreover, a full-scale physical model was established to reproduce mud pumping, and polyurethane injection remediation against mud pumping was validated on this physical model. The remediation method was applied to an in-situ mud pumping. The deviation of the vertical track profile reduced remarkably and remained at a low level within half a year, showing a good long-term service performance of the polyurethane remediated roadbed.</jats:p>",

Tibetan hull-less barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum) is the only cereal crop grown widely in the Tibetan Plateau as a staple food. Extensive and long-term cropping of barley may influence the soil’s chemical and biological properties, including microbial communities. However, microbiota associated with hull-less barley is largely unexplored. This study aimed to reveal the composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities associated with the hull-less barley at different elevations in the Tibetan Plateau. The core bacterial and fungal taxa of Tibetan hull-less barley were identified, with Bacillaceae, Blastocatellaceae, Comamonadaceae, Gemmatimonadaceae, Planococcaceae, Pyrinomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Nitrospiraceae being the most abundant bacterial taxa and Ceratobasidiaceae, Chaetomiaceae, Cladosporiaceae, Didymellaceae, Entolomataceae, Microascaceae, Mortierellaceae, and Nectriaceae being the most abundant fungal taxa (relative abundance &gt; 1%). Both bacterial and fungal diversities of hull-less barley were affected by altitude and soil properties such as total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus and potassium. Both bacterial and fungal diversities showed a significant negative correlation with altitude, indicating that the lower elevations provide a conducive environment for the survival and maintenance of hull-less barley-associated microbiota. Our results also suggest that the high altitude-specific microbial taxa may play an important role in the adaptation of the hull-less barley to the earth’s third pole.</jats:p>"

An in-depth two-dimensional simulation of partial channel blockage can be carried out using FLUENT Code. In this study, a channel blockage simulation is employed to perform a safety analysis for the TRIGA-2000 reactor, which is converted using plate-type fuel. Heat generation on the fuel plate takes place along its axial axis. The modelling of the fuel-plate is in the form of a rectangular sub-channel with an inlet coolant temperature of 308 K with a low coolant velocity of 0.69 m/s. It is assumed that blockage is in a form of a thin plate, with the blockage area being assumed to be 60 %, 70 %, and 80 % at the sub-channel inlet flow. An unblocking condition is also compared with a steady-state calculation that has been done by COOLOD-N2 Code. The results show that a partial blockage has a significant impact on the coolant velocity. When the blockage of 80 % occurs, a maximum coolant temperature locally reaches 413 K. While the saturation temperature is 386 K. From the point of view of the safety aspect, the blockage simulation result for the TRIGA-2000 thermal-hydraulic core design using plate-type fuel shows that a nucleate boiling occurs, which from the safety aspect, could cause damage to the fuel plate.</jats:p>"

Broadband nonthermal emission is a useful proxy for probing the energy budget and production history of CRs in SNRs. We conduct hydrodynamic simulations to model the long-term SNR evolution from explosion all the way to the radiative phase (or 3 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> yr at maximum) and compute the time evolution of the broadband nonthermal spectrum to explore its potential applications on constraining the surrounding environments, as well as the natures and mass-loss histories, of the SNR progenitors. A parametric survey is performed on the ambient environments separated into two main groups, namely, a homogeneous medium with a uniform gas density and one with the presence of a circumstellar structure created by the stellar wind of a massive red supergiant progenitor star. Our results reveal a highly diverse evolution history of the nonthermal emission closely correlated to the environmental characteristics of an SNR. Up to the radiative phase, the roles of CR reacceleration and ion−neutral wave damping on the spectral evolution are investigated. Finally, we make an assessment of the future prospect of SNR observations by the next-generation hard X-ray space observatory FORCE and predict what we can learn from their comparison with our evolution models.</jats:p>",

To facilitate standardized prospective molecular surveillance, we established a novel core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme. Whole genome sequencing data of 1991 isolates were employed to validate the scheme, re-analyze global population structure and set genetic distance thresholds for cluster detection and taxonomic identification. We confirmed and amended the nomenclature of the main dominant circulating clones and found that these also correlate well with traditional 7-loci MLST. Dominant circulating clones could be linked to a corresponding reference genome with less than 250 alleles while 99% of pairwise comparisons between epidemiologically linked isolates were below 25 alleles and 90% below 10 alleles. These thresholds can be used to guide further epidemiological investigations. Overall, the scheme will help to unravel the apparent global spread of certain clonal complexes and as yet undiscovered transmission routes.</jats:p>"

We highlight the value of critical reflection and critical reflexivity on contexts of research and practice in order to increase the practical impact of WOP for everyone. First, we outline how WOP currently fails to address pressing global issues, such as precarious employment, by focusing on work‐related phenomena in affluent societies and neglecting issues relevant to the majority of the world's working population. Second, we present a heuristic framework of four fundamental contextual components that are important to consider when engaging in a continuous process of critical reflection and critical reflexivity: history; economy and politics; society and culture; and personal background. Third, we illustrate why these contexts are important for WOP with the example of precarious employment. Considering context more explicitly is important for future WOP research because context not only co‐determines the experiences of the working people under investigation but also the subjectivity of researchers themselves. We hope to encourage WOP researchers to engage in critical reflection and critical reflexivity to promote a more critical WOP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The mixed layer is the uppermost layer of the ocean, driven by atmospheric fluxes. It follows a strong seasonal cycle, deepening in winter due to buoyancy loss, shoaling very close to the surface with summer restratification. Recently global and regional studies showed a mixed layer depth (MLD) modulation by mesoscale eddies with the seasonal cycle. In winter, MLD tends to be deeper inside anticyclonic eddies and shallower inside cyclonic ones. Several studies proposed a scaling law with eddy sea surface height deviation. However they were done globally or regionally with eddy composites mostly representative of surface-intensified structures and using monthly averaged climatologies as reference. The Mediterranean sea contains a wide variety of mesoscale eddies, with the specific presence of several large anticyclones living up to 4 years, in particular in the Eastern basin. These anticyclones were surveyed over the past decade with numerous Argo floats deployments. Several floats remained trapped inside anticyclones for months and enabled to record 16 continuous MLD time series inside 13 long-lived anticyclones at a fine temporal scale on the order of the week. MLD evolution at anticyclone cores reveals a stronger winter deepening, reaching sometimes deeper than 300 m, compared to always less than 100 m in the neighboring background. MLD evolution also does not coincide inside- and outside-eddy, starting to restratify outside of eddies, while it keeps deepening and cooling MLD at anticyclone core for a longer time. We then bring to light a restratification delay of one month on average between the anticyclones and their background, sometimes reaching more than 2 months. Extreme MLD anomalies of up to 330 m that would be smoothed in composite analyses can then be observed when the winter mixed layer connects with a preexisting subsurface anticyclonic core, greatly accelerating mixed layer deepening. On the opposite, the winter MLD sometimes does not achieve such connection but homogenizes a second subsurface layer, then forming a double-core anticyclone with spring restratification. Formation of several double-core anticyclones in the Eastern Mediterranean is accurately described in time. MLD restratification delay and connection with preexisting subsurface anomalies appear to be determinant in MLD modulation by mesoscale eddy and highlights the importance of interaction with eddy vertical structure.\n                        </jats:p>"

We use the stellar evolution code mesa to follow the response of main sequence stars of masses $3 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $7\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ to energy deposition and mass removal. The collision of the CCSN ejecta with the main sequence star deposits energy and inflate the main sequence star. If the binary system stays bound after the CCSN explosion, the inflated main sequence star might engulf the newly born neutron star (NS). We assume that the NS accretes mass through an accretion disc and launches jets. The jets remove mass from the inflated main sequence star and collide with the CCSN ejecta. Although this scenario is rare, it adds up to other rare scenarios to further support the notion that many stripped envelope CCSNe are powered by late jets. The late jets can power these CCSNe-I for a long time and might power bumps in their light curve. The jets might also shape the inner ejecta to a bipolar morphology. Our results further support suggestions that there are several ways to feed an NS (or a black hole) to launch the late jets in superluminous supernovae.</jats:p>",

It is found that there are two different types of helical equilibrium states: one is a rigid-body shift in the core region on a poloidal cross-section, while the other is a local advection only around the magnetic axis. Linear stability analysis of the corresponding axisymmetric equilibrium is carried to understand the origin of these two types of helical equilibrium states. The analysis shows that the former is related to the current-driven internal-kink instability, while the latter is linked to the pressure-driven quasi-interchange instability.

Diagnosing oncocytomas using renal biopsy remains a controversy in the uro-pathologic community. With the increasing use of biopsies for assessment of renal lesions, reaching this pathologically benign diagnosis may prevent further surgical measures and have significant clinical benefit. Objective. To demonstrate our center’s results using renal biopsy to diagnose oncocytomas and to suggest that this diagnosis can be made with high success rates. Design, Setting, and Participants. From our center’s database, we retrospectively identified and retrieved all cases of oncocytoma diagnosed between the years 2011 and 2020 by renal biopsy. Medical records of those patients were then reviewed to view follow-up meetings and imaging of the lesions biopsied. Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis. In 21 biopsies performed on 19 patients, diagnosis was supported by subsequent follow-up averaging at 3.44 years per patient. Results and Limitations. The lesions exhibited benign behavior during follow-up after biopsy, consistent with the diagnosis of oncocytoma. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that with good patient selection and proficient cooperation between urologists, radiologists and dedicated uro-pathologists, correctly diagnosing oncocytomas using RCB is a viable task. Patient Summary. Oncocytomas are benign lesions of the kidney. In our study, we reviewed all cases of oncocytomas pathologically diagnosed using renal biopsy from our center’s database. We found that in subsequent follow-up later to biopsy, the lesions displayed benign behavior consistent with oncocytoma. The use of percutaneous biopsies to reach this diagnosis could save patients more extensive surgeries.</jats:p>",

The microcapsule characteristics including shape and morphology, size and size distribution, microencapsulation efficiency in dependence on the core-shell ratio were investigated. The antimicrobial capacity and the fragrance durability of interlock knitted fabric coated with the elaborated microcapsules were evaluated. The results showed that cinnamon oil was microencapsulated successfully in the spherical microcapsules. When the cinnamon oil content increased, the microcapsule size decreased and the size distribution became broader, the microcapsules were more porous and more aggregate, the fragrance intensity of the fabric treated with microcapsules increased while the activity against E. coli bacteria decreased. According to the results, the microcapsules elaborated with 0.15 g of cinnamon oil was recommended for the treatment of interlock cotton knitted fabric to apply in aroma and antimicrobial textiles.</jats:p>",

Synchronously, hydrogen released from zircaloy-water reaction is a threat to the integrity of containment. Up to now, multifarious zircaloy-water oxidation models are applied in different severe accident analysis programs. In order to investigate the influence of different cladding oxidation models on the core degradation process, a station blackout (SBO) accident model of CPR1000 nuclear power plant (NPP) was established and simulated by modifying the cladding oxidation model in this work. Five oxidation relations were chosen for evaluating thermal hydraulic, metal oxidation and core degradation analysis. Thermal hydraulic characteristics of five types remain consistent before core oxidation. For more concerned hydrogen production, the results show that the ratio of the maximum hydrogen production to the minimum is approximately 2.5 times in comparison of the different oxidation models. Four core nodes temperature distributions at different time points are selected to analyze the core node degradation process, which can help readers understand the effect of different models on core degradation more intuitively. The oxidation heat generated is consistent with that of hydrogen production, indicating that the core degradation time in the case of less hydrogen produced is delayed than that of more hydrogen produced. It follows that different oxidation models have great influence on the core oxidation behavior, which is of great significance to understand different oxidation models of zircaloy and the core degradation behavior of severe accident. It is critical to choose the appropriate model to simulate the whole severe accident.</jats:p>",

However, the limited amount of intracellular H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> makes it remain challenging to achieve high performance for chemodynamic therapy. Herein, we reported dual-responsive disassembly of core-shell nanoplatform with self-supplied H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and autocatalytic Fenton reaction for enhanced chemodynamic therapy. The platform was designed by coating glucose oxidase mimic nanozyme gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with metal polyphenol network (Au@MPN). Both ATP and low pH could disassemble Au@MPN to release Fe(III), which could be reduced by the simultaneously released tannic acid (TA) into Fe (II). Especially, the exposed AuNPs could catalyze the oxidation of intracellular glucose to produce H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Subsequently, the Fe(II) and self-supplied H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> induced efficient Fenton reaction to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radical (•OH), which revealed cytotoxicity to cancer cells through chemodynamic therapy. Besides, tumor growth can be effectively suppressed by Au@MPN through both intratumoral and intravenous administration routes. Additionally, melanoma metastatic lung cancer could be inhibited by intratracheal instillation of Au@MPN. Therefore, this work not only reports a facile method to construct a chemodynamic agent with self-supplied H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and high therapeutic efficiency, but also provides insight into the design of nanoplatform with enhanced efficiency for chemodynamic therapy.</jats:p>"

Further, the tetravalent cationic 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-trimethylammoniophenyl) porphyrin (TAPP) fulfills a triple functionality in the catalyst: as a photosensitizer, as an electrostatic linker connecting the nanoparticles and as a probe to investigate the surface composition of the II-VI semiconducting nanoparticles. Different nanoparticles with varying zinc sulfide/manganese sulfide shell ratios are tested with regard to their photocatalytic behavior by crocin bleaching. The results reveal that the shell composition can be a crucial key to optimize the catalytic activity, which can further be important in tuning the reactivity of related systems. Fundamentally, the stepwise multi-component self-assembly in an aqueous solution has been demonstrated to allow the tuning of optic and catalytic properties of core-shell nanoparticles, a general concept that may be widely applicable.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this research aimed to determine the mediating role of coping styles in the relationship between the core of self-assessment and academic stress. To this aim, a total of 384 English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in the training institutes in Woldia, Ethiopia, filled out three questionnaires, including self-evaluations, the coping styles, and the academic stress. The analysis of the data using structural equation modeling revealed that the core of self-assessment had significant negative effects on academic stress, emotion-based coping, and avoidance. Furthermore, self-assessment with the mediating role of other factors, namely problem-oriented coping, emotion-based coping, and avoidance coping showed to have a negative and significant effect on academic stress. Based on the findings, it is possible to receive personality traits as an individual factor, predict differences in individuals coping styles of academic stress, and, as a result, teach appropriate coping styles to EFL learners to reduce their academic stress.</jats:p>"

We here show that the plasmaspheric plume facilitates the energy conversion from energetic electrons to hiss waves and then guides hiss waves into the plasmaspheric core. Three ground and space missions captured the initial formation and subsequent rotation of the plasmaspheric plume in the noon‐dusk‐midnight sector following a strong substorm. The observed hiss waves in the nightside plasmaspheric plume and core propagated oppositely but highly correlated with each other at a time lag of 4–10 s. The linear instability of energetic electrons in the plasmaspheric plume qualitatively explains the frequency‐dependence of hiss waves, and the ray‐tracing modeling reproduces the propagation direction and timing of hiss waves.</jats:p>",

However, the effect of this training on dynamic balance in young soccer players is a matter of curiosity.  Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of core and plyometric training on dynamic balance in young male soccer players.  Materials and Methods: Eighteen male soccer players between 17 and 18 years of age participated in the study voluntarily. Subjects were randomly separated into three groups: core training group (C, n=6), plyometric training group (P, n=6), and control group (Con, n=6). Group C and P subjects participated in the determined training programs, in addition to soccer training, two days a week for eight weeks. The Con group only continued their soccer training. The Y-balance test (before and after eight weeks) was applied to determine the balance performance of the subjects.  Results: After eight weeks of core training, significant differences in anterior (ANT) and posteromedial (PM) balance performance on the dominant side and in ANT, PM, and posterolateral (PL) balance performance on the non-dominant side were observed in group C subjects. The PL and PM balance performance of group P subjects after plyometric training was found to be significantly different on both sides.  Conclusion: As a result, it was determined that applying core and plyometric training in addition to soccer training increases dynamic balance. We recommend that trainers and coaches use core and plyometric exercises in their training, as these programs will provide a positive performance increase in balance and gains in muscle strength.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has altered travel patterns in cities across the world. Previous studies have found that travel choices during the pandemic are affected by attitudes and perceptions of risk in addition to transportation system level-of-service attributes. However, traditional travel demand models often rely on household travel survey data, which rarely include information on attitudinal factors. Conversely, specialized surveys are often lengthy, so they offer the ability to collect detailed attitudinal information but suffer from limited sample sizes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of fusing a “core” household travel survey with three specialized “satellite” surveys to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on passenger travel demand in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The study uses a non-parametric implicit data fusion method to generate multiple synthetic datasets that contain observed travel diaries and socioeconomic attributes of the trip-makers from the core survey, along with imputed attitudinal statements based on the satellite surveys. The results highlight the ability of the method to sufficiently reproduce the distribution of the attitudinal variables and the ability of the imputed variables to support the estimation of an advanced econometric model. The proposed method can reduce the risk of potential biases in the imputed data that can adversely impact subsequent data analysis. This method can be used to capitalize on the benefits of specialized surveys while still being able to utilize data from large-scale household travel surveys.</p>"

Pyroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death discovered in recent years, which has been proved to play an important role in sepsis. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive report, which can help researchers get a quick overview and find research hotspots. Thus, we aimed to identify the study status and knowledge structures of pyroptosis in sepsis and summarize the key mechanism of pyroptosis in sepsis. The data were retrieved and downloaded from the WOS database. Software such as VOSviewer was used to analyze these publications. Key genes were picked out by using (<jats:ext-link>https://www.genecards.org</jats:ext-link>) and (<jats:ext-link>http://www.bioinformatics.com</jats:ext-link>). Then, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to performed these key genes. From 2011 to 2021, a total of 299 papers met the search criteria, and the global interest in pyroptosis in sepsis measured by the value of (RRI) has started to increase since 2016. China ranked first in the number of publications, followed by the USA. The journal <jats:italic>Frontiers in Immunology</jats:italic> published the most relevant articles.

In addition, a total of 15 genes were identified as hub genes. TNF, IL-1β, AKT1, CASP1, and STAT3 were highly expressed in lung tissues, thymus tissues, and lymphocytes.

Ramie is one of the cellulosic fibers that show high mechanical strength and stiffness. This work aims to explore the feasibility of encapsulating woven ramie core in fiber‐metal laminates. The sandwich laminates and composites were fabricated using the hot molding compression method. Tensile, flexural, Charpy impact and quasi‐static indentation tests were carried out to identify the mechanical performance of fiber‐metal laminates based on woven ramie core. Meanwhile, the mechanical tests were also performed on the composite laminates and woven ramie fabrics for comparison purposes. Based on the findings obtained, ramie fiber‐reinforced metal laminates exhibited eminent absolute and specific mechanical properties compared to their associated ramie fabrics and ramie fiber‐based composites. The specific tensile strength of metal laminates is 3.80% and 50.56% higher than that of ramie fabrics and composite laminates. It was also found that the specific flexural and impact strengths of metal laminates are 70.02% and 89.12%, respectively, greater than those of composite laminates. In terms of quasi‐static indentation, metal laminates displayed specific energy absorption of 35.25 J/g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, which is 388.23% greater than composite laminates. These findings corroborated the addition of aluminum skin layers provided the laminated structures with superior absolute and specific mechanical properties.

In this paper, pulsed eddy current testing (PECT) was employed to inspect local incomplete brazing defects. Finite element simulation and experiment verification were conducted to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The peak value of the PECT signal was found to be sensitive to the presence of the defect. With the aid of an industrial robotic arm, line and two-dimensional scans were performed of the PECT probe above the panel specimen. The prefabricated incomplete brazing foil was successfully imaged as a notched ring, whose opening coincides with the physical length of the missing brazing.

This new model is built on the same\nwavelet-based dynamically adaptive core as wavetrisk, which itself\nuses dynamico's mimetic vector-invariant multilayer rotating shallow water\nformulation. Both codes use a Lagrangian vertical coordinate with\nconservative remapping. The ocean variant solves the incompressible\nmultilayer shallow water equations with inhomogeneous density layers. Time integration uses barotropic–baroclinic mode splitting via an semi-implicit free surface\nformulation, which is about 34–44 times faster than an unsplit explicit time-stepping. The barotropic and baroclinic estimates of the free surface\nare reconciled at each time step using layer dilation. No slip\nboundary conditions at coastlines are approximated using volume\npenalization. The vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients are computed from a closure model based on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Results are presented for a standard set of ocean model test cases adapted to the sphere (seamount, upwelling and baroclinic turbulence). An innovative feature\nof wavetrisk-ocean is that it could be coupled easily to the wavetrisk\natmosphere model, thus providing a first building block toward an integrated Earth system model using a consistent modelling framework with dynamic mesh adaptivity and mimetic properties.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Along with specialized functions, cells of multicellular organisms also perform essential functions common to most if not all cells. Whether diverse cells do this by using the same set of genes, interacting in a fixed coordinated fashion to execute essential functions, or a subset of genes specific to certain cells, remains a central question in biology. Here, we focus on gene coexpression to search for a core cellular network across a whole organism. Single-cell RNA-sequencing measures gene expression of individual cells, enabling researchers to discover gene expression patterns that contribute to the diversity of cell functions. Current efforts to study cellular functions focus primarily on identifying differentially expressed genes across cells. However, patterns of coexpression between genes are probably more indicative of biological processes than are the expression of individual genes. We constructed cell-type-specific gene coexpression networks using single-cell transcriptome datasets covering diverse cell types from the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We detected a set of highly coordinated genes preserved across cell types and present this as the best estimate of a core cellular network. This core is very small compared with cell-type-specific gene coexpression networks and shows dense connectivity. Gene members of this core tend to be ancient genes and are enriched for those encoding ribosomal proteins. Overall, we find evidence for a core cellular network in diverse cell types of the fruit fly. The topological, structural, functional, and evolutionary properties of this core indicate that it accounts for only a minority of essential functions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Sava suture zone of the internal Dinarides contains Maastrichtian trench-fill sediments, termed &amp;amp;#8220;Sava flysch&amp;amp;#8221; that record the closure of the northern branch of the Neotethys. Subsequent collision between Adria-derived thrust sheets and blocks of European affinity in Latest Cretaceous to Paleogene times culminated in the formation of the Dinarides fold-and-thrust belt. The suture zone hosts numerous Oligocene plutons of I-type granitic composition. Many of these intrusions are located in the center of metamorphic core complexes (MCCs) that were exhumed in early Miocene times. This phase of post-collisional extension was concomitant with the opening of the northerly adjacent Pannonian Basin and associated with granitic S-type magmatism. Both the processes responsible for extensional deformation and magmatic activity in the internal Dinarides are still a matter of debate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our Study contributes spatio-temporal constraints to better understand the tectono-magmatic processes of this area. We present field-kinematic, geochronological, and thermobarometric data from two MCCs at the transition between the internal Dinarides and the Pannonian Basin. Both MCCs are characterized by plutonic rocks in the center, surrounded by up to amphibolite-grade mylonites of exhuming shear zones. Heterogeneous extensional reactivation of formerly contractional structures that gave rise to these core complexes as low-angle detachments in the early Miocene is indicated by a variation in deformation ages of 3 Ma, obtained by Ar-Ar in-situ dating of white mica from deformed rocks of the respective shear zones. While Motajica MCC was exhumed from within the Sava zone during E-W extension at approximately 20 Ma, Cer MCC was exhumed as part of the underlying Adriatic basement during N-S extension between 17-16 Ma. For the Cer MCC, a concordia age of 17.6&amp;amp;#177;0.1 Ma (2&amp;amp;#963;) obtained by U-Pb LA-ICP-MS on zircons from an S-type granite in combination with an Ar-Ar inverse isochron age of 16.6&amp;amp;#177;0.2 Ma (2&amp;amp;#963;) obtained on white mica from the same sample, indicate a cooling rate of approximately 400&amp;amp;#176;C/Ma.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our results contribute to the idea of rapid exhumation of mid-crustal material in the form of MCCs in response to the opening of the Pannonian Basin. This is further corroborated by results of Raman spectroscopy on carbonaceous material, as the temperature profile across the shear zone implies extremely condensed isotherms of 250&amp;amp;#176;C/km. Additionally, U-Pb analyses show that zircons of the I-type intrusion contain inherited cores with age maxima at 270 Ma and 516 Ma and newly formed rims with an age maximum at 31.7 Ma, indicating the timing of intrusion. The S-type granite of Cer in parts reworks the I-type intrusion, as inherited cores include ages of 31-32 Ma, while the rims show an age of 17-18 Ma, suggesting a syn-extensional emplacement. Our data further shows that zircons of the I-type intrusion contain a significant amount of inherited cores with an age spectrum that resembles the detrital age spectrum from sediments of the Sava zone. This challenges the idea that these I-type melts were solely generated from igneous protoliths, and rather suggests a formation from melting of Paleozoic to Mesozoic successions constituting tectonically buried nappes of the internal Dinarides.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The DHRS consists of two circuits of direct reactor auxiliary cooling system and one circuit of reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system. The evaluation tool is a one-dimensional plant dynamics code, Super-COPD, with a debris bed module. The coolability evaluations have indicated that the current core catcher design secures sufficient natural circulation flows around the core catcher to ensure the debris bed cooling when at least one circuit of DHRS was activated. Sensitivity analyses under a pessimistic condition have shown that the debris bed is coolable with at least one circuit of improved DHRS even if most fuel accumulates on the core catcher in a short term.</jats:p>",

And a three-dimensional finite element stress-seepage coupled calculation model of the dam was established to study the deformation and stresses of the dam under the condition of normal storage water level and the sharp drop in the storage level. The test results show that the permeability coefficient of the clay core material is close to that of the dam shell material, resulting in the leakage of the dam under the condition of the low-water level. The simulation results show that the dam deforms a little under the condition of normal storage water level and the sharp drop in the storage level, and the stress distribution under the condition of the sharp drop in the storage level is basically consistent with that under the condition of normal storage water level. The safety factors of the dam under the two conditions meet the requirements of the specification, but the margin of the safety factor is small.</jats:p>",

In a core–shell structure, each discrete nanothermite particle can undergo an exothermic reaction as the oxygen atoms in the metal oxide shell undergo a solid state diffusion to oxidize the metal core. This feature allows the spherical core–shell nanothermites to react in the absence of gaseous oxygen, thus modifying their group combustion characteristics compared to char or liquid fuels. Using a number of simplifying assumptions, a theoretical framework was established—based on existing group combustion theory—to examine the characteristics of mass and heat diffusion in nanothermite combustion. First, a model for the quasi-steady state single-particle combustion, in quiescent air, was established. The isolated particle combustion theory serves as the basis for the combustion interaction and mass transfer in a spherical cloud of dispersed nanothermite particles. The type of group combustion is strongly dependent on the diffusion of vapour products, i.e., the interaction is more pronounced when the diffusion of vapour products is higher. The group combustion regimes in dispersed nanothermites were identified and delineated.</jats:p>"

Here we report the first observation of the formation of fluctuation structures in the pellet plasmoid during the pellet ablation process by a fast camera in a medium-sized fusion device, Heliotron J. The fluctuation has a normalized fluctuation level of ~ 15% and propagates around the moving pellet across the magnetic field. By comparing the fluctuation structures with the shape of magnetic field lines calculated with the field line tracing code, we successfully reconstruct the spatio-temporal structure of the fluctuations during the pellet ablation process. The fluctuations are located at the locations displaced toroidally from the pellet and propagate in the cross-field direction around the pellet axis along the field line, indicating a three-dimensional behavior and structure of fluctuations. The fluctuation would be driven by a strong inhomogeneity formed around the pellet and invoke the relaxation of the gradient through a cross-field transport induced by the fluctuations, which could affect the pellet ablation and pellet fueling processes. Such fluctuations can be ubiquitously present at the inhomogeneity formed around a pellet in the pellet ablation process in fusion devices.</jats:p>"

We used Louvain clustering on tissue-specific gene interaction networks and their subgraphs exclusively containing autism-related genes to study the effects of peripheral gene interactions.

Functional failure becomes an important factors in the natural circulation system operation failure, which needs to be considered in the system reliability analysis. In order to solve the problem of multi-dimensional uncertainty parameters and small functional failure probability of passive systems, an efficient functional reliability estimation method based on improved response surface and importance sampling subset simulation was presented. This method was applied in natural circulation cooling in XAPR reactor core. Combined with MLOCA, the uncertainties related to the input parameters and the model were considered. And then the probability of functional failure and the sensitivity measures were estimated with the combination of response surface method and importance sampling subset simulation method. The assessment results show that the functional failure probability is 3.796 × 10−3, and it is fully considered the functional failure in the passive system reliability analysis. Meanwhile, this method has high computed efficiency and excellent computed accuracy compared with traditional probability analysis methods, and it is robust to nonlinear functional function of XAPR.</jats:p>",

Only a small number of studies have measured patient-reported outcomes or included patients in the selection of outcomes that are meaningful to them. This study was a cross-sectional, qualitative study of 15 patient participants conducted to inform a core outcome set. A core outcome set is an approach to facilitate standardisation in outcome reporting, allowing direct comparison of outcomes across studies to enhance understanding of impacts and potential harms. The aim of this study was to incorporate the patient perspective in the development of a core outcome set by eliciting a detailed understanding of outcomes of importance to patients. Data were collected via online, semi-structured interviews using a novel method informed by co-design and the nominal group technique. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Outcomes elicited from patient stakeholder interviews highlighted several under-explored areas for future research. This includes the role of grief and loss in increased risk couples, the role of empowerment in conceptualising the utility of RGCS, the impact of societal context and barriers that contribute to negative experiences, and the role of genetic counselling in ensuring that information needs are met and informed choice facilitated as RGCS becomes increasingly routine. Future research should focus on incorporating outcomes that accurately reflect patient needs and experience.</jats:p>"

Samples were taken by using a simple random technique and obtained VIII A class as an experimental and VIII C as a control class. Subjects of this study were determined by using the purposive technique and obtained two students from each thinking style category.

Before testing the effectiveness of learning, the prerequisite test is conducted first, namely the normality and homogeneity test. The qualitative data analysis technique was carried out by using qualitative descriptive methods, including data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. The results showed that (1) the implementation of the CORE learning model is effective towards students’ mathematical reasoning ability; and (2) subject with concrete sequential have good ability in mathematical reasoning; subject with abstract sequential tends to be very good in mathematical reasoning ability; subject with concrete random tends to be good in mathematical reasoning ability; subject with abstract random tends to have the low ability in mathematical reasoning.</jats:p>"

It has previously been shown that this encapsulation system is highly dynamic, implying existence of different populations; GFP free in solution or complexed with polymers (small complexes) and EGFP encapsulated in C3Ms. We performed time resolved fluorescence anisotropy experiments to determine the relative populations of EGFP encapsulated in C3Ms using three different fluorescence anisotropy decay analysis methods. First, Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) data analysis was employed for five different EGFP concentrations in C3Ms that were mixed with dark fluorescent proteins (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% EGFP, respectively). In all cases, correlation-time distributions between 0.1 and 100 ns (on a logarithmic timescale) are clearly visible showing bimodal distribution. The distribution between 0.1 and 2.0 ns is due to homo-FRET between EGFP molecules packed in micelles and the distribution between 8 and 30 ns coincides with the correlation-time distribution of free EGFP in solution. The fraction of homo-FRET distribution linearly increases with increase of relative micellar EGFP concentrations. These MEM results were corroborated by two different analysis methods: global population analysis of all five fluorescence anisotropy decays arising from EGFP in micelles together with the one of free EGFP (direct analysis of anisotropies) and global associative population analysis of anisotropies by fitting parallel and perpendicular fluorescence decay components. In contrast to global analyses approaches, the MEM method directly reveals distributions of correlation times without any prior information about the sample. However, global associative analysis of anisotropies by fitting parallel and perpendicular fluorescence decay components is the only method that allows to estimate accurately fractions of free fluorophores in solution and encapsulated fluorophores.</jats:p>",

Reactor core inventory, accident source term and dose consequence of DHR400 is calculated in the event of fuel handling accident and core damage accident. The ORIGEN2 code developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory is used to calculate the core inventory for an operating period of five years before refueling. Based on regulations for environmental radiation protection of China and regulatory guide of NRC, the accident scenario and source term assumption of design based accident and beyond design based accident are discussed. The accidental releases of radioactive material from reactor is calculated and evaluated based on the ARCON96 program sponsored by the NRC. In this paper, an overall systematic analysis method, which includes key aspects in the calculation, such as hazard assessment, source term estimation and timing, dose assessment and so on, is proposed to determine emergency planning zone (EPZ) of DHR400. The result shows that 114m could be used as the recommended boundary of EPZ of DHR400 in one specific DHR400 site.</jats:p>",

When it is applied for supercapacitors’ electrode materials, ZIF‐90@ZIF‐67 delivers the best energy storage ability and excellent electrochemical stability. In a three‐electrode system, its specific capacitance reaches 1357.8 F g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 1 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and maintains 55.4% while increasing the current density from 1 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to 20 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. In a two‐electrode system, an all‐solid‐state asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled using ZIF‐90@ZIF‐67 and activated carbon (CV) as the positive and negative electrode material. The simple device exhibits a high specific capacitance of 151.6 F g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 0.5 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and a high energy density of 53.9 Wh kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 510.2 W kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

Finally, two simple all‐solid‐state supercapacitors in series power a blue lighting‐emitting diode for over 13 min, which reveals that the core–shell ZIF‐90@ZIF‐67 has great potential application prospects in the field of energy storage.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The present paper aims to evaluate the use of some nanolime-silica core-shell for consolidation process of these weak limestone artifacts. Two concentrations (5% and 10% w/w) were prepared for consolidating the aged limestone cubic samples. After complete drying, the cubic stones were exposed to the accelerated heat aging. The evaluation of consolidation process for the treated and aged treated samples was performed by some analytical methods such as measurement of physical properties and compressive strength. While, the investigation of surface morphology was carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and measurement of contact angle. The characterization process for the prepared core-shell showed the smoothness and spherical shape of the grains with approximate size of 72 nm. The results of physical properties revealed that the treated samples with 10% of nanolime-silica core-shell gave the lowest porosity (15.57%) and water absorption (6.26%). Additionally, the treated samples with 10% concentration of nanolime-silica core-shell gave the highest values of compressive strength (21.23 Cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/ Kg) and contact angle (122.78°). Moreover, the investigation using SEM revealed that the smoothness and good penetration for the treated sample with 10% concentration of nanolime-silica core-shell.

Dynamic balance by functional reach test, static balance by single leg stance and strength of core were evaluated before and after inducing the fatigue.  Fatigue was induced by asking the participant to perform the squats till RPE of 10. Results: On data analysis using paired t test, a marked decrease in the single leg stance time mean from 26.63 seconds before fatigue to 22.55 seconds after inducing fatigue (p&lt;0.05) was observed. A reduction in the functional reach distance covered by subjects from 31.8cms before fatigue to 29.33cms after inducing fatigue (p&lt;0.05) was observed.

Yet, studies of ceramic production have shown that there are sometimes limited or more subtle changes in the ceramic economy throughout such political fluctuations. This article synthesizes recent efforts to address political economic changes via geochemical characterization (neutron activation analysis; NAA) in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin in western Mexico. This region was home to the Purépecha state and then empire (Tarascan; ca. AD 1350–1530), one of the most powerful kingdoms in the Americas before European arrival. The combined ceramic dataset from four sites in the region result in eight geochemical groups. Our analysis indicates that the region experienced long-term and relatively stable ceramic production that was not substantially altered by the emergence of the state and empire. In addition, we find evidence for (1) dispersed, localized production; (2) long-lived compositional ceramic recipes; and (3) a complex ceramic economy with differential community participation. We discuss why documenting local ceramic production and craft production more generally is important for the study of past political economies.</jats:p>",

The next step is to take the eight core component categories and undertake a rigorous fidelity assessment as part of formal process evaluation where the components can be critiqued and measured across multiple nursing home sites. The core components can then be used as evidence‐based building blocks for developing, implementing and evaluating nursing home hospital avoidance programmes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve the inherent safety and cost-effectiveness of lead-bismuth cooled fast reactors, the SPALLER-100 reactor designed by the University of South China has been selected as the research object to determine the maximum power it can produce. This is a multi-objective, complex, multi-dimensional, nonlinear, and constrained optimization problem. To maintain the transportability, material durability, and long-term operation stability of the reactor core and ensure safety under accident conditions, three steady-state limitations and three accident limitations are proposed. The platform used to calculate the maximum neutronic power produced by the reactor at different core heights has been built using Latin hypercube sampling and the Kriging proxy model. Meanwhile, the cooling power of the reactor at different core heights is calculated by considering its natural circulation capacity. Finally, a design scheme is obtained that meets the requirements of neutronic and thermal-hydraulic assessments, while producing maximum power. Consequently, during the entire life-cycle of SPALLER-100, a safety analysis of three typical accident scenarios (unprotected loss of heat sink, unprotected transient over power, and unprotected coolant inlet temperature undercooling) is performed using a Quasi-Static Reactivity Balance (QSRB) approach. The results show that the platform used to calculate the maximum neutronic power exhibits high accuracy, and that the design scheme with maximum power is safe and economical. Overall, this study can provide reference ideas for designing natural circulation reactors that can maximize power output.</jats:p>"

Choose five NESs here and inset them in the different places of the sandwich plate to suppress the vibration of the plate, which is excited by a half-wave shock. The coupled dynamic equations of the system are derived by the principle of conservation of energy. Then, the vibration-control performances of five NESs are discussed by numerical simulation. The distributions of the five NESs are analyzed, and the optimal position distributions are obtained. Based on the optimal location, the transient responses of the system are studied. Moreover, the performances of five NESs and a single NES are compared in different dimensions. Finally, it is found that the selection of parameters has a great impact on the effectiveness of the five NESs. The new distribution way is introduced to improve the suppression effects of the five NESs in the sandwich plate.</jats:p>"

We followed 49 students with extensive support needs and limited symbolic communication across 2 years in the classrooms of 53 teachers who engaged in ongoing coaching and professional development. At pretest, the students demonstrated an average of 15 of the 80 (19%) expressive skills on the Communication Matrix. Multilevel longitudinal modeling was used to analyze changes in scores over time. The findings suggest there was a statistically significant relationship between time and Communication Matrix scores, with the ends of each academic year associated with statistically significant growth at rates of 3.01% and 12.38%, respectively.

These functions are neutron diffusion within the core and reflector, macroscopic depletion or microscopic depletion calculation analysis, multi-channel or sub-channel thermal-hydraulic analysis, one-dimensional heat transfer from nuclear fuel to the coolant, critical search by boron concentration or control rod position, integral and differential worth of neutron absorbers, neutron kinetics parameters for transient analysis, in-core neutron detector response simulation etc. CORAL is convenient to update and maintain in consider of modular, object-oriented programming technology. In order to verify the computational capabilities of the reactor core analysis code, the BEAVRS benchmark is adopted as the research object. The BEAVRS problem is a benchmark problem based on real commercial PWRs with detailed material description, geometric information, core operating history, and detector measurement data. In this paper, the CORAL code is used to carry out physical analysis and calculation for the BEAVRS benchmark, and the response rate distribution of radial and axial detectors can be obtained. By comparing with the measurement results provided by the benchmark, it can be found that the calculation results of the CORAL code are in good agreement. This shows that the CORAL code can well simulate the detector response distribution in the core.</jats:p>",

The microparticle is trapped and rotated nearby the laser focus center. The rotation frequency is several Hertz and can be controlled by adjusting the laser power.

In this study, hybrid heparin/silica nanoparticles were synthesized, and the role of silica as a templating agent for heparin supramolecular organization was investigated. The effect of synthesis parameters on particles compositions was deeply investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) reveals a different supramolecular organization of both components, leading to amazing organic-inorganic nanoparticles with different behavior in drug encapsulation and release. Furthermore, favorable biocompatibility for healthy human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and tumor HS578T cells has been assessed, and a different biological behavior was observed, ascribed to different surface charge and morphology of synthesized nanoparticles.</jats:p>"

Laboratory and virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) examinations of culprit lesions were conducted before PCI. Patients were divided according to median apo-C3 into low apo-C3 (≤ 8.5 mg/dL) and high apo-C3 (&gt; 8.5 mg/dL) groups. VH-IVUS data indicated that the percentage of necrotic core volume (%NC) was significantly higher in the high apo-C3 group than in the low apo-C3 group. Moreover, the %NC significantly correlated with the apo-C3 level (R = 0.2109, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.037). Kaplan–Meier curve analysis revealed that freedom from MACEs exhibited a greater decrease in the high apo-C3 group than in the low apo-C3 group, and in the high %NC group than in the low %NC group. Multivariate Cox hazards analysis showed that the %NC and high apo-C3 were independent predictors of 4 year MACEs. Apo-C3 may be a useful marker of future MACEs in patients with SCD after PCI and contribute to %NC growth.</jats:p>"

The considerable price of Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) testing, as well as the time constraints imposed by the short duration of this experiment, and prior reports of the obedience of Quasi-Static Indentation (QSI) test findings to LVI test results, have encouraged researchers to employ QSI instead of LVI. This work compares the mechanical characteristics of composite laminates consisting of chopped glass and kenaf fibers as a core and investigates the effect of hybridizing the mentioned chopped fibers as the core of a laminate. Three types of laminates with different core materials were fabricated to do this research. The results showed that among the laminates with the same weight, kenaf core laminate has the highest resistance against indentation and has the best performance in terms of absorbed energy, peak load, and damaged region. Using chopped kenaf fiber instead of chopped glass fiber can increase the absorbed energy and the peak load by 36% and 17%, respectively. Also, hybridizing the mentioned chopped fibers has not fully maximized the properties of the composite laminate during the QSI test. Finally, finite element modelling of the laminates was performed, and the numerical and experimental results were pretty aligned. </jats:p>",

Following transient physical or pharmacological manipulations of embryo size, pre-gastrulation mouse embryos show remarkable plasticity to recover and resume normal development. However, it remains unclear how mechanisms driving lineage specification and morphogenesis respond to defects in cell proliferation during and after gastrulation. Null mutations in DNA replication or cell-cycle-related genes frequently lead to cell-cycle arrest and reduced cell proliferation, resulting in developmental arrest before the onset of gastrulation; such early lethality precludes studies aiming to determine the impact of cell proliferation on lineage specification and morphogenesis during gastrulation. From an unbiased ENU mutagenesis screen, we discovered a mouse mutant, tiny siren (tyrn), that carries a hypomorphic mutation producing an aspartate to tyrosine (D939Y) substitution in Pold1, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ. Impaired cell proliferation in the tyrn mutant leaves anterior–posterior patterning unperturbed during gastrulation but results in reduced embryo size and severe morphogenetic defects. Our analyses show that the successful execution of morphogenetic events during gastrulation requires that lineage specification and the ordered production of differentiated cell types occur in concordance with embryonic growth.</jats:p>",

The SiO2 shells of such two nanowires resulted from the reaction between SiO and CO and the reaction of SiO itself, respectively, based on the model analysis. The growth of these two nanowires conformed to the vapor—liquid—solid (VLS) mode. In this mode, CO played an important role in the growth of nanowires.

The naked dinoflagellate <jats:italic>Karlodinium veneficum</jats:italic> is a cosmopolitan and toxic species, which is also notorious in forming harmful algal blooms (HABs) and causing massive fish-kills. Here we reported the core microbiome tightly associated with 19 strains of <jats:italic>K. veneficum</jats:italic> that were originally isolated from 6 geographic locations along the coast of China and from an estuary of Chesapeake Bay, United States, and have been maintained in the laboratory for several months to over 14 years. Using high-throughput metabarcoding of the partial 16S rRNA gene amplicons, a total of 1,417 prokaryotic features were detected in the entire bacterial microbiome, which were assigned to 17 phyla, 35 classes, 90 orders, 273 families, and 716 genera. Although the bacterial communities associated with <jats:italic>K. veneficum</jats:italic> cultures displayed heterogeneity in feature (sequences clustered at 100% sequence similarity) composition among strains, a core set of 6 genera were found persistent in their phycospheres, which could contribute up to 74.54% of the whole bacterial microbiome. Three γ-proteobacteria members of the “core,” namely, <jats:italic>Alteromonas</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Marinobacter</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Methylophaga</jats:italic>, were the predominant core genera and made up 83.25% of the core bacterial microbiome.

In general, Mencius accepts 'Mozi is Gyeom-ae (兼爱)' which is what Mencius said while criticizing the philosophy of Mozi, and insists that the central thought of the philosophy of Mozi is Gyeom-ae (兼愛).\r\nHowever, in this thesis, I would like to emphasize that the core of the Mozi philosophy is 'Uy(義)' derived from ‘Heaven's will(天志)’.\r\nAnd then. Through Mozi's by side 'Heaven's will(天志)･legal way(法儀)･ valuable Uy(貴義), Gyeom-ae(兼愛)', I want to find the source of the thought that Mozi centered on. Mozi is looking from heaven(天)for the source of the direction in which the most persecuted people in the turbid world should live, called the age of Warring States period.\r\n'What heaven(天) wants is a righteous world where people live and help each other equally.' and at the same time, he said. it is called 'nothing else on earth is more precious than the righteousness' and Among them 'the Uy(義)' is the most valuable value. It is emphasized that people should use 'the Uy(義)' as the standard of value in life and continue to do a righteous acts. If scholars act righteously, they contribute to society by leaving much more profit than the merchants in the face of difficulties.\r\nAs such, people insist on serving the will of heaven, 'The Uy(義)', and practicing the spirit of 'serving' and 'sharing' to share with the world.\r\nIn Mozi, ' The Uy(義)' is a dual concept, meaning 'the right thing(正)' and 'correcting(政)' in side 'legal way(法儀)'.\r\nIn other words, 'Uy(義)' has a dual meaning, which means moral role as 'right thing(正)' and political role as 'correcting(政)' and it is said that it has both the moral concept of right and the concept of punishment to be observed.\r\nIt is in the same context as the doctrine of Gyeom-ae(兼愛) that the Uy(義) of Mozi is the spirit of \"serving\" and \"sharing.\" The Doctrine of Gyeom-ae(兼愛) in Mozi’s is a means and a way to a righteous society.\r\nIn the end, Mozi's doctrine of Gyeom-ae(兼愛) is a shortcut to practicing righteousness and a way out of a difficult environment for people's lives.\r\nGyeom-ae(兼愛) is a very important concept in the philosophy of Mozi, but it is a means to practice the Uy(義). Conclusionally, I will say that the core of Mozi's philosophy is ‘‘Heaven’s Will(天志) is the Uy(義).’</jats:p>",

The Chinji, Nagri, Dhok Pathan, and Soan Formations of the Siwalik Group were deposited by river meandering flood plains, braided rivers, and alluvial fan systems, respectively. The Siwalik Group is classified into seven major facies and many minor facies based on sedimentological properties. According to the petrographic analysis, the Siwalik Group sandstone is classified as litharenite and feldspathic litharenite petrofacies. The sandstone of the Siwalik Group is texturally mature, but compositionally it is immature. The data shown on the tectonic discrimination diagrams point to a recycled orogen provenance field for the Siwalik sandstone. In addition to quartz and feldspar, the sandstone includes clasts of volcanic, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock types. The igneous and metamorphic rock clasts were derived from the Lesser and Higher Himalayas. The sedimentary lithic fragments, on the other hand, are derived from both the earlier molasse and pre-molasse rocks. The presence of lithic fragments of the earlier molasse sandstone in the Siwalik sandstone indicates that the Siwalik Group sandstones were deposited during the Middle Stage of the Himalayan orogeny. The paleoclimatic conditions were semi-arid to semi-humid during the Siwalik Group’s deposition. The presence of clay minerals in the shale reveals the intense chemical weathering processes that occurred during their deposition on the flood plains of the river meandering system.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this article is an analytical analysis of studies devoted to kickboxing. Material and methods. The bibliometric database Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) is analyzed. 194 articles that met the search criteria were selected for the primary analysis. We used bibliometric methods for processing the information received in the context of kickboxing. The VOSviewer 1.6.18 software was used: keyword analysis method and direct citation analysis with the construction of bibliometric maps, visualization of cluster density, and citation weights. Results. The constructed bibliometric maps made it possible to identify the leading thematic areas of research, the most popular areas of research in this area. They can be divided into sports and rehabilitation and recreational areas. In a sports context, these include the performance of technical and tactical elements of kickboxing, the study of the physiological characteristics of combat sports athletes; assessment of the main physical qualities and analysis of the adaptive potential of athletes; the study of biochemical and features of homeostasis, the state of the cardiorespiratory system; highlighting factors important for winning competitions. In the rehabilitation context, kickboxing is used to optimize the functional state, recover from injuries, and improve the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases. The use of the VOSviewer software, version 1.6.18, made it possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the problem, to determine the priority scientific directions in this area. In sports, this is an analysis of the technical and tactical indicators of athletes, the time spent on their implementation, the study of the metabolic characteristics of combat sports athletes, and the assessment of their physical qualities. Conclusions. The conducted bibliometric analysis of publications on the problem of kickboxing confirms the relevance of this area of sports science. There is a lack of research on a comprehensive study of success, monitoring the state of kickboxing athletes. These directions should be recognized as the most relevant in this area.</jats:p>"

The HCMV core nuclear egress complex (core NEC), a heterodimer of viral proteins pUL50 and pUL53, is therefore considered a promising target for new antiviral drugs. We have recently shown that a 29-mer peptide presenting an N-terminal alpha-helical hook-like segment of pUL53, through which pUL53 interacts with pUL50, binds to pUL50 with high affinity, and inhibits the pUL50–pUL53 interaction in vitro. Here, we show that this peptide is also able to interfere with HCMV infection of cells, as well as with core NEC formation in HCMV-infected cells. As the target of the peptide, i.e., the pUL50–pUL53 interaction, is localized at the inner nuclear membrane of the cell, the peptide had to be equipped with translocation moieties that facilitate peptide uptake into the cell and the nucleus, respectively. For the resulting fusion peptide (NLS-CPP-Hook), specific cellular and nuclear uptake into HFF cells, as well as inhibition of infection with HCMV, could be demonstrated, further substantiating the HCMV core NEC as a potential antiviral target.</jats:p>"

These new opioids include members of the 2-benzyl benzimidazole (eg, isotonitazene, metonitazene, <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">N</jats:italic>-pyrrolidino etonitazene, protonitazene, etodesnitazene), benzimidazolone (eg, brorphine), and cinnamylpiperazine (eg, AP-238, 2-methyl AP-237) subclasses. Novel synthetic opioids continue to be detected in opioid-related fatal overdoses, demonstrating the harms associated with exposure to these drugs. Between January 2020 and December 2021, 384 casework blood samples were reported by our laboratory to contain 1 or more of the prior listed 8 NSOs. Isotonitazene (n = 144), metonitazene (n = 122), and brorphine (n = 91) were the 3 most prevalent substances, with positivity for isotonitazene and brorphine peaking just before the announcement of emergency scheduling. These NSOs have been documented as significant drivers of drug mortality, and this case series described here highlights the challenges medical examiners and coroners face in staying current with emerging drugs. Challenges include regional differences, rapid turnover, short lifecycles, variable toxicology testing, and difficulty in assessing individual drug toxicity in polydrug cases.</jats:p>",

The shielding properties of the material are analyzed in details section. Cross-sectional observation and sheet resistance measurement were used to determine the thickness and electrical conductivity of the electromagnetic shielding layer, which was generated by spray-coating; this aided in confirming the uniformity of the coating film. The results indicate that the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness increases when the silver-coated copper paste (core-shell paste) is used as the coating material rather than the conventional aluminum base. The proposed material can be used in various frequency ranges owing to the excellent shielding effectiveness of the core-shell paste used in this study. Further investigations on the optimized spray-coating type of electromagnetic shielding material are required based on the composition of the core-shell paste and the thickness of the coating film.</jats:p>"

No entanto, a CIF apresenta muitas categorias que dificultam o seu uso diário e, por isso, foram criados os core sets. Entre os diversos core sets propostos, existe um core set para condições cardiorrespiratórias pós-agudas. Objetivo: classificar os pacientes com alterações cardíacas, respiratórias e mistas, assistidos ambulatoriais por meio de um core sets para esta população, além de verificar se existem diferenças entre os grupos na aplicação deste core set. Métodos: Foram avaliados indivíduos com diagnóstico clínico de doenças cardiorrespiratórias em acompanhamento fisioterapêutico ambulatorial para reabilitação cardiopulmonar. A amostra foi dividida em três grupos: cardíacos, respiratórios e mistos. Os pacientes foram avaliados por meio da versão abreviada do core set para condições cardiorrespiratórios pós-agudas, funcionalidade, força de preensão palmar e dos músculos respiratórios. Resultados: A amostra foi composta por 67 indivíduos alocados de acordo com seu comprometimento. Verificou-se que apenas as funções de energia e impulso, cardíaca e de ingestão, estrutura do sistema respiratório e a atividade andar apresentaram respostas significativamente diferentes entres os grupos. Pacientes com distúrbios respiratórios, cardíacos e mistos apresentam perfis funcionais semelhantes, porém as categorias com diferença desse perfil foram as relacionadas ao sistema respiratório, atividades e funções relacionadas ao aumento da demanda metabólica como andar. Conclusão: Assim é possível afirmar que o core set auxilia a identificar as disfunções dos pacientes sem depender se sua disfunção é cardíaca, respiratória ou mista que pode ser uma ferramenta utilizada no meio clínico.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Various wind turbine blade components, such as shear webs and skins, commonly use fiber-reinforced composite sandwich structures with a core material like balsa or foam. During manufacturing, core gap defects may result from the misalignment of adjacent foam or balsa core sheets in the blade mold. It is important to understand the influence that core gaps have on the structural integrity of wind turbine blades and how to mitigate their influence. This research characterized the effects of core gap defects at the manufacturing and mechanical levels for both epoxy and next-generation thermoplastic composites. Common repair methods were assessed and compared. Multiple defect sizes were compared using temperature data gathered with thermocouples embedded during manufacturing to core gap defect characteristics obtained using image-mapping techniques, optical microscopy, and mechanical characterization by long beam flexure. Results showed that peak exothermic temperatures during curing were closely related to core gap size. The long beam flexure tests determined that transverse core gaps under pure bending loads can have a substantial effect on the ultimate facesheet strength of both epoxy and thermoplastic composite sandwich structures (up to 25% strength reduction), although the size of the defect itself had less of an influence on the magnitude of the strength reduction. The supporting image-mapping techniques indicated that the distortion of the composite facesheets by the core gaps contributed to the premature failures. The repair methods used in this study did very little to improve the ultimate strength of the sandwich panels that previously had core gap defects. The repair of the thermoplastic panel resulted in a further loss in ultimate facesheet strength. This research demonstrated that there is a vital need for the development of a compatible thermoplastic polymer repair resin system and appropriate resin specific repair procedures for the next generation of recyclable thermoplastic wind blades. </jats:p>",

The device contains pins with a fuel material that is in a solid state during normal operation but melts and fluidizes during an unprotected loss of flow (ULOF) or unprotected transient overpower (UTOP) accident. By rapidly transferring the liquefied device fuel into the lower plenum region of the pins via gravitation alone, the device can passively provide a large negative reactivity to the core. In this study, the nuclear and thermal properties of the device subassembly with metallic fuel were evaluated to determine the basic device specifications for proper device operation during ULOF and UTOP accidents. The results of the transient analysis of the ULOF initiating phase in a 750-MWe-class MOX-fueled SFR core showed that a conventional homogeneous core can maintain stable cooling of the core prior to coolant boiling in the driver fuel subassemblies. On the other hand, the negative reactivity required to terminate the event by device operation was found to be slightly larger in the low sodium void reactivity core than in the conventional homogeneous core.</jats:p>",

Combined with digital core technology and the digital volume image correlation method, the 3D characterization of meso-structure and the evolution process of localized damage in mudstone were analyzed. The research shows that brittle minerals such as quartz in mudstone often exist in the form of agglomerated strips, resulting in the formation of weak structural planes at the contact surfaces of different minerals. There are a large number of primary intergranular pores near the mineral accumulation zone. With the increase in axial load, the connectivity of pores will gradually increase, cracks will gradually emerge, internal pores will develop abnormally, and rocks will reach the critical state of failure; at this time, the throat number and coordination number of pores increase obviously. There was no obvious difference found in the distribution of mineral particles of different sizes, and the slip between mineral zones was mainly dominated by small particles. The accumulated mineral zone was able to easily form a weak surface, and the aggregated mineral zone under loading was easily able to produce local deformation, which is related to the mechanical properties of the mineral zone and its surrounding rock matrix, with the rock failure easily occurring along the junction of the two minerals. The displacement in the polymeric mineral zone was small, the deformation displacement of the rock skeleton dominated by clay minerals near the quartz mineral zone was larger, and the stronger quartz minerals restrained the rock skeleton deformation in the region.</jats:p>"

Construction of semiconductor heterojunctions can solve these problems. CdS has a narrow band gap, which can effectively utilize visible light, and it has a band structure matched with that of SrTiO3. Therefore, CdS is considered as an ideal candidate for constructing heterojunctions with SrTiO3. In this paper, bamboo pulp fibers were used as the substrate, and SrTiO3 was coated on the substrate through the solvothermal process. CF/SrTiO3 rich in oxygen vacancies was formed by high temperature carbonization, and heterojunctions were formed by loading CdS on the surface of the CF/SrTiO3 composite material through the hydrothermal method, thus obtaining one-dimensional CF/SrTiO3/CdS core–shell photocatalysts. The structure and photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the CF/SrTiO3/CdS core–shell photocatalysts were mainly studied. The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment showed that the hydrogen production rate of the CF/SrTiO3/CdS-2 sample under the optimized process was as high as 577.39 μmol/g·h, which was about 11 times that of the CF/SrTiO3 sample. In this composite photocatalytic material system, the loading of the CdS nanospheres could enhance the visible light absorption capacity of the composite catalyst, promote the rapid separation and high-speed migration of photocarriers, and significantly improve the photocatalytic activity.</jats:p>"

Given the aforementioned situation, the functional immune cell contents correlated with CM patient prognosis are needed to optimize present predictive models and reflect the overall situation of TME. We developed a novel risk score named core tumor-infiltrating immune cell score (cTICscore), which showed certain advantages over existing biomarkers or TME-related signatures in predicting the prognosis of CM patients. Furthermore, we explored a new gene signature named cTILscore−related module gene score (cTMGs), based on four identified TME-associated genes (<jats:italic>GCH1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>GZMA</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>PSMB8</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>PLAAT4</jats:italic>) showing a close correlation with the cTICscore, which was generated by weighted gene co-expression network analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis to facilitate clinical application.

Continuous enhancement in the intake and negligent domestic ejection of these cytostatic agents are the main grounds for the occurrence of active residual metabolites in various aquatic environments. Electrochemical sensors are a capable substitute for other conventional analytical methods for monitoring toxic drug pollutants due to their beneficial features. Thus, the purpose of this work is to demonstrate an energy-efficient fabrication of neodymium vanadate integrated with boron-doped carbon (NdVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/B–C) hybrid composite for the selective electrochemical determination of nilutamide (NT– anti-androgen drug). The choice of neodymium among rare earth metals has a significant impact on the electrochemical redox processes. In addition, rapid electron mobility for well-separated peaks and defined current potentials implies an improved active surface area in NdVO<jats:sub>4.</jats:sub> Therefore, the incorporation of B–C displays substantial enhancement in electronic conductivity, identifying the nanocomposite as a remarkable detecting candidate. The presence of multiple oxidation states of rare earth vanadate embedded on boron-doped activated carbon results in high synergistic interactions and advanced matrix structures that facilitate superlative electrocatalytic characteristics including the minimal R<jats:sub>ct</jats:sub> value (81.32 Ω.cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), wide linear-range responses (0.001–344 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>M), low limit of detection (0.0002 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>M), high sensitivity (5.56 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>A·<jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>M<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>), good stabilities (operational stability = 3000 s and storage stability = 20 days), and excellent selectivity (with an excess concentration of 12 interfering compounds).

It furthermore highlights the limitations of the standard method and suggests a three-level optimization, i.e., problem identification, target indicators, and system construction. Based on the framework of “mountain management–water management–moist city,” this paper proposes a set of ideas for formulating sponge city special planning. In this regard, the discussions are based on the formulation practice of Xining.</jats:p>"

However, the ability to accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies has yet to be demonstrated. The presence of cut-offs in the gamma-ray spectra of several young SNRs led to the idea that PeV energies might only be achieved during the first years of a remnant’s evolution. We use our time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in supernovae expanding into dense environments around massive stars. We performed spherically symmetric one-dimensional (1D) simulations in which we simultaneously solve the transport equations for cosmic rays, magnetic turbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit. We investigated typical circumstellar-medium (CSM) parameters expected around red supergiant (RSG) and luminous blue variable (LBV) stars for freely expanding winds and accounted for the strong γγ absorption in the first days after explosion. The maximum achievable particle energy is limited to below $600\\,$TeV even for the largest considered values of the magnetic field and mass-loss rates. The maximum energy is not expected to surpass $\\approx 200\\,$ and $\\approx 70\\,$TeV for LBVs and RSGs that experience moderate mass-loss prior to the explosion. We find gamma-ray peak-luminosities consistent with current upper limits and evaluate that current-generation instruments are able to detect the gamma-rays from Type-IIP explosions at distances up to $\\approx 60\\,$ kpc and Type-IIn explosions up to $\\approx 1.0\\,$ Mpc. We also find a good agreement between the thermal X-ray and radio synchrotron emission predicted by our models with a range of observations.</jats:p>",

This technique is capable of predicting the buckling load of different structures without reaching the failure point through modal testing. The composite lattice-core sandwich conical shell has been fabricated using a filament winding process. To perform the expriment, the fundamental natural frequency of the specimen is measured under stepped axial compression loading. The procedure is followed up without actually reaching the instability point when the structure collapses and is no longer usable. A finite element model has also been built in ABAQUS in order to determine the correlation between natural frequency and applied compressive load. A comparison of the results indicated that the VCT has provided a reliable estimate of the buckling load of composite lattice-core sandwich conical shells, especially when the structure is loaded up to at least 66% of the experimental buckling load and accuracy of the VCT decreases when the maximum load is lower than 43% of the buckling load. Results also revealed that the linear fitted curve is unsuitable for the correlation between frequency of vibration and applied load in order to predict buckling load. </jats:p>",

The combination of multivalent charged and hydrophobic moieties in TD enables effective binding with biomolecules in NT. The higher crosslinking in the shell structure of nanogel excludes the abundant large serum proteins and allows for size‐selectivity in scavenging the medium‐sized septic molecules (10–30 kDa), e.g., lipopolysaccharides (LPS, a potent endotoxin in sepsis), thus reducing cytokine production. At the same time, the core–shell TD NT nanogel captures the overflowing proinflammatory cytokines effectively both in vitro and in vivo from biological fluids to further control hyperinflammation. Intraperitoneal injection of core–shell TD NT nanogel effectively attenuates NF‐κB activation and cytokine production in LPS‐induced septic mouse models.

In contrast to animal GPXs, the plant enzymes are non-seleno monomeric proteins that generally utilize TRX more effectively than GSH but can be a putative link between the two main redox systems. Because of the substantial differences compared to non-plant GPXs, use of the GPX-like (GPXL) name was suggested for Arabidopsis enzymes. GPX(L)s not only can protect cells from stress-induced oxidative damages but are crucial components of plant development and growth. Due to fine-tuning the H2O2 metabolism and redox homeostasis, they are involved in the whole life cycle even under normal growth conditions. Significantly new mechanisms were discovered related to their transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications by describing gene regulatory networks, interacting microRNA families, or identifying Lys decrotonylation in enzyme activation. Their involvement in epigenetic mechanisms was evidenced. Detailed genetic, evolutionary, and bio-chemical characterization, and comparison of the main functions of GPXs, demonstrated their species-specific roles. The multisided involvement of GPX(L)s in the regulation of the entire plant life ensure that their significance will be more widely recognized and applied in the future.</jats:p>"

Outstanding NIWs in the background wavefield were also observed inside the positive vorticity core of the CE, despite their lower strength and shallower residence (above 350 m) compared to the counterparts in the WE. Particularly, the near-inertial kinetic energy efficiently propagated downward and amplified below the surface layer in both eddies, leading to an elevated turbulent dissipation rate of up to 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup> W kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. In addition, bidirectional energy exchanges between the NIWs and mesoscale balanced flow occurred during NIWs’ downward propagation. The present study provides observational evidence for the enhanced downward NIW propagation by mesoscale eddies, which has significant implications for parameterizing the wind-driven diapycnal mixing in the eddying ocean.</jats:p>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>\n<jats:p>We provide observational evidence for the downward propagation of near-inertial waves enhanced by mesoscale eddies. This is significant because the down-taking of wind energy by the near-inertial waves is an important energy source for turbulent mixing in the interior ocean, which is essential to the shaping of ocean circulation and climate. The anticyclonic eddies are widely regarded as a conduit for the downward near-inertial energy propagation, while the cyclonic eddies activity influencing the near-inertial waves propagation lacks clear cognition. In this study, enhanced near-inertial waves and turbulent dissipation were observed inside both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in the Kuroshio Extension region, which has significant implications for improving the parameterization of turbulent mixing in ocean circulation and climate models.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The dominant causes for radiation exposure, solar particle events and galactic cosmic rays, contain high-energy protons. In space, astronauts need healthy and highly functioning cognitive abilities, of which the hippocampus plays a key role. Therefore, understanding the effects of 1H exposure on hippocampal-dependent cognition is vital for developing mitigative strategies and protective countermeasures for future missions. To investigate these effects, we subjected 6-month-old female CD1 mice to 0.75 Gy fractionated 1H (250 MeV) whole-body irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. The cognitive performance of the mice was tested 3 months after irradiation using Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Both sham-irradiated and 1H-irradiated mice significantly preferred exploration of the novel arm compared to the familiar and start arms, indicating intact spatial and short-term memory. Both groups statistically spent more time in the target quadrant, indicating spatial memory retention. There were no significant differences in neurogenic and gliogenic cell counts after irradiation. In addition, proteomic analysis revealed no significant upregulation or downregulation of proteins related to behavior, neurological disease, or neural morphology. Our data suggests 1H exposure does not impair hippocampal-dependent spatial or short-term memory in female mice.</jats:p>"

Accurate quantification of exemestane is important to set an optimal dose, and thus a simple assay for exemestane is developed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometer. Exemestane was extracted from human plasma samples (100 μL) by simple protein precipitation with acetonitrile/methanol (1/1, v/v). Interference peaks observed close to the elution of exemestane led us to use a core shell column for higher selectivity instead of totally porous columns. The extracts were chromatographed on CORTECS UPLC C18, under a gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and detected in the selected reaction monitoring. Validation parameters were assessed in accordance with the bioanalytical guidelines using quality control samples. Exemestane in human plasma was quantifiable from 0.5 to 50 ng/mL with high extraction recovery and minimal matrix effects. Hemolyzed or hyperlipemic plasma did not impact the exemestane assay. Exemestane was stable in human plasma for 392 days at −15°C or below. The developed assay was robust and successfully applied to quantifying exemestane concentrations in human plasma to support a clinical trial. </jats:p>",

Based on modes analysis and theoretical calculations, the phase-matching modes from multiple optional modes in the SHG process and the optimal SCF length are determined by calculating the effective refractive index and balancing the SHG growth and transmission loss. Due to the long-distance interaction between pumped fundamental mode and GaSe nanosheets around the suspended core, an SHG signal is observed under a milliwatt-level pump light, and exhibits a quadratic growth with the increased pump power. The SHG process is also realized in a broad wavelength range by varying the pump in the range of 1420∼1700 nm. The SCF with the large air cladding and suspended core as an excellent platform can therefore be employed to integrate low-dimensional nonlinear materials, which holds great promise for the applications of all-fiber structures in new light source generating, signal processing and fiber sensing.</jats:p>",

In this study, through a stringent bioinformatics analysis of the core genome and proteome of <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>pneumoniae</jats:italic> PCS8235, we identified and analyzed 28 HPs that are common in many <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic> species and might have a potential role in the virulence or pathogenesis of the bacteria. Functional annotations of the proteins were conducted based on the physicochemical properties, subcellular localization, virulence prediction, protein-protein interactions, and identification of essential genes, to find potentially druggable proteins among 28 HPs. The majority of the HPs are involved in bacterial transcription and translation. Besides, some of them were homologs of enzymes, binding proteins, transporters, and regulators. Protein-protein interactions revealed HP PCS8235_RS05845 made the highest interactions with other HPs and also has TRP structural motif along with virulent and pathogenic properties indicating it has critical cellular functions and might go under unconventional protein secretions.

The SST at core of the anticyclonic eddy was 0.4°C lower than that in its peripheral region. The MLD at the center of the eddy was about half of that outside the eddy. Below the surface mixed layer, a lens-shaped structure containing relatively well-mixed water was observed between the two high-gradient layers. Within this lens-shaped structure, the isothermal layers were stretched, but accompanied by water mixing that was about one third of that at the upper and lower bounds of the structure. This eddy originated from a Kuroshio Current intrusion in late October 2020 and died in November 2021, such that its lifespan exceeded 1 year. The shedding of the Kuroshio Loop into the SCS under strong air–sea interactions under continuous sea surface cooling in winter was considered a key mechanism for the generation of the cold core of the eddy. The lens-shaped structure formed below the surface mixed layer and was maintained through geostrophic balance by the subsurface maximum speeds of the Kuroshio Current intrusion (50–100 m), thereby forming a shallower MLD in the eddy center. The subsurface speed maximum within the eddy was also observed by a shipborne acoustic Doppler current profiler at 10 months after its formation, confirming the hypothesized mechanism. This type of abnormal anticyclonic may be a common phenomenon in the northern SCS and has potential implications for the local biogeochemistry, local heat budget, and regional oceanic models.</jats:p>"

The steel batches were case-hardened in the as-delivered condition. However, in the industrial practice it is common that pre-heat treatments are done, such as annealing to a ferritic-pearlitic microstructure, or quenching and tempering, as well as forging as a process if for example larger gears are needed. It is known that the whole heat treatment process route can affect the grain size negatively. Therefore, this publication presents investigations into the effects of preheat treatments on the grain size in the core region of ultra-clean gear steels after case-hardening. The aim is to receive a deeper understanding on how the whole process route influences the grain size in the core region of ultra-clean gear steels.</jats:p>",

Also, we used thin sections and fluid analysis throughout the investigation. Python’s 1-D backstripping technique was used to determine the abrupt changes in subsidence rates and their effect on the reservoir’s quality. The results defined that the potential reservoirs include, from top to bottom, Mauddud, Upper Burgan, Lower Zubair, and Ratawi Limestone. The reservoir facies reflect different environments between the carbonate ramp (Mauddud, Ratawi Limestone, and Minagish reservoirs), delta plain (Zubair reservoir), and margin shelf (Burgan reservoir), and its quality is graded from Mauddud to Ratawi Limestone from top to bottom. The field lies up-dip under Kuwait Bay and represents the continuation of super-giant Greater Burgan Field. It filled with the spilled oil from the down-dip Raudhatain and Sabriyah fields through a structural saddle. Two major tectonic events subsided the deposited sediments by 0.25 mm/year, besides three minor events; however, these events did not affect all Cretaceous reservoirs but only according to their deposition times. Furthermore, according to burial history, thermal maturity, and reservoirs’ fluid geochemical analysis, the Sulaiy (Makhoul) and Minagish formations are likely the primary sources for all Cretaceous reservoirs.</jats:p>",

Under a compressive strain of −0.15%, the output current of the ZnO/ZnS core/shell NWs increases by 91.1% compared to that under the no-strain condition, whereas that of the ZnO NWs under the same condition is 42.7%. The significant increase in the output current of the ZnO/ZnS core/shell NWs is attributed to the type-II band alignment and strain-induced piezopotential changes at the junction interface, which induce a reduction in the barrier height to enable efficient charge carrier transport. Furthermore, under UV illumination and a compressive strain of −0.15%, although the photocurrent of the ZnO/ZnS core/shell NWs increases by 4.5 times compared to that of the ZnO NWs, the relative increase in the photocurrent of the ZnO/ZnS core/shell NWs is 11.7% compared to that under the no-strain condition, while the photocurrent of the ZnO NWs increases by 32.3% under the same condition. A decrease in the increase rate in the photocurrent of the ZnO/ZnS core/shell NWs with a change in strain under UV light compared to that under the dark condition can be explained by the piezoelectric screening effect induced by photogenerated carriers. By calculating the change in the Schottky barrier height (SBH), we demonstrate that the piezoelectric potential with a change in strain decreased the SBH, thus increasing the current level. Lastly, we propose a mechanism of the piezotronic and piezo-phototronic effects under applied strain and their effects on energy-band diagrams.</jats:p>"

Under the strong selected pressure generated by the human body over thousands of years, HIV has evolved strategies to counteract and deceive the innate immune system into completing its lifecycle. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that HIV capsid core which is thought to be a protector of the cone structure of genomic RNA, also plays an essential role in escaping innate immunity surveillance. This mini-review summarizes the function of capsid in viral immune evasion, and the comprehensive elucidation of capsid-host cell innate immunity interaction could promote our understanding of HIV-1’s pathogenic mechanism and provide insights for HIV-1 treatment in clinical therapy.</jats:p>"

Here, we analyze a high‐resolution ice core from southeastern Greenland, comparing the seasonal deposition flux of large sulfate salt particles and small sulfur compounds, including non‐neutralized sulfuric acid, between the anthropogenic sulfate maximum (1973–1975) and after sulfur emissions control (2010–2012). Between these periods, we find that the large‐diameter (&gt;0.4 μm) flux remains roughly unchanged, yet the small‐diameter (&lt;0.4 μm) aerosol flux significantly decreases. The results indicate that small sulfates were efficiently activated as cloud condensation nuclei during the 1970s, and thus likely increased cloud albedo, offsetting the warming.</jats:p>",

(2) Objective: To analyze the equity of the distribution of parkland in the core area of Beijing from a quantitative and spatial perspective. By measuring both vehicular and pedestrian transport modes, the study identifies areas with low levels of green space provision and provides strategies for optimization. It is hoped that this study can provide a basis for future green space construction in the core area of Beijing. (3) Methods: In this paper, the Gauss Two-step Floating Catchment Area Method (Ga2SFCA) is used to study the green park space layout in the core area of Beijing. The two modes of 30min-walk and 10min-car-journey were used to measure the fair values of the residential unit scale, the street district scale, and the overall scale, respectively. (4) Results: The study results show that the fair values based on the 30-min walk and the 10-min car journey differ significantly. For the 30-min walk-based travel mode, the proportion of fair (Class IV) and fairer (Class V) areas is approximately 20%, while for the 10 min car-based travel mode, the corresponding class is over 90%. (5) Conclusions: The overall equity of urban parkland in Beijing core area is better for car-based travel modes, while for walking modes, the supply is still insufficient, and the distribution of parkland is polarized.</jats:p>"

We also screened the references of the included studies as a supplementary search. We extracted basic information from the articles and the outcomes. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted the data, extracted the outcomes, and grouped them into domains. Then, semi-structured interviews based on the potential factors collected by the systematic review were conducted at West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University. Pregnant women who met the diagnostic criteria for PROM were enrolled. Participants reported their concerns about the outcomes. Two researchers identified the pregnant women’s concerns.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A total of 90 studies were enrolled in this systematic review.

The classification and order of the core outcome domains of PPROM and TPROM were consistent. The physiological domain was the most common for PPROM and TPROM outcomes. Furthermore, 35.1 and 57.1% outcomes were only reported once in PPROM and TPROM studies, respectively. Thirty pregnant women participated in the semi-structured interviews; 10 outcomes were extracted after normalized, and the outcomes were reported in the systematic review.

The FG porous nanocomposite core and the actuator piezoelectric layer are exposed to steady magnetic and electric fields, respectively. The electric potential between two piezoelectric layers is governed by a proportional-derivative controller. The Halpin–Tsai micromechanics model and the Kelvin–Voigt model are adopted to express the effective elastic modulus of the FG porous nanocomposite core and material viscoelasticity of the core and piezoelectric layers, respectively. The governing equations of smart FG porous nanocomposite plates under thermal environment are derived grounded on the refined third-order shear deformation theory. Upon the validated theoretical model, the wave velocities and frequencies in plates are obtained by solving governing equations analytically. Finally, the effects of material viscoelasticity, porosity distribution and coefficient, GPL distribution and weight fraction, the plate and GPL geometries and external environment on wave propagation characteristics are demonstrated comprehensively. This work provides guidance on tunable control of wave propagation in smart sandwich plates affected by complex external environments. </jats:p>",

These ccECPs are given as a sum of spin-orbit averaged relativistic effective potential (AREP) and effective spin–orbit (SO) terms. The construction involves several steps with increasing refinements from more simple to fully correlated methods. The optimizations are carried out with objective functions that include weighted many-body atomic spectra, norm-conservation criteria, and SO splittings. Transferability tests involve molecular binding curves of corresponding hydride and oxide dimers. The constructed ccECPs are systematically better and in a few cases on par with previous effective core potential (ECP) tables on all tested criteria and provide a significant increase in accuracy for valence-only calculations with these elements. Our study confirms the importance of the AREP part in determining the overall quality of the ECP even in the presence of sizable spin–orbit effects. The subsequent quantum Monte Carlo calculations point out the importance of accurate trial wave functions that, in some cases (mid-series transition elements), require treatment well beyond a single-reference.</jats:p>",

First, data were collected from the web with keywords ‘university’ + ‘core competency’, and analysis was conducted using UCINET, a network analysis program. For the collected data, 100 key keywords were selected based on the frequency of extracted words through the first and second refining processes, and a 1-mode matrix was created and then network analysis and Concor analysis was performed.\r\nResults  as a Results First, as a result of frequency analysis, keywords such as ‘core competency’, ‘university’, ‘research’, ‘student’, and ‘education’ showed a high frequency of appearance. Second, as a result of centrality analysis, the keywords for which centrality increased rapidly were ‘scholarship application’, ‘program’, and ‘reinforcement’. Third, as a result of Concor analysis, 4 clusters were formed, and 2 large and small clusters were formed each.\r\nConclusions  The core competency-based university education revealed in the big data network is leading to social discourse in terms of the development and role of the university, the diagnosis and evaluation of the university, the scholarship system, and change and response. It has meaning in providing directions and implications for growth and development.</jats:p>",

Because of the universal distribution and ability to form GLVs, they have been anticipated to play a common role in vascular plants. While resting levels in intact plant tissues are low, GLVs are immediately synthesized de novo in response to stresses, such as insect herbivory, that disrupt the cell structure. This rapid GLV burst is one of the fastest responses of plants to cell-damaging stresses; therefore, GLVs are the first plant-derived compounds encountered by organisms that interact with plants irrespective of whether the interaction is competitive or friendly. GLVs should therefore be considered important mediators between plants and organisms that interact with them. GLVs can have direct effects by deterring herbivores and pathogens as well as indirect effects by attracting predators of herbivores, while other plants can recruit them to prepare their defenses in a process called priming. While the beneficial effects provided to plants by GLVs are often less dramatic and even complementary, the buildup of these tiny effects due to the multiple functions of GLVs can amass to levels that become substantially beneficial to plants. This review summarizes the current understanding of the spatiotemporal resolution of GLV biosynthesis and GLV functions and outlines how GLVs support the basic health of plants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to neuroinflammation and contribute to many neurological disorders, including autoimmune diseases. Cell culture models are powerful tools for studying specific molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to these disease states and identifying potential therapeutics. However, most cell culture models have limitations in capturing biologically relevant phenomena, due in part to the non-inclusion of necessary cell types. Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (critical cell types that play a role in neuroinflammation) all express at least a subset of TLRs. However, the response of each of these cell types to various TLR activation, along with their relative contribution to neuroinflammatory processes, is far from clear. In this study, we demonstrate the screening capabilities of a primary cortical cell tri-culture of neuron, astrocyte, and microglia from neonatal rats. Specifically, we compare the neuroinflammatory response of tri-cultures to that of primary neuron-astrocyte co-cultures to a suite of known TLR agonists. We demonstrate that microglia are required for observation of neurotoxic neuroinflammatory responses, such as increased cell death and apoptosis, in response to TLR2, 3, 4, and 7/8 activation. Additionally, we show that following TLR3 agonist treatment, microglia and astrocytes play opposing roles in the neuroinflammatory response, and that the observed response is dictated by the degree of TLR3 activation. Overall, we demonstrate that microglia play a significant role in the neuroinflammatory response to TLR activation in vitro and, hence, the tri-culture has the potential to serve as a screening platform that better replicates the in vivo responses.</jats:p>"

The assessment of students’ learning status can greatly promote students’ learning quality and values. However, the current evaluation of students’ learning status still has the score-oriented problem, and lacks enough attention to students’ interests, skills, potential, thinking, values, and other aspects, which is worrying. The function of Chinese evaluation has been narrowed to evaluate students’ knowledge and skills, and it has been euphemistically called the focus of classroom teaching. In Chinese class, the role of students’ learning status assessment has received a lot of attention, and it should play more roles in promoting students’ deep learning, so as to improve the thinking quality of learning and find appropriate learning methods. Deep learning requires students to have strong autonomous learning ability and problem-solving ability, etc. Students will benefit from developing these good habits in their future work and life.</jats:p>",

The rich dynamics originating from the ferroelectric polarization dynamics and polarization-charge coupling are the keys leading to the essential properties for reservoir computing: the short-term memory and high-dimensional nonlinear transform function. We demonstrate that an FeFET-based reservoir computing system can successfully solve computational tasks on time-series data processing including nonlinear time series prediction after training with simple regression. Due to the FeFET’s high feasibility of implementation on the silicon platform, the systems have flexibility in both device- and circuit-level designs, and have a high potential for on-chip integration with existing computing technologies towards the realization of advanced intelligent systems.</jats:p>"

Objective: To evaluate the effect of one session of high and low volume core stabilization training protocols on endogenous pain modulation in women with CNLBP. Methods: This is an evaluator-blinded randomized crossover trial. Eighteen volunteers participated of the study, whom performed two core stabilization training sessions: high and low training volume. The variables evaluated were the pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and temporal summation (TS) by digital pressure algometer, in addition to the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) using a pressure algometer and ischemic compression with sphygmomanometer as conditioned stimulus. A 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA was performed to compare training and time, Bonferroni's post hoc test for pairwise comparison from interactions (time and training). Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and the significance level established in 5%. Results: When comparing pre and post intragroup, low volume core stabilization training showed significant increase at the PPT in L5 (p &lt; 0.05) and tibialis anterior (p &lt; 0.01). High volume training not showed a significant increase in none of the PPT measures. However, none of the investigated protocols changed TS and CPM in women with CNLBP. Conclusion: Low volume core stabilization training produces local analgesia and remote hypoalgesia, demonstrated by increased PPT in L5 and tibialis anterior. However, none of the investigated protocols were effective to reduce the central sensitization assessed by CPM and TS.</jats:p>"

In this study, we were interested in evaluating the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3, either alone or in combination with two forms of HCV core protein (C173 and C191) in HepG2 cells. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Transcripts’ levels of key genes known to be regulated in HCC, such as p53, DNMT1, miRNA152, TGF-b, and BCL-2, were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression levels of caspase-3 and MKI67 were determined by immunocytochemistry and apoptosis assays. The co-expression of lncRNA MEG3 and C191 resulted in a marked increase and accumulation of dead cells and a reduction in cell viability. In addition, a marked increase in the expression of tumor suppressor genes (p53 and miRNA152), as well as a marked decrease in the expression of oncogenes (DNMT1, BCL2, and TGF-b), were detected. Moreover, apoptosis assay results revealed a significant increase in total apoptosis (early and late). Finally, immunocytochemistry results detected a significant increase in apoptotic marker caspase-3 and a decrease in tumor marker MKI67. In this study, transgene expression of C191 and lncRNA MEG3 showed induction in apoptosis in HepG2 cells greater than the expression of each one alone.

The mode purity is in excess of 91%, and the confinement loss is less than 10−7 dB/m over the 0.2 THz to 0.55 THz band.

The presented concept allows for the preparation of thermoplastic-based composites with enhanced mechanical properties. The sample preparation process consists of 3D printing the sandwich’s core structure using the FDM method. For comparison purposes, we used two types of GPET (copolymer of polyethylene terephthalate)-based filaments, pure resin, and carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced filaments. The outer reinforcing layer “skins” of the sandwich structure were prepared from the compression molded prepregs made from the LCP (liquid-crystal polymer)-fiber fabric with the GPET-based matrix. The final product consisting of an FDM-printed core and LCP-based prepreg was prepared using the compression molding method. The prepared samples were subjected to detailed materials analyses, including thermal analyses (thermogravimetry-TGA, differencial scanning calorimetry-DSC, and dynamic thermal-mechanical analysis-DMTA) and mechanical tests (tensile, flexural, and impact). As indicated by the static test results, the modulus and strength of the prepared composites were slightly improved; however, the stiffness of the prepared materials was more related to the presence of the CF-reinforced filament than the presence of the composite prepreg. The main advantage of using the developed method is revealed during impact tests. Due to the presence of long LCP fibers, the prepared sandwich samples are characterized by very high impact resistance. The impact strength increased from 1.7 kJ/m2 for pure GPET samples to 50.4 kJ/m2 for sandwich composites. For GPET/CF samples, the increase is even greater. The advantages of the developed solution were illustrated during puncture tests in which none of the sandwich samples were pierced.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green innovation is an important way for enterprises to achieve high-quality economic development, and it is also the way to achieve the goal of double carbon. Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation. The results of this research are intended to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for Chinese intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises to better achieve green core technology innovation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>A number of metamorphic core complexes (MCCs) developed in the North China Craton and adjacent regions in the Early Cretaceous and were characterized by consistent extensional orientations. These MCCs formed in the continental interior and were conceptually attributed to the retreat of the Palaeo-Pacific (Izanagi) Plate, but the exact physical mechanism remains enigmatic. Here we utilize 2-D thermomechanical simulations to study how mechanical conditions of the continental crust respond to stresses derived from oceanic subduction and their roles in the formation of MCCs. Our results demonstrate that pre-existing weaknesses are key for localized formation within the continental interior. These weaknesses first undergo compression to form thrust faults in response to shallow subduction of the oceanic slab. These thrust faults gradually transform into extensional ones as the oceanic slab starts to retreat, eventually causing the synchronous exhumation of middle-to-lower crustal rocks that form the MCCs. The P-T paths of metamorphic rocks in the core of MCCs reveal a two-stage exhumation, with isothermal decompression followed by rapid isobaric cooling. Sensitivity tests show that (1) stronger upper crust and weaker lower crust favour MCC formation, while lithospheric strength could exert an influence on the formation time of MCCs and (2) when the continental crust is hot (TMoho = 800 °C), a new magmatic dome could form along the continental margin. We suggest that pre-existing weaknesses in the North China Craton played a key role in generating the quasi-simultaneous MCC series in response to the retreating Palaeo-Pacific Plate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rational use of medicine (RUM) for all medical conditions is crucial in attaining quality of healthcare and medical care for patients and the community as a whole. However, the actual medicine use pattern is not consistent with that of the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline and is often irrational in many healthcare setting, particularly in developing countries. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate rational medicine use based on WHO/International Network of Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) core drug use indicators in Eritrean National and Regional Referral hospitals. A descriptive and cross-sectional approach was used to conduct the study. A sample of 4800 (600 from each hospital) outpatient prescriptions from all disciplines were systematically reviewed to assess the prescribing indicators. A total of 1600 (200 from each hospital) randomly selected patients were observed for patient indicators and all pharmacy personnel were interviewed to obtain the required information for facility-specific indicators. Data were collected using retrospective and prospective structured observational checklist between September and January, 2018. Descriptive statistics, Welch’s robust test of means and Duncan’s post hoc test were performed using IBM SPSS (version 22). The average number of medicines per prescription was 1.78 (SD = 0.79). Prescriptions that contained antibiotic and injectable were 54.50% and 6.60%, respectively. Besides, the percentage of medicines prescribed by generic name and from an essential medicine list (EML) was 98.86% and 94.73%, respectively. The overall average consultation and dispensing time were 5.46 minutes (SD = 3.86) and 36.49 seconds (SD = 46.83), respectively. Moreover, 87.32% of the prescribed medicines were actually dispensed. Only 68.24% of prescriptions were adequately labelled and 78.85% patients knew about the dosage of the medicine(s) in their prescriptions. More than half (66.7%) of the key medicines were available in stock. All the hospitals used the national medicine list but none of them had their own medicine list or guideline. In conclusion, majority of WHO stated core drug use indicators were not fulfilled by the eight hospitals. The results of this study suggest that a mix of policies needs to be implemented to make medicines more accessible and used in a more rational way.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) surpasses other BC subtypes as the most challenging to treat due to its lack of traditional BC biomarkers. Nearly 30% of TNBC patients express the androgen receptor (AR), and the blockade of androgen production and AR signaling have been the cornerstones of therapies for AR-positive TNBC. However, the majority of women are resistant to AR-targeted therapy, which is a major impediment to improving outcomes for the AR-positive TNBC subpopulation. The hypoxia signaling cascade is frequently activated in the tumor microenvironment in response to low oxygen levels; activation of the hypoxia signaling cascade allows tumors to survive despite hypoxia-mediated interference with cellular metabolism. The activation of hypoxia signaling networks in TNBC promotes resistance to most anticancer drugs including AR inhibitors. The activation of hypoxia network signaling occurs more frequently in TNBC compared to other BC subtypes. Herein, we examine the (1) interplay between hypoxia signaling networks and AR and (2) whether hypoxia and hypoxic stress adaptive pathways promote the emergence of resistance to therapies that target AR. We also pose the well-supported question, “Can the efficacy of androgen-/AR-targeted treatments be enhanced by co-targeting hypoxia?” By critically examining the evidence and the complex entwinement of these two oncogenic pathways, we argue that the simultaneous targeting of androgen biosynthesis/AR signaling and hypoxia may enhance the sensitivity of AR-positive TNBCs to AR-targeted treatments, derail the emergence of therapy resistance, and improve patient outcomes.</jats:p>"

In this study, we characterize the interaction between the precessing vortex core (PVC), which is the consequence of a global hydrodynamic instability, and thermoacoustic instabilities, which are the result of a coupling between combustor acoustics and the unsteady heat release rate. This study is performed using experimental data obtained from a model gas turbine combustor employing two concentric swirling nozzles of air, separated by a ring of fuel injectors, operating at five bar pressure. The flow split between the two streams is systematically varied to observe the impact of flow structure variation on the system dynamics at both non-reacting and reacting conditions. High-speed stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, OH planar laser-induced fluorescence and acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence are used to obtain information about the velocity fields, flame and fuel flow behaviour, respectively. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition and a complex network analysis are used to identify and characterize the dominant oscillation mechanisms driving the system. In the non-reacting data, a PVC is present in most cases and the amplitude of the oscillation increases with increasing flow through the centre nozzle. In the reacting data, three dominant modes are seen: two thermoacoustic modes and the PVC. Our results show that in the cases where the frequency of the PVC overlaps with either of the thermoacoustic modes, the thermoacoustic modes are suppressed. The complex network analysis coupled with a weakly nonlinear theoretical analysis suggests the mechanisms by which this coupling and suppression of the thermoacoustic mode occur.</jats:p>",

Specifically, p53 facilitated the binding of E6AP to HCV Core through direct interactions with the two proteins.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background, Leucoptera coffeella (Guerin-Meneville, 1842) is a moth species (Lyonetiidae, Lepidoptera) pest that causes severe losses to coffee crops. Further information about its genomic data is required to allow molecular strategies for the development of sustainable pesticides and to gain in-depth knowledge on phylogenetics. However, the closest complete genome available is within the superfamily level (Yponomeutoidea). Here we report the generation of the first long-read genome, transcriptome and proteome results of L. coffeella and the in silico analysis performed in these molecular levels to investigate genes involved in the siRNA processing. Results, PACBio and paired-end Illumina combined DNA sequencing from pupae samples resulted in more than 436 Gb subreads and 31Mb reads with N50 read length of 15,512 nt, mean read length 13.8 Kb and max read length 420.7 Kb. Additionally, 20Gb data of short DNA sequencing was combined to produce 1,984 contigs comprising 397 Mb in total. The longest and shortest scaffold sizes are 10,809,567 nt and 15,247 nt, respectively (mean size 200,178 nt). The N50 scaffold was 275,598 nt and the GC content was 36.10%. Predicted coding DNA sequences counted 39.930 gene models. Searching of 5286 BUSCO groups revealed 91.7 percent of completeness (single and duplicated genes combined) compared to lepidoptera genomes (lepidoptera_odb10). Flow cytometry showed the 1C DNA content is approximately 295 Mb. RNA-Seq from seven development stages resulted in 28294 identified transcripts. Additionally, proteomics from immature stages resulted in 2045 proteins matching the gene models. Conclusions, This first nuclear genome of the Lyonetiidae family brings valuable molecular resources to study Lepidoptera genomes. Genome, transcriptome and proteome sequencing to raise genome annotation precision may resolve uncovered taxonomic issues. In addition, these combined approaches provide insights into plant-insect interaction players, as horizontally transferred genes (HGT) and endosymbionts. Put together, the generated data enables the development of molecular tools towards sustainable biotechnology solutions for lepidopteran pest control.</jats:p>"

However, our recent study suggested that the premaxilla, the rostralmost upper jaw bone, was rearranged during the evolution of therian mammals, being replaced by the septomaxilla at least in the lateral part. In the present study, to understand more about the process of evolution from the ancestral upper jaw to the therian face, we re‐examined the development of the therian premaxilla (incisive bone). By comparing mouse, bat, goat, and cattle fetuses, we confirmed that the therian premaxilla has dual developmental origins, the lateral body and the palatine process. This dual development is widely conserved among the therian mammals. Cell‐lineage‐tracing experiments using<jats:italic>Dlx1</jats:italic>‐CreER<jats:sup>T2</jats:sup>mice revealed that the palatine process arises in the ventral part of the premandibular domain, where the nasopalatine nerve distributes, whereas the lateral body develops from the maxillary prominence in the domain of the maxillary nerve. Through comparative analysis using various tetrapods, we concluded that the palatine process should not be considered part of the ancestral premaxilla. It rather corresponds to the anterior region of the vomerine bone of nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, the present findings indicate that the true premaxilla was completely lost during the evolution of the therian mammals, resulting in the establishment of the unique therian face as an evolutionary novelty. Reconsideration of the homological framework of the cranial skeleton based on the topographical relationships of the ossification center during embryonic development is warranted.</jats:p>",

Broadening of both transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) modes of the bulk Si1−xGex alloy was directly observed using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) with increasing momentum (from Γ to X points in the Brillouin zone), which cannot be observed in pure Si or pure Ge. The IXS spectral linewidth of the TA mode indicated Ge dependence, which suggests the overlapping of a low-energy local vibration mode (LVM) caused by Ge clusters surrounded by Si atoms around the X point. Although the behavior of the IXS spectral linewidth of the LA mode showed almost no dependence on Ge fraction, the IXS spectra of the LA mode indicated broadening after crossing with a low-energy LVM with increasing momentum. The results obtained by molecular dynamics showed almost the same behavior of the acoustic phonon spectral linewidth. These results suggest that a change in the acoustic phonon spectral linewidth between the Γ and X points indicates a reduction in the acoustic phonon lifetime caused by the appearance of a localized mode originated from a random atom position in the alloy structure, leading to suppression of the thermal transport in the SiGe alloy.</jats:p>",

Almost all extracellular glutamate is retrieved by the glial transporter, Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), belonging to the SLC1A family. However, in some cancers, EAAT2 expression is enhanced and causes resistance to therapies by metabolic disturbance. Despite its crucial roles, the detailed structural information about EAAT2 has not been available. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of human EAAT2 in substrate-free and selective inhibitor WAY213613-bound states at 3.2 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively. EAAT2 forms a trimer, with each protomer consisting of transport and scaffold domains. Along with a glutamate-binding site, the transport domain possesses a cavity that could be disrupted during the transport cycle. WAY213613 occupies both the glutamate-binding site and cavity of EAAT2 to interfere with its alternating access, where the sensitivity is defined by the inner environment of the cavity. We provide the characterization of the molecular features of EAAT2 and its selective inhibition mechanism that may facilitate structure-based drug design for EAAT2.</jats:p>"

In this work, a facile and effective route to simultaneously toughen and reinforce polylactide (PLA) by regulating the distribution of core–shell rubber (CSR) nanoparticles with carbon black (CB) is reported. The PLA/CSR/CB nanocomposites are prepared via direct melt‐blending PLA, CSR, and CB nanoparticles with different self‐aggregate capabilities. The FTIR and DFT calculation results reveal that the interactions between CB and CSR are stronger than those between CB and PLA. Thus, CB nanoparticles with high self‐aggregate capability (HCB) can drive CSR nanoparticles to join into the HCB network structures and form CSR‐HCB network structures in the PLA/CSR/HCB nanocomposites. However, for the CB nanoparticles with low self‐aggregate capability (LCB), uniform dispersion of both CSR nanoparticles and small‐sized CB clusters in the PLA/CSR/LCB nanocomposites is observed. Compared to the network structures, the uniform dispersion structure can endow PLA/CSR/CB nanocomposites with much better stiffness–toughness balance performances. Additionally, the distribution of CSR nanoparticles on the rheological properties of PLA/CSR/CB nanocomposites are studied. This work reveals significant correlations between distribution of CSR nanoparticles and properties of PLA nanocomposites, which is helpful to prepare high‐performance PLA materials.</jats:p>",

The association of cold fronts with two highly aged (∼260 Myr) USS sources in a cool-core cluster makes it a very rare system. These USS sources are probably radio lobes from a previous episode of jet activity in the BCG, driven buoyantly towards the outskirts of the X-ray halo, thereby creating the cold fronts. A deeper radio image of this cluster may provide a rare opportunity to verify the recently proposed alternative model which explains radio mini-haloes as the aggregate radio emission from Type Ia supernova remnant occurring in the giant stellar halo extended across the cluster core.</jats:p>",

However, it is usually synthesized by template methods which are complex and environmentally unfriendly and would lead to low‐efficiency charge and mass exchange because of the single‐point van der Waals contact between the Si core and the shell. Here, a facile and benign one‐step method to synthesize multi‐Si‐void@SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> structure, where abundant void spaces exist between multiple Si cores that are multi‐point attached to a SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> shell through strong chemical bonding, is reported. The corresponding electrode exhibits highly stable cycling stability and excellent electrochemical performance. After 200 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and then another 200 cycles at 1.2 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, the electrode outputs a specific capacity of 1440 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Even at 2.0 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, it outputs a specific capacity as high as 1182 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Such an anode can match almost all the cathode materials presently used in lithium‐ion batteries. These results demonstrate the multi‐Si‐void@SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as a promising anode to be used in future commercial lithium‐ion batteries of high energy density and high power density.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a task model and processor model based on line tree(LT) for sporadic real-time periodic tasks are designed, and a transformation algorithm from task line tree(TLT) model to processor line tree(PLT) model is proposed. The algorithm takes the least common multiple of all real-time periodic tasks as the benchmark of layer number, and based on the complete job replacement rule, the minimum common multiple of all real-time periodic tasks is used as the reference of layer number. In order to achieve the optimal multiprocessor scheduling result, the method of replacing the empty node of non-migrating job with the node of migrating job and the condition of allowing job to publish tasks ahead of time with variable cycle are used. Experimental results show that comparing with PEDF, GEDF and RMFF, the present method not only has higher core utilization and lower time loss rate, but also reduces the number of context switching and migration.</jats:p>",

In this paper, Fe is encapsulated within ZSM‐5 via the seed‐directed growth technique and characterized with a suite of analytical techniques including Mössbauer spectroscopy and X‐ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Characterization of the core‐shell catalysts indicates that some of the Fe‐based active phase is destabilized during seed‐directed growth, demonstrating the challenges associated with encapsulating an Fe‐based active phase within zeolites.

Based on spectral analyses, fluctuations with a period of 15–90 days were extracted as the ISO component. First, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed for the ISO components of the zonal mean temperature from the MLS in the region of 10°S–10°N, 68–85 km, where the ISO amplitudes are found to be maximized. The global structure of the ISO anomalies of temperature and zonal winds estimated assuming a gradient wind balance was examined by a regression analysis using the first and second principal EOFs. It is shown that the ISO phases propagate downward with a vertical wavelength of 25–30 km above a height of 60 km and that the ISO signal synchronized with the equatorial ISO is observed even in the middle and high latitude regions of both hemispheres. Second, the global analysis data were used to examine the driving mechanism of the ISO. It was confirmed that the time series of the equatorial ISO zonal mean zonal wind in the analysis agreed well with radar observations, which were not used for assimilation. Results suggest small‐scale phenomena, such as gravity waves not necessarily represented in the parameterization and the meridional advection of angular momentum, mainly contribute to drive the ISO.</jats:p>",

The biosynthesized Au@AgNPs were characterized using UV–Vis spectrophotometer, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Zeta potential, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier Transformation Infrared (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the detection of antibacterial activity was assessed through disc diffusion, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), time-killing curve, and detection of cell membrane integrity via SEM. As a result, the UV–Vis spectrum revealed the formation of Au@AgNPs in a single peak between 533 and 555 nm. Furthermore, FTIR analysis confirmed nanoparticles’ green synthesis due to the presence of carbon functional groups. The formulated Au@AgNPs showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC and the MBC of <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S. sciuri</jats:italic> were 31.25 µg/mL. However, nanoparticles were more effective on <jats:italic>S. enterica</jats:italic> with MIC of 7.5 µg/mL and MBC of 15.6 µg/mL. Furthermore, the time-killing curve of the three model bacteria with the treatment was effective at 50 µg/mL. Besides, SEM of the tested bacteria indicated unintegrated bacterial cell membranes and damage caused by Au@AgNPs. Regarding the anticancer activity, the results indicated that the biosynthesized Au@AgNPs have a cytotoxic effect on HEPG2 cell lines. In conclusion, this research revealed that the green synthesized Au@AgNPs could be effective antibacterial agents against <jats:italic>S. sciuri</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>S. enterica</jats:italic> and anticancer agents against HEPG2.</jats:p>"

The objective of the Core Research Outcomes for Sedentary Behaviour Interventions (CROSBI) consensus study was to identify and validate, a core outcome set (COS) to report (what, how, when to measure) in interventional sedentary behaviour studies. Outcomes, extracted from a systematic literature review, were categorized into domains and data items (COS v0.0). International experts (n = 5) provided feedback and identified additional items, which were incorporated into COS v0.1. A two round online Delphi survey was conducted to seek consensus from a wider stakeholder group and outcomes that achieved consensus in the second round COS (v0.2), were ratified by the expert panel. The final COS (v1.0) contains 53 data items across 12 domains, relating to demographics, device details, wear-time criteria, wear-time measures, posture-related measures, sedentary breaks, sedentary bouts and physical activity. Notably, results indicate that sedentary behaviour outcomes should be measured by devices that include an inclinometry or postural function. The proposed standardised COS is available openly to enhance the accumulation of pooled evidence in future sedentary behaviour intervention research and practice.</jats:p>"

However, information about hydraulic fracture networks in post-fractured formations is seldom available. In this study, the characteristics (density and orientation) of hydraulic fractures were obtained from field observations of cores taken from conglomerate hydraulic fracturing test site (CHFTS). A large number of fractures were observed in the cores, and systematic fracture description was carried out. The fracture analysis data obtained includes fracture density, fracture depth, fracture orientation, morphology, fracture surface features, apertures, fill, fracture mechanical origin (type), etc. Our results show that 228 hydraulic fractures were intersected in a span of 293.71 m of slant core and composed of irregularly spaced single fractures and fracture swarms. One of the potential sources of the observed fracture swarms is near-wellbore tortuosity. Moreover, for regions far away from the wellbore, reservoir heterogeneity can promote complex hydraulic fracture trajectories. The hydraulic fractures were mainly cross-gravel and high-angle fractures and align with maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) ± 15°. The fracture density, orientations, and types obtained from the core fracture description provided valuable information regarding fracture growth behavior. For the near-wellbore area with a transverse distance of less than 25 m from the hydraulically-fractured wellbore, tensile fractures were dominant. While for the area far away from the wellbore, shear fractures were dominant. Our results provide improved understanding of the spatial hydraulic fracture dimensions, proppant distribution, and mechanism of hydraulic fracture formation. The dataset acquired can also be used to calibrate numerical models and characterize hydraulic fracture geometry and proppant distribution.</jats:p>"

The variable parameters were the core thickness (30, 50, 60 and 100 mm), core category (polyurethane [PU], extruded polystyrene [XPS], rock-mineral wool [RW]), and hybrid core (PU+RW and XPS+RW). Finally, the shear distribution coefficient of core material for sandwich panels with BFRP facesheets was modified depending on the experimental data. The experimental results showed that an increase in the PU core thickness significantly increased the flexural strength and rigidity of the sandwich panels. For different core materials, the maximum loads of the panels were positive with the shear strength of the core materials. Whereas, XPS+RW hybrid core not only can significantly decreases the costs, but also exhibits the highest bearing capacity and stiffness as compared with the PU+RW hybrid and PU cores. </jats:p>",

The results showed that the fermentation process of sufu could be divided into early and late stages. The early stage was critical for flavor development. Seven microbiota were screened based on their abundance, microbial relevance, and flavor production capacity. Five microbes were screened in the early stage: Pseudomonas, Tetragenococcus, Lysinibacillus, Pantoea, and Burkholderia–Caballeronia–Paraburkholderia. Three microbes were screened in the late stage: Exiguobacterium, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. Their metabolic profiles were predicted. The results provided a reference for the selection of enriched bacterial genera in the fermentation process and controlling applicable process conditions to improve the flavor of sufu.</jats:p>"

The PMEI criterion takes full advantage of the strong global search ability of the EI criterion and the local search ability of the IEI criterion to improve the overall accuracy of the fitting function. In the paper, the detailed steps of the PMEI method are introduced firstly, which can add multiple sample points in a single iteration. At the same time, in the process of constructing the surrogate model, it is effective to avoid the problem of the low fitting accuracy caused by adding only one new sample point in each iteration of the EI and IEI criteria. The numerical examples of the classical one-dimensional function and two-dimensional function clearly demonstrate the accuracy of the fitting function of the proposed method. Moreover, the accuracy of the multi-objective optimization surrogate model of a truck cab constructed by the PMEI method is tested, which proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving high-dimensional modeling problems. All these results confirm that the Kriging model developed by the PMEI method has high accuracy for low-dimensional problems or high-dimensional complex problems.</jats:p>"

Whether these structures accommodated diapiric upwelling or regional extension via low‐angle normal faulting is debated. The Ruby Mountains‐East Humboldt Range MCC, northeast Nevada, records top‐west normal‐sense exhumation of deformed Proterozoic‐Paleozoic stratigraphy and older basement. We conducted 1:24,000‐scale mapping of the southwestern East Humboldt Range, with integrated structural, geochemical, and geochronological analyses to characterize the geometry and kinematics of extension and exhumation of the mylonitized footwall. Bedrock stratigraphy is pervasively intruded by Cretaceous, Eocene, and Oligocene intrusions, but observations of a coherent stratigraphic section show &gt;80% vertical attenuation of Neoproterozoic to Ordovician rocks. These rocks are penetratively sheared with top‐west kinematics. The shear zone thus experienced combined pure‐ and simple‐shear (i.e., general shear) strain. We argue that this shear zone was syn‐/post‐kinematic with respect to Oligocene plutonism because: (a) mylonitic shearing spatially corresponds with preceding Oligocene intrusions; (b) thermochronology reveals that the shear zone experienced substantial cooling and exhumation after Oligocene plutonism; and (c) the mylonites are crosscut by undated, but likely late Oligocene, leucogranite. We propose that Eocene mantle‐derived magmatism and thermal incubation led to Oligocene diapiric upwelling of the middle crust, with ductile stretching focused on the flanks of this upwarp. Regional Basin and Range extension initiated later in the middle Miocene. Therefore, the development of the East Humboldt Range shear zone was not driven by regional extension and coupled detachment faulting.</jats:p>",

A 10‐year (2011–2020) WCR dataset that tracks weekly WCR locations and surface areas is used here to identify the rings' path and characterize their movement between 55 and 75°W. The WCR dataset reveals a very narrow band between 66 and 71°W along which rings travel almost due west along ∼39°N across isobaths – the “Ring Corridor.” Then, west of the corridor, the mean path turns southwestward, paralleling the shelfbreak. The average ring translation speed along the mean path is 5.9 cm s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Long‐lived rings (lifespan &gt;150 days) tend to occupy the region west of the New England Seamount Chain (NESC) whereas short‐lived rings (lifespan &lt;150 days) tend to be more broadly distributed. WCR vertical structures, analyzed using available Argo float profiles indicate that rings that are formed to the west of the NESC have shallower thermoclines than those formed to the east. This tendency may be due to different WCR formation processes that are observed to occur along different sections of the Gulf Stream. WCRs formed to the east of the NESC tend to form from a pinch‐off mechanism incorporating cores of Sargasso Sea water and a perimeter of Gulf Stream water. WCRs that form to the west of the NESC, form from a process called an aneurysm. WCRs formed through aneurysms comprise water mostly from the northern half of the Gulf Stream and are smaller than the classic pinch‐off rings.</jats:p>",

In this work, we have theoretically examined the effects of Rashba spin-orbit interaction on an electron in a cylindrical core/shell quantum dot (CCSQD). The modifications of various properties of cylindrical core/shell quantum dot such as transition energies, dipole transition matrix elements and linear and nonlinear optical properties due to change in Rashba coupling parameter, magnetic field and effective Rydberg energy were studied. We solved the Schrödinger equation using numerical methods and obtained energy eigenvalues as functions of the aforementioned parameters. It was observed that, the magnetic field has a considerable effect on absorption coefficients and refractive index. It was also observed that increasing the magnetic field shifts the resonances towards higher energies. Additionally, increasing in the Rashba coupling coefficient (<jats:italic>α</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>R</jats:italic></jats:sub>) was found out to result an increase in absorption coefficients and refractive index.

To conduct murine cerebral microdialysis research, validated, sensitive, and reliable liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were used to determine IWR-1-endo concentration in the murine plasma and brain microdialysate. IWR-1-endo and the internal standard (ISTD) dabrafenib were extracted from murine plasma and microdialysate samples by a simple solid-phase extraction protocol performed on an Oasis HLB µElution plate. Chromatographic separation was executed on a Kinetex C18 (100A, 50 × 2.1 mm, 4 µm particle size) column with a binary gradient of water and acetonitrile, each having 0.1% formic acid, pumped at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Detection by mass spectrometry was conducted in the positive selected reaction monitoring ion mode by monitoring mass transitions 410.40 &gt; 344.10 (IWR-1-endo) and 520.40 &gt; 307.20 (ISTD). The validated curve range of IWR-1-endo was 5–1000 ng/mL for the murine plasma method (r2 ≥ 0.99) and 0.5–500 ng/mL for the microdialysate method (r2 ≥ 0.99). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 5 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL for the murine plasma and microdialysate sample analysis method, respectively. Negligible matrix effects were observed in murine plasma and microdialysate samples. IWR-1-endo was extremely unstable in murine plasma. To improve the stability of IWR-1-endo, pH adjustments of 1.5 were introduced to murine plasma and microdialysate samples before sample storage and processing. With pH adjustment of 1.5 to the murine plasma and microdialysate samples, IWR-1-endo was stable across several tested conditions such as benchtop, autosampler, freeze–thaw, and long term at −80 °C. The LC-MS/MS methods were successfully applied to a murine pharmacokinetic and cerebral microdialysis study to characterize the unbound IWR-1-endo exposure in brain extracellular fluid and plasma.</jats:p>"

We study the impact of three different hadron-quark equations of state (EoS) with first-order (DD2F_SF, STOS-B145) and second-order (CMF) phase transitions on supernova dynamics by performing 97 simulations for solar- and zero-metallicity progenitors in the range of $14\\tt {-}100\\, \\text{M}_\\odot$. We find explosions only for two low-compactness models (14 and $16\\, \\text{M}_\\odot$) with the DD2F_SF EoS, both with low explosion energies of ${\\sim }10^{50}\\, \\mathrm{erg}$. These weak explosions are characterized by a neutrino signal with several minibursts in the explosion phase due to complex reverse shock dynamics, in addition to the typical second neutrino burst for phase-transition-driven explosions. The nucleosynthesis shows significant overproduction of nuclei such as 90Zr for the $14\\hbox{-} \\text{M}_\\odot$ zero-metallicity model and 94Zr for the $16\\hbox{-}\\text{M}_\\odot$ solar-metallicity model, but the overproduction factors are not large enough to place constraints on the occurrence of such explosions. Several other low-compactness models using the DD2F_SF EoS and two high-compactness models using the STOS EoS end up as failed explosions and emit a second neutrino burst. For the CMF EoS, the phase transition never leads to a second bounce and explosion. For all three EoS, inverted convection occurs deep in the core of the protocompact star due to anomalous behaviour of thermodynamic derivatives in the mixed phase, which heats the core to entropies up to 4kB/baryon and may have a distinctive gravitational-wave signature, also for a second-order phase transition.</jats:p>",

As fingerprints, we denote those core proteins of a certain lineage that are present only in that particular lineage and absent in any other Bacillus lineage. Thus, these lineage-specific fingerprints are expected to be involved in particular adaptations of that lineage. Intriguingly, with a few notable exceptions, the majority of the Bacillus species demonstrate a rather low number of species-specific fingerprints, with the majority of them being of unknown function. Therefore, species-specific adaptations are mostly attributed to highly unstable (in evolutionary terms) accessory proteomes and possibly to changes at the gene regulation level. A series of comparative analyses consistently demonstrated that the progenitor of the Cereus Clade underwent an extensive genomic expansion of chromosomal protein-coding genes. In addition, the majority (76–82%) of the B. subtilis proteins that are essential or play a significant role in sporulation have close homologs in most species of both the Subtilis and the Cereus Clades. Finally, the identification of lineage-specific fingerprints by this study may allow for the future development of highly specific vaccines, therapeutic molecules, or rapid and low-cost molecular tests for species identification.</jats:p>"

In this study, we analyze a generalized version of KP, which is termed the generalized multidimensional knapsack problem (GMDKP). As opposed to the basic KP, GMDKP allows multiple choices per item type under multiple weight constraints. Although several efficient algorithms are known and the properties of their solutions have been examined to a significant extent for basic KPs, there is a paucity of known algorithms and studies on the solution properties of GMDKP. To gain insight into the problem, we assess the typical achievable limit of the total profit for a random ensemble of GMDKP using the replica method. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) when the profits of item types are normally distributed, the total profit grows in the leading order with respect to the number of item types as the maximum number of choices per item type <jats:italic>x</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sup>max</jats:sup> increases while it depends on <jats:italic>x</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sup>max</jats:sup> only in a sub-leading order if the profits are constant among the item types. (2) A greedy-type heuristic can find a nearly optimal solution whose total profit is lower than the optimal value only by a sub-leading order with a low computational cost. (3) The sub-leading difference from the optimal total profit can be improved by a heuristic algorithm based on the cavity method. Extensive numerical experiments support these findings.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this work is to present a novel geometry of trapezoidal cores, and their configurations are inspired by the earlier works. These absorbers have been proposed to raise the specific energy absorption (SEA) while declining the initial peak crushing force. Therefore, five corrugated core sandwich panels have been tested under quasi-static axial compressive load experimentally and then simulated by ABAQUS software. The accuracy of the numerical simulations is validated by comparing the numerical results with the corresponding experimental data. Besides, some other simulations have been carried out to investigate the effect of foam density, core type, and thickness in more detail. The comparison results show that the SEA rate of bi-core sandwich panels which has not been filled by foam is better than the single trapezoidal core sandwich panels, and this rate is roughly around 70%. The best performance is relevant to the pure foam core without any trapezoidal core structure and the next item is the single foam-filled corrugated core and the lowest performance among them is related to the bi-core corrugated core foam-filled. </jats:p>",

The obtained GAM allows spatiotemporal release of pVEGF and pBMP2 and promotes osteogenic differentiation of preosteoblasts in vitro. In vivo evaluation using a critical‐sized segmental femoral defect model in rats shows that the dual gene delivery system can significantly accelerate bone healing by activating angiogenesis and osteogenesis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective. This paper hopes to lay a foundation for properly understanding the role of the Hakka terrace system in the future development of agricultural economy by evaluating and comparing the values of the farmland ecosystem in the core area of The Hakka terrace system in Chongyi, Jiangxi province, in the year 2013 and 2019. Methods. By sorting out the evolution of Chongyi Hakka terrace system, we can figure out the corresponding multidimensional values obtained in rural revitalization process, thus forming the value evaluation system, calculating the values of each value system in 2013 and 2019, analyzing and comparing the reasons behind numerical changes, and making suggestions accordingly. Results. In the year 2013, the economic value, ecological value, social value, and cultural value of the farmland ecosystem accounted for 11.72%, 6.15%, 80.36%, and 1.77% of the total value. In the year 2019, the figure is 19.22%, 2.75%, 76.67%, and 1.36%, respectively. Conclusion. The noneconomic value of terrace ecosystem far exceeds its economic value, so the utilization rate of farmland production should be increased based on the local conditions so as to maximize the value of the agricultural system and boost rural revitalization.</jats:p>",

Especially binary mixtures of such core/shell colloids exhibit unique adsorption behavior that manifests in adsorption races to the interface, resulting in the formation of patterns of binary colloidal particles as well as in a suppression of the coffee‐ring effect.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Blind people face difficulties with independent mobility, impacting employment prospects, social inclusion, and quality of life. Given the advancements in computer vision, with more efficient and effective automated information extraction from visual scenes, it is important to determine what information is worth conveying to blind travelers, especially since people have a limited capacity to receive and process sensory information. We aimed to investigate\n            <jats:italic>which</jats:italic>\n            objects in a street scene are useful to describe and\n            <jats:italic>how</jats:italic>\n            those objects should be described. Thirteen cane-using participants, five of whom were early blind, took part in two urban walking experiments. In the first experiment, participants were asked to voice their information needs in the form of questions to the experimenter. In the second experiment, participants were asked to score scene descriptions and navigation instructions, provided by the experimenter, in terms of their usefulness. The descriptions included a variety of objects with various annotations per object. Additionally, we asked participants to rank order the objects and the different descriptions per object in terms of priority and explain why the provided information is or is not useful to them. The results reveal differences between early and late blind participants. Late blind participants requested information more frequently and prioritized information about objects’ locations. Our results illustrate how different factors, such as the level of detail, relative position, and what type of information is provided when describing an object, affected the usefulness of scene descriptions. Participants explained how they (indirectly) used information, but they were frequently unable to explain their ratings. The results distinguish between various types of travel information, underscore the importance of featuring these types at multiple levels of abstraction, and highlight gaps in current understanding of travel information needs. Elucidating the information needs of blind travelers is critical for the development of more useful assistive technologies.\n          </jats:p>",

When the SiO2 thickness was 50 nm, the temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) was ±1 ppm/°C.

In this study, a core–shell structured MnO2@La(OH)3 nanocomposite was synthesized via a facile two-step precipitation method. Its removal performance and mechanisms for As(V) and As(III) were investigated through batch adsorption experiments and a series of analysis methods including the transformation kinetics of arsenic species in As(III) removal, FTIR, XRD and XPS. Solution pH could significantly influence the removal efficiencies of arsenic. The adsorption process of As(V) occurred rapidly in the first 5 h and then gradually decreased, whereas the As(III) removal rate was relatively slower. The maximum adsorption capacities of As(V) and As(III) were up to 138.9 and 139.9 mg/g at pH 4.0, respectively. For As(V) removal, the inner-sphere complexes of lanthanum arsenate were formed through the ligand exchange reactions and coprecipitation. The oxidation of As(III) to the less toxic As(V) by δ-MnO2 and subsequently the synergistic adsorption process by the lanthanum hydroxide on the MnO2@La(OH)3 nanocomposite to form lanthanum arsenate were the dominant mechanisms of As(III) removal. XPS analysis indicated that approximately 20.6% of Mn in the nanocomposite after As(III) removal were Mn(II). Furthermore, a small amount of Mn(II) and La(III) were released into solution during the process of As(III) removal. These results confirm its efficient performance in the arsenic-containing water treatment, such as As(III)-contaminated groundwater used for irrigation and As(V)-contaminated industrial wastewater.</jats:p>"

U1 small ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) is a major component of spliceosome, and U1 snRNP complex can suppress proximal APA sites through crosstalking with 3′ end processing factors. However, here we show that both knockdown and overexpression of SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2, the U1 snRNP proteins, promote the usage of proximal APA sites at the transcriptome level. SNRNP70 can drive the phase transition of PABPN1 from droplet to aggregate, which may reduce the repressive effects of PABPN1 on the proximal APA sites. Additionally, SNRNP70 can also promote the proximal APA sites by recruiting CPSF6, suggesting that the function of CPSF6 on APA is related with other RNA-binding proteins and cell context-dependent. Consequently, these results reveal that, on the contrary to U1 snRNP complex, the free proteins of U1 snRNP complex can promote proximal APA sites through the interaction with 3′ end processing machinery.</jats:p>",

Structurally, dyes <jats:bold>BZ1</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>BZ2</jats:bold> carry TPA and 4‐MeO‐TPA as donors, respectively, whereas CAA constitutes as a common acceptor. On the other hand, <jats:bold>BZ3</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>BZ4</jats:bold> incorporate TPA and 4‐MeO‐TPA as donors, respectively, and RAA serves as a common acceptor. Key steps to access <jats:bold>BZ1</jats:bold>‐<jats:bold>BZ4</jats:bold> involved Wittig olefination, reduction of cyano groups to aldehyde, and finally Knoevenagel condensation. In UV–visible spectra, dyes <jats:bold>BZ1</jats:bold>‐<jats:bold>BZ4</jats:bold> exhibited intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) maxima in the range of 503 nm to 534 nm and their extinction coefficients varied from 22,600 to 40,400 M<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

DFT studies revealed that HOMOs of dyes were localized essentially on the donors triphenylamine groups, whereas the LUMOs are largely confined over electron acceptors CAA and RAA as well as partly diffused into the benzofuran spacer. DSSCs, configured using <jats:bold>BZ1</jats:bold>‐<jats:bold>BZ4</jats:bold> as photosensitizers, showed fill factors (<jats:italic>ff</jats:italic>) in the range of 0.57 to 0.76, comparable to standard <jats:bold>N3</jats:bold> dye (0.67).

Dysregulated formation of the branch produced by <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (GnT-V, also called as MGAT5) promotes cancer growth and malignancy. However, it is largely unknown how the activity of GnT-V in cells is regulated.

Our glycomic analysis further shows that loss of terminal modifications of <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-glycans resulted in an increase in the amount of the GnT-V-produced branch. Mechanistically, shedding (cleavage and extracellular secretion) of GnT-V mediated by signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3) protease is greatly inhibited by blocking maturation of cellular <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-glycans, resulting in an increased level of GnT-V protein in cells.

Signalling from activated NLRs converges with and potentiates downstream responses from activated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense microbial signatures at the cell surface. Efficient signalling of both receptor branches relies on the host cell nucleus as an integration point for transcriptional reprogramming, and on the macromolecular transport processes that mediate the communication between cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Studies on nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), the nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) that compose NPCs, and nuclear transport machinery constituents that control nucleocytoplasmic transport, have revealed that they play important roles in regulating plant immune responses. Here, we discuss the contributions of nucleoporins and nuclear transport receptor (NTR)‐mediated signal transduction in plant immunity with an emphasis on NLR immune signalling across the nuclear compartment boundary and within the nucleus. We also highlight and discuss cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of NLRs and their signalling partners and further consider the potential implications of NLR activation and resistosome formation in both cellular compartments for mediating plant pathogen resistance and programmed host cell death.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to understand the relationship between serum IL-1β, IL-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels with infarct core and ischemic penumbra volume in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and its influence on prognosis.\nMethods\n The serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and hs-CRP were measured in 65 patients within 24h of AIS onset. The infarcts of the patients were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) and core volume on computed tomography perfusion or perfusion-weighted imaging were used to calculate infarct volume and ischemic penumbra volume. The Tan collateral score was calculated with Neusoft Brain Clinical Assistant Ration Evaluate (NeuBrainCARE).\nResults\n We found a significant correlation between infarct core volume and serum hs-CRP levels (P &lt; 0.05) and between penumbra volume and IL-6 levels (P &lt; 0.05). Serum IL-6 and hs-CRP levels were positively correlated with NIHSS scores at admission, discharge, and 3 months after discharge. IL-1β levels, Tan collateral score, and ASPECTS showed no correlation with the infarct core volume.\nConclusion\n A significant correlation between hs-CRP and IL-6 levels and infarct and ischemic penumbra volume, respectively, and with NIHSS score shows that these two factors might prove helpful in predicting the extent of neurological damage in AIS patients after 3 months of onset, opening new avenues for treatment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in risk factors for pulmonary hemorrhage in elderly and young patients with percutaneous computed tomography-guided needle biopsies (PCNBs). The correlations between the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary function indicators before CT-guided PCNB were also discussed. Methods. Between January 2018 and December 2019, 1,100 consecutive patients underwent CT-guided PCNBs at Qilu Hospital. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified risk factors for hemorrhage. Results. The occurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage was 22.1% in elderly patients and was 22.6% in young patients. In elderly patients, pulmonary hemorrhage was significantly influenced by needle depth to the lesion and dwell time, while in young patients, pulmonary hemorrhage was independently associated with lesion size, needle depth to the lesion, and dwell time. However, pulmonary function parameters, including FVC (% pred), FEV1 (% pred), FEV1/FVC ratio (%), small airway function parameters (FEF50%, FEF75%, and FEF25–75%), and large airway function parameters (MVV, PEF, and FEF25%), were not risk factors for hemorrhage. Furthermore, the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was not associated with different types of pulmonary dysfunctions. The risk of pulmonary hemorrhage did not increase with the severity of pulmonary dysfunctions. Conclusions. In this study, age is no longer a risk factor in evaluating pulmonary hemorrhage. Longer needle depth to the lesion and longer dwell time were significantly high risk factors of hemorrhage in both elderly patients and young patients. Patients with severe pulmonary dysfunctions did not show increased risks of pulmonary hemorrhage here.</jats:p>",

The influence of the scaling effects that is, the side length and layer thickness on the compression performance of these structures was studied. The experimental results showed that the specific strengths of three different hexagonal-core sandwich panels with different side lengths of 5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm side lengths is roughly maintained at 0.018 MPa/(kg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). In addition, doubling the wall thickness of the hexagonal core increases the compressive strength by only 38.9%. The performance characteristics of these hexagonal-core sandwich panels, which change with size, can provide a reference for designers and can be used for the preliminary prediction of the structural strength.</jats:p>",

Here, we analyzed the assembly of the transmembrane (TM)–juxtamembrane (JM) region of EGFR, one of the best studied members of RTKs, by combining single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging and a nanodisc technique. The JM domain of EGFR contains a threonine residue (T654) that is phosphorylated after ligand association. We observed that the TM–JM peptides of EGFR form anionic lipid-induced dimers and cholesterol-induced oligomers. The two forms involve distinct molecular interactions, with a bias toward oligomer formation upon threonine phosphorylation. We further analyzed the functions and oligomerization of whole EGFR molecules, with or without a substitution of T654 to alanine, in living cells. The results suggested an autoregulatory mechanism in which T654 phosphorylation causes a switch of the major function of EGFR from kinase-activating dimers to scaffolding oligomers.</jats:p>",

However, the reason for the acidic core and diversity in the taste of the same fruit is not clear. In this study, we observed that the citrate contents were three times higher in the core than in the pulp, while the malate content decreased along with fruit development and was significantly lower in the core than in the pulp at 110 days after flowering. Overall transcript levels for citrate-malate synthesis-related genes increased more in the pear core than the pulp at early fruit development, while degradation-related genes activity was nearly similar or non-significant between the core and pulp during fruit development. The lesser malate accumulation in the pear core compared to the pulp at 110 DAF was possibly due to the reduced activity of tDT2 gene. Regarding citrate accumulation, we identified five important p-type H+-ATPase genes in pear and found that the relative expression level of the PH8.1 gene was four-fold higher in the core than in the pulp during fruit development. Moreover, the expression level of di-carboxylate carrier gene 2 (DIC2) was constantly and significantly higher in the core than in the pulp. In addition, correlation analysis signified that the transcript levels of the two genes PH8.1 and DIC2 positively and significantly correlated with the citrate contents. These results suggested that the increased and collaborative activity of PH8.1 and DIC2 played a key role in the higher citrate accumulation in the core than the pulp, thus, with the help of molecular breeding tools, the citrate contents can be optimized in pear fruit for divers and improved fruit flavoring.</jats:p>"

The vaginal microbiome influences genital inflammation and HIV infection risk. Multiple factors, including age, induce vaginal microbial alterations, characterized by high microbial diversity that generate high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), known to modulate neutrophil function. However, how SCFAs may modulate innate anti-HIV protection by neutrophils is unknown. To investigate SCFA-mediated alterations of neutrophil function, blood neutrophils from younger and older women were treated with SCFAs (acetate, butyrate and propionate) at concentrations within the range reported during bacterial vaginosis, and phenotype, migration and anti-HIV responses were evaluated. SCFA induced phenotypical changes preferentially in neutrophils from older women. Butyrate decreased CD66b and increased CD16 and CD62L expression, indicating low activation and prolonged survival, while propionate increased CD54 and CXCR4 expression, indicating a mature aged phenotype. Furthermore, acetate and butyrate significantly inhibited neutrophil migration in vitro and specifically reduced α-defensin release in older women, molecules with anti-HIV activity. Following HIV stimulation, SCFA treatment delayed NET release and dampened chemokine secretion compared to untreated neutrophils in younger and older women. Our results demonstrate that SCFAs can impair neutrophil-mediated anti-HIV responses.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today’s lowest-loss hollow core fibers are based on antiresonance guidance. They have been shown both theoretically and experimentally to have very low levels of backscattering arising from the fiber structure – 45 dB below that of traditional optical fibers with a solid silica glass core. This makes their longitudinal characterization using conventional reflectometric techniques very challenging. However, it was recently estimated that when filled with air, their backscattering coefficient increases to about 30 dB below that of standard solid core fibers. This level should be measurable with commercially available high performance optical time domain reflectometers (OTDR). Here we demonstrate – for the first time to the best of our knowledge – the measurement of backscattering from the air inside a hollow core fiber. We show that the characterization of multi-km long hollow core fibers with 15 m spatial resolution is possible using a commercial OTDR instrument. To benefit from its full dynamic range, we strongly suppress the 4% back-reflections that ordinarily occur at the OTDR’s standard fiber output when directly-connected to a hollow core fiber. Furthermore, low coupling loss into the hollow core fiber (0.3 dB in our experiment) also helps to maximize the achievable OTDR signal-to-noise ratio. This approach enables distributed characterization and fault-finding in low-loss hollow core fibers, a topic of increasing importance as these fibers are now starting to be installed in commercial optical communication networks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Automated postprocessing packages have been developed for managing acute ischemic stroke (AIS). These packages identify ischemic core and penumbra using either computed tomographic perfusion imaging (CTP) data or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Measurements of abnormal tissues and treatment decisions derived from different vendors can vary. The purpose of this study is to investigate the agreement of volumetric and decision-making outcomes derived from two software packages. Methods: A total of 594 AIS patients (174 underwent CTP and 420 underwent MRI) were included. Imaging data were accordingly postprocessed by two software packages: RAPID and RealNow. Volumetric outputs were compared between packages by performing intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Wilcoxon paired test and Bland–Altman analysis. Concordance of selecting patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was assessed based on neuroimaging criteria proposed in DEFUSE3. Results: In the group with CTP data, mean ischemic core volume (ICV)/penumbral volume (PV) was 14.9/81.1 mL via RAPID and 12.6/83.2 mL via RealNow. Meanwhile, in the MRI group, mean ICV/PV were 52.4/68.4 mL and 48.9/61.6 mL via RAPID and RealNow, respectively. Reliability, which was measured by ICC of ICV and PV in CTP and MRI groups, ranged from 0.87 to 0.99. The bias remained small between measurements (CTP ICV: 0.89 mL, CTP PV: −2 mL, MRI ICV: 3.5 mL and MRI PV: 6.8 mL). In comparison with CTP ICV with follow-up DWI, the ICC was 0.92 and 0.94 for RAPID and Realnow, respectively. The bias remained small between CTP ICV and follow-up DWI measurements (Rapid: −4.65 mL, RealNow: −3.65 mL). Wilcoxon paired test showed no significant difference between measurements. The results of patient triage were concordant in 159/174 cases (91%, ICC: 0.90) for CTP and 400/420 cases (95%, ICC: 0.93) for MRI. Conclusion: The CTP ICV derived from RealNow was more accurate than RAPID. The similarity in volumetric measurement between packages did not necessarily relate to equivalent patient triage. In this study, RealNow showed excellent agreement with RAPID in measuring ICV and PV as well as patient triage.</jats:p>"

Delivery of an infectious agent or intervention to the respiratory tract mirrors natural routes of exposure and allows for the evaluation of clinically relevant therapeutic administration. The data to support instillation or inoculation volumes are important both for optimal experimental design and to minimize or avoid effects of diluent alone, which may compromise both data interpretation and animal welfare. Here we investigate four intranasal (IN) instillation volumes in hamsters (50, 100, 200, or 400 µL). The animals were monitored daily, and a subset were serially euthanized at one of four pre-determined time-points (1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-instillation). Weight, temperature, oxygen saturation, CBC, radiographs, and respiratory tissue histopathology were assessed to determine changes associated with instillation volume alone. With all the delivery volumes, we found no notable differences between instilled and non-instilled controls in all of the parameters assessed, except for histopathology. In the animals instilled with 200 or 400 µL, inflammation associated with foreign material was detected in the lower respiratory tract indicating that higher volumes may result in aspiration of nasal and/or oropharyngeal material in a subset of animals, resulting in IN instillation-associated histopathology.</jats:p>"

To address this gap, we conducted a case-control study using baseline data from the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study [n = 1255; Type 1 Diabetes (T1D): n = 563; non-Diabetes Mellitus (non-DM): n = 692]. Participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire, fasting (12 h overnight fast) biochemical analyses, and a physical examination including anthropometric measures. CAC and PAT were measured using electron beam-computed tomography. Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of the Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS) with CAC (presence or absence), and linear regression models were applied to PAT analyses. In all of the adjusted models, no significant associations with CAC were found. For PAT, an increasing MSDPS was consistently associated with its lower volume in models adjusted for age, sex, diabetes status, total calories, and body mass index (all p &lt; 0.05). The association between MSDPS and PAT was attenuated after adjusting for serum lipids and physical activity. In conclusion, the baseline data from the CACTI study show that a greater adherence to MSDPS is associated with a lower PAT volume and provide evidence that the Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with lower cardiovascular risk markers.</jats:p>"

Therefore, peculiar core–crust oscillation may occur in a strange star, which can produce distinctive gravitational waves. In this paper, the waveforms of such gravitational waves are derived using a rigid model. We find that the gravitational waves are extremely weak and undetectable, even for the next-generation detectors.

The miRNA cluster miR-130b/301b is highly expressed in adipose tissues and has been implicated in metabolic diseases as a posttranscriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid metabolism. We investigated the roles of miR-130b/301b in regulating beige adipogenesis in vivo and in vitro. miR-130b/301b declined in adipose progenitor cells during beige adipogenesis, while forced overexpression of miR-130b-3p or miR-301b-3p suppressed uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that a decline in miR-130b-3p or miR-301b-3p is required for adipocyte precursors to develop the beige phenotype. Mechanistically, miR-130b/301b directly targeted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα1) and suppressed peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (Pgc-1α), key regulators of brown adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Mice lacking the miR-130b/301b miRNA cluster showed reduced visceral adiposity and less weight gain. miR-130b/301b null mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance, increased UCP1 and AMPK activation in subcutaneous fat (inguinal white adipose tissue [iWAT]), and increased response to cold-induced energy expenditure. Together, these data identify the miR-130b/301b cluster as a new regulator that suppresses beige adipogenesis involving PGC-1α and AMPK signaling in iWAT and is therefore a potential therapeutic target against obesity and related metabolic disorders.</jats:p>",

Non‐destructive and minimally invasive methods of prospection can help to overcome these limits. Our case study of a Late Bronze Age opencast mine (ca. 1050 to 780 BC) shows the potential of geophysical prospection methods combined with core drillings. For the reconstruction of this mine, we combined electrical resistivity and induced polarization (IP) tomography, seismic refraction tomography (SRT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). The geophysical data were collected based on an orthogonal grid of 10 longitudinal and transverse profiles, laid out over an area of ~330 × 300 m. The profiles allowed a three‐dimensional interpolation of the geological units, the mining dumps, the mining areas and the residual mineralization. Additionally, two deep cores were drilled to ground‐truth the geophysical prospection results. They provided information about the stratification at intersections of the measurement grid, and this proved crucial for validating the interpreted geophysical profiles. Each geophysical method applied provided different information for the reconstruction of the site: the electrical resistivity tomography offered the best clues as to the locations of the geological units and the dumps, the seismic refraction tomography visualized the transition between the dump or backfill layers and the underlying bedrock, and the IP measurements revealed residual mineralization. The georadar measurements, on the other hand, did not contribute to the interpretation owing to the limited depth of penetration. Based on the combination of borehole and geophysical data, it was possible to develop a hypothetical model of an open‐pit mine for copper ore that developed in three phases (mines A–C) during the Late Bronze Age. Without the control provided by the core drillings, one of the mining areas (mine A) could not have been correctly identified in the geophysical prospections.</jats:p>",

The selection of surgical operation (simple fistulotomy, fistulectomy, seton placement, development flap, fibrin glue or anal plug) is decided with the aid of the route of the fistula tracts and continence status. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the surgical technique “core out fistulectomy with anal sphincter reconstruction and primary closure of internal opening” in the treatment of trans-sphincteric fistula (high type or long tract) or supra-sphincteric fistula in terms of fistula healing, morbidity, recurrence and anal continence. Methods: This prospective observational study was carried out in the Department of Surgery Dr Amanat khan hospital and other private hospitals, Dhaka, Bangladesh, during 5th March 2020 to 10th April 2022. A total 30 patients between the age group 20 to 70 years who were diagnosed with Fistula-in-Ano(Complex Variety) which underwent Core out Fistulectomy with Anal Spincter Reconstruction and Primary Repair of Internal Opening. This analysis was done using SPSS 24 software version. The level of significance was set to 5% (p &lt; 0.05). Results: There were 30 (91%) men and three (9%) women with a median age of 42 years. The common anal fistula type was high transsphincteric fistula in 31 patients with deep postanal abscess in two patients and two patients were suprasphincteric fistula. Conclusions: Core out fistulectomy with anal sphincter reconstruction and major closure of inner opening is a secure and nice method for excessive trans-sphincteric fistula. It has desirable useful results and no disturbance of continence. This has to be viewed in the cure of high trans-sphincteric fistula.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Human perception and behavior are affected by the situational context, in particular during social interactions. A recent study demonstrated that humans perceive visual stimuli differently depending on whether they do the task by themselves or together with a robot. Specifically, it was found that the central tendency effect is stronger in social than in non-social task settings. The particular nature of such behavioral changes induced by social interaction, and their underlying cognitive processes in the human brain are, however, still not well understood. In this paper, we address this question by training an artificial neural network inspired by the predictive coding theory on the above behavioral data set. Using this computational model, we investigate whether the change in behavior that was caused by the situational context in the human experiment could be explained by continuous modifications of a parameter expressing how strongly sensory and prior information affect perception. We demonstrate that it is possible to replicate human behavioral data in both individual and social task settings by modifying the precision of prior and sensory signals, indicating that social and non-social task settings might in fact exist on a continuum. At the same time, an analysis of the neural activation traces of the trained networks provides evidence that information is coded in fundamentally different ways in the network in the individual and in the social conditions. Our results emphasize the importance of computational replications of behavioral data for generating hypotheses on the underlying cognitive mechanisms of shared perception and may provide inspiration for follow-up studies in the field of neuroscience.</jats:p>"

Here, we compare the immunogenicity of a first-generation mRNA vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, with a second-generation mRNA vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, in rats. Higher levels of spike (S) protein expression were observed in cell culture with the CV2CoV mRNA than with the CVnCoV mRNA. Vaccination with CV2CoV also induced higher titres of virus neutralising antibodies with accelerated kinetics in rats compared with CVnCoV. Significant cross-neutralisation of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and the ‘mink’ variant (B1.1.298) that were circulating at the time in early 2021 were also demonstrated. In addition, CV2CoV induced higher levels of antibodies at lower doses than CVnCoV, suggesting that dose-sparing could be possible with the next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which could improve worldwide vaccine supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. This study aims to reconstruct the hydro-climatic variations over the last 1000 yrs in Haiti using mineralogical and geochemical composition of well dated lacustrine sediment core retrieved from Lake Azuei. The results show changes in sedimentological processes linked to environmental and climatic variations. The general pattern suggests a wetter Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), drier Little Ice Age (LIA), high climate variability during the MCA-LIA transition and more anthropogenic impacts that dominate natural climate during the Current Warm Period (CWP). The MCA period (~1000–1100 CE) thus appears marked by increase sedimentation rate supported by higher terrigenous input linked to erosive events and consequently increases in precipitation. During the LIA, particularly from ~1450 CE to 1600 CE, there is a great variation towards a decrease of terrigenous input, which is related to a decrease on sedimentation rate and increase Mg-calcite precipitation, suggesting less precipitation and high evaporation respectively during dry climate conditions. The MCA-LIA transition (~1200–1400 CE) is characterized by variations between terrigenous input, Mg-calcite neoformation and organic matter deposition, which indicate succession of dry and humid conditions. The CWP (1800–2000 CE) shows a progressive increase on sedimentation rate and decrease of grey level, which indicate more organic matter sedimentation as consequence of anthropogenic activities in the surrounding basin of the lake. High-resolution grey level analysis, which reflects principally variations in terrigenous input, carbonate mineral neoformation and organic matter deposition, shows that the AMO, NAO, PDO and ENSO are the principal modes affecting the hydro-climatic changes in Haiti during the last millennium. In addition, temporal correlation of other Caribbean paleoclimate records with our geochemical and mineralogical data, suggests that trends observed in Lake Azuei were controlled by regional climate, likely associated with shifts in the position of the ITCZ.\n                        </jats:p>"

Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from 4-methylsulphinylbutyl glucosinolate (glucoraphanin) that accumulates in certain of these vegetables, notably broccoli, has been implicated in their protective effects. Likewise, the consumption of garlic and its sulphur-containing compounds such as alliin have been associated with a reduction in risk of prostate cancer. In this study, we tested whether consuming glucoraphanin derived from broccoli seeds and alliin derived from garlic resulted in the occurrence of these potential bioactive compounds in the prostate, which may contribute to our understanding of the putative protective effects of these dietary components. We recruited 42 men scheduled for a trans-perineal prostate biopsy into a randomised, double-blinded, 2 × 2-factorial dietary supplement four-week intervention study, and 39 completed the study. The two active interventions were supplements providing glucoraphanin from broccoli (BroccoMax®) and alliin from garlic (Kwai Heartcare®). Following the intervention, prostate biopsy tissue was analysed for the presence of sulforaphane and its thiol conjugates and for alliin and associated metabolites. Sulforaphane occurred in significantly higher levels in the prostate tissue (both within the transition and peripheral zone) of men consuming the glucoraphanin containing supplements (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to men not consuming these supplements. However, while alliin and alliin-derived metabolites were detected within the prostate, there was no significant difference in the concentrations of these compounds in the prostate of men consuming supplements derived from garlic compared to men not consuming these supplements.</jats:p>"

Within this process, a conventional ring-spun cotton yarn fed to the electrical field, where nanofibers covered it by a certain orientation owning to the twisting procedure. This approach combines the excellent biological and physical-mechanical properties of cotton with outstanding features of the PLA nanofibers for biomedical applications. The effects of the core and shell structures on the ultimate properties of the electrospun core-shell yarns were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that relatively uniform and bead-free fibers with smooth surfaces were formed. SEM images also confirmed that the nanofibers were arranged around the core with a specific angle to the axis (with the angle range of 8–44 based on the twisting rate) to constitute a twisted core-shell yarn. The diameter of the electrospun yarns decreased (∼ 22%) by increasing the twist rate. The influence of the core on the mechanical behavior of core-shell yarn are also discussed. Improvements in mechanical performance of core-shell yarns were generally perceived at low twist levels of the core yarn (α<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> = 2.8), and electrospun shell (40 rpm). </jats:p>",

Opportunities for range expansion can be assessed by investigating the associations of core-periphery environmental and genetic differences. This study investigates differences in the core-periphery adaptation of <jats:italic>Ammopiptanthus mongolicus</jats:italic>, a broad-leaved evergreen shrub species in a relatively homogeneous temperate Asian desert environment, to explore the environmental factors that limit the expansion of desert plants. Temperate deserts are characterized by severe drought, a large diurnal temperature range, and seasonality. Long-standing adaptation to the harsh desert environment may confine the genetic diversity of <jats:italic>A. mongolicus</jats:italic>, despite its distribution over a wide range of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Since range edges defined by climate niches may have different genetic responses to environmental extremes, we compared genome-wide polymorphisms between nine environmental core populations and ten fragmented peripheral populations to determine the “adaptive peripheral” populations. At least four adaptive peripheral populations had similar genetic-environmental association patterns. High elevations, summer drought, and winter cold were the three main determinants of converging these four adaptive peripheral populations. Elevation mainly caused similar local climates among different geographic regions. Altitudinal adaptation resulting from integrated environmental-genetic responses was a breakthrough in breaching niche boundaries. These peripheral populations are also located in relatively humid and warmer environments. Relaxation of the drought and cold constraints facilitated the genetic divergence of these peripheral populations from the core population’s adaptive legacy. We conclude that pleiotropic selection synchronized adaptative divergence to cold and drought vs. warm and humid environments between the core and peripheral populations. Such parallel adaptation of peripheral populations relies on selection under a background of abundant new variants derived from the core population’s standing genetic variation, i.e., integration of genetic surfing and local adaptation.</jats:p>"

However, its evolutionary potential and involvement in facilitating rapid adaptations in insects are enigmatic. Moreover, our understanding of these mechanisms is limited to a few insect species, of which none are pests of crops. Hence, we studied methylation patterns in the brown planthopper (BPH), a major rice pest, under pesticide and nutritional stress, across its life stages. Moreover, as the inheritance of epigenetic changes is fundamentally essential for acclimation, adaptability, and evolution, we determined the heritability and persistence of stress-induced methylation marks in BPH across generations. Our results revealed that DNA methylation pattern(s) in BPH varies/vary with environmental cues and is/are insect life-stage specific. Further, our findings provide novel insights into the heritability of stress-induced methylation marks in BPH. However, it was observed that, though heritable, these marks eventually fade in the absence of the stressors, thereby suggesting the existence of fitness cost(s) associated with the maintenance of the stressed epigenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate how 5-azacytidine-mediated disruption of BPH methylome influences expression levels of stress-responsive genes and, thereby, highlight demethylation/methylation as a phenomenon underlying stress resilience of BPH.</jats:p>"

In the present study, the effects of cpTPI overexpression on photosynthesis were examined in transgenic rice plants overexpressing the gene encoding cpTPI. The amounts of cpTPI protein in the two lines of transgenic plants were 4.8- and 12.1-folds higher than in wild-type plants, respectively. The magnitude of the increase approximately corresponded to the increase in transcript levels of cpTPI. A at CO2 levels of 100 and 120 Pa increased by 6–9% in the transgenic plants, whereas those at ambient and low CO2 levels were scarcely affected. Similar increases were observed for TPU capacity estimated from the CO2 response curves of A. These results indicate that the overexpression of cpTPI marginally improved photosynthesis at elevated CO2 levels via improvement in TPU capacity in rice. However, biomass production at a CO2 level of 120 Pa did not increase in transgenic plants, suggesting that the improvement in photosynthesis by cpTPI overexpression was not sufficient to improve biomass production in rice.</jats:p>",

To obtain higher efficiency, the building of a dual-core system-on-chip (SoC) with TEE security capabilities is the hottest topic. However, TEE SoCs currently commonly use complex processor cores such as Rocket, resulting in high resource usage. More importantly, the cryptographic unit lacks flexibility and ignores secure communication in dual cores. To address the above problems, we propose DITES, a dual-core TEE SoC based on a Reduced Instruction Set Computer-V (RISC-V). At first, we designed a fully isolated multi-level bus architecture based on a lightweight RISC-V processor with an integrated crypto core supporting Secure Hashing Algorithm-1 (SHA1), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), among which RSA can be configured to five key lengths. Then, we designed a secure boot based on Chain-of-Trust (CoT). Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical access policy to improve the security of inter-core communication. Finally, DITES is deployed on a Kintex 7 Field-Programmable-Gate-Array (FPGA) with a power consumption of 0.297 W, synthesized using TSMC 90 nm. From the results, the acceleration ratios of SHA1 and RSA1024 decryption/encryption can reach 75 and 1331/1493, respectively. Compared to exiting TEE SoCs, DITES has lower resource consumption, higher flexibility, and better security.</jats:p>"

The explodability of strongly and weakly magnetized models of 20 and 27 M⊙ pre-supernova progenitors are compared. We find that although the efficiency for the conversion of the neutrino heating into turbulent energy including magnetic fields in the gain region is not significantly different between the strong and weak field models, the amplified magnetic field due to the neutrino-driven convection on large hot bubbles just behind stalled shock results in a faster and more energetic explosion in the strongly magnetized models. In addition, by comparing the difference between the 2nd- and 5th-order spatial accuracy of the simulation in the strong field model for 27 M⊙ progenitor, we also find that the higher order accuracy in space is beneficial to the explosion because it enhances the growth of neutrino-driven convection in the gain region. Based on our results of core-collapse supernova simulations for the non-rotating model, a new possibility for the origin of the magnetic field of the protoneutron star (PNS) is proposed. The magnetic field is accumulated and amplified to magnetar level, that is, $\\mathcal {O}(10^{14})$ G, in the convectively stable shell near the PNS surface.</jats:p>",

Therefore, Earth's deep water and carbon cycles can be linked. The extracted core carbon can explain a significant amount of the present‐day mantle carbon. Also, if diamond can be collected by mantle flow in the region, it can result in unusually high seismic‐velocity structures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Over the last two decades, optical frequency combs (OFCs) have enabled some of the most accurate measurements in physics. Distributing light from OFCs via optical fibers could make these high‐accuracy measurement tools available more widely, from a few dedicated metrology laboratories to other laboratories and industry. However, the performance of distributed OFCs is strongly limited by impairments of standard single mode fiber (SMF), most notably its thermal sensitivity of chromatic dispersion, for which no compensation technique has been shown to date. To overcome this limitation, use of a new class of optical fiber is suggested here: a hollow core fiber (HCF), which offers more than an order of magnitude lesser such impairment. The measured OFC frequency stability of the optical mode and mode spacing reaches 1.8 × 10<jats:sup>−19</jats:sup> and 1.5 × 10<jats:sup>−17</jats:sup> at a few thousand seconds, respectively, after transmitting through 7.7 km of HCF. To the best of knowledge, this is the best ever performance for km‐lengths of fiber‐based OFC distribution. Besides, other HCF advantages over SMF in this application are discussed. Specifically, HCFs offer over an order of magnitude lower thermal sensitivity of propagation delay, several orders of magnitude lower optical nonlinearity, and almost ten times lower chromatic dispersion.</jats:p>",

The process by which this branching could propagate towards the higher order (butyl cyanide, $\\rm {C_4H_9CN}$) is an active field of research. Since the grain catalysis process could have formed a major portion of these species, considering a realistic set of binding energies are indeed essential. We employ quantum chemical calculations to estimate the binding energy of these species considering water as a substrate because water is the principal constituent of this interstellar ice. We find significantly lower binding energy values for these species than were previously used. It is noticed that the use of realistic binding energy values can significantly change the abundance of these species. The branching is more favourable for the higher order alkyl cyanides with the new binding energies. With the inclusion of our new binding energy values and one essential destruction reaction ($\\rm {i-C_3H_7CN+H \\rightarrow CH_3C(CH_3)CN + H_2}$, having an activation barrier of 947 K), abundances of $\\rm {t-C_4H_9CN}$ dramatically increased.</jats:p>",

To date, early prognostic and diagnostic markers for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have not been systematically and clearly identified, so most patients receive standard treatment. In the present study, we combine quantitative proteomics studies and the use of magnetic core-shell nanoparticles (mCSNP’s), first to identify a marker for lung cancer, and second to functionalize the nanoparticles and their possible application for early and timely diagnosis of this and other types of cancer. In the present study, we used label-free mass spectrometry in combination with an ion-mobility approach to identify 220 proteins with increased abundance in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines. Our attention was focused on cell receptors for their potential application as mCSNP’s targets; in this work, we report the overexpression of Transferrin Receptor (TfR1) protein, also known as Cluster of Differentiation 71 (CD71) up to a 30-fold increase with respect to the control cell. The kinetics of endocytosis, evaluated by a flow cytometry methodology based on fluorescence quantification, demonstrated that receptors were properly activated with the transferrin supported on the magnetic core-shell nanoparticles. Our results are important in obtaining essential information for monitoring the disease and/or choosing better treatments, and this finding will pave the way for future synthesis of nanoparticles including chemotherapeutic drugs for lung cancer treatments.</jats:p>"

This work investigates the relations between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) adipocytes and parameters of glucose/insulin metabolism, circulating adipokines levels, and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD); establishing significant determinants describing changes in ROS EAT in this category of patients. Material and methods. This study included 19 patients (14 men and 5 women, 53–72 y.o., 6 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2; 5 patients with prediabetes), with CAD, who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. EAT adipocytes were isolated by the enzymatic method from intraoperative explants obtained during coronary artery bypass grafting. The size of EAT adipocytes and ROS level were determined. Results. The production of ROS by EAT adipocytes demonstrated a direct correlation with the level of postprandial glycemia (rs = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05), and an inverse correlation with serum adiponectin (rs = −0.50, p = 0.026), but not with general and abdominal obesity, EAT thickness, and dyslipidemia. Regression analysis demonstrated that the increase in ROS of EAT adipocytes occurs due to the interaction of the following factors: postprandial glycemia (β = 0.95), postprandial insulin (β = 0.24), and reduced serum adiponectin (β = −0.20). EAT adipocytes in patients with diabetes and prediabetes manifested higher ROS production than in patients with normoglycemia. Although there was no correlation between the production of ROS by EAT adipocytes and Gensini score in the total group of patients, higher rates of oxidative stress were observed in EAT adipocytes from patients with a Gensini score greater than median Gensini score values (≥70.55 points, Gr.B), compared to patients with less severe coronary atherosclerosis (&lt;70.55 points, Gr.A). Of note, the frequency of patients with diabetes and prediabetes was higher among the patients with the most severe coronary atherosclerosis (Gr.B) than in the Gr.A. Conclusions. Our data have demonstrated for the first time that systemic impairments of glucose/insulin metabolism and a decrease in serum adiponectin are significant independent determinants of oxidative stress intensity in EAT adipocytes in patients with severe coronary atherosclerosis. The possible input of the interplay between oxidative stress in EAT adipocytes and metabolic disturbances to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis requires further investigation.</jats:p>"

These events, where dramatic warming occurs over decades, are well represented in both Greenland ice core mineral dust and temperature records, suggesting a causal link. However, the feedbacks between atmospheric dust and climate change during these Dansgaard–Oeschger events are poorly known and the processes driving changes in atmospheric dust emission and transport remain elusive. Constraining dust provenance is key to resolving these gaps. Here, we present a multi‐technique analysis of Greenland dust provenance using novel and established, source diagnostic isotopic tracers as well as results from a regional climate model including dust cycle simulations. We show that the existing dominant model for the provenance of Greenland dust as sourced from combined East Asian dust and Pacific volcanics is not supported. Rather, our clay mineralogical and Hf–Sr–Nd and D/H isotopic analyses from last glacial Greenland dust and an extensive range of Northern Hemisphere potential dust sources reveal three most likely scenarios (in order of probability): direct dust sourcing from the Taklimakan Desert in western China, direct sourcing from European glacial sources, or a mix of dust originating from Europe and North Africa. Furthermore, our regional climate modeling demonstrates the plausibility of European or mixed European/North African sources for the first time. We suggest that the origin of dust to Greenland is potentially more complex than previously recognized, demonstrating more uncertainty in our understanding dust climate feedbacks during abrupt events than previously understood.</jats:p>",

Alterations of proteome induced by LYS739 and LYS744 were compared with those elicited by morphine. The changes in rat proteome profiles were analyzed by label-free quantification (MaxLFQ). Proteomic analysis indicated that the treatment with 3 mg/kg of LYS744 caused significant alterations in protein expression levels in spleen lymphocytes (45), rat brain cortex (31), and hippocampus (42). The identified proteins were primarily involved in RNA processing and the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. In spleen lymphocytes, the administration of the higher 10 mg/kg dose of both enkephalin analogs caused major, extensive modifications in protein expression levels: LYS739 (119) and LYS744 (182). Among these changes, the number of proteins associated with immune responses and apoptotic processes was increased. LYS739 treatment resulted in the highest number of alterations in the rat brain cortex (152) and hippocampus (45). The altered proteins were functionally related to the regulation of transcription and cytoskeletal reorganization, which plays an essential role in neuronal plasticity. Administration with LYS744 did not increase the number of altered proteins in the brain cortex (26) and hippocampus (26). Our findings demonstrate that the effect of κ-OR full antagonism of LYS744 is opposite in the central nervous system and the peripheral region (spleen lymphocytes).</jats:p>"

During the material-relocation phase in CDA of SFR, the molten materials are possibly released from the core region into subcooled sodium, subsequently forming the debris bed on the lower part of the reactor vessel after being quenched and fragmented. The accumulated high-temperature debris with decay heat can cause sodium coolant boiling, leading to the so-called “debris bed self-leveling behavior” during which the shape of the debris bed becomes flattered (leveling). It is important to investigate the debris bed self-leveling behavior due to its potential capacity to induce the transfer of debris and affect the ability of cooling and criticality of the debris bed. Thus, in recent years, valuable knowledge concerning the mechanism and characteristics of this behavior was accumulated through lots of experimental results and modeling developments. Aimed at providing a valuable guideline for future investigations on this issue, in this study, the past experimental and modeling investigations on debris bed self-leveling mechanism and characteristics are systematically summarized and reviewed, and some future remarks are also proposed to promote the progression of further research for SFR severe accident analysis.</jats:p>",

Previous deeper collections (below conventional SCUBA depths) have relied on dredge/grab samples or drop camera surveys. Remote techniques cannot conclusively prove that macroalgae are living at these depths, as algae detach from shallower substrata, e.g., through ice scouring, and drift to depths below their growth limit. This, combined with a low rate of decay of macroalgae around Antarctica, requires validation that algal samples from depth have grown in situ. Estimates of macroalgal biomass, energy fluxes, and the potential energy fixation may need adjusting to consider the deeper growing depths particularly with glacial retreat along the Antarctic Peninsula revealing areas of rocky substrata for macroalgal colonisation. The confirmed extension of depth where macroalgae can grow will have implications for assessments of benthic productivity and food webs in Antarctica.</jats:p>",

Specifically, their application to perovskite solar cells, which are among the most promising photovoltaic devices acknowledged for eco‐friendly energy generation, has significantly impacted the current standing of metal halide perovskite‐based devices. The uniqueness of the nanocarbon applications can be attributed to their outstanding optical, electrical, chemical and mechanical properties, which conventional materials do not possess. This review overviews past and present reports on graphene‐ and CNT‐incorporated perovskite solar cells. Versatile roles and various synthetic methodologies of the applied nanocarbons in perovskite solar cells, including the material growth methods and sources, and functions as transparent electrodes, charge‐transporting layers, interfacial layers, additives and encapsulants, are categorized and graphically illustrated. The discussion expands from single‐junction to tandem applications with silicon solar cells, where the nanocarbon materials also play an equally important yet divergent function. Applications of each graphene and CNTs to the silicon‐perovskite tandem solar cells are interpreted in terms of what roles they play and how they solve the conventional problems. This review serves as the guideline for the photovoltaics researchers in advancing devices using nanocarbons.</jats:p>",

In the core region, heavy elements are predicted to be distributed uniformly and make up only 18% by mass because of dilution with hydrogen and helium.

Therefore, antibody‐based therapies that specifically target cancer antigens can be considered ideal cancer therapies. Antibodies linked with small‐molecule drugs (i.e., antibody–drug conjugates [ADCs]) are widely used in clinics as antibody‐based therapeutics. However, because tumors express antigens heterogeneously, greater target specificity and stable binding of noncleavable linkers in ADCs limit their antitumor effects. To overcome this problem, strategies, including decreasing the binding strength, conjugating more drugs, and targeting tumor stroma, have been applied, albeit with limited success. Thus, further technological advancements are required to remotely control the ADCs. Here, we described a drug that is photo‐releasable from an ADC created via simple double conjugation and its antitumor effects both on target and nontarget tumor cells. Specifically, noncleavable T‐DM1 was conjugated with IR700DX to produce T‐DM1‐IR700. Although T‐DM1‐IR700 itself is noncleavable, with NIR‐light irradiation, it can release DM1‐derivatives which elicited antitumor effect in vitro mixed culture and in vivo mixed tumor model which are mimicking heterogeneous tumor‐antigen expression same as real clinical tumors. This cytotoxic photo‐bystander effect occurred in various types mixed cultures in vitro, and changing antibodies also exerted photo‐bystander effects, suggesting that this technology can be used for targeting various specific cancer antigens. These findings can potentially aid the development of strategies to address challenges associated with tumor expression of heterogeneous antigen.</jats:p>",

Numerous studies have investigated the impact of size, shape, charge, and surface functionality of nanoparticles on mammalian cellular uptake. Rigidity has been studied to a far lesser extent, and its effects are still unclear. Here, the importance of this property, and its interplay with particle size, is systematically explored using a library of core‐shell spherical PEGylated nanoparticles synthesized by RAFT emulsion polymerization. Rigidity of these particles is controlled by altering the intrinsic glass transition temperature of their constituting polymers. Three polymeric core rigidities are tested: hard, medium, and soft using two particle sizes, 50 and 100 nm diameters. Cellular uptake studies indicate that softer particles are taken up faster and threefold more than harder nanoparticles with the larger 100 nm particles. In addition, the study indicates major differences in the cellular uptake pathway, with harder particles being internalized through clathrin‐ and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis as well as macropinocytosis, while softer particles are taken up bycaveolae‐ and non‐receptormediated endocytosis. However, 50 nm derivatives do not show any appreciable differences in uptake efficiency, suggesting that rigidity as a parameter in the biological regime may be size dependent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>TRPV1, a capsaicin- and heat-activated ion channel, is expressed by peripheral nociceptors and has been implicated in various inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. Although pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 has attracted therapeutic interest, many TRPV1 agonists and antagonists produce thermomodulatory side effects in animal models and human clinical trials, limiting their utility. These on-target effects may result from the perturbation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptors, which transduce signals to central thermoregulatory circuits and release proinflammatory factors from their peripheral terminals, most notably the potent vasodilative neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Alternatively, these body temperature effects may originate from the modulation of TRPV1 on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), where channel activation promotes arteriole constriction. Here, we ask which of these pathways is most responsible for the body temperature perturbations elicited by TRPV1 drugs in vivo. We address this question by selectively eliminating TRPV1 expression in sensory neurons or vSMCs and show that only the former abrogates agonist-induced hypothermia and antagonist-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, lesioning the central projections of TRPV1-positive sensory nerve fibers also abrogates drug-mediated thermomodulation, whereas eliminating CGRP has no effect. Thus, TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature by modulating sensory input to the central nervous system, rather than through peripheral actions on the vasculature. These findings suggest how mechanistically distinct TRPV1 antagonists may diminish inflammatory pain without affecting core body temperature.</jats:p>"

Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high‐density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.</jats:p>",

Together with reverse time migration images, seafloor morphology, in situ geological samples, magnetic and gravity data, the seismic constraints are used to infer the lithological distribution along the seismic profiles. Based on the striking similarity in velocity structure beneath the corrugated domes with other OCCs and drilling results from Atlantis Massif, we confidently reconfirmed the Southern Dome as dominantly gabbroic rocks, and the Northern Dome as serpentinized peridotites. A series of isolated gabbroic bodies embedded in the diabase and basaltic layers is observed in the breakaway zone, suggesting that the initiation of Dante's Domes OCC occurred over a long period during which there were several failed attempts to form a long‐lived detachment fault. This early development of the OCC probably occurred under a regime of alternating magma starvation and magma replenishment. The predominantly gabbroic section, beneath the Southern Dome and extending to termination, indicates the OCC has been created with relatively high magma flux. We also imaged distinct shallow subseafloor reflections which are also termed as D reflectors underneath the corrugated domes. The location of the D reflectors is similar to those in the Atlantis Massif, with depths well correlated with the top of exhumed gabbroic bodies and the discontinuities in the D reflectors between gabbroic bodies. Our findings contribute to the understanding of processes controlling the OCCs initiation and evolution at slow spreading ridges.</jats:p>",

According to the results of the flatwise-compression test, it was revealed that some factors, including height and angle of the core, the weight percentage of nanographene, and polyurethane foam, can be considered as effective parameters to enhance the compressive strength of the composite sandwich beams. Scanning electron microscopy images were utilized to observe the composition and distribution of the nanoparticles. It was observed that adding nanographene particles to the composite laminates significantly affects the mechanical properties and flexural strength of the sandwich beams.

However, smaller feature sizes, higher dimensional accuracy, and more stringent requirements for cavity surface roughness and edge radius make it difficult to manufacture terahertz waveguide cavities with a high operating frequency by using existing micro-manufacturing technology. At the same time, the smaller feature size also makes it more difficult to realize uniform metallization on the inner surface of a terahertz waveguide cavity.

The effects of the electric field, laser pulse energy, temperature, and light intensity pattern on the photocharge transport process were investigated systematically. The results indicate that some peculiar features, such as high photosensitivity, relatively large mobility, and negative conductivity anisotropy, were present in the studied soft-matter system. Furthermore, a coupling between the optically induced grating and electrically induced convection was observed, which revealed a competitive state between them via the transport process. Thus, a better understanding of the carrier transport process involving photosensitivity and response time will help to tailor LC devices toward novel optical applications.</jats:p>",

The UPR reprograms gene expression to promote adaptation to chronic ER stress. The UPR comprises an acute phase involving inhibition of bulk protein synthesis and a chronic phase of transcriptional induction coupled with the partial recovery of protein synthesis. However, the role of transcriptional regulation in the acute phase of the UPR is not well understood. Here we analyzed the fate of newly synthesized mRNA encoding the protective and homeostatic transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) during this acute phase. We have previously shown that global translational repression induced by the acute UPR was characterized by decreased translation and increased stability of <jats:italic>XBP1</jats:italic> mRNA. We demonstrate here that this stabilization is independent of new transcription. In contrast, we show <jats:italic>XBP1</jats:italic> mRNA newly synthesized during the acute phase accumulates with long poly(A) tails and escapes translational repression. Inhibition of newly synthesized RNA polyadenylation during the acute phase decreased cell survival with no effect in unstressed cells. Furthermore, during the chronic phase of the UPR, levels of <jats:italic>XBP1</jats:italic> mRNA with long poly(A) tails decreased in a manner consistent with co-translational deadenylation. Finally, additional pro-survival, transcriptionally-induced mRNAs show similar regulation, supporting the broad significance of the pre-steady state UPR in translational control during ER stress. We conclude that the biphasic regulation of poly(A) tail length during the UPR represents a previously unrecognized pro-survival mechanism of mammalian gene regulation.</jats:p>"

The behavioral trajectory of this model, particularly relating to spatial learning and memory, has yet to be fully characterized. The current experiment evaluated spatial working and reference memory performance, as well as several physiological markers of health, at 3 key age points in female TgF344-AD rats: 6-months, 9-months, and 12-months. At 6 months of age, indications of working and reference memory impairments were observed in transgenic (Tg) rats on the water radial-arm maze, a complex task that requires working and reference memory simultaneously; at 12 months old, Tg impairments were observed for two working memory measures on this task. Notably, no impairments were observed at the 9-month timepoint on this maze. For the Morris maze, a measure of spatial reference memory, Tg rats demonstrated significant impairment relative to wildtype (WT) controls at all 3 age-points.

The effects of the core–shell ratio of PB‐g‐PS graft copolymer and matrix composition on the mechanical properties, micromorphology, and deformation mechanism of the blends are investigated. The results show that the synthesized PB‐g‐PS graft copolymer has extremely high toughening efficiency. The blends with high toughness and excellent processability can be prepared by introducing it and PS into PPO at the same time, and then obtain better end‐use properties and broaden the applications. With the increase of the core‐shell ratio of PB‐g‐PS graft copolymer, the rubber particles gradually gather in the matrix. With an increase of PPO content in the matrix, the rubber particles gradually become uniformly dispersed, the impact strength and yield strength of the blends gradually increase, the coarseness of the impact fracture surface of the blends gradually increase, and massive elongated cavities appear. The blends undergo a brittle ductile transition, and its deformation mechanism change from the initial cracking to shear yielding.</jats:p>",

Among total flavonoids from soybean leaves (SLs), the abundant flavonols (83.6%) were primarily composed of di- and tri- glycosides combined to the aglycones (K, kaempferol; Q, quercetin; I, isorhamnetin). Particularly, K-rich SLs (yellow coated seed), Nongrim 51 (breeding line) and YJ208-1 (landrace) contained mainly kaempferol 3-<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>-(2″-<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>-glucosyl-6″-<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>-rhamnosyl)galactoside and 3-<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>-(2″,6″-di-<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>-rhamnosyl)galactoside, and were expected to be superior cultivars by their higher flavonoids. Besides, the new tri-I-glycosides (soyanins I–V) were presented as predominant components in Junyeorikong (landrace, black). Thus, this study suggest that the SLs can be considered as valuable edible resources due to their rich flavonoids. Also, these detailed profiles will support breeding of superior varieties with excellent biological activities as well as relationship with seed anthocyanins production, and contribute to perform metabolomics approach to investigate the changes of SLs flavonols during the leaf growth and fermentation in further research.</jats:p>"

Here, we determined that gelsolins (2DGels) from Lokiarchaeota (Loki) and Heimdallarchaeota (Heim) are capable of regulating eukaryotic actin dynamics in vitro and when expressed in eukaryotic cells. The actin filament severing and capping, and actin monomer sequestering, functionalities of 2DGels are strictly calcium controlled. We determined the X-ray structures of Heim and Loki 2DGels bound actin monomers. Each structure possesses common and distinct calcium-binding sites. Loki2DGel has an unusual WH2-like motif (LVDV) between its two gelsolin domains, in which the aspartic acid coordinates a calcium ion at the interface with actin. We conclude that the calcium-regulated actin cytoskeleton predates eukaryogenesis and emerged in the predecessors of the last common ancestor of Loki, Heim and Thorarchaeota.</jats:p>"

EV‐associated proteins purified by ultracentrifugation and affinity columns underwent proteomic analysis to identify novel PDAC markers G protein‐coupled receptor class C group 5 member C (GPRC5C) and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8). To verify the potency of GPRC5C‐ or EPS8‐positive EVs as PDAC biomarkers, we analyzed EVs from PDAC patient blood samples using ultracentrifugation in two different cohorts (a total of 54 PDAC patients, 32 healthy donors, and 22 pancreatitis patients) by immunoblotting. The combination of EV‐associated GPRC5C and EPS8 had high accuracy, with area under the curve values of 0.922 and 0.946 for distinguishing early‐stage PDAC patients from healthy controls in the two cohorts, respectively, and could detect PDAC patients who were negative for CA19‐9. Moreover, we analyzed 30 samples taken at three time points from 10 PDAC patients who underwent surgery: before surgery, after surgery, and recurrence as an early‐stage model. These proteins were detected in EVs derived from preoperative and recurrence samples. These results indicated that GPRC5C‐ or EPS8‐positive EVs were biomarkers that have the potential to detect stage I early pancreatic cancer and small recurrent tumors detected by computed tomography.</jats:p>",

This 651 m ice core is one of the main targets of the WACSWAIN (WArm Climate Stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet in the last INterglacial) project. A present-day accumulation rate of 13.5 cm w.e. yr−1 was derived. Although the project mainly aims to investigate the last interglacial (115–130 ka), a robust chronology period covering the recent past is needed to constrain the age models for the deepest ice. Additionally, this time period is important for understanding current climatic changes in the West Antarctic region. Here, we present a stratigraphic chronology for the top 184.14 m of the Skytrain ice core based on absolute age tie points interpolated using annual layer counting encompassing the last 2000 years of climate history. Together with a model-based depth–age relationship of the deeper part of the ice core, this will form the ST22 chronology. The chemical composition, dust content, liquid conductivity, water isotope concentration and methane content of the whole core was analysed via continuous flow analysis (CFA) at the British Antarctic Survey. Annual layer counting was performed by manual counting of seasonal variations in mainly the sodium and calcium records. This counted chronology was informed and anchored by absolute age tie points, namely, the tritium peak (1965 CE) and six volcanic eruptions. Methane concentration variations were used to further constrain the counting error. A minimal error of ±1 year at the tie points was derived, accumulating to ± 5 %–10 % of the age in the unconstrained sections between tie points. This level of accuracy enables data interpretation on at least decadal timescales and provides a solid base for the dating of deeper ice, which is the second part of the chronology.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under healthy conditions, the pancreas responds to a glucose challenge by releasing insulin. Insulin suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby decreasing plasma glycerol concentration, and it regulates plasma glucose concentration through action in muscle and liver. Insulin resistance (IR) occurs when more insulin is required to achieve the same effects, and IR may be tissue-specific. IR emerges during puberty as a result of high concentrations of growth hormone and is worsened by youth-onset obesity. Adipose, liver, and muscle tissue exhibit distinct dose-dependent responses to insulin in multi-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic (HE) clamps, but the HE clamp protocol does not address potential differences in the dynamics of tissue-specific insulin responses. Changes to the dynamics of insulin responses would alter glycemic control in response to a glucose challenge. To investigate the dynamics of insulin acting on adipose tissue, we developed a novel differential-equations based model that describes the coupled dynamics of glycerol concentrations and insulin action during an oral glucose tolerance test in female adolescents with obesity and IR. We compared these dynamics to the dynamics of insulin acting on muscle and liver as assessed with the oral minimal model applied to glucose and insulin data collected under the same protocol. We found that the action of insulin on glycerol peaks approximately 67 min earlier (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.001) and follows the dynamics of plasma insulin more closely compared to insulin action on glucose as assessed by the parameters representing the time constants for insulin action on glucose and glycerol (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that the dynamics of insulin action show tissue-specific differences in our IR adolescent population, with adipose tissue responding to insulin more quickly compared to muscle and liver. Improved understanding of the tissue-specific dynamics of insulin action may provide novel insights into the progression of metabolic disease in patient populations with diverse metabolic phenotypes.</jats:p>"

Experimental approach: We sought to develop a\nresearch-based, globally relevant list of core concepts that all\nstudents completing a foundational pharmacology course should master.\nThis two-part project consisted of exploratory and refinement phases.\nThe exploratory phase involved empirical data mining of the introductory\nsections of five key textbooks, in parallel with an online survey of\nover 200 pharmacology educators from 17 countries across six continents.\nThe refinement phase involved three Delphi rounds involving 24 experts\nfrom 15 countries across six continents. Key Results: The exploratory\nphase resulted in a consolidated list of 74 candidate core concepts. In\nthe refinement phase, the expert group produced a consensus list of 25\ncore concepts of pharmacology. Conclusion and Implications: This list\nwill allow pharmacology educators everywhere to focus their efforts on\nthe conceptual knowledge perceived to matter most by experts within the\ndiscipline.

The Virginia-Carolina (VC) region (Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina) is an important peanut-growing region of the U.S and is affected by numerous biotic and abiotic stresses. Identification of stress-resistant germplasm, along with improved phenotyping methods, are important steps toward developing improved cultivars. Our objective in 2017 and 2018 was to assess the U.S. mini-core collection for desirable traits, a valuable source for resistant germplasm under limited water conditions. Accessions were evaluated using traditional and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) techniques, and the suitability of HTP methods as indirect selection tools was assessed. Traditional phenotyping methods included stand count, plant height, lateral branch growth, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), canopy temperature depression (CTD), leaf wilting, fungal and viral disease, thrips rating, post-digging in-shell sprouting, and pod yield. The HTP method included 48 aerial vegetation indices (VIs), which were derived using red, blue, green, and near-infrared reflectance; color space indices were collected using an octocopter drone at the same time, with traditional phenotyping. Both phenotypings were done 10 times between 4 and 16 weeks after planting. Accessions had yields comparable to high yielding checks. Correlation coefficients up to 0.8 were identified for several Vis, with yield indicating their suitability for indirect phenotyping. Broad-sense heritability (H2) was further calculated to assess the suitability of particular VIs to enable genetic gains. VIs could be used successfully as surrogates for the physiological and agronomic trait selection in peanuts. Further, this study indicates that UAV-based sensors have potential for measuring physiologic and agronomic characteristics measured for peanut breeding, variable rate input application, real time decision making, and precision agriculture applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Nitrate in Antarctic snow has seasonal cycles in its nitrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios that reflect its sources and atmospheric formation processes, and as a result, nitrate archived in Antarctic ice should have great potential to record atmospheric chemistry changes over thousands of years. However, sunlight that strikes the snow surface results in photolytic nitrate loss and isotopic fractionation that can completely obscure the nitrate’s original isotopic values. To gain insight into how photolysis overwrites the seasonal atmospheric cycles, we collected 244 snow samples along a 850 km transect of East Antarctica during the 2013–2014 CHICTABA traverse. The CHICTABA route’s limited elevation change, consistent distance between the coast and the high interior plateau, and intermediate accumulation rates offered a gentle environmental gradient ideal for studying the competing pre- and post-depositional influences on archived nitrate isotopes. We find that nitrate isotopes in snow along the transect are indeed notably modified by photolysis after deposition, and drier sites have more intense photolytic impacts. Still, an imprint of the original seasonal cycles of atmospheric nitrate isotopes is still present in the top 1–2 m of the snowpack and likely preserved through archiving in glacial ice at these sites. Despite this preservation, reconstructing past atmospheric values from archived nitrate along CHICTABA and in similar transitional regions remains a difficult challenge without having an independent proxy for photolytic loss to correct for post-depositional isotopic changes. Nevertheless, nitrate isotopes should function as a proxy for snow accumulation rate in such regions if multiple years of deposition are aggregated to remove the seasonal cycles, and this application can prove highly valuable in its own right.\n                        </jats:p>"

Revealing ecological stability of belowground organisms is key to developing management strategies that maintain agricultural ecosystem services in a changing world. Here, we collected soils from adjacent pairs of maize and rice fields along large spatial scale across Eastern and Southeast China to investigate the importance of core microbiota as a predictor of resistance of soil microbiome (e.g. bacteria, fungi and protist) to climate changes and nutrient fertilization, and their effect on multiple ecosystem functions, representing key services for crop growth and health in agro‐ecosystems. Soil microbiome in maize soils exhibited stronger resistance than that in rice soils, by considering multiple aspects of the resistance index, for example, community, phylogenetic conservation and network complexity. Community resistance of soil microbiome showed a geographic pattern, with higher resistance at lower latitudes, suggesting their stronger resistance in warmer regions. Particularly, we highlighted the role of core phylotypes in enhancing the community resistance of soil microbiome, which was essential for the maintenance of multifunctionality in agricultural ecosystems. Our results represent a significant advance in linking core phylotypes to community resistance and ecosystem functions, and therefore forecasting agro‐ecosystems dynamics in response to ongoing environmental changes. These suggest that core phylotypes should be considered a key factor in enhancing agricultural sustainability and crop productivity under global change scenarios.</jats:p>",

To investigate the c-MYBPC3 HCM-related cardiac impairment, we generated a zebrafish mypbc3-knockout model. These knockout zebrafish displayed significant morphological heart alterations related to a significant decrease in ventricular and atrial diameters at systolic and diastolic states at the larval stages. Immunofluorescence staining revealed significant hyperplasia in the mutant’s total cardiac and ventricular cardiomyocytes. Although cardiac contractility was similar to the wild-type control, the ejection fraction was significantly increased in the mypbc3 mutants. At later stages of larval development, the mutants demonstrated an early cardiac phenotype of myocardium remodeling, concurrent cardiomyocyte hyperplasia, and increased ejection fraction as critical processes in HCM initiation to counteract the increased ventricular myocardial wall stress. The examination of zebrafish adults showed a thickened ventricular cardiac wall with reduced heart rate, swimming speed, and endurance ability in both the mypbc3 heterozygous and homozygous groups. Furthermore, heart transcriptome profiling showed a significant downregulation of the actin-filament-based process, indicating an impaired actin cytoskeleton organization as the main dysregulating factor associated with the early ventricular cardiac hypertrophy in the zebrafish mypbc3 HCM model.</jats:p>"

The positive or negative topological charge is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise twist direction, indicating that the helical phase of the OAM can be controlled by the twist orientation. Compared with other fiber-based methods, the high-order OAM modes generated by our approach have the characteristics of low loss (minimum 0.3 dB), high mode purity (maximum 98%), and simple fabrication.

The protein leverage hypothesis proposes an inverse relationship between dietary protein levels and obesity development (low protein promoting high obesity), although the majority of laboratory studies have utilized a design modulating the protein amount within a single dietary protein source composition. We investigated whether varying the levels of dietary protein amount and sources would have impacts on growth and body composition using the Zebrafish Danio rerio model. At 28 d postfertilization, Zebrafish were fed 1 of 12 dietary treatments for 12 weeks. Diets contained different protein sources (fish protein hydrolysate [FPH], soy protein isolate [SOY], casein [CAS], or a mixture of all three sources including wheat gluten [MIX]). Sources were formulated at three protein concentrations (18, 33, or 48% as fed, substituted with wheat starch for caloric balance). Body length, height, and weight were measured over time and at termination. Contributions of macronutrients to growth and body fat outcomes were estimated by LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression. Male and female length, height, and weight increased significantly in response to increasing dietary protein. Male and female fish fed SOY or FPH had the highest amount of body lipid at all protein concentrations relative to those fed CAS or MIX. Relative body lipid was highest in fish that were fed the lowest protein concentration. These data suggest an important role of macronutrient balances, including dietary protein amount and source, in relation to the protein: energy (carbohydrate and lipid) ratio on growth and body composition outcomes. These outcomes may ultimately reflect metabolic alterations that can lead to confounding interpretations of health and disease status. Furthermore, these data reinforce the need to consider and report dietary composition in establishing rigorous and reproducible nutritional guidelines for Zebrafish.</jats:p>",

Although deep learning methods have been proposed to diagnose POAG, it remains challenging to develop a robust and explainable algorithm to automatically facilitate the downstream diagnostic tasks. In this study, we present an automated classification algorithm, GlaucomaNet, to identify POAG using variable fundus photographs from different populations and settings. GlaucomaNet consists of two convolutional neural networks to simulate the human grading process: learning the discriminative features and fusing the features for grading. We evaluated GlaucomaNet on two datasets: Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) participants and the Large-scale Attention-based Glaucoma (LAG) dataset. GlaucomaNet achieved the highest AUC of 0.904 and 0.997 for POAG diagnosis on OHTS and LAG datasets. An ensemble of network architectures further improved diagnostic accuracy. By simulating the human grading process, GlaucomaNet demonstrated high accuracy with increased transparency in POAG diagnosis (comprehensiveness scores of 97% and 36%). These methods also address two well-known challenges in the field: the need for increased image data diversity and relying heavily on perimetry for POAG diagnosis. These results highlight the potential of deep learning to assist and enhance clinical POAG diagnosis.

In solution, the blue monomer emission of the luminophore is largely quenched and a faint reddish‐orange emission originating from a charge‐transfer (CT) complex is observed. A polyurethane elastomer containing the mechanophore displays orange emission in the absence of force, which is dominated by the CT‐emission. Mechanical deformation causes a decrease of the CT‐emission and an increase of blue monomer emission, due to the spatial separation between the luminophore and quencher.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Insoluble particles in ice cores record signatures of past climate parameters like vegetation, volcanic activity or aridity. Their analytical detection depends on intensive bench microscopy investigation and requires dedicated sample preparation steps. Both are laborious, require in-depth knowledge and often restrict sampling strategies. To help overcome these limitations, we present a framework based on Flow Imaging Microscopy coupled to a deep neural network for autonomous image classification of ice core particles. We train the network to classify 7 commonly found classes: mineral dust, felsic and basaltic volcanic ash (tephra), three species of pollen (Corylus avellana, Quercus robur, Quercus suber) and contamination particles that may be introduced onto the ice core surface during core handling operations. The trained network achieves 96.8 % classification accuracy at test time. We present the system’s potentials and limitations with respect to the detection of mineral dust, pollen grains and tephra shards, using both controlled materials and real ice core samples. The methodology requires little sample material, is non destructive, fully reproducible and does not require any sample preparation step. The presented framework can bolster research in the field, by cutting down processing time, supporting human-operated microscopy and further unlocking the paleoclimate potential of ice core records by providing the opportunity to identify an array of ice core particles. Suggestions for an improved system to be deployed within a continuous flow analysis workflow are also presented.\n                        </jats:p>"

In this work, we aimed to characterize MSLN glycans from PaC cells and serum samples to assess their potential usefulness as PaC biomarkers. First, we analyzed MSLN glycans from PaC cell lines and then we developed an enzyme-linked lectin assay to measure core fucosylated-MSLN (Cf-MSLN) glycoforms. MSLN glycans from PaC cells were analyzed by glycan sequencing and through Western blotting with lectins. All of the cell lines secreted MSLN, with its three N-glycosylation sites occupied by complex-type N-glycans, which were mainly α2,3-sialylated, core fucosylated and highly branched. The Cf-MSLN glycoforms were quantified on PaC serum samples, and compared with MSLN protein levels. The Cf-MSLN was significantly decreased in PaC patients compared to control sera, while no differences were detected by using MSLN protein levels. In conclusion, Cf-MSLN glycoforms were differently expressed in PaC, which opens the way to further investigate their usefulness as PaC biomarkers.</jats:p>"

Seagrass‐associated microbiota support host health, yet the ecological processes that maintain biodiversity and stability of the seagrass leaf microbiota are poorly understood. We tested two hypotheses: (1) Microbes select seagrass leaves as habitat such that they consistently host distinct microbiota and/or core taxa in comparison to nearby substrates, and (2) seagrass leaf microbiota are stable once established and are resistant to change when transplanted to a novel environment. We reciprocally transplanted replicate seagrass shoots (natural and surface sterilized/dead tissue treatments) among four meadows with different environmental conditions and deployed artificial seagrass treatments in all four meadows. At the end of the 5‐day experiment, the established microbiota on natural seagrass partially turned over to resemble microbial communities in the novel meadow, and all experimental treatments hosted distinct surface microbiota. We consistently found that natural and sterilized/dead seagrass hosted more methanol‐utilizing bacteria compared to artificial seagrass and water, suggesting that seagrass core microbiota are shaped by taxa that metabolize seagrass exudates coupled with minor roles for host microbial defence and/or host‐directed recruitment. We found evidence that the local environment strongly influenced the seagrass leaf microbiota in natural meadows and that transplant location explained more variation than experimental treatment. Transplanting resulted in high turnover and variability of the seagrass leaf microbiota, suggesting that it is flexibly assembled in a wide array of environmental conditions which may contribute to resilience of seagrass in future climate change scenarios.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of endogenous metabolites in saliva can be altered based on the systemic condition of the hosts and may, in theory, serve as a reflection of systemic disease progression. Hemoglobin A1C is used clinically to measure long-term average glycemic control. The aim of the study was to demonstrate if there were differences in the salivary metabolic profiles between well and poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 subjects with diabetes. Subjects and Methods. Subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were enrolled (n = 40). The subjects were assigned to phenotypic groups based on their current level of A1C: &lt;7 = well-controlled and &gt;7 = poorly controlled. Demographic data, age, gender, and ethnicity, were used to match the two phenotypic groups. Whole saliva samples were collected and immediately stored at −80°C. Samples were spiked using an isotopically labeled internal standard and analyzed by UPLC-TOF-MS using a Waters SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer. Results. Unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares regression discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to define unique metabolomic profiles associated with well and poorly controlled diabetes based on A1C levels. Conclusion. OPLS-DA demonstrates good separation of well and poorly controlled in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This provides evidence for developing saliva-based monitoring tools for diabetes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Jumonji domain–containing protein JMJD6 is a 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase associated with a broad range of biological functions. Cellular studies have implicated the enzyme in chromatin biology, transcription, DNA repair, mRNA splicing, and cotranscriptional processing. Although not all studies agree, JMJD6 has been reported to catalyze both hydroxylation of lysine residues and demethylation of arginine residues. However, despite extensive study and indirect evidence for JMJD6 catalysis in many cellular processes, direct assignment of JMJD6 catalytic substrates has been limited. Examination of a reported site of proline hydroxylation within a lysine-rich region of the tandem bromodomain protein BRD4 led us to conclude that hydroxylation was in fact on lysine and catalyzed by JMJD6. This prompted a wider search for JMJD6-catalyzed protein modifications deploying mass spectrometric methods designed to improve the analysis of such lysine-rich regions. Using lysine derivatization with propionic anhydride to improve the analysis of tryptic peptides and nontryptic proteolysis, we report 150 sites of JMJD6-catalyzed lysine hydroxylation on 48 protein substrates, including 19 sites of hydroxylation on BRD4. Most hydroxylations were within lysine-rich regions that are predicted to be unstructured; in some, multiple modifications were observed on adjacent lysine residues. Almost all of the JMJD6 substrates defined in these studies have been associated with membraneless organelle formation. Given the reported roles of lysine-rich regions in subcellular partitioning by liquid–liquid phase separation, our findings raise the possibility that JMJD6 may play a role in regulating such processes in response to stresses, including hypoxia.</jats:p>",

Here, we report a cyclophane‐based supramolecular mechanophore that contains a 1,6‐bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophore and a pyromellitic diimide quencher. In solution, the blue monomer emission of the luminophore is largely quenched and a faint reddish‐orange emission originating from a charge‐transfer (CT) complex is observed. A polyurethane elastomer containing the mechanophore displays orange emission in the absence of force, which is dominated by the CT‐emission. Mechanical deformation causes a decrease of the CT‐emission and an increase of blue monomer emission, due to the spatial separation between the luminophore and quencher. The ratio of the two emission intensities correlates with the applied stress.</jats:p>",

The efficiency, <jats:italic>η</jats:italic>, is defined as the increase in the internal core energy divided by the energy of the heating laser. Six beams (output of 1.6 kJ) from the GEKKO XII (GXII) green laser system at the Institute of Laser Engineering (ILE), Osaka University were applied to implode a spherical deuterated polystyrene (CD) shell target to form a dense core. The DD-reacted protons and the core x-ray emissions showed a core density of 2.8 ± 0.7 g cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, or 2.6 times the solid density. Furthermore, DD-reacted thermal neutrons were utilized to estimate the core temperature between 600 and 750 eV. Thereafter, the core was directly heated by a laser for fast-ignition experiments (LFEX, an extremely energetic ultrashort pulse laser) at ILE with its axis lying along or perpendicular to the GXII bundle axis, respectively. The former and latter laser configurations were termed ‘axial’ and ‘transverse modes’, respectively.

The results indicated that LCF crack damage displayed different sensitivity to cyclic stress. LCF microcracks initiated from slip bands and propagated through the microcrack coalescences at high stress, while LCF cracks tended to initiate at the αL/β interface and connect with these interface microcracks. Furthermore, the LCF damage model was established on the basis of Lemaitre damage theory. When the maximum stress exceeded yield stress, LCF damage increased sharply and fatigue life decreased significantly, which agreed with experiment data.</jats:p>"

In BLCA, however, GPX2 correlated more strongly than Nrf2 signatures with decreased infiltration of multiple leukocyte subtypes. GPX2 inversely correlated with expression of multiple pro- inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and NF-kB activation in cell lines and knockdown of GPX2 led to increased secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-6. Conversely, GPX2 overexpression led to reduced PGE2 production in a murine OCSCC model (MOC1).

The sensing test results showed that the sensor based on 1 at% Ni-doped ZnO exhibited the best toluene sensing performance. The response was up to 210 to 100 ppm toluene at 325 °C. The sensor exhibited high selectivity, fast response/recovery characteristics (2/77 s), and low detection limit (500 ppb, 3.5). Furthermore, we carried out molecular-level research on the sensitive material prepared in this experiment by various characterization methods. The SEM characterization results showed that ZnO and Ni-doped ZnO possessed the core-shell morphology, and the average grain size decreased with the increase in the Ni doping content. The UV–Vis test showed that the band gap of ZnO became smaller with the increase in the Ni doping amount. The enhanced toluene sensing performance of 1 at% Ni-doped ZnO could be ascribed to the structural sensitization and Ni doping sensitization, which are discussed in detail in the sensing mechanism section.</jats:p>"

In rodent models, females typically consume more ethanol (EtOH) than males. Here, we used the four core genotypes (FCG) mouse model to investigate the influence of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome complement on EtOH drinking behaviours. FCG mice were given access to escalating concentrations of EtOH in a two‐bottle, 24‐h continuous access drinking paradigm to assess consumption and preference. Relapse‐like behaviour was measured by assessing escalated intake following repeated cycles of deprivation and re‐exposure. Twenty‐four‐hour EtOH consumption was greater in mice with ovaries (<jats:italic>Sry</jats:italic>−), relative to those with testes, and in mice with the XX chromosome complement, relative to those with XY sex chromosomes. EtOH preference was higher in XX versus XY mice. For both consumption and preference, the influences of the <jats:italic>Sry</jats:italic> gene and sex chromosomes were concentration dependent. Escalated intake following repeated cycles of deprivation and re‐exposure emerged only in XX mice (vs. XY). Mice with ovaries (<jats:italic>Sry</jats:italic>− FCG mice and C57BL/6J females) were also found to consume more water than mice with testes. These results demonstrate that aspects of EtOH drinking behaviour may be independently regulated by sex hormones and chromosomes and inform our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms which contribute to EtOH dependence in male and female mice. Future investigation of the contribution of sex chromosomes to EtOH drinking behaviours is warranted. We used the FCG mouse model to investigate the influence of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome complement on EtOH drinking behaviours, including the alcohol deprivation effect.

Amidst concerns of radiological terrorism, there are institutional initiatives to replace radionuclide sources with lower energy X-ray sources. As researchers transition, questions remain regarding whether the biological effects of γ-rays may be recapitulated with orthovoltage X-rays because different energies may induce divergent biological effects. We therefore sought to compare the effects of orthovoltage X-rays with 1-mm Cu or Thoraeus filtration and 137Cs γ-rays using mouse models of acute radiation syndrome. Following whole-body irradiation, 30-day overall survival was assessed, and the lethal dose to provoke 50% mortality within 30-days (LD50) was calculated by logistic regression. LD50 doses were 6.7 Gy, 7.4 Gy, and 8.1 Gy with 1-mm Cu-filtered X-rays, Thoraeus-filtered X-rays, and 137Cs γ-rays, respectively. Comparison of bone marrow, spleen, and intestinal tissue from mice irradiated with equivalent doses indicated that injury was most severe with 1-mm Cu-filtered X-rays, which resulted in the greatest reduction in bone marrow cellularity, hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations, intestinal crypts, and OLFM4+ intestinal stem cells. Thoraeus-filtered X-rays provoked an intermediate phenotype, with 137Cs showing the least damage. This study reveals a dichotomy between physical dose and biological effect as researchers transition to orthovoltage X-rays. With decreasing energy, there is increasing hematopoietic and intestinal injury, necessitating dose reduction to achieve comparable biological effects.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Understanding the significance of physical dose delivered using energetically different methods of radiation treatment will aid the transition from radionuclide γ-irradiators to orthovoltage X-irradiators.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

We established a paradigm that links/separates context-dependent memories according to geometrical similarities. Mice exploring one of four contexts 1 d before undergoing contextual fear conditioning in a square context showed a gradual fear transfer to preexposed geometrically relevant contexts the next day, but not after 15 min. Anterior cingulate cortex neurons representing relevant, rather than distinct, memories were significantly coreactivated during postconditioning sleep only, before their selective integration the next day during testing. Disrupting sleep coreactivations prevented assimilation while preserving recent memory consolidation. Thus, assimilating pertinent memories during sleep through coreactivation of their respective engrams represents the neural underpinnings of sleep-triggered implicit cortical learning.</jats:p>",

The cluster analysis is used to divide clusters and expand the weight of failed execution and added to suspicious in the process of degree evaluation to troubleshoot multiple errors.

Full plastome sequences from the highly diverse (&amp;gt;1,500 spp.) subfamily Tillandsioideae (Bromeliaceae, Poales) have been published for only three (i.e., <jats:italic>Guzmania</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Tillandsia</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Vriesea</jats:italic>) out of 22 currently recognized genera. Here, we focus on core Tillandsioideae, a clade within subfamily Tillandsioideae, and explore the contribution of individual plastid markers and data categories to inform deep divergences of a plastome phylogeny. We generated 37 high quality plastome assemblies and performed a comparative analysis in terms of plastome structure, size, gene content and order, GC content, as well as number and type of repeat motifs. Using the obtained phylogenetic context, we reconstructed the evolution of these plastome attributes and assessed if significant shifts on the evolutionary traits’ rates have occurred in the evolution of the core Tillandsioideae. Our results agree with previously published phylogenetic hypotheses based on plastid data, providing stronger statistical support for some recalcitrant nodes. However, phylogenetic discordance with previously published nuclear marker-based hypotheses was found. Several plastid markers that have been consistently used to address phylogenetic relationships within Tillandsioideae were highly informative for the retrieved plastome phylogeny and further loci are here identified as promising additional markers for future studies. New lineage-specific plastome rearrangements were found to support recently adopted taxonomic groups, including large inversions, as well as expansions and contractions of the inverted repeats. Evolutionary trait rate shifts associated with changes in size and GC content of the plastome regions were found across the phylogeny of core Tillandsioideae.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) are essential for immune responses and differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells via intermediate progenitors, such as monocyte−DC progenitors (MDPs) and common DC progenitors (CDPs). Upon infection, cDCs are activated and rapidly express host defense-related genes, such as those encoding cytokines and chemokines. Chromatin structures, including nuclear compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs), have been implicated in gene regulation. However, the extent and dynamics of their reorganization during cDC development and activation remain unknown. In this study, we comprehensively determined higher-order chromatin structures by Hi-C in DC progenitors and cDC subpopulations. During cDC differentiation, chromatin activation was initially induced at the MDP stage. Subsequently, a shift from inactive to active nuclear compartments occurred at the cDC gene loci in CDPs, which was followed by increased intra-TAD interactions and loop formation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor IRF8, indispensable for cDC differentiation, mediated chromatin activation and changes into the active compartments in DC progenitors, thereby possibly leading to cDC-specific gene induction. Using an infection model, we found that the chromatin structures of host defense-related gene loci were preestablished in unstimulated cDCs, indicating that the formation of higher-order chromatin structures prior to infection may contribute to the rapid responses to pathogens. Overall, these results suggest that chromatin structure reorganization is closely related to the establishment of cDC-specific gene expression and immune functions. This study advances the fundamental understanding of chromatin reorganization in cDC differentiation and activation.</jats:p>",

The application of blockchain technology in the security field of the Internet of Things can improve security problems, and the blockchain has immutable characteristics. Therefore, it is particularly important to ensure the security of blockchain smart contracts. However, the order of transaction in smart contracts is easy to be operated by miners, and there is a relative lack of tools to detect TOD (transaction-ordering dependent) vulnerabilities. The current smart contract vulnerability detection methods have the problems of low efficiency and low accuracy. Therefore, based on the study of TOD vulnerability principle, this paper creatively highlights a mutation fuzzy testing method EtherFuzz to specifically detect TOD vulnerability in smart contracts. Use the intelligent contract ABI (application binary interface) to generate test cases, test the byte code of the intelligent contract, use TOD to test oracle to detect TOD vulnerabilities, and then, mutate the tested data to generate new test cases. Finally, the behavior of smart contract operation is recorded, and the fuzzy test process is controlled until the vulnerability is detected. The experimental results show that when 987 token contracts are selected as Ethereum test objects, the false-positive rate, detection time overhead, and detection storage overhead of EtherFuzz are reduced by 74.4%, 30.1%, and 28.1%, respectively. Therefore, EtherFuzz has high speed, efficiency, and accuracy in detecting TOD vulnerabilities and has excellent application value.</jats:p>",

The film was synthesized by the sol-gel method, spin coating technique, starting from a precursor solution deposited on a glass substrate in a multilayer process, followed by drying of each deposited layer. Crystalline PbS QDs embedded in the inorganic vitreous host matrix formed a nanocomposite material. Specific investigations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorbance in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis)-near infrared (NIR) domain, NIR luminescence, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the deposited film. The dimensions of the PbS nanocrystallite phase were corroborated by XRD, SEM-EDX, and AFM results. The luminescence band from 1400 nm follows the luminescence peak of the precursor solution and that of the dopant solution.

It is unknown whether IS impairs the efficacy of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: From 1 June 2021, to 31 December 2021, hemodialysis patients (n = 358) and a control group (n = 59) were eligible to receive the first dose of the ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccine. Titer measurements indicative of the humoral response (anti-S1 IgG and surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) results) and indoxyl sulfate concentration measurement were performed 4 weeks after ChAdOx1 vaccine injection. Results: The serum concentrations of anti-S1 IgG were 272 ± 1726 AU/mL and 2111 ± 4424 AU/mL in hemodialysis patients and control group (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. The sVNT values were 26.8 ± 21.1% and 54.0 ± 20.2% in the hemodialysis and control groups (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. There was a decreasing trend for the anti-S1 IgG titer from the lowest to highest quartile of IS (p &lt; 0.001). The patients with higher concentrations of IS had lower sVNT (p for trend &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Hemodialysis patients had weaker humoral immunity after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine.

A data analysis technique for 3D hot-spot reconstruction from experimental observables has been developed to characterize the effects of low modes on 3D hot-spot formations. In nuclear measurements, the effective flow direction, governed by the maximum eigenvalue in the velocity variance of apparent ion temperatures, has been found to agree with the measured hot-spot flows for implosions dominated by mode ℓ=1. Asymmetries in areal-density (ρR) measurements were found to be characterized by a unique cosine variation along the hot-spot flow axis. In x-ray images, a 3D hot-spot x-ray emission tomography method was developed to reconstruct the 3D hot-spot plasma emissivity using a generalized spherical-harmonic Gaussian function. The gradient-descent algorithm was used to optimize the mapping between the projections from the 3D hot-spot emission model and the measured x-ray images along multiple views. This work establishes a platform to analyze 3D low-mode core asymmetries in ICF.</jats:p>",

Bayesian and cluster analysis clustered these germplasms into three groups. The germplasms revealed a high level of admixture between clusters, which indicated a relatively high level of gene exchange between germplasms. The F value (0.124) also showed a moderate genetic differentiation in the breeding population.

Mitochondria lack certain DNA repair processes, which could contribute to polymerase error-induced mutations and increase susceptibility to chemical-induced mtDNA mutagenesis. We conducted error-corrected, ultra-sensitive Duplex Sequencing to investigate the effects of two known nuclear genome mutagens, cadmium and Aflatoxin B1, on germline mtDNA mutagenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Detection of thousands of mtDNA mutations revealed pervasive heteroplasmy in C. elegans and that mtDNA mutagenesis is dominated by C:G → A:T mutations generally attributed to oxidative damage. However, there was no effect of either exposure on mtDNA mutation frequency, spectrum, or trinucleotide context signature despite a significant increase in nuclear mutation rate after aflatoxin B1 exposure. Mitophagy-deficient mutants pink-1 and dct-1 accumulated significantly higher levels of mtDNA damage compared to wild-type C. elegans after exposures. However, there were only small differences in mtDNA mutation frequency, spectrum, or trinucleotide context signature compared to wild-type after 3050 generations, across all treatments. These findings suggest mitochondria harbor additional previously uncharacterized mechanisms that regulate mtDNA mutational processes across generations.</jats:p>",

The present study explores the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the sensitized response to the psychomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine following chronic restraint stress (CRS), emphasizing the differential contribution of both subcompartments of the nucleus accumbens (NA), the core (NAcore) and shell (NAshell), to this phenomenon. Adult male Wistar rats were restrained for 2 h/day for 7 days and, 2 weeks after the last stress exposure (day 21), all animals were randomly assigned to behavioral, biochemical or neurochemical tests. Our results demonstrated that the enduring CRS-induced increase in psychostimulant response to cocaine was paralleled by an increase of extracellular dopamine levels in the NAcore, but not the NAshell, greater than that observed in the non-stress group. Furthermore, we found that CRS induced an impairment of glutamate homeostasis in the NAcore, but not the NAshell. Its hallmarks were increased basal extracellular glutamate concentrations driven by a CRS-induced downregulation of GLT-1, blunted glutamate levels in response to cocaine and postsynaptic structural remodeling in pre-stressed animals. In addition, ceftriaxone, a known GLT-1 enhancer, prevented the CRS-induced GLT-1 downregulation, increased basal extracellular glutamate concentrations and changes in structural plasticity in the NAcore as well as behavioral cross-sensitization to cocaine, emphasizing the biological importance of GLT-1 in the comorbidity between chronic stress exposure and drug abuse. A future perspective concerning the paramount relevance of the stress-induced disruption of glutamate homeostasis as a vulnerability factor to the development of stress and substance use disorders during early life or adulthood of descendants is provided.</jats:p>"

Here, we study the relationship of histogenesis and clonal diversification in GCTs by analysing the genomes and transcriptomes of 547 microdissected histological units. We find no correlation between genomic and histological heterogeneity. However, we identify unifying features including the retention of fetal developmental transcripts across tissues, expression changes on chromosome 12p, and a conserved somatic evolutionary sequence of whole genome duplication followed by clonal diversification. While this pattern is preserved across all GCTs, the developmental timing of the duplication varies between prepubertal and postpubertal cases. In addition, tumours of younger children exhibit distinct substitution signatures which may lend themselves as potential biomarkers for risk stratification. Our findings portray the extensive diversification of GCT tissues and genetic subclones as randomly distributed, while identifying overarching transcriptional and genomic features.</jats:p>"

The complementary TEM and APT analyses have shown that Mg atoms agglomerate at dislocations that bound extended defects. The concentration of Mg is higher at the dislocations with a larger Burgers vector. This indicates that Mg agglomeration is caused by the pressure at the dislocations. Mg concentration in highly Mg-rich regions is 1 at. %, which exceeds the solubility limit of Mg in GaN. We investigated isothermal and isochronal evolution of the defects by TEM, cathodoluminescence analysis, and positron annihilation spectroscopy. The results indicated that the intensity of donor–acceptor pair emission increases with the annealing temperature and duration and reaches a maximum after elimination of the extended defects with highly Mg-rich regions. These results strongly suggest that such extended defects reduce the acceptor formation and that they as well as the previously reported compensating centers, such as N-related vacancies, can inhibit the formation of p-type GaN. The mechanism by which the extended defects reduce acceptor formation is discussed.</jats:p>",

Secondly, we alternately execute Cuckoo Search (CS) and Cauchy mutation to update the positions of the ants to enhance population diversity and accelerate convergence speed. Then, we introduce differential evolution (DE) to mutate the population of antlions to improve the convergence accuracy of our algorithm. We compare IALO with the original ant lion optimizer (ALO) and other algorithms on 9 benchmark functions to verify its effectiveness. Finally, IALO is applied to the coverage optimization in wireless sensor networks. Simulation results show that, compared with previous works, IALO provides higher coverage rate, makes the sensor distribution more uniform, and effectively reduces the deployment cost.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the work using the finite element method, a three-dimensional computer model of the processes of electrothermal treatment of an aluminum core of a power cable in an electric furnace and a thermostat was developed, and the pat-terns of changes in the temperature field in such a core were determined under different modes of implementation of the so-called \"annealing\" processes, that is, the restoration of the necessary electrical properties in it , in particular, an increase in specific electrical conductivity and plasticity. Calculations based on the developed mathematical model and the obtained regularities are consistent with the results of practical measurements of electrical conductivity and plastic-ity of experimental samples of aluminum cores of cables manufactured by YUZHCABLE WORKS, PJSC, Kharkiv. However, the analysis of the patterns of changes in the temperature field in the volume of aluminum cores of cables during their continuous electric heating to the required temperatures of both the outer and inner layers of the core wound on a spool showed that the difference in their temperatures can exceed 500 С. Such nonuniformity of the tem-perature field of the core and long-term overheating of its outer layers leads to unacceptable losses of electricity and reduces the positive result of the processes of such heat treatment of the core, in particular, regarding the increase of its electrical conductivity. It is substantiated that in order to reduce the loss of electricity and the nonuniformity of the temperature field in the aluminum core, it is necessary to reduce the duration of electric heating of the aluminum core to the temperature of its upper layers, necessary for annealing, and then move the drum with such a core to a thermo-stat without electronic heating elements. In such a thermostat, the temperature of the outer layers will decrease, and the temperature of the inner layers will continue to increase. The work shows that after some time (≈ 60 min), the tempera-ture distribution in the core will become almost uniform, and the total losses of electricity and the nonuniformity of the temperature field in the volume of the core will become smaller. Based on the results of the calculations, recommenda-tions were developed for the selection of appropriate modes of heat treatment of aluminum cores wound on a spool, with acceptable energy consumption and overheating of the upper layers of the core.

Research on the activation conditions, functions, and the interactions between key elements in A. citrulli T6SS is lacking. Hcp (Hemolysin co-regulated protein) is both a structural protein and a secretion protein of T6SS, which makes it a special element. The aims of this study were to determine the role of Hcp and its activated conditions to reveal the functions of T6SS. In virulence and colonization assays of hcp deletion mutant strain Δhcp, tssm (type VI secretion system membrane subunit) deletion mutant strain Δtssm and double mutant ΔhcpΔtssm, population growth was affected but not virulence after injection of cotyledons and seed-to-seedling transmission on watermelon. The population growth of Δhcp and Δtssm were lower than A. citrulli wild type strain Aac5 of A. citrulli group II at early stage but higher at a later stage. Deletion of hcp also affected growth ability in different culture media, and the decline stage of Δhcp was delayed in KB medium. Biofilm formation ability of Δhcp, Δtssm and ΔhcpΔtssm was lower than Aac5 with competition by prey bacteria but higher in KB and M9-Fe3+ medium. Deletion of hcp reduced the competition and survival ability of Aac5. Based on the results of Western blotting and qRT-PCR analyses, Hcp is activated by cell density, competition, ferric irons, and the host plant. The expression levels of genes related to bacterial secretion systems, protein export, and several other pathways, were significantly changed in the Δhcp mutant compared to Aac5 when T6SS was activated at high cell density. Based on transcriptome data, we found that a few candidate effectors need further identification. The phenotypes, activated conditions and transcriptome data all supported the conclusion that although there is only one T6SS gene cluster present in the A. citrulli group II strain Aac5, it related to multiple biological processes, including colonization, growth ability, competition and biofilm formation.</jats:p>"

Immune surveillance of EBV-infected cells by cytotoxic CD4+ T cells has been recognized; however, the molecular mechanism of generating cytotoxic effector T cells of the CD4+ subset remains poorly understood. Here we compared phenotypic features and the transcriptome of EBV-specific effector-memory CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in mice and found that both T cell types show cytotoxicity and, to our surprise, widely similar gene expression patterns relating to cytotoxicity. Similar to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, EBV-specific cytotoxic CD4+ T cells from human peripheral blood expressed T-bet, Granzyme B, and Perforin and upregulated the degranulation marker, CD107a, immediately after restimulation. Furthermore, T-bet expression in cytotoxic CD4+ T cells was highly correlated with Granzyme B and Perforin expression at the protein level. Thus, differentiation of EBV-specific cytotoxic CD4+ T cells is possibly controlled by mechanisms shared by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. T-bet-mediated transcriptional regulation may explain the similarity of cytotoxic effector differentiation between CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, implicating that this differentiation pathway may be directed by environmental input rather than T cell subset.</jats:p>"

Patients affected by the most severe transfusion‐dependent form of the disease (TDT) require lifelong blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy, a symptomatic treatment associated with several complications. Other therapeutic opportunities are available, but none is fully effective and/or applicable to all patients, calling for the identification of novel strategies. Transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) balances red blood cells production according to iron availability, being an activator of the iron‐regulatory hormone hepcidin in the liver and a modulator of erythropoietin signaling in erythroid cells.

Here, using a genetic method to manipulate network activity in a stage-specific manner, we demonstrated that network activity contributes to callosal axon projections in the mouse visual cortex during a ‘critical period’: restoring neuronal activity during that period resumed the projections, whereas restoration after the period failed. Furthermore, in vivo Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> imaging revealed that the projections could be established even without fully restoring highly synchronous activity.

Mechanistically, compound 4e promoted cell death by apoptosis in the OSCC cell, and molecular docking studies suggested this compound possibly targets enzymes important for tumor progression, such as RSK2, PKM2, and topoisomerase IIα.

The development of technologies to mitigate the damage caused by drought stress is essential for ensuring a sustainable food supply for the increasing global population. We herein report that the exogenous application of ethanol, an inexpensive and environmentally friendly chemical, significantly enhances drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and wheat. The transcriptomic analyses of ethanol-treated plants revealed the upregulation of genes related to sucrose and starch metabolism, phenylpropanoids and glucosinolate biosynthesis, while metabolomic analysis showed an increased accumulation of sugars, glucosinolates and drought-tolerance-related amino acids. The phenotyping analysis indicated that drought-induced water loss was delayed in the ethanol-treated plants. Furthermore, ethanol treatment induced stomatal closure, resulting in decreased transpiration rate and increased leaf water contents under drought stress conditions. The ethanol treatment did not enhance drought tolerance in the mutant of ABI1, a negative regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis, indicating that ABA signaling contributes to ethanol-mediated drought tolerance. The nuclear magnetic resonance analysis using 13C-labeled ethanol indicated that gluconeogenesis is involved in the accumulation of sugars. The ethanol treatment did not enhance the drought tolerance in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) triple mutant (aldh2b4/aldh2b7/aldh2c4). These results show that ABA signaling and acetic acid biosynthesis are involved in ethanol-mediated drought tolerance and that chemical priming through ethanol application regulates sugar accumulation and gluconeogenesis, leading to enhanced drought tolerance and sustained plant growth. These findings highlight a new survival strategy for increasing crop production under water-limited conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We present measurements of the polarization of X-rays in the 2–8 keV band from the nucleus of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A), using a 100 ks observation from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Nearly simultaneous observations of Cen A were also taken with the Swift, NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL observatories. No statistically significant degree of polarization is detected with IXPE. These observations have a minimum detectable polarization at 99% confidence (MDP<jats:sub>99</jats:sub>) of 6.5% using a weighted, spectral model-independent calculation in the 2–8 keV band. The polarization angle <jats:italic>ψ</jats:italic> is consequently unconstrained. Spectral fitting across three orders of magnitude in X-ray energy (0.3–400 keV) demonstrates that the SED of Cen A is well described by a simple power law with moderate intrinsic absorption (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>H</jats:sub> ∼ 10<jats:sup>23</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) and a Fe K<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> emission line, although a second unabsorbed power law is required to account for the observed spectrum at energies below 2 keV. This spectrum suggests that the reprocessing material responsible for this emission line is optically thin and distant from the central black hole. Our upper limits on the X-ray polarization are consistent with the predictions of Compton scattering, although the specific seed photon population responsible for the production of the X-rays cannot be identified. The low polarization degree, variability in the core emission, and the relative lack of variability in the Fe K<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> emission line support a picture where electrons are accelerated in a region of highly disordered magnetic fields surrounding the innermost jet.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Patients with cancer have been shown to have increased risk of COVID-19 severity. We previously built and validated the COVID-19 Risk in Oncology Evaluation Tool (CORONET) to predict the likely severity of COVID-19 in patients with active cancer who present to hospital. We assessed the differences in presentation and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, depending on the wave of the pandemic. We examined differences in features at presentation and outcomes in patients worldwide, depending on the waves of the pandemic: wave 1 D614G (n = 1430), wave 2 Alpha (n = 475), and wave 4 Omicron variant (n = 63, UK and Spain only). The performance of CORONET was evaluated on 258, 48, and 54 patients for each wave, respectively. We found that mortality rates were reduced in subsequent waves. The majority of patients were vaccinated in wave 4, and 94% were treated with steroids if they required oxygen. The stages of cancer and the median ages of patients significantly differed, but features associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes remained predictive and did not differ between waves. The CORONET tool performed well in all waves, with scores in an area under the curve (AUC) of &gt;0.72. We concluded that patients with cancer who present to hospital with COVID-19 have similar features of severity, which remain discriminatory despite differences in variants and vaccination status. Survival improved following the first wave of the pandemic, which may be associated with vaccination and the increased steroid use in those patients requiring oxygen. The CORONET model demonstrated good performance, independent of the SARS-CoV-2 variants.</jats:p>"

In particular, studies of gene expression dynamics and regulation landscape in COVID-19 infected individuals are limited. Here, we report on a thorough analysis of whole blood RNA-seq data from 465 genotyped samples from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force, including 359 severe and 106 non-severe COVID-19 cases. We discover 1169 putative causal expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) including 34 possible colocalizations with biobank fine-mapping results of hematopoietic traits in a Japanese population, 1549 putative causal splice QTLs (sQTLs; e.g. two independent sQTLs at <jats:italic>TOR1AIP1</jats:italic>), as well as biologically interpretable trans-eQTL examples (e.g., <jats:italic>REST</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>STING1</jats:italic>), all fine-mapped at single variant resolution. We perform differential gene expression analysis to elucidate 198 genes with increased expression in severe COVID-19 cases and enriched for innate immune-related functions. Finally, we evaluate the limited but non-zero effect of COVID-19 phenotype on eQTL discovery, and highlight the presence of COVID-19 severity-interaction eQTLs (ieQTLs; e.g., <jats:italic>CLEC4C</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>MYBL2</jats:italic>).
