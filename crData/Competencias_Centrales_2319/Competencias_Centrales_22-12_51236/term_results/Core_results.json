This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of CD with autologous bone graft to promote rapid bone formation and early postoperative ambulation.\nMethods\n This study included 13 patients who received CD for ONFH (≤ 2mm head collapse) with a minimum follow-up of two years. We implanted autologous bone blocks obtained from the decompression tract into the decompressed necrotic area, and the remaining space was filled with 5–10 cc of allograft bone chips or left empty. We then evaluated patients’ clinical and radiographical outcomes.\nResults\n The mean visual analog scale improved from 4.7 at admission to 3.1 at the latest follow-up (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.039). The mean modified Harris hip score also improved from 59.8 to 73.2 ( <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.027). Mild osteoarthritic changes were noted in most patients (11/13, 84.6%), and the hip survival rate (no further surgeries required) was 76.9%. Three patients underwent total hip arthroplasty due to residual hip pain (mean time to reoperation, 12.7 months).\nConclusion\n Core decompression showed favorable clinical outcomes without any surgery-related complications. This technique may be recommended for the treatment of ONFH.</jats:p>"

Here, we perform strain-resolved, integrated meta-genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of paired saliva and stool samples collected from 35 individuals from eight families with multiple cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We identified distinct oral microbiota mostly reflecting competition between streptococcal species.

However, it is inevitable that inter-core crosstalk (IC-XT) will hinder efforts to increase capacity. Thus, attempts have been made to leverage SDM-EONs by solving the route, modulation format, core, and spectrum assignment problems, but the effects of IC-XT still need to be mitigated. Existing methods such as XT-Aware first fit and core prioritization methods are insufficient for addressing this issue. In this paper, we propose generalized hierarchical core prioritization for the graceful degradation of IC-XT in core and spectrum allocation. Simulation results establish that our approach mitigates adverse influences from IC-XT and has high flexibility in network environments. This study shows that the dynamic resource allocation method, despite being heuristic and computationally inexpensive, can sufficiently reduce the blocking probabilities in any SDM-EONs with hexagonal MCFs.</jats:p>",

Therefore, taking into account the CDL-induced signal attenuation difference among cores is sufficient when considering the signal-to-XT ratio in an MCF with CDL. We also analytically investigated the effect of CDL on XT measurements, and found that the effects of the CDLs induced in an MCF as a measurement target and a measurement setup (including input/output devices) can be canceled in the geometric mean of linear values (or the arithmetic mean of decibel values) of the XT by switching the source core and destination core of the XT.</jats:p>",

In order to obtain modal properties including natural frequencies, damping ratio, mode shapes, and frequency responses of the fabricated structure, modal experiment is performed using a modal hammer with an acceleration sensor. Furthermore, a finite element method is developed to validate the precision of the experimental data. It is recognized that the finite element results are in remarkably great agreement with those obtained by modal experiment. The experimental results showed that the natural frequencies of the sandwich structures with rhombus are much higher than that of the elliptical sandwich structures under free–free boundary conditions and equal relative density of the truss cores.</jats:p>",

It has been proven that core strength training improves the motor coordination of the athlete’s whole body. Therefore, it is essential to develop specific approaches to strengthen the core in tennis players.  Objective  Analyze the effect of core strength training in college tennis players.  Methods  Twenty college tennis players were selected and randomly divided into two groups: core strength training and general training. Comparative results of the experiment were statistically processed for analysis on the effect of core strength training versus general strength training.  Results  There is a big difference in the level of fitness indicators before and after 14 weeks of core strength training (P &lt; 0.05). The average gain in training speed of the athletes in the experimental group was 8.24% versus 1.05% in the control group.

Vertical jump, counter movement jump, pro-agility and dynamic balance tests were applied to all volleyball players before and after the core-training program. The athletes were selected randomly and divided into two groups as study group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The study group performed core exercises added to the beginning of the training sessions for 8 weeks (3days/week) in addition to volleyball training. The control group, on the other hand, continued volleyball training alone. At the end of 8 weeks, the tests applied in the pre-test were repeated and analyzed for all participants in order to determine the effect of core training on agility, explosive strength and balance parameters. In the statistical analysis of the study, Kurtosis-Skewness test was used to determine the normal distribution of the data. Mixed Anova and two-independent independent-samples t-test were used to make in-group and between-group comparisons. During the study, the level of significance was accepted as 0.05.  A statistically significant difference was found in the balance precision index, static vertical jump (cm), counter movement jump (cm) and pro-agility agility test (sec) parameters when comparing the study and control groups. As a result, core exercises performed in addition to volleyball training appear to have a positive effect on agility, explosive strength and balance performances. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT  Introduction  Modern basketball is very competitive and enjoyable; it combines several factors. Basketball requires specific physical characteristics such as high stature, which raises the position of the center of gravity, making the stability angle smaller. This compromises stability, especially in sudden speed and direction changes, because it requires a large base opening. The core musculature is intimately involved with body balance; however, there is a lack of studies verifying the impact of specific training of this region on balance in basketball athletes.  Objective  To explore the influence of core strengthening on the physical fitness of college basketball players.  Methods  12 college basketball players were selected and randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group performed core strengthening training, while the control group practiced traditional strength training. After six weeks, physical fitness and basic skills were compared between the groups. Data were statistically treated and discussed confronting the literature.  Results  Basketball players in the experimental group obtained higher fast dribbling passes and shots than before the experiment (P&lt;0.05), there was no statistically significant difference in several indicators in the control group ( P&gt;0.05); Basketball players in the experimental group had higher fast dribbling passes and shots than the control group (P&lt;0.05), there was no statistically significant difference in approach height between the experimental group and the control group (P&gt;0.05).

Given the dramatic variability in their visual appearance and functional significance, what organizational principles underly the internal representation of materials? To address this question, here we use a large-scale data-driven approach to uncover the core latent dimensions in our mental representation of materials. In a first step, we assembled a new image dataset (STUFF dataset) consisting of 600 photographs of 200 systematically sampled material classes. Next, we used these images to crowdsource 1.87 million triplet similarity judgments. Based on the responses, we then modelled the assumed cognitive process underlying these choices by quantifying each image as a sparse, non-negative vector in a multidimensional embedding space. The resulting embedding predicted material similarity judgments in an independent test set close to the human noise ceiling and accurately reconstructed the similarity matrix of all 600 images in the STUFF dataset. We found that representations of individual material images were captured by a combination of 36 material dimensions that were highly reproducible and interpretable, comprising perceptual (e.g., “grainy”, “blue”) as well as conceptual (e.g., “mineral”, “viscous”) dimensions. These results have broad implications for understanding material perception, its natural dimensions, and our ability to organize materials into classes.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Visually categorizing and comparing materials is crucial for our everyday behaviour. Given the dramatic variability in their visual appearance and functional significance, what organizational principles underly the internal representation of materials? To address this question, here we use a large-scale data-driven approach to uncover the core latent dimensions in our mental representation of materials. In a first step, we assembled a new image dataset (STUFF dataset) consisting of 600 photographs of 200 systematically sampled material classes. Next, we used these images to crowdsource 1.87 million triplet similarity judgments. Based on the responses, we then modelled the assumed cognitive process underlying these choices by quantifying each image as a sparse, non-negative vector in a multidimensional embedding space. The resulting embedding predicted material similarity judgments in an independent test set close to the human noise ceiling and accurately reconstructed the similarity matrix of all 600 images in the STUFF dataset. We found that representations of individual material images were captured by a combination of 36 material dimensions that were highly reproducible and interpretable, comprising perceptual (e.g., “grainy”, “blue”) as well as conceptual (e.g., “mineral”, “viscous”) dimensions. These results have broad implications for understanding material perception, its natural dimensions, and our ability to organize materials into classes.</p>"

First of all, vertical jump, pro-agility agility and ITN Tennis skill tests were applied to all participants, then, in addition to tennis training, the experimental group of 11 people was given core training 3 times a week for 8 weeks in a row in line with the literature. The tennis players in the control group continued only their tennis trainings. In order to examine the effect of core training on strength, agility and tennis skills, the tests applied in the pre-tests were applied to all participants again at the end of 8 weeks as post-test. Using the pretest-posttest measurements taken in the study, the effect of 8-week core training on the strength, reactive agility and tennis skills of 10-14-year-old tennis players was determined. According to the results, a statistically significant improvement was observed in the ITN numbers, ITN scores, agility of the tennis players in the experimental group. Also, within limited aspects, a statistically significant difference was found in ITN numbers, ITN scores in the control group. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant difference in vertical jump and counter movement jump test scores in both groups. As a result, it has been concluded that core training has positive contributions to agility, balance and tennis performance in tennis players aged 10-14. It is thought that core training to be applied in addition to tennis training in training programs will contribute to the development of athletes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The outbreak of Covid-19 has contributed significantly to the growth of e-commerce and the boom in the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) market. This was accompanied by increased purchasing power and financial flexibility for consumers through \"zero interest\" installment plans. In 2022, Afterpay, as a leading BNPL company, was acquired by Square, another large digital payment company, at A$39 billion. This is the most high-profile M&amp;A deal in the global fintech sector to date. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis to explain how Afterpay has achieved success since there are only six years after its launch in Australia. From the business model perspective, Afterpay's business model of not making money from its customers combined with the first-mover advantage of its rapid expansion is one of the keys to Afterpay's success. Meanwhile, after analyzing the company’s capabilities, the result indicates that Afterpay is backed by its strong technological capabilities, which effectively reduces its credit risk and allows it to keep up with its rapid international expansion. That analysis can provide references for fintech companies’ business models or technical support systems.</jats:p>"

Araştırmaya 30 işitme engelli öğrenci katıldı. Katılımcılar, egzersiz grubu (EG: 15; 4 kadın 11 erkek; yaş: 19,60±1,96) ve kontrol grubu (KG: 15, 4 kadın 11 erkek; yaş: 19,73±1,03) olarak rastgele iki gruba ayrıldı. EG’ye dört haftalık (haftada 5 gün) CKA programı uygulandı. KG’deki katılımcılar sadece günlük yaşamlarına devam ettiler. Tüm katılımcılara antrenman uygulaması başında ve sonunda boy uzunluğu, vücut ağırlığı, denge, esneklik, sağ-sol el kavrama kuvveti, dikey sıçrama, durarak uzun atlama, şınav ve mekik testleri uygulandı. Grup içi ve gruplar arası farkları karşılaştırmak için 2x2 mixed faktör ANOVA kullanıldı. Dört haftalık CKA programı sonrası EG’de esneklik, sağ-sol el kavrama kuvveti, durarak uzun atlama, dikey sıçrama, şınav ve mekik testi değişkenlerinde anlamlı gelişim görüldü (p&amp;lt;0,05). KG’de ise sadece sol el kavrama kuvveti ve mekik değişkenlerinde anlamlı değişim oldu (p&amp;lt;0,05). EG ve KG’nin ön-son testleri arasındaki ortalama farklar karşılaştırıldığında esneklik, sağ el kavrama, dikey sıçrama ve şınav parametrelerinde EG lehine anlamlı farklılık görüldü (p&amp;lt;0,05). Ayrıca denge yeteneği EG’de %12,73 gelişim gösterirken KG’de %9,37 gerileme gösterdi. Sonuç olarak CKA modeli, işitme engelli bireylerde denge ve fiziksel performans parametrelerinin gelişiminde etkili olduğu söylenebilir. Bu sonucun core bölgesindeki kasların kuvvet artışıyla meydana geldiği düşünülmektedir. İşitme engellilerin egzersiz programlarına CKA’nın da dahil edilmesi önerilmektedir.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT  Introduction  Surfing depends mainly on the driving force resulting from wave oscillations. Athletes need to paddle in the wave zone and complete the competition actions in the most robust section on the wave walls. This requires extreme balance skills, which can be strengthened with specific training. Among them, it is believed that core training could be beneficial.  Objective  To study the influence of training on a stable and unstable platform on the regulation of the surfer’s orthostatic posture under balance disturbance.  Methods  Members of the Hainan National Surf Training Team were volunteers for the experiment; their physical training methods, memory training, and effects evaluation were analyzed.  Results  90% of athletes manage to complete the balance control in a short-term autonomous position on the balance board in 1 week; their progress also depends on the training duration, times, and intervals; the progression rule lies according to the literary theory of sports training.  Conclusion  With the further extension of the balance board training cycle, it is believed that athletes’ ability to control balance and real competition comprehensive capabilities will continue to increase, the overall technical level and stability of their performance will be even greater.

Bacillus subtilis is a gut-associated probiotic bacteria that can suppress allergic lung disease; however, it is not clear for how long this protection lasts. We exposed C57Bl/6 mice to B. subtilis via oral gavage and challenged them with intranasal house-dust mite for up to 8 weeks. We found that B. subtilis treatment was able to provide protection from eosinophil infiltration of the airways for 3 weeks. This loss of protection correlated with an increase in the eosinophil chemoattractant CCL24. Additionally, we demonstrate that B. subtilis treatment altered the bacterial composition by increasing the phylum Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicorbiota. The phylum Verrucomicorbiota was reduced in B. subtilis-treated mice at 8 weeks when protection was lost. These results support B. subtilis as a prophylactic for preventing the production of allergic lung disease and highlights that protection can last up to 3 weeks. This work also expands our understanding of how B. subtilis mediates protection and that in addition to modifying the immune system it is also altering the host microbiota.</jats:p>"

The estimated column density of C2H5CN towards the G10.47+0.03 was 7.7 (±0.5)×1016 cm−2 with a high rotational temperature of 352.9±66.8 K. The estimated fractional abundance of C2H5CN with respect to H2 towards the G10.47+0.03 was 5.70×10−9. We observed that the estimated fractional abundance of C2H5CN is similar to the simulated abundance of C2H5CN which was predicted by the three-phase warm-up model from Garrod (2013). We also discuss the possible formation mechanism of C2H5CN towards the hot molecular cores and we claim the barrierless and exothermic radical-radical reaction between CH2 and CH2CN is responsible for the production of low abundant C2H5CN (∼10−9) in the grain surface of the G10.47+0.03.</jats:p>"

These either referred to different content facets or methodological artifacts due to the item wording. The present random-effects meta-analysis summarized correlation matrices from 53 samples including 31,843 respondents. After accounting for acquiescent responding, meta-analytic confirmatory factor analyses revealed a single common factor for all items. The factor was highly reliable (ω = .87) and demonstrated partial metric measurement invariance across English, German, and Spanish language versions as well as cultural tendencies of individualism and flexibility. However, Chinese and Romanian translations exhibited substantially lower factor loadings. These results corroborate the use of the CSES as a unidimensional measure, albeit systematic investigations of measurement invariance are recommended before its use in cross-cultural research.</p>"

They are involved not only in converting between geodata formats and reference systems, but also in turning geodata into useful information according to some purpose. However, since a transformation can be implemented in various formats and tools, its  function and purpose usually remains hidden underneath the technicalities of a workflow. To automate geographic information procedures, we therefore need to model the transformations    implemented by workflows on a conceptual level, as a form of procedural knowledge. Although core concepts of spatial information provide a useful level of description in this respect,  we currently lack a model for the space of possible transformations between such concepts. In this article, we present the algebra of core concept transformations (CCT). It consists of a type hierarchy     which models core concepts as relations, and a set of basic transformations described in terms of function signatures that use such types. Type inference allows us to enrich GIS workflows with abstract machine-readable metadata, by compiling algebraic tool descriptions. This allows us to automatically infer goal concepts across workflows and to query over such concepts across raster and vector implementations. We evaluate the algebra over a set of expert GIS workflows taken from online tutorials.</p>"

In order to obtain a relatively objective perception of the core values of the brand and the effectiveness of the strategies used by Lululemon, a questionnaire is conducted to collect quantitative data on these points. Despite the original and utility designs of its products, the commitments such as sustainability and realization of racially diverse representation contribute to the purchase of products and the irreplaceable status taken up by the brand in the market, especially yoga apparel and equipment. It is also evident that Lululemon has succeeded in receiving stable revenue with the help of directly operated websites after the pandemic outbreak, which can be considered a threat to other competitors. During the SWOT analysis, the great potential of the firm activated by factors including its solid relationship with customers and the interpretation of the brand’s core values while promoting products are shown, accompanied by its existing weaknesses and the threats posed to the brand by its competitors in the industry.

By the example of the fables of K. Atazhukin, A. Dymov, B. Zhanimov, B. Kagermazov, P. Tambiev, B. Tkhamokov, M. Khakuasheva, P. Shekikhachev, T. Sheretlokov, A. Shomakhov, H. Elberdov the law of correlation between moral values declared by poets and the postulates of the Kabardian ethical code “Adyghe Khabze” is shown. Within the framework of historical poetics, the author demonstrates three-stage evolutionary process associated with the transition of fabulists from the practice of borrowing classical subjects to national adaptation, and then to the creation of original texts. Much attention is paid to the decoding of symbolic images.</jats:p>"

An easy and cheap fluid core is designed and used to decrease the eddy current and loses, thereby low conducting and paramagnetic features are added. The core exhibits both fluid and solid characteristics exerting high frequency modes in the fluid and low current due to the iron powder inside. The finite element analysis simulations are performed via COMSOL Multi-physics package for different mass fractions of iron powder. The maximum peak-to-peak voltage and power are found as 526 mV and 188.8 mW at 12 MHz from the simulations. 3D patterns prove that the magnetic flux and magnetization exhibit turbulence in the core, thereby localized magnetic values indicate an arbitrary attitude for various frequencies. Optimum mass fraction is found as 0.7, which is parallel with experimental results. The transformer operates between 11 MHz and 13.5 MHz optimally.</jats:p>"

Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in Ugandan women with an estimated 6959 new cases and 4607 deaths in 2020. The histopathological differentiation of cervical cancer is a major determinant in treatment options for cervical cancer and is a major determinant of the prognosis of the disease. However, there is paucity of data regarding cervical cancer patterns in Uganda. The study aimed to determine the histopathological pattern of cervical cancer among females presenting to Makerere university pathology core reference laboratory. \n<jats:bold>Methodology: </jats:bold>A retrospective cross-sectional study employing the use of quantitative methods of data collection was conducted within Makerere university pathology core reference laboratory. The study obtained information on patients who had a cervical cancer diagnosis by histology from 2017 to 2021.The Data collected was analyzed using SPSS version 18. \n<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>A total of 120 patients from 2017 to 2021 were recruited into the study. The mean age of the patients was 47.5 (SD 13.1), the youngest patient was 21 years and the oldest was 80 years of age. Cervical cancer was more prevalent in women aged between 35 to 54 years 77(64.2%) and women with HIV infection 26(21.7%). Squamous cell carcinoma presents in 102 (85%) patients was the most prevalent pattern of cervical cancer. This was followed by adenocarcinoma 7 (5.8%) and adenosquamous 5 (4.2%) histological patterns of cervical cancer. \n<jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold>Cervical cancer is predominant among women with HIV and women aged 35-55 years. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most prevalent pattern of cervical cancer in Uganda present in every 9 out 10 cervical cancer patients. Routine screening of all HIV positive women and women aged 35 years and above is recommended</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Prostate cancer is common in urological practice. Diagnosis of prostate cancer depends on biopsy of the prostate. For the last two decade TRUS guided 6 core (sextant) biopsy is being considered as standard for prostate biopsy. Various studies in different countries showed the drawback of sextant biopsy. The debate remains alive on number of biopsy core which is appropriate for obtaining representative tissue. Moreover, more number of needle biopsy may be associated with more complication. Methods: In this hospital based Quasi experimental study, a total of 50 patients were allocated into two groups by purposive sampling technique where 6 core prostate biopsy in one group and 12 core biopsy in another group. Baseline demographic and clinical data were recorded. Post procedural morbidity &amp; histopathological findings were recorded. All the collected data were compiled. Further Statistical analyses of the results were obtained by using Microsoft Xcel, 2010 and web based computer software - Graph Pad Software, 2017. A probability value (p) of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results: The baseline characteristics like age, S.PSA, prostate volume &amp; DRE findings were similar in two groups. Cancer detection rate was not significantly different between the 6 core biopsy group and 12 core biopsy group (48% Vs 60%, p=0.395). Dysuria with difficulty in micturition and hematuria after biopsy significantly more in 12 core biopsy group (24% Vs 44% and 32% Vs 60% respectively). Other post procedural complications like fever, perrectal bleeding was found statistically not significant between two groups Conclusion: Trans rectal ultrasound guided 6 core biopsy is equally effective as Trans rectal ultrasound guided 12 core biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.</jats:p>",

We have recently achieved the complete α-stereoselective glycosidation of Kdo using a macrobicyclic donor tethered at the C1 and C5 positions. In this study, to expand the scope of Kdo glycosidation, we sought to protect the 4-OH group, thereby shortening the reaction time and ensuring the conversion of the glycosyl acceptor via its selective removal. The protection of the 4-OH group influenced the reactivity of the Kdo donor, and the triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group acted as a selectively removable booster. The 4-O-TIPS donor allowed the synthesis of the α(2,4)-linked dimeric Kdo sequence, which is widely found in bacterial LPSs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article puts operationalization as a research practice and its theoretical consequences into focus. As all sciences as well as humanities areas use concepts to describe their realm of investigation, digital humanities projects are usually faced with the challenge of ‘bridging the gap’ from theoretical concepts (whose meaning(s) depend on a certain theory and which are used to describe expectations, hypothesis and results) to results derived from data. The process of developing methods to bridge this gap is called ‘operationalization’, and it is a common task for any kind of quantitative, formal, or digital analysis. Furthermore, operationalization choices have long-lasting consequences, as they (obviously) influence the results that can be achieved, and, in turn, the possibilities to interpret these results in terms of the original research question. However, even though this process is so important and so common, its theoretical consequences are rarely reflected. Because the concepts that are operationalized cannot be operationalized in isolation, operationalizing is not only an engineering or implementation challenge, but touches on the theoretical core of the research questions we work on, and the fields we work in.</jats:p> <jats:p>In this article, we first clarify the need to operationalize on selected, representative examples, situate the process within typical DH workflows, and highlight the consequences that operationalization decisions have. We will then argue that operationalization plays such a crucial role for the digital humanities that any kind of theory needs to take off from operationalization practices. Based on these assumptions, we will develop a first scheme of the constraints and necessities of such a theory and reflect their epistemic consequences.</jats:p>"

In the current study, we measured subcutaneous (T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>) and core (T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>) body temperature as well as activity in a conditional transgenic mouse strain that allows the inducible ablation of Hcrt/Ox-containing neurons by removal of doxycycline (DOX) from their diet (<jats:italic>orexin-DTA</jats:italic>mice). Measurements were made during a baseline, when mice were being maintained on food containing DOX, and over 42 days while the mice were fed normal chow which resulted in Hcrt/Ox neuron degeneration. The home cages of the<jats:italic>orexin-DTA</jats:italic>mice were equipped with running wheels that were either locked or unlocked. In the presence of a locked running wheel, T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>progressively decreased on days 28 and 42 in the DOX(-) condition, primarily during the dark phase (the major active period for rodents). This nocturnal reduction in T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>was mitigated when mice had access to unlocked running wheels. In contrast to T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>, T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>was largely maintained until day 42 in the DOX(-) condition even when the running wheel was locked. Acute changes in both T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>and T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>were observed preceding, during, and following cataplexy. Our results suggest that ablation of Hcrt/Ox-containing neurons results in elevated heat loss, likely through reduced sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, and that exercise may have some therapeutic benefit to patients with narcolepsy, a disorder caused by Hcrt/Ox deficiency. Acute changes in body temperature may facilitate prediction of cataplexy onset and lead to interventions to mitigate its occurrence.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlights</jats:title><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Hypocretin/Orexin (Hcrt/Ox) neuron degeneration results in the sleep disorder Narcolepsy and reduced subcutaneous body temperature (T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>) during the dark phase of the 24-h light/dark cycle.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>This reduction in dark phase T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>is mitigated by access to an exercise opportunity.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>In contrast to T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>, core body temperature (T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>) is largely maintained as the Hcrt/Ox neurons degenerate.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Reduced T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>while T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>is maintained suggests increased heat loss, possibly through modulation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Hcrt/Ox neuron loss in Narcolepsy results in cataplexy, whose occurrence is associated with acute changes in both T<jats:sub>sc</jats:sub>and T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Exercise may represent an effective intervention for mitigating heat loss resulting from Hcrt/Ox neuron loss in Narcolepsy.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the implementation of investment processes with the use of ready-made prefabricated elements, undesirable situations may occur that cause scratches, excessive deflections or damage. This is due to the fact that defects occur during transport, storage or incorrect loading of the elements. The conducted tests and technical assessments often allow the use of built-in elements, however, under the conditions of the need to make their reinforcements. This may be due to the scale of damage or defects made during molding and, as a consequence, the implementation of prefabricated elements with too low load capacity. Taking action each time should allow for the implementation of reinforcements of the elements, limiting the need to dismantle them, which would result in their irretrievable destruction. The implementation of reinforcements allows to reduce the generation of waste from new elements and allows for the proper management of already produced prefabricated elements. Used elements with reinforcements should be subject to technical inspection in the same periods as other structural elements. Proper implementation of repairs allows for the final effect to be similar to the parameters of elements free of technical defects. Due to the existing problem of damage to new elements of prefabricated channel ceilings, solutions have been developed that can be used to reinforce the elements without the need to dismantle them from the places of installation, while reducing the time spent on the process.</jats:p>"

The first two topics cover the “bedrock” principles of international trade law: market access (covering tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions, non-tariff barriers, and some services-specific market access considerations); and non-discrimination (as between domestic and imported goods; and between imported goods from different sources). The third topic covers various ‘good governance’ obligations, which require transparency and proper administration by national authorities, with respect to their trade-related measures. The penultimate topic covers obligations that balance competing trade interests of different WTO Members, including permitted grounds for preferential trade treatment of imports, the grant of subsidies, and the imposition of trade remedies on imports. Finally, we consider the rules that look to balance competing trade and non-trade interests, including the general and security exceptions in the GATT 1994, and the SPS and TBT Agreements.</jats:p>"

Many types of research have been done on task Partitioning and Task Mapping from various perspectives by researchers. The existing partitioning task algorithms still have negatives, such as low usage of the processor or not making the most of the cores efficiency on the processor. However, partitioning tasks onto processors is a significant challenge among the challenges facing the multi-core processor. In this paper, to solve this challenge we proposed developing the framework that uses hybrid partitioning algorithms to mix the Blocking-Aware Algorithm with First-Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm, based on each of these algorithms advantages.\n</jats:p>"

A post space was prepared in Typodent maxillary second premolar teeth. A direct digital scan for the post space was obtained using the Medit i700 intraoral scanner. The scan was then sent electronically to the CAD/CAM machine for virtual model creation, post-and-core designing and milling out of vita Enamic®. The resulted one-piece post-and-core was then compared to a conventionally-made custom lithium disilicate ceramic post made on the same tooth to verify the successfulness of this new fully digital technique to produce identical outcome to the conventional technique. This study showed that the full digital workflow for fabrication of custom hybrid ceramic one-piece post-and-core can be an acceptable alternative to the conventional methods, thus further advancing digital dentistry.</jats:p>"

As such, core values have appeal for mass politics and representative democracy. To fulfill this role, core values should possess several characteristics. Chief among these are resistance to elite influence and trans‐situationalism, that is, the ability to guide political evaluations across different contexts. Despite their importance for mass politics, it is unclear as to how well core values fulfill these criteria. I examine this here by testing whether core values can be systematically primed by electoral campaigns. That is, I test whether core values can be made, by political elites, to matter more in certain situations over others. I do this by using observational data from the 2012 and 2016 ANES, along with data from a nationally representative survey experiment, originally fielded in 2005. Overall, I find little evidence to suggest that electoral campaigns can prime citizens’ core values. These findings have implications for our understanding of value systems, electoral campaigns, and public opinion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Aims: Hepatoblastoma (HBL), a deadly malignancy in children, is the most common type of pediatric liver cancer. We recently demonstrated that β-catenin, phosphorylated at S675 (ph-S675-β-catenin), causes pathological alterations in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC), by activating oncogenes and fibrotic genes via human genomic regions, known as cancer-enhancing genomic regions or aggressive liver cancer domains (CEGRs/ALCDs). The aim of this study was to determine the role of the ph-S675-β-catenin-TCF4-CEGRs/ALCDs pathway in HBL. Methods: The ph-S675-β-catenin-TCF4-CEGRs/ALCDs pathway was examined in a large cohort of HBL specimens, in HBL cell lines HepG2 and Huh6, and in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Results: β-catenin is phosphorylated at S675 in a large portion of tested HBL patients. In these patients, ph-S675-β-catenin forms complexes with TCF4 and opens CEGRs/ALCDs-dependent oncogenes for transcription, leading to a massive overexpression of the oncogenes. The inhibition of the β-catenin-TCF4-CEGRs/ALCDs axis inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth in HBL cell lines and HBL-PDXs. The ph-S675-β-catenin is abundant in mitotic cells. We found that markers of HBL Glypican 3 (GPC3) and Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) are increased in HBL patients by β-catenin-TCF4-p300 complexes. Conclusions: The phosphorylation-mediated activation of the β-catenin-TCF4-p300-CEGRs/ALCDs pathway increases oncogene expression in patients with aggressive liver cancer and promotes the development of hepatoblastoma.</jats:p>"

The paper present theresults of an experimental study of hydrocarbon filtration by a porous medium core in thepresence of acoustic oscillations with the frequency of 2,7 kHz. Porous sandstone cores with aheight of 18 mm and a diameter of 53 mm were studied. The core holder was filled with engineoil which contained a piezoelectric acoustic oscillator, the electrical signal to the emitter wasgenerated by a generator and amplifier. During the studied filtration, the core was located atthe bottom of the core holder, which was filled with liquid hydrocarbons, which were used asengine oil.The aim was to investigate the effect of acoustic oscillations on the filtration of hydrocarbonsin a porous medium. For this purpose, an experimental setup, amplifier and piezoelectricemitter of acoustic oscillations were made, sandstone cores were prepared, experiments wereperformed and the mass of the filtered liquid was estimated.Methodology. An experimental study of the effect of acoustic oscillations with a frequencyof 2.7 KHz on the filtration of hydrocarbons by a sandstone core for different pressures wasperformed in laboratory conditions. Amplified oscillations from the electronic generator wereapplied to the piezoelectric emitter located in the core holder, which was filled with motor oil,the pressure in the oil was changed using a reducer and manometers. The mass of core-filteredoil was measured by electronic scales.Originality. It has been established that acoustic oscillations effectively affect the filtrationof hydrocarbons in porous media and increase filtration by tens of percent.Findings and practical implications. Experiments have shown that acoustic oscillations ina porous medium filled with hydrocarbons increase the filtration of hydrocarbons. The use ofacoustic oscillations for processing around the filter space of wells will increase the flow rateof wells.Experiments have shown that in the presence of acoustic oscillation, the filtration of engineoil by the sandstone core increase by tens % relative to the amount of filtration in the absenceof acoustic oscillations.Relevance of the topic. Increasing the flow rate of wells is an important scientific andpractical task, its solution can be cleaning the filter zone from clogging and improving thefiltration of useful fluid Under the action of acoustic oscillations.Keywords: hydrocarbon filtration; porous medium; acoustic oscillations; well; around thefilter area; debit.</jats:p>"

This work aims to improve the properties of random flax fiber composites by incorporating waste glass fibers (WGF) obtained from the fiber production line. The waste glass fibers were incorporated as a core structure between the flax layers to form a hybrid composite. Two routes of manufacturing viz. vacuum infusion and autoclave were used to identify the optimum route to incorporate the WGF in flax fiber composites. The quality of composites was investigated in terms of residual void content and thickness uniformity. Residual void content was identified to be directly proportional to the WGF content in the composites. With the increase in WGF content, the flexural and impact properties were increased by 47% and 117%, respectively, indicating a positive hybridization effect. Furthermore, a global warming potential indicator was identified to be small, indicating the eco-friendliness of these composites.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The practical application of genistein (GEN) as a drug system is hindered by its low aqueous solubility and poor oral bioavailability. Encapsulation of poor water-soluble drug was considered as one of the widely used approaches to overcome such of these obstacles. The primary goal of this research was to in situ encapsulate the hydrophobic GEN during the electrosynthesis of DNA nanospheres as a delivery system (Es GEN@DNA) with appropriate drug release properties. The prepared Es GEN@DNA nanospheres were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), zeta potential and stability test. The results revealed that GEN was successfully encapsulate in situ during the DNA electrospherization (Es GEN@DNA) as core shell like structure (Core: GEN and Shell: DNA) with a wonderful stability against time. Furthermore, the drug encapsulation % was studied. In addition, the drug release efficiency of Es GEN@DNA was recorded and theoretically visualized to understand the mechanism and kinetics of GEN drug release. %Encapsulation of GEN within DNA nanospheres was found to be 89.62%. Es GEN@DNA release profile explored that the well entrapped GEN within the DNA nanospheres could be a promising for sustained drug release. Besides, we overcome the dilemma of using a fractal or fractional kinetics model by introducing a general fractional kinetic equation that involves a time-dependent rate coefficient, which introduced that the solution of the fractional kinetic model is capable of fitting the release data profiles of free GEN and Es GEN@DNA.</jats:p>"

We first introduce this module and how it interfaces to C code. Next, we briefly introduce the basic principles in optimizing numerical code, including some common techniques. Then we use the code examples in Owl to demonstrate how these techniques are applied in Owl. We finish this chapter with a bit of touch on the topic of automatic performance tuning in numerical libraries.</jats:p>"

The assessment of outcomes is an important part of demonstrating these benefits. There is no current consensus about which outcomes are appropriate for the evaluation of genetic health interventions, including genetic testing and genetic counselling. The Core Outcome DEvelopment for Carrier Screening study has addressed this lack of guidance by undertaking a systematic approach to understanding the outcomes that can meaningfully capture the benefits of reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS). Herein, we report on a consensus process to determine the degree of consensus among Australian and New Zealand stakeholders regarding the core outcomes of RGCS. An iterative, two-round online Delphi survey was conducted. Panellists ranked 83 outcomes according to their perceived importance on a nine-point Likert scale. Using the distribution of rankings, outcomes were grouped into tiers representative of their perceived level of importance and agreement between groups. The top tier outcomes were agreed to be critically important for all future studies and were used to define a preliminary core outcome set encompassing the domains (1) primary laboratory outcomes, (2) pregnancy outcomes, (3) resource use and (4) perceived utility of RGCS. These findings will help to guide the selection of meaningful outcomes in studies aiming to evaluate the value of RGCS. A future international consensus process will expand on these findings and guide the inclusion of diverse perspectives across the range of settings in which RGCS is offered.</jats:p>"

The current works examines the neural differences between unitization and non-unitized memory using fMRI and multivoxel analyses. Specifically, we examined the differences across face-occupation pairings as a function of whether the pairing was viewed as a person performing the given job (unitized binding) or a person saying they knew someone who had a particular job (non-unitized binding). The results show that at encoding, the angular gyrus can discriminate between unitized and non-unitized target trials. Additionally, during encoding, the medial temporal lobe (hippocampus and perirhinal cortex), frontal parietal regions (angular gyrus and medial frontal gyrus) and visual regions (middle occipital cortex) exhibit distinct neural patterns to recollected unitized and non-unitized targets. Furthermore, the medial frontal gyrus and middle occipital cortex show greater neural similarity for recollected unitized trials than those of recollected non-unitized trials. We conclude that visually unitized pairs may enhance unitization in older adults due to greater similarity of trials within the same condition during the encoding process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Genomic studies of hepatitis B virus (HBV) diversity are becoming increasingly significant to understand how HBV mutations interact with a wide spectrum of clinical and pathological disorders. Objective: This study focused on identifying HBV genotypes and determining the status of pre-core (PC) and core promoter (CP) mutants. Methods: Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the viral genotypes of 100 patients with chronic HBV infection. Only 30 samples out of 100 were selected to determine the prevalence of mutations in the PC and CP by Sanger sequencing. Results: Over 95% of the samples had only D genotype and mixed genotypes 5% (B+C+D) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. G1898A, G1901A, G1910A and G1915A mutations in PC gene were found in total 15 out of 30 (50%) samples, which were distributed in the following proportions: 12 out of 25 (48%) in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -ve, 8 samples with mutants at G1898A, G1901A, G1910A and G1915A (four mutations), 4 samples with mutants at G1898A, G 1901A and G1910A (three mutations). In addition, 3 out of 5 (60%) in patients with HBeAg +ve, while no type of any mutation was detected in the core gene in patients with chronic hepatitis type B. Conclusion: The genotype D was predominantly prevalent among HBV in CHB patients with 95% and with 5% in mixed genotypes (B+C+D), while genotype B and C were relatively less prevalent among CHB patients than genotype D. The mutations were found in the PC gene at nucleotides G1898A, G1901A, G1910A and G1915A, while no type of mutation was detected in the core gene.

In this study, we characterised glycan structures of MEC and identified the localisation of cells expressing these distinctive glycans on MUC1. Mucins were extracted from the frozen tissues of three patients with MEC, and normal salivary glands (NSGs) were extracted from seven patients, separated by supported molecular matrix electrophoresis (SMME) and the membranes stained with various lectins. In addition, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from three patients with MEC were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) with various monoclonal antibodies and analysed for <jats:italic>C2GnT-1</jats:italic> expression by in situ hybridisation (ISH). Lectin blotting of the SMME membranes revealed that glycans on MUC1 from MEC samples contained α2,3-linked sialic acid. In IHC, MUC1 was diffusely detected at MEC-affected regions but was specifically detected at apical membranes in NSGs.

Whereas prior research has focused mainly on direct land use-induced forest fragmentation, this study models the relationship between the spatial distribution of core forest patches, land uses, and terrain variables. Relying on Landsat images from the Atewa Range Forest Reserve (ARFR) in Ghana, we use machine learning geospatial techniques and statistical methods to process satellite images and model the relationship between core forest patches and associated variables. The study finds that a unit reduction in elevation would significantly likely reduce by 0.995 times the possibility of forest patches being core forests, implying that on lower slopes, core forests are less likely to occur. Additionally, we find that a unit increase in slope gradient significantly increases the odds of a forest patch being among the core forest category by 1.35 times. Moreover, our results show that the odds of forest patches being core forests significantly increase by 1.60 and 2.14 times if patches are found beyond 1 km from logging sites and access roads, respectively. This implies that intact forest patches would likely be found on higher slopes, higher elevations, and areas far away from land uses. Based on the results, we suggest that the protection of forest patches should target higher elevations and slopes and most importantly areas far from land uses whereas forest restoration programs should target areas close to land uses and on lower elevations and lower slopes. With this study demonstrating a significant relationship between core forests, land uses and terrain variables, we present important information to land managers for land monitoring and conservation in the ARFR and other tropical forest regions of the world.</jats:p>"

To precisely study the hot spot temperature and temperature distribution law of dry iron core reactor, this paper firstly studied the loss of reactor, including coil loss and core loss, and obtained the calculation method of reactor loss. Then, the normal working environment of the dry core reactor is analyzed, and the temperature field simulation is carried out for a three-phase dry core reactor with an inductance value of 11.561 mH and capacity of 10 kV, and the hot spot temperature and temperature distribution law of this reactor are obtained and analyzed through reasonable material setting and heat dissipation method setting. Finally, the accuracy and validity of the simulation results are verified by the actual temperature rise experimental data. The research results provide a theoretical basis for structure optimization and online monitoring of the dry core reactor.</jats:p>",

An elastic PMHS@EPDM shell was fabricated on BF surface by successively spraying PMHS/hexane and EPDM/hexane solutions onto BF, based on the dehydrogenation and addition reaction of PMHS with BF and EPDM. It was found that surface encapsulation of wood at high PMHS content would simultaneously increase the strength and toughness of BF@PMHS/HDPE composite. The tensile strength and impact strength were increased by 54.2% and 9.9%, respectively as PMHS content was 3.3%. Furthermore, an encapsulation of BF@PMHS with EPDM further increased the strength and toughness by 5.1% and 14.7%. Compared with the pristine BF/plastic composites (BPC), the tensile, flexural and impact strength of modified BPC increased by 62.1%, 28.0% and 26.1%. The changes in the microstructure of the interface between BF and HDPE as a function of encapsulation of PMHS and EPDM and the relationship between chemical structure, microstructure and mechanical properties were discussed in detail. This work gave a novel MAH-free method for strengthening and toughening BF/HDPE or wood flour/high-density polyethylene (WF/HDPE) composites.</jats:p>"

Based on the geostress classification standard and engineering cases data, the stress level of complete granite prone to discing is determined in this paper. On this basis, laboratory drilling tests with different drilling speeds under high and low stress conditions are designed. The results show that high stress is not the key factor for core discing. When the drilling speed is fast, even if the confining stress is 0, core discing will occur. When the drilling speed is slow, the core can be taken completely even at high stress levels. Drilling parameters fluctuate with discing, and its peaks correspond to the core fracture location.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mouth has a diverse microbial ecosystem and is yet vulnerable to infectious diseases. Dental plaque is formed when bacteria accumulate on teeth, and if left untreated, it can develop to gingivitis. Gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, which causes irreparable damage to the gums and underlying support tissues if left untreated. Hundreds of bacterial species are involved in dental caries such as streptococci species, lactobacillus species. Mouthwashes are meant to reduce oral bacteria, remove any food debris and provide a pleasant and refreshing taste in the mouth. Antiseptic chemicals including alcohol, menthol, and eucalyptol are used in mouthwash to destroy microorganisms. Plaque and gingivitis can be avoided with the use of mouthwash. Each mouthwash mixture has somewhat different chemicals, and each product serves a particular purpose. Herbal mouthwashes are considered to be an effective alternative for the commercial products. Herbal mouthwashes are in high demand, because they have less or no side effects and act on oral pathogens effectively. Herbs, in contrast to artificial products, are widely regarded as highly effective. Medicinal herbs have long been used to treat ailments because of their antibacterial and antifungal properties against human pathogens. Herbal mouth washes have the ability to deliver the therapeutic ingredients to access against the organism present on the surface of the mouth. Dental caries and periodontal diseases are among the most frequent infectious diseases experienced by many people at various phases of their lives, with a significant prevalence among children and adolescents who do not practice basic oral hygiene. Herbal mouthwash was prepared from the aqueous extracts of four different leaves namely&lt;i&gt; Ocimum tenuiflorum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Plectranthus amboinicus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;. The antimicrobial efficacy was tested against the oral pathogens&lt;i&gt; Staphylococcus sp&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus sp.&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus sp.&lt;/i&gt; by using agar well diffusion method.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The “new core paradox” suggests that the persistence of the geomagnetic field over nearly all of Earth history is in conflict with the core being highly thermally conductive, which makes convection and dynamo action in the core much harder prior to the nucleation of the inner core. Here we revisit this issue by exploring the influence of six important parameters on core evolution: upper/lower mantle viscosity ratio, core thermal conductivity, core radiogenic heat rate, mantle radiogenic heating rate, central core melting temperature, and initial core‐mantle boundary (CMB) temperature. Each parameter is systematically explored by the model, which couples mantle energy and core energy‐entropy evolution. A model is “successful” if the correct present‐day inner core size is achieved and the dynamo remains alive, as implied by the paleomagnetic record. In agreement with previous studies, we do not find successful thermal evolutions using nominal parameters, which includes a core thermal conductivity of 70 Wm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, zero core radioactivity, and an initial CMB temperature of 5,000 K. The dynamo can be kept alive by assuming an unrealistically low thermal conductivity of 20 Wm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> or an unrealistically high core radioactive heat flow of 3 TW at present‐day, which are considered “unsuccessful” models. We identify a third scenario to keep the dynamo alive by assuming a hot initial CMB temperature of ∼6,000 K and a central core liquidus of ∼5,550 K. These temperatures are on the extreme end of typical estimates, but should not be ruled out and deserve further scrutiny.</jats:p>",

Multifunctional applications can be achieved by endowing nanoparticles with piezoelectric, quantum dot, magnetothermal, and piezoluminescent properties. In particular, multiferroic magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs) can generate electricity by coupling piezoelectric and magnetostrictive properties when an external magnetic field, which is harmless to the human body, is applied. In this regard, magnetoelectricity (ME) induced by a magnetic field makes MENPs useful for various biomedical and electrocatalytic applications. The ME voltage coefficients, which express the efficiency of energy conversion from magnetic field to electricity, show differences depending on the setup for ME measurements of MENPs. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to optimize the ME characterization method to reduce measurement errors resulting from charge leakages caused by the specimen preparation, as well as to investigate the ME effect of a single nanoparticle. Our review is focused on the structures, syntheses (hydrothermal and sol–gel methods), activation mechanism, and measurement of magnetoelectricity, as well as applications, of core–shell MENPs.</jats:p>"

However, there is limited data about the diagnostic yield of increasing the core number to 18.\n\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of cancer detection and clinical advantages between 12- and 18-core TRUS biopsies.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The authors conducted a prospective, single-group trial of TRUS biopsies specifically for patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels between 4.0 and 20.0 ng/mL. Sixty-two consecutive patients were enrolled and received a 12- or an 18-core TRUS biopsy under local anaesthesia. The patients and prostate cancer characteristics, such as serum PSA, free PSA, prostate volume, PSA density, D’Amico risk classification, and Gleason grade group were recorded and analysed.\n\nResults: The prostate cancer detection rate using 12 cores for the initial TRUS biopsy was 22.6% (14 patients), while using 18 cores was 24.2% (15 patients). The results were not statistically different (p=0.83). Postoperative complications were two cases of gross haematuria and two case of acute urinary retention, which did not require admission. Infection occurred in two patients and no serious morbidities or mortalities.\n\nConclusion: The present study did not find any significant benefit in increasing the number of biopsy cores from 12 to 18 for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men with serum PSA levels between 4.0 and 20.0 ng/mL.\n\nKeywords: Transrectal prostate biopsy; 12-core; 18-core; Prostate cancer; Cancer detection</jats:p>"

These include, for example, the number and granularity of the computations or the use of the memories of the devices. In this paper, we assess those factors by evaluating and comparing different parallelizations of the same problem on a multiprocessor containing a CPU with 40 cores and four P100 GPUs with Pascal architecture. We use, as study case, the convolutional operation behind a non-standard finite element mesh truncation technique in the context of open region electromagnetic wave propagation problems. A total of six parallel algorithms implemented using OpenMP and CUDA have been used to carry out the comparison by leveraging the same levels of parallelism on both types of platforms. Three of the algorithms are presented for the first time in this paper, including a multi-GPU method, and two others are improved versions of algorithms previously developed by some of the authors. This paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation of the parallel algorithms on a radar cross-sectional prediction problem. Results show that performance obtained on the GPU clearly overcomes those obtained in the CPU, much more so if we use multiple GPUs to distribute both data and computations. Accelerations close to 30 have been obtained on the CPU, while with the multi-GPU version accelerations larger than 250 have been achieved.</jats:p>",

It is considered how one of the founders of the world-system analysis, Immanuel Wallerstein, borrowed the provisions of the dependence theory. Using retrospective and hermeneutic methods, we reproduce the origin and development of center-periphery relations, and with them the entire capitalist world-system. Particular attention is paid to the semi-periphery – the territories located between the center and the periphery. Introducing the concept of a semi-periphery, Wallerstein solves a number of problems associated with his application of the theory of dependence. At the same time, with the introduction of the semi-periphery, a number of problems arise - how to determine the state belonging to the semi-periphery, as well as the problem of the role of the semi-periphery in the functioning of the capitalist world-system. These problems are caused by the absence of intermediate zones in the dependence theory. A separate problem is related to the political status of the periphery and semi-periphery. In the case of the periphery, this is the problem of political subjectivity within the framework of a long historical time (historically, not every state of the periphery is a colony, but the colonies are the periphery) in relation to the semi-periphery - primarily its stabilizing role. This function, as the study showed, is attributed to it erroneously. Based on this, it is necessary to revise the theoretical paradigms of world-system analysis.</jats:p>",

When applied to core cultural values, statistics could help to arrange and streamline priority areas of relevance in an organization. Such streamlined priorities are normally defined in vision and mission statements of the organization and designed to be part of the work-culture and core values that defines reform processes. Statistics therefore helped to trace the evolution processes and acceptable standards of the organizational culture either in tangible or intangible forms among team members. The stringent classifications of cultural traits in any organization are functions of the behavioural depositions of the workforce, clients and stakeholders in line with the ideals and philosophies of the organization. The way things are done here is peculiar to the way things are done there. That is the tenet of organizational culture, not any two are the same though organizations could be similar. However, the fingerprints that specifically identify the uniqueness of any organizational culture are in the application of statistics for the presumable co-mingling and thus bring out the typical biomarkers of the organization. In this study, the statistics of core cultural values of the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) were aggregated, synthesized and analysed for organizational integration based on the core value needs of the Fund. Certain identifiable cultural traits were sorted, classified and marked as cultural obligations (terminators) while others were rated as assets for the enhancement of organizational high performances (enablers), meant to be adopted for decision making. Where there are challenges of cultural adaptations, the benefits are unquantifiable in dynamic reforms. This study is therefore useful for policy formulation and decision making in the oil and gas sector and for performance evaluation.\nKeywords: Organizational culture, Performance evaluation, Core values, Team work.</jats:p>"

This article examines the social role played by royal sites in terms of integrating the population of the Castilian kingdom from the reign of Philip IV (1621-1665) onwards. During his rule the bonds between the royal possessions and the central court were tightened more than ever before, and, as a result, the material resources of these royal sites were used to provide those servants with retirement deals, creating a system of social welfare for those directly or indirectly related to the royal households and royal sites, especially at the middle and lower levels of society.</jats:p>"

Previous observational studies have found evidence for double-peaked line profiles for the rotational transitions of several molecules, which cannot be accounted for with the models presently available for the physical structure of the source, without ad hoc up-scaling of the infall velocity. We ran one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a core with L1544-like properties (in terms of mass and outer radius), using a state-of-the-art chemical model with a very large chemical network combined with an extensive description of molecular line cooling, determined via radiative transfer simulations, with the aim of determining whether these expansions of the simulation setup (as compared to previous models) can lead to a higher infall velocity. After running a series of simulations where the simulation was sequentially simplified, we found that the infall velocity is almost independent of the size of the chemical network or the approach to line cooling. We conclude that chemical evolution does not have a large impact on the infall velocity, and that the higher infall velocities that are implied by observations may be the result of the core being more dynamically evolved than what is now thought, or alternatively the average density in the simulated core is too low. However, chemistry does have a large influence on the lifetime of the core, which varies by about a factor of two across the simulations and grows longer when the chemical network is simplified. Therefore, although the model is subject to several sources of uncertainties, the present results clearly indicate that the use of a small chemical network leads to an incorrect estimate of the core lifetime, which is naturally a critical parameter for the development of chemical complexity in the precollapse phase.</jats:p>",

The study is performed on Swedish single-word items.\nThe four hypotheses we examine are: (1) there is core vocabulary for each proficiency level, but this is only true until CEFR level B2 (upper-intermediate); (2) core vocabulary shows more systematicity in its behavior and usage, whereas peripheral items have more idiosyncratic behavior; (3) given that we have truly core items (aka anchor items) for each level, we can place any new unseen item in relation to the identified core items by using a series of comparative judgment tasks, this way assigning a “target” level for a previously unseen item; and (4) non-experts will perform on par with experts in a comparative judgment setting. The hypotheses have been largely confirmed: In relation to (1) and (2), our results show that there seems to be some systematicity in core vocabulary for early to mid-levels (A1-B1) while we find less systematicity for higher levels (B2-C1). In relation to (3), we suggest crowdsourcing word rankings using comparative judgment with known anchor words as a method to assign a “target” level to unseen words. With regard to (4), we confirm the previous findings that non-experts, in our case language learners, can be effectively used for the linguistic annotation tasks in a comparative judgment setting.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Biological modularity enhances evolutionary adaptability by allowing rearrangement of functional components. One striking example are bacterial viruses (phages). They exhibit extensive genomic modularity by being built of independent functional modules that evolve separately and combine in various ways, making them astoundingly diverse. While multiple studies have investigated genomic modularity in phages, less attention has been given to protein modularity—proteins having distinct building blocks or domains that can evolve and recombine, enhancing functional and genetic diversity. To better understand the impact of protein modularity on viral evolution, we quantified it by detecting instances of domain mosaicism, defined as a homologous fragment sharing between two otherwise unrelated proteins. We used highly sensitive homology detection to quantify domain mosaicism between pairs of 133,574 representative phage proteins and to understand its relationship with functional diversity in phage genomes. We found that diverse functional classes often shared homologous domains. This phenomenon was often linked to protein modularity, particularly in receptor-binding proteins, endolysins and DNA polymerases. We also identified multiple instances of recent diversification via exchange and gain/loss of domains in receptor-binding proteins, neck passage structures, endolysins and some members of the core replication machinery. Diversification via protein fragment exchange often transcended distant taxonomic and ecological borders. We argue that the ongoing diversification via shuffling of protein domains associated with those functions is reflective of co-evolutionary arms race and the resulting diversifying selection to overcome multiple mechanisms of bacterial resistance against phages.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the flexibility of the nanofiber network may be further enhanced by engineering the network topology. Therefore, in this study, the topologies of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-Pt core-shell nanofiber (CS NF) networks were engineered, and their performances as flexible transparent electrodes were comprehensively evaluated. Three distinct topologies of nanofiber networks were induced using circular, square, and rectangular electrode collectors. A highly uniform nanofiber network was obtained using the square electrode collector, which generated a high density of nanofiber junctions (nodes). Consequently, this nanofiber network exhibited the smallest sheet resistance (Rs) and lowest optical transmittance (T) among the three CS NF networks. In contrast, nanofiber bundles were frequently formed in the randomly aligned CS NF network prepared using the circular electrode collector, reducing the node density. As a result, it simultaneously exhibited a very small Rs and high T, generating the largest percolation figure of merit (Π = 330.5). Under certain strain directions, the CS NF network with the engineered topology exhibited a significantly enhanced mechanical durability. Finally, a flexible piezoelectric pressure sensor with CS NF network electrodes was fabricated and its sensing performance was excellent.</jats:p>"

A 2.5% of households (368) was adopted as sample size. The landlord or the most senior household head was interviewed using a structured socio-economic questionnaire. The photograph of scenes of interest were taken to supplement information from the questionnaire. The DDAs formed the basis for questionnaire administration. Empirical analysis shows that there is poverty in the study area due to underemployment and low income.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, we reported for the first time the effect of butanol isomerization on the photothermal production of hydrogen in the presence of a noble, metal-free Ti@TiO2 core-shell photocatalyst. The experiments were performed in aqueous solutions of 1-BuOH, 2-BuOH, and t-BuOH under Xe lamp irradiation (vis/NIR: 8.4 W, UV: 0.6 W) at 35–69 °C. The increase in temperature significantly enhanced H2 formation, indicating a strong photothermal effect in the studied systems. However, in dark conditions, H2 emission was not observed even at elevated temperatures, which clearly points out the photonic origin of H2 photothermal formation. The rate of H2 production followed the order of 1-BuOH &gt;&gt; 2-BuOH &gt; t-BuOH in the entire range of studied temperatures. In the systems with 1-BuOH and 2-BuOH, hydrogen was the only gaseous product measured online in the outlet carrier argon using mass spectrometry. By contrast, a mixture of H2, CH4, and C2H6 was detected for t-BuOH, indicating a C–C bond scission with this isomer during photocatalytic degradation. The apparent activation energies, Ea, with 1-BuOH/2-BuOH isomers (20–21 kJ·mol−1) was found to be larger than for t-BuOH (13 kJ·mol−1). The significant difference in thermal response for 1-BuOH/2-BuOH and t-BuOH isomers was ascribed to the difference in the photocatalytic mechanisms of these species. The photothermal effect with 1-BuOH/2-BuOH isomers can be explained by the thermally induced transfer of photogenerated, shallowly trapped electron holes to highly reactive free holes at the surface of TiO2 and the further hole-mediated cleavage of the O-H bond. In the system with t-BuOH, another mechanism could also contribute to the overall process through hydrogen abstraction from the C–H bond by an intermediate •OH radical, leading to CH3• group ejection. Formation of •OH radicals during light irradiation of Ti@TiO2 nanoparticle suspension in water has been confirmed using terephthalate dosimetry. This analysis also revealed a positive temperature response of •OH radical formation.</jats:p>"

The coupling effect of the axial and bending displacements owing to the presence of the soft core was considered. Classical beam theory was employed for analyzing the top and bottom layers, and only the shear deformation was applied for the core layer. The frequency determinant was deduced using the transfer matrix method. The efficacy of the method was demonstrated through a comparison with the natural frequencies obtained in previous studies. To determine the physical phenomena caused by the exchange process in the order of modes of such beams, a new analytical method is proposed. As an example, the dynamic behavior of a three-layered beam was analyzed by examining the changes in the strain energies related to the natural frequencies and mode shapes. All bending-dominated modes were accompanied by the axial displacements because of the existence of a core layer, whereas the axial-dominated modes were uncoupled with the bending displacements. In addition, the efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated through relevant discussions of the predicted results.</jats:p>"

Research has largely missed the individual differences in people that may either promote or hinder their ambidextrous behavior. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of core self-evaluation as a broad personality trait in determining the ambidextrous behaviors of employees at an individual level. This study also investigates the role of learning goal orientation as a mediator between core self-evaluation and individual ambidexterity.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach-This study uses data from 396 managerial level employees collected through structured questionnaires in two waves from various organizations across multiple industries. Data is analyzed through Hayes Process Macro using SPSS and Amos v.24.\nFindings -The data analysis shows that core self-evaluation has a positive impact on individual ambidexterity and that learning goal orientation mediates the relationship between core self-evaluation and individual ambidexterity.\nPractical Implications-This study offers significant implications for human resource managers and top management of the organization by highlighting the importance of selecting employees with positive core self-evaluation and the importance of encouraging those employees to set learning-oriented goals.\nOriginality/Value-Very few researchers have studied the impact of the personality trait of core self-evaluation on complex but desired behavioural outcomes in organizations. The individual differences between employees play an important role in their behavioural manifestations, hence, understanding the differences is crucial to achieving goals and success. This study positively contributes to the literature on core self-evaluation and individual ambidexterity by demonstrating a positive link between them.</jats:p>"

However, a complete understanding of biological temperature adaptation is lacking, in part because of the unique constraints among different evolutionary lineages and physiological groups. Here we compared the genomes of cultivated psychrotolerant and thermotolerant methanogens, which are physiologically related and span growth temperatures from −2.5°C to 122°C. Despite being phylogenetically distributed amongst three phyla in the archaea, the genomic core of cultivated methanogens comprises about one-third of a given genome, while the genome fraction shared by any two organisms decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between them. Increased methanogenic growth temperature is associated with reduced genome size, and thermotolerant organisms—which are distributed across the archaeal tree—have larger core genome fractions, suggesting that genome size is governed by temperature rather than phylogeny. Thermotolerant methanogens are enriched in metal and other transporters, and psychrotolerant methanogens are enriched in proteins related to structure and motility. Observed amino acid compositional differences between temperature groups include proteome charge, polarity and unfolding entropy. Our results suggest that in the methanogens, shared physiology maintains a large, conserved genomic core even across large phylogenetic distances and biology’s temperature extremes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Restoration of endodontically treated teeth (ETT) is distinct from root canal treatment although they are mutually dependent in planning, treatment and prognosis. The fabrication of full coverage crowns with or without the use of posts remains the long-established means of restoration of endodontically treated teeth. Despite all the clinical success achieved with intraradicular posts, they have been criticized for removal of sound tissue and risk of root perforation. With the amelioration of adhesive techniques and invention of newer materials, the concept of endocrown has been considered as an alternative and viable method for restoration of root canal treated molars. It is an indirect monoblock restoration aimed to achieve a bonded biomimetic reconstruction. The preparation is simple following minimally invasive principles of adhesive dentistry compared to conventional crowns with post and core. They have the advantage of removing lower amounts of sound tissue compared to other techniques, and with much lower chair time needed. Also, the masticatory stresses received at the tooth/ restoration interface are more properly dissipated along the overall restored tooth structure when endocrowns are placed. The rationale of the preparation was to use surface area available in the pulp chamber to gain stability and retention through adhesive cementation. The supragingival positioning of restorative margins prevents interferences with periodontal tissues. This article highlights a case report where a porcelain fused to metal endocrown is fabricated to effectively manage a grossly mutilated endodontically treated tooth and was followed up for one year.</jats:p>"

Specimens with a 90 mm top layer of High Strength Concrete (HSC) and a 90 mm bottom layer of Lightweight Aggregate Concrete (LWAC) were examined. Nine full-scale slabs with dimensions of 1600* 450* 180 mm were tested under a 4-point loading test. The %core, a/d, RFT ratio, and connection method were the different studied parameters. A push-out test was conducted on triplet specimens to study the bond strength at the interface between HSC jacket and LWAC cubes using bond agent material or shear dowels, or without treatment, to determine which method of them is suitable for connecting the two layers of the tested slabs. Load, deflection, ductility, strain, crack pattern, and mode of failure were studied. The results indicate that ultimate strength is enhanced with decreasing a/d and %core and with an increasing RFT ratio of the LHCS specimens. Using shear dowels ensures an efficient bond between the two layers of the tested slabs. ANSYS program used for modelling the slab. The numerical study accepted the experimental data with a variation of less than 10% for all slabs. </jats:p>"

The main problem of using chemical based shampoo is the increase in hair fall instead of dropping it. In this perspective, the present study focused on the formulation and development of harmless organic shampoo from natural ingredients. An approach in reducing the chemical ingredients is by incorporating natu-ral herbal extracts whose functionality can be studied by comparing with chemical ingredients. The shampoo contained aqueous extracts of Fenugreek (seeds), Reetha seeds and Rice water. Small amounts of black pepper and honey was added to nourish the scalp, glycerine to adjust the pH, lecithin powder and essential oils to use as preservatives. The physicochemical parameters the prepared shampoo such as color, clarity, pH, dirt dispersion and, the percentage of solid content and foaming ability were carried out. It was found that the prepared organic shampoo was clear and dark to light brown in colour. The pH of the shampoo ranges from 5.20-5.50. It has good foaming ability and cleaning capacity.

The heat preservation and feeding effect of the riser can effectively reduce the occurrence of shrinkage cavity and porosity in the casting. Therefore, the insulation effect of the riser is an important index to evaluate sand mold design. In this study, a hollow sand core was designed and used for casting a cylindrical thin-walled part by the binder jetting 3D printing method. The temperature change curve of the hollow core during the No. 35 steel pouring process and the riser site during the A356 aluminum alloy solidification process in this sand mold was tested to explore the effect of the hollow core on the cooling process. The A356 pouring results showed that the concretion time of the riser with a hollow core was prolonged by over 20%; the cooling rate of casting was accelerated by over 20% by applying this hollow core before sand shakeout. The No. 35 steel pouring facts reflected that the temperature rise rate of the solid core was more visible than that of the hollow core in the early process of casting solidification. The work in this paper indicated that a sand core with a hollow structure could not only accelerate casting cooling but also draw out the concretion duration of the riser to improve its supplying function and can reduce the thermal expansion of the sand core. This study provides a new and effective design idea for 3D printed sand core, which can be used as a reference for the design of 3D sand core molds and the research of casting solidification and cooling.</jats:p>",

The interface and volume fraction contour between three immiscible fluids are captured using a ternary phase-field model. Previous research has shown that the effective parameters of microdroplet size are the physical properties and velocity of the three phases. By adjusting these variables, five main flow patterns are observed in numerical simulations. A core/shell dripping/slug regime is observed when the inertia of the continuous phase breaks the flow of the core and shell phases and makes a droplet. In the slug regime, the continuous phase has less inertia, and the droplets that form are surrounded by the channel walls, while in the dripping regime, the shell phase fluid is surrounded by the continuous phase. An increase in continuous-fluid or shell-fluid flow rate leads to dripping to a jetting transition. When three immiscible liquids flow continuously and parallel to one another without dispersing, this is known as laminar flow. In the tubing regime, the core phase flows continuously in the channel's central region, the shell phase flows in the annulus formed by the core phase's central region, and the continuous phase flows between the shell phase fluid and channel walls. In order to discriminate between the aforementioned flow patterns using Weber and Capillary numbers and establish regime transition criteria based on these two dimensionless variables, a flow regime map is provided. Finally, a correlation for shell thickness using shell-to-core phase velocity ratio and conducting 51 CFD simulations was proposed.</jats:p>"

Our best-performing rules are so-called large-style rules—that is, they provide better incentives to bidders with larger values.

With the rapid development of power grid engineering, the power grid’s capacity is increasing, and the transmission capacity of the cable is also growing. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the cable carrying capacity. This paper puts forward some methods to enhance the current-carrying capacity of the cable, taking a 110 kV cable as an example, including adopting a reasonable cable arrangement, adopting proper grounding mode and segment length, and reducing the external thermal resistance of the cable and adopting reasonable laying mode. The above methods are calculated and analyzed, and the influence degree of the above methods on the current carrying capacity of the cable is counted, which provides a reference and basis for the design and selection of power cables in the future. Combined with the theoretical calculation and engineering practice of the current carrying capacity of the cable, the cable diameter is reasonably selected, the engineering investment is reduced, and the urban power grid is well constructed to provide a stable power guarantee for urban construction.</jats:p>",

Results show that both the specialized digital economy’s core industry agglomeration and the diversified digital economy’s core industry agglomeration can significantly improve GTFP, and both have significant spatial spillover effects. At the same time, the impact of the digital economy’s core industry agglomeration on GTFP is spatial heterogeneity. GTFP in the eastern region can be significantly enhanced by the digital economy’s core industry agglomeration, and the specialized digital economy’s core industry agglomeration has a significant negative spillover effect on GTFP in the eastern region. In the contrast, GTFP in the mid-western region can be significantly enhanced only by the specialized digital economy’s core industry agglomeration, and the digital economy’s core industry agglomeration has no significant spatial spillover effect on GTFP in the mid-western region.

This study aims to understand the nature of the urban expansion of Chennai city, located on India’s southeastern coast, by determining the urban growth pattern and identifying the urban sprawl areas. The urban growth pattern and sprawl areas between 1998 and 2019 are identified using remote sensing data through the delineation of the Urban Core Boundary (UCB). The urban areas were extracted from the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification using combined classification technique to delineate the UCB. All the findings were validated using ground truth information. LULC classification performed with an accuracy of more than 90 % for urban land cover revealed an increase in urban cover by 71.77% from 1998 to 2009 and</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>36.91 % from 2009 to 2019.

A multi-modal approach has led to modest improvement in survival in recent years but surgery remains the cornerstone of curative treatment. A variety of surgical approaches are available, including newer minimally-invasive techniques: laparoscopic and robotic surgery. Determining the optimal approach requires appraisal of high-quality evidence, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews with meta-analyses. However, heterogeneity within the literature hinders this, allowing little consensus. Surgical trials often report different outcomes and even the same outcome may be defined or measured differently. This challenge spans specialties and has been addressed by the development of core outcome sets (COS): a standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported as a minimum. The GASTROS group developed a COS for gastric cancer surgical trials. This process involved key stakeholders, patients and clinicians, better reflecting their priorities. These core outcomes are disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, surgery-related death, recurrence, completeness of tumour removal, overall quality of life, nutritional effects, and ‘serious’ adverse events. The aim of this review was to determine what proportion of trials report these core outcomes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This review was an update of an earlier systematic review by our group spanning years 1996 to 2016. We systematically reviewed databases Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from the years 2016 to 2021, specifically focusing on ‘type 2’ surgical RCTs: trials comparing two or more therapeutic surgical interventions. We separately reviewed systematic reviews of RCTs. The data extracted was outcomes reported, definitions, measuring tools used and when outcomes were measured.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A total of 2213 abstracts were screened and 295 included. After full paper review this yielded 53 relevant articles. A further 47 articles from our previous systematic review were included. Twenty-two systematic reviews of RCTs were also identified.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Of the 101 trials, no trial reported all core outcomes. Serious adverse events were reported by nearly all trials, 98.4%, but these were reported heterogeneously; as pooled and individual complications and graded using different severity tools. Other commonly reported outcomes were surgery-related death, 85.3%, and completeness of tumour resection, 73.8%. Survival outcomes were often reported as overall survival. Only 54.1% reported disease-free survival 54.10% and even fewer, 4.9%, reported disease-specific survival. Tumour recurrence was reported by just over a third of trials. Outcomes likely to be most important to patients, quality of life and nutritional effects, were reported least at 23% and 16.4% respectively. Over the past 25 years there has been no significant improvement in the reporting of core outcomes. An expectedly similar spread of outcome reporting was seen in systematic reviews of RCTs, with serious adverse events and surgery-related death reported most and quality of life, nutritional effects and survival outcomes reported least.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Surgical trials must report outcomes relevant to key stakeholders, importantly patients as well as surgeons. This review demonstrates that outcomes from the COS are poorly reported at present. The value of the COS needs to be disseminated to the wider research community in order to increase its uptake. As part of this, we intend to contact ongoing trials with the results of this review. Consistent reporting of core outcomes in future will allow for meaningful appraisal of evidence, ultimately improving clinical outcomes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding variation in abundance within species' ranges is fundamental for ecological and evolutionary theory and applied conservation science. The abundant‐center model provides a general hypothesis based on basic ecological principles and macroscale biogeographic patterns: abundance should peak near the center of a species' range, where environmental conditions are most favorable, and decline towards the periphery. Despite longstanding influence in ecological thinking, consistent support for the ubiquity of abundant‐center distributions remains elusive, and recent assessments have questioned the value of this paradigm altogether. We suggest that revisiting the simplifying assumptions that underly the model provides a productive path forward by clarifying predictions and revealing expectations for alternative distribution patterns. Towards this end, we use standardized abundance surveys of North American birds to reassess the prevalence of abundant‐center distributions in geographic and climate space, test whether deviations are associated with predictable violations of assumptions, and provide more robust expectations. After accounting for common methodological pitfalls, we find that geographic centrality is generally indicative of centrality in climate space (confirming a key model assumption) and that abundant‐center distributions occurred in 71% of passerines. To better understand exceptions, we introduce the concept of abundant‐core distributions, of which the abundant‐center is a special case. We find that 87% of species fit abundant‐core expectations, with abundances peaked and generally declining from a core region within the range. Abundance cores tended to deviate from geographic center where topographic features complicate correspondence between geography and environmental conditions (e.g. the climatically heterogenous west). Such deviations were often associated with truncated climatic availability, with core regions offset towards the continental edge or climate extremes. Overall, our analyses suggest that abundant‐center thinking provides a useful generalization for understanding spatial variation in abundance for many species. However, as with any model, its assumptions must be assessed within the context of given applications.</jats:p>",

Ninety male athletes at the age of 12 were randomly divided into three equal groups (30 in each). Group 1 underwent core strengthening training, group 2 underwent weight training, and group 3 was the control. The training was for 12 weeks, with three sessions per week (one hour per session). Prior to and after the training, abdominal strength, endurance, and flexibility were evaluated using the sit-ups test, the Cooper 12 min run test and the sit and reach test. The analysis of variance was used to analyze pre- and post-intervention data. The results showed that both the core strength training group and the weight training group significantly (p = 0.00) improved in abdominal strength, represented by the number of sit-ups (from 18.70 ± 3.20 to 22.21 ± 3.50 and from 17.60 ± 3.29 to 21.60 ± 3.63, respectively); endurance, represented by distance covered in 12 min (from 1817 ± 185.78 m to 2008.97 ± 214.79 m and from 1806 ± 237.25 m to 2002.59 ± 83.32 m, respectively); and flexibility, represented by the sit and reach distance (from 23.48 ± 2.75 cm to 25.96 ± 2.38 cm and from 23.66 ± 2.92 cm to 25.86 ± 2.55 cm, respectively) when compared to the control group (from 17.20 ± 3.20 to 16.39 ± 2.69; from 1813 ± 224.69 m to 1778.15 ± 05.28 m; from 23.46 ± 3.06 cm to 21.76 ± 2.56 cm). More specifically, abdominal strength and endurance improved slightly more in the weight training group than in the core strength training group, whilst flexibility increased slightly more in the core strength training group than in the weight training group. These findings indicate that both core strengthening training and weight training are effective in improving physical fitness in school-aged athletes; however, the improvement is to differing extents regarding their endurance, flexibility, and abdominal strength.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the present work, the low-velocity impact characteristics of the spherical core sandwich structures made of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) are tested at different strike velocities (3, 5, and 7 m/s). Four different types of core orientation, namely, regular, interlock, inverted, and stagger, are designed and fabricated by the hand-layup method. Vinyl ester resin and woven glass fibre fabrics are used as matrices and reinforcements, respectively. The diameter of the spherical core and the pitch distance is chosen as 16 mm and 32 mm, respectively. The impact behaviour of the novel spherical sandwich structures is examined based on the maximum contact force, energy absorption capacity, coefficient of restitution (COR), and damage behaviour. The Regular model shows enhanced energy absorption capacity with a specific absorbed energy of 0.092 J/(kg/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) at 7 m/s impact velocity. Similarly the Interlock model shows good damage resistance. The typical failure patterns observed in the Interlock model at 3 m/s are matrix cracking (MC) and fibre breakage (FB), whereas, at 5 and 7 m/s impact velocities, the damage core crushing (C) is observed. </jats:p>",

Foam core sandwich structures stand out as the most ideal materials in terms of providing both weight reduction and strength conditions in the bodies of electric individual and public transportation vehicles. In this study, EPP foams with two different densities were placed between aluminum plates and sandwich structures were obtained by combining the two structures with an EVA-based adhesive. Compression and bending behaviors of the produced sandwich structures were investigated under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. With the tests carried out, the strength of the sandwich structures and the amount of energy they absorb were calculated and compared experimentally. According to the results obtained, it was observed that the denser D2 foam exhibited approximately 1.4 to 2.05 times more strength than the lower density D1 foam in all tests. In terms of the energy they absorb, the D2 foam absorbs 1.25 to 2.5 times more energy than the other foam. Contrary to this situation, only the dynamic compression test occurred in the tests performed. When the post-damage behavior of the sandwich structures was examined, it was also observed that the D2 foam returned to a very similar dimensions to its original size, giving more of the deformation after the damage at the end of 72 hours.</jats:p>"

While timescales between the core and periphery region diverge, features of their power spectra, especially scale‐free dynamics during resting‐state and their mdulation in task states, remain unclear. To answer this question, we investigated the ~1/<jats:italic>f</jats:italic>‐like pink noise manifestation of scale‐free dynamics in the core‐periphery topography during rest and task states applying infra‐slow inter‐trial intervals up to 1 min falling inside the BOLD's infra‐slow frequency band. The results demonstrate (1) higher resting‐state power‐law exponent (PLE) in the core compared to the periphery region; (2) significant PLE increases in task across the core and periphery regions; and (3) task‐related PLE increases likely followed the task's atypically low event rates, namely the task's periodicity (inter‐trial interval = 52–60 s; 0.016–0.019 Hz). A computational model and a replication dataset that used similar infra‐slow inter‐trial intervals provide further support for our main findings. Altogether, the results show that scale‐free dynamics differentiate core and periphery regions in the resting‐state and mediate task‐related effects.</jats:p>",

Because they have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their core, they burn the hydrogen in the surrounding shell . Once the helium in the core starts fusing, the star enters the clump phase, which is identified as a striking feature in the color-magnitude diagram. Since clump stars share similar observational properties, they are heavily used in astrophysical studies, as probes of distance, extinction through the galaxy, galaxy density, and stellar chemical evolution. In this work, we perform the detailed observational characterization of the deepest layers of clump stars using asteroseismic data from Kepler. We find evidence for large core structural discontinuities in about 6.7% of the stars in our sample, implying that the region of mixing beyond the convective core boundary has a radiative thermal stratification. These stars are otherwise similar to the remaining stars in our sample, which may indicate that the building of the discontinuities is an intermittent phenomenon.</jats:p>"

Previous studies reported that those behavioral abnormalities can be associated with corpus callosum organization. However, little is known about the specific differences in white matter structure of the corpus callosum parts in children with ASD and TD peers and their relationships to core and comorbid symptoms of ASD. The aim of the study was to investigate the volumetric and microstructural characteristics of the corpus callosum parts crucially involved in social, language, and non-verbal IQ behavior in primary-school-aged children with ASD and to assess the relationships between these characteristics and behavioral measures.\n<jats:italic>Method:</jats:italic> 38 children (19 with ASD, 19 typically developing (TD)) were scanned using diffusion-weighted MRI and behaviorally assessed. The tractography of the corpus callosum parts were performed using Quantitative Imaging Toolkit software; diffusivity and volumetric measurements were extracted and analyzed.\n<jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> In the ASD group, fractional anisotropy (FA) was decreased across the supplementary motor area and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, axial diffusivity (AD) was reduced across each of the corpus callosum parts in comparison to the TD group. Importantly, the AD decrease was related to worse language abilities and more severe autistic traits in individuals with ASD.\n<jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> The microstructure of the corpus callosum parts differs between children with and without ASD. Abnormalities in white matter organization of the corpus callosum parts are associated with core and comorbid symptoms of ASD.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The measurement of physical parameters is important in many current applications, since they often rely on these measurands to operate with the due quality and the necessary safety. In this work, a simple and robust optical fiber sensor based on an antiresonant hollow square core fiber (HSCF) is proposed to measure simultaneously temperature, strain, and curvature. The proposed sensor was designed in a transmission configuration where a segment of HSCF, with a 10 mm length, was spliced between two single mode fibers. In this sensor, a cladding modal interference (CMI) and a Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI) are enhanced along with the antiresonance (AR) guidance. All the present mechanisms exhibit different responses towards the physical parameters. For the temperature, sensitivities of 32.8 pm/°C, 18.9 pm/°C, and 15.7 pm/°C were respectively attained for the MZI, AR, and CMI. As for the strain, sensitivities of 0.45 pm/με, -0.93 pm/με, and -2.72 pm/με were acquired for the MZI, AR and CMI respectively. Meanwhile, for the curvature measurements, two regions of analysis were considered. In the first region (0 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> - 0.7 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) sensitivities of 0.033 nm/m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, -0.27 nm/m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and -2.21 nm/m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> were achieved, whilst for the second region (0.7 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> - 1.5 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) sensitivities of 0.067 nm/m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, -0.63 nm/m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and -0.49 nm/m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> were acquired for the MZI, AR and CMI, respectively.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to explore the associations between agility and core endurance on visual reaction time among adult male amateur badminton players. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amateur male badminton players between 12–25 years were recruited and assessed on visual reaction time, agility and core endurance using deary liewald reaction time software, T test and prone bridge test respectively. Pearson correlation test was used to analyze the data for correlation while Mann Whitney U test was used to find the difference, if any, between the adolescent and adult players in terms of reaction time, agility and core endurance. Data analysis was done using SPSS software version 23. RESULT: Ninety amateur male badminton players in the age group of 12–25 years were included in the study. Data analysis was done for adolescent players (n = 45 of 12–17 years) and young adult players (n = 45 of 17–25 years). A positive correlation was obtained between reaction time and agility in both adolescents’ and young adults and the entire population with r value 0.413, 0.082, and 0.244 respectively. A negative correlation was seen between reaction time and core endurance in adolescents, young adults and whole group with r value –0.283, –0.267, –0.272 respectively. CONCLUSION: Amateur badminton players who had good agility displayed faster reaction time while those having poor core endurance showed slower reaction time.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the water repellent core materials were produced by standard sands combined with water repellent laterite modified by octadecylamine. The water-repellent degree and shear strength tests were carried out to obtain the change laws of water content, soil-rock ratio and octadecylamine content of shear strength of the specimens. It is shown that: (1) when the content of octadecylamine is 0.6%, the water drop penetration time (WDPT) of the specimens decreased gradually with the increase of soil-rock ratio in dry condition. The maximum WDPT is 2966s and the minimum WDPT is 2182s, which are severely water repellent. With the increase of water content, the change laws of WDPT increased firstly and then decreased, and the WDPT reached the peak value when the water content was from 10–15%, which are extremely water repellent. (2) With the increase of water content, the shear strength of the specimens increased continuously, in which the effect on soil cohesion is more than the effect on internal friction angle. (3) With the increase of soil-rock ratio, the shear strength of the specimens increased gradually and the maximum increasing range was 92.36% when the soil-rock ratio was less than 5%. (4) With the increase of octadecylamine content, the shear strength of specimens decreased gradually, and the maximum decreasing range was 12.44%. The soil-rock ratio and water content has a greater effect on shear strength, while the octadecylamine content has a less effect on shear strength.</jats:p>"

By comprehensively examining the spectral formation processes of allowed transitions (Fe <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>, Fe <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, and the Ca <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> near-IR triplet) and forbidden transitions ([Ca <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>]<jats:italic>λλ</jats:italic>7292, 7324 and [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>]), we quantitatively constrain the nature of the innermost region and find that it is distinct from the outer ejecta; the mass of the innermost component is ∼0.03 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> dominated by Fe (which can initially be <jats:sup>56</jats:sup>Ni), expanding with a velocity of ∼760 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. We argue that the nature of the inner component is explained by the failed/weak white-dwarf thermonuclear explosion scenario. We suggest that a fraction of the <jats:sup>56</jats:sup>Ni-rich materials initially confined in (the envelope of) the bound remnant can later be ejected by the energy input through the <jats:sup>56</jats:sup>Ni/Co/Fe decay, forming the <jats:italic>second</jats:italic> unbound ejecta component which manifests itself as the inner dense component seen in the late phase.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose a helical broken-circular-symmetry core microstructured optical fiber for refractive index sensing. The proposed fiber consists of pure silica and its noncircular helical core is formed by a broken air ring. By using finite element modeling combined with transformation optics, the modal characteristics of the fiber are investigated in detail. The results show that for the core located at the fiber center, the confinement loss of fundamental core modes increases with twist rate, whereas for a sufficiently large core offset the modes can be well confined owing to the twist-induced light guidance mechanism, showing decreases with rising twist rate in the loss spectra. Moreover, we have found that for large twist rates and core offsets, resonant peaks occur at different twist rates due to the couplings between the fundamental core modes and the highly leaky modes created by the helical structure. The refractive index sensing performance is also studied and the obtained results show that the proposed fiber has great potential in fiber sensing.</jats:p>"

Similarly, we proposed that environmental identity, a well-studied antecedent of pro-environmental behaviors (PEBS), are also related to a specific form of PEBS – again, OCB-E. The specific relations of these antecedents to OCB-E, to the best of our knowledge, had never been tested. Drawing on the goal-self concordance model, we tested goal self-concordance as a mediating mechanism in each of these relationships. Results drawn from a sample of 297 employees from diverse organizations support goal self-concordance as a relevant mediator between core self-evaluations and OCB, but not for the remaining relationships. Still, environmental identity, as well as core self-evaluations, are positively and significantly related to OCB-E. We discuss implications for the conceptualization of OCB-E and ways to further study this concept.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we examine the impact of FFC on explosive nucleosynthesis by including the effects of FFC in conjunction with asymmetric ν emission into nucleosynthetic computations in a parametric way. We find that the ejecta compositions are not appreciably affected by FFC for elements lighter than Co while the compositions are influenced by FFC for the heavier elements. We also find that the role of FFC varies depending on the asymmetric degree of ν emission (masy) and the degree of ν-flavour mixing. The impact of FFC is not monotonic to masy. The change in the ejecta composition increases for higher masy up to ∼10 per cent compared with that without FFC, whereas FFC has little effect on the nucleosynthesis in very large asymmetric ν emission (${\\gtrsim}30\\,\\hbox{per cent}$). Our results suggest that FFC facilitates the production of neutron-rich ejecta in most cases, although it makes the ejecta more proton-rich if anti-ν conversion is more vigorous than that of ν. The key ingredient accounting for this trend is ν absorption, whose effects on nucleosynthesis can be quantified by simple diagnostics.</jats:p>",

Seventy-two undergraduate participants who scored in the top 35th percentile on trait anger were randomly assigned to: full MI (FMI), spirit-only MI (SOMI), or psychoeducation. They met individually with an experimenter for one 30- to 45-minute session to discuss their anger. In the FMI condition, the relational and technical elements of MI were both used to elicit change talk. In the SOMI condition, the supportive and relational elements of MI were emphasized. In the psychoeducation condition, the focus was placed on teaching the components of anger episodes. Participants were then asked to launch a daily, online, deep breathing exercise during the following week. Results showed that participants in both MI conditions emitted more change talk than those in the psychoeducation condition. Independent session ratings showed that despite the attempted elimination of technical elements in the SOMI condition, the FMI and SOMI conditions did not differ on the experimenter’s acceptance, empathy, direction, autonomy support, and collaboration. Also, results did not support the main effect on program launches. These results indicate it is challenging to separate relational from technical elements in MI and, thus, to identify core mechanisms of change.</jats:p>"

Associated health-related disciplines was the weakest subspecialty.\nConclusion: These subjects need to be prioritized in collection development. All subspecialties exhibited an increasing trend of matching between 2014 and 2020. Electronic books were included in the matching to DCT 2020; however, the match was low compared to print only or both print and electronic titles. DCT title matching can not only identify gaps in library collections that need to be filled but also point toward opportunities to develop strong and varied collections in medicine and allied health.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ants communicate via large arrays of pheromones and possess expanded, highly complex olfactory systems, with antennal lobes in the brain comprising ~500 glomeruli. This expansion implies that odors could activate hundreds of glomeruli, which would pose challenges for higher order processing. To study this problem, we generated the first transgenic ants, expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated ≤6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic-alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representation of alarm pheromone cues. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.</jats:p>"

Only 1/3 of youth with an identified SU need receive a treatment referral and even fewer initiate services.

The current study examines the comparative effectiveness of two bundled implementation intervention strategies for improving SU treatment initiation, engagement, and continuing care among justice-involved youth supervised in community settings. Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) served as the conceptual framework for study design and selection/timing of implementation intervention components, and the BH Services Cascade served as the conceptual and measurement framework for identifying and addressing gaps in service receipt.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Part of a larger Juvenile-Justice Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS) Cooperative, this study involved a multisite, cluster-randomized control trial where sites were paired then randomly assigned to receive Core (training teams on the BH Services Cascade and data-driven decision making; supporting goal selection) or Core+Enhanced (external facilitation of implementation teams) intervention components.

Coat damage due to the MUPS tableting process could undermine the sustained release function of the EC-coated pellets. Deformability of the pellet core is a factor that can impact the extent of pellet coat damage. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the relative performance of drug-loaded pellets prepared with either microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or crospovidone (XPVP) as a spheronization aid and were comparatively evaluated for their ability to withstand EC pellet coat damage when compacted. These pellets were tableted at various compaction pressures and pellet volume fractions. The extent of pellet coat damage was assessed by the change in drug release after compaction. The findings from this study demonstrated that pellets spheronized with XPVP had slightly less favorable physical properties and experienced comparatively more pellet coat damage than the pellets with MCC. However, MUPS tablets of reasonable quality could successfully be produced from pellets with XPVP, albeit their performance did not match that of vastly mechanically stronger pellets with MCC at higher compaction pressure.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to examine the functional movement scores of school-age children attending karate sports training and to compare them with the control group. Secondly, core strength and core endurance parameters were evaluated. The research was conducted on children aged 8-11 who have been attending karate training for at least one year within the Ministry of Youth and Sports (n=14) and who have just started this education (maximum 2 weeks) (n=14). Among the children included in the assessment, the mean age of the group that received karate training was 9.35 ± 2.12 years, and the mean age of the group that new beginners were 9.78 ± 0.8 years. There was a significant difference in hurdle step (both sides), shoulder mobility (right side), trunk stability push-up, rotary stability (both sides) and total FMS score between groups (p&amp;lt;0,05).

Six low-grade and 26 high-grade B-cell lymphomas were not further classified because of limited tissue. B-cell lymphomas were the largest category (73.0%): Primarily diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (21.4%), followed by follicular lymphoma (17.5%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (10.9%). A total of 140 cases (36.0%) had flow cytometry results, but 30 specimens (21.4%) were insufficient.

This paper examines the spatial and temporal patterns of the county-level COVID-19 case rates, fatality rates, and full vaccination rates in the United States from December 24, 2020 through September 30, 2021. Statistical and geospatial analyses show clear temporal and spatial patterns of the progression of COVID-19 outcomes and vaccinations. In the relationship between two time series, the fatality rates series was positively related to past lags of the case rates series. At the same time, case rates series and fatality rates series were negatively related to past lags of the full vaccination rates series. The lag level varies across urban and rural areas. The results of partial correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) also confirmed that the existing COVID-19 infections and different sets of socioeconomic, healthcare access, health conditions, and environmental characteristics were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccinations over time and space. These results empirically identify the geographic health disparities with COVID-19 vaccinations and outcomes and provide the evidentiary basis for targeting pandemic recovery and public health mitigation actions.</jats:p>"

Preliminary tests of cross-section dependence point to the existence of dependence among the cross sections after which second-generation testing procedures are applied. Spatial differential impact of infrastructure on the performance of manufacturing activity is estimated using fixed/random effect modelling. The empirical results show that infrastructure index exerts positive and significant impact on the manufacturing performance with estimate of 0.20 for all states in India and 0.49 for high-income states. Similarly, individual components of infrastructure influence manufacturing activity differently. Road infrastructure is influencing manufacturing performance negatively in high-income states while it is positive for other states; teledensity exerts positive influence in case of middle-income states while the impact is negative in case of low-income states. Dumitrescu and Hurlin’s causality test shows bidirectional causality from infrastructure to manufacturing output. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: D02, E62, H54, L94, L96 </jats:p>",

The core region is filled with the patient's blood samples, and the light is confined through the core region. The circular sensing ring is utilized for trouble-free penetration to cope with biosensing applications. Since the occurrence of the blood samples is very in-differentiable in the human body, these sensors play a valuable role due to their trimness, small size, litheness, and isolated competence to identify diagonisive elements in human blood.</jats:p>"

(n=10) Ten disks from PEEK blocks were only veneered with composite resins. A2 shade veneer material with 2mm thickness served as control for color evaluation. Color parameter were measured by spectrophotometer.\n<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>\nThe mean color differences of Cr-Co, Zirconia and PEEK samples veneered with composite were 2.91(±0.45), 3.24 (±0.33) and 2.75 (±0.35) and for Cr-Co and Zirconia in ceramic groups were 6.46(±0.32) and 1.97(±0.19) respectively. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test showed a significant difference between the core groups veneered with ceramic (P value=0.000).

To this end, multiple PDFs, denominated as components, are combined in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to represent the distribution of the E2E delay. The accuracy and computation time of the GMM is evaluated for a different number of components and a number of samples. The results presented in the paper are based on a dataset of E2E delay values sampled from both SA and NSA 5G networks. Finally, we show that the GMM can be adopted to estimate a high diversity of E2E delay patterns found in 5G networks and its computation time can be adequate for a large range of applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite great advances in X-ray absorption spectroscopy for the investigation of small molecule electronic structure, the application to biosystems of experimental techniques developed within this research field remains a challenge. To partially circumvent the problem, users resort to theoretical methods to interpret or predict the X-ray absorption spectra of large molecules. To accomplish this task, only low-cost computational strategies can be exploited. For this reason, some of them are single Slater determinant wavefunction approaches coupled with multiscale embedding techniques designed to treat large systems of biological interest. Therefore, in this work, we propose to apply the recently developed IMOM/ELMO embedding method to the determination of core-ionized states. The IMOM/ELMO technique resulted from the combination of the single Slater determinant Δself-consistent-field-initial maximum overlap approach (ΔSCF-IMOM) with the QM/ELMO (quantum mechanics/extremely localized molecular orbital) embedding strategy, a method where only the chemically relevant region of the examined system is treated at fully quantum chemical level, while the rest is described through transferred and frozen extremely localized molecular orbitals (ELMOs). The IMOM/ELMO technique was initially validated by computing core-ionization energies for small molecules, and it was afterwards exploited to study larger biosystems. The obtained results are in line with those reported in previous studies that applied alternative ΔSCF approaches. This makes us envisage a possible future application of the proposed method to the interpretation of X-ray absorption spectra of large molecules.</jats:p>"

The modulated pulses are split into two, and one is measured by an optical spectrum analyzer, whose output is detected by a lock-in amplifier, while the other is directly detected by a photodiode and its output is used as a reference signal of the lock-in amplifier.

For HCS to be able to increase its flexural and shear capacity, an overlay is used on the interface along the length of HCS. Overlay serves to create a continuous surface level and increase the load capacity of the slab. The advantage of using an overlay system, namely strength and serviceability, is available after the element is fully composite against the parent concrete. An analytical study will be carried out using Response-2000 version 1.0.5 program related to flexural behavior using two research configurations. The first configuration is HCS with overlay, with an overlay thickness of 50 mm. The second configuration is HCS without using an overlay. Therefore, the second specimen is referred to as a control specimen. The evaluation of the analysis results was reviewed based on the load-displacement curve, cracking load, displacement at cracking load, peak load, displacement at peak load, and cracking mode. The final result of this study is a form of validation to ensure the flexural behavior of the specimen in analytical modeling is consistent with the specimen in experimental studies.</jats:p>",

The nanoparticles were further entrapped in a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion system for a sustained release profile. The CMC/Fe3O4@SiO2/QC nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) to obtain insights into their size, stability, functional groups/chemical bonds, crystalline structure, morphology, and magnetic properties, respectively. The entrapment and loading efficiency were slightly improved after the incorporation of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs within the hydrogel network. The dialysis method was applied for drug release studies. It was found that the amount of QC released increased with the decrease in pH from 7.4 to 5.4, while the sustained-release pattern was preserved. The A549 cell line was chosen to assess the anticancer activity of the CMC/Fe3O4@SiO2/QC nanoemulsion and its components for lung cancer treatment via an MTT assay. The L929 cell line was used in the MTT assay to determine the possible side effects of the nanoemulsion. Moreover, a flow cytometry test was performed to measure the level of apoptosis and necrosis.

The application of core-shell nanostructures for supercapacitors is one of the effective strategies to achieve a high specific surface area for abundant reaction sites and good electrical conductivity for fast charge transfer, hence improving the performance of supercapacitors. Particularly, the use of NiMoO4 for the core-shell structure has drawn great attention due to its outstanding advantages, such as its natural abundance, low material cost, superior electrochemical performance, and wide electrochemical potential window in cyclic voltammetry. In this context, this review comprehensively covers the recent progress of the core-shell nanostructures based on the NiMoO4-composite materials, which find applications in supercapacitors. The composite materials that incorporate metal oxides such as NiMoO4, metal hydroxides, metal chalcogenides, carbon materials, and conductive polymers are discussed in detail for such core-shell nanostructures with the aim of understanding how the adopted materials and the relevant morphology govern the electrochemical features for supercapacitors. Finally, the existing challenges in current technologies for supercapacitors are discussed, while possible future directions in developing the NiMoO4-composite-based core-shell nanostructures are proposed for high-performance supercapacitors.</jats:p>"

In the brain, tomosyn inhibits fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs), whereas its role in the fusion of neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs) is unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a new mouse model allowing conditional deletion of tomosyn (<jats:italic>Stxbp5</jats:italic>) and its paralogue tomosyn-2 (<jats:italic>Stxbp5l</jats:italic>), and an assay that detects DCV exocytosis with single vesicle resolution in primary hippocampal neurons. Surprisingly, loss of both tomosyns did not affect DCV exocytosis but resulted in a strong reduction of intracellular levels of many DCV cargos, most prominently brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), granin VGF and prohormone convertase PCSK1. Reduced levels of DCV cargos were paralleled by decreased DCV size and impaired mRNA expression of the corresponding genes. We conclude that tomosyns regulate neuropeptide and neurotrophin secretion via control of DCV cargo production, and not at the step of cargo release. Our findings suggest a differential effect of tomosyn on the two main secretory pathways in mammalian neurons and argues against a conserved role of tomosyn as competitive inhibitor of SNARE complex formation.</jats:p>"

Our results suggest that the seismic anisotropy pattern in the inner core can be ascribed to the elastic anisotropy (6%) of hcp iron. The observed low shear wave velocity is largely produced by viscous grain boundaries in iron polycrystal. We also found highly mobile and abundant vacancies in hcp iron yield a viscous strength (10<jats:sup>15±1</jats:sup>) that is consistent with the geophysical observations.

Although in this class of phenomena the stalled supernova (SN) shock is not revived, the outer stellar envelope can still be partially ejected. This occurs because the hydrodynamic equilibrium of the star is disrupted by the gravitational mass loss of the protoneutron star (PNS) due to neutrino emission. We develop a simple parameterized model that emulates PNS evolution and its neutrino emission and use it to simulate failed CCSNe in spherical symmetry for a wide range of progenitor stars. Our model allows us to study mass ejection of failed CCSNe where the PNS collapses into a BH within ∼100 ms and up to ∼10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> s. We perform failed CCSNe simulations for 262 different pre-SN progenitors and determine how the energy and mass of the ejecta depend on progenitor properties and the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter.

During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>24</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>6−</jats:sup> may lead to the in situ generation of few analogous [Mo<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>n−</jats:sup> clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the γ‐FeO(OH) nanocore, Mo<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [Mo<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>n−</jats:sup>, they are covalently linked via Mo<jats:sup>VI</jats:sup>‐μ<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O‐Fe<jats:sup>III</jats:sup> bridging to γ‐FeO(OH) core in Mo<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidence.

Similar behavior is observed in turbulent dynamo simulations, where the short magnetic field decay time cannot be attributed to higher‐order decay modes. We interpret the short decay time as a signature of turbulent diffusion and show that mean‐field theory can quantitatively account for the dynamo results. The predictions depend on the amplitude and length scale of the flow that interacts with the magnetic field. We rely on the pairwise balance between Lorentz/Coriolis and buoyancy/Coriolis forces to identify the relevant part of the flow, and use the resulting flow properties to reproduce results from numerical dynamo simulations within their uncertainties. Upon extending these predictions to the paleomagnetic field, we find that the inferred decay time requires a bulk root‐mean‐square velocity less than 0.8–1.2 mm s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Somewhat lower velocities have been estimated at the top of the core from observations of secular variation. These results show that velocities in the interior of the core are constrained by paleomagnetic observations, and that the amplitude of this flow cannot substantially exceed estimates at the core surface.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, when they are on the verge of gravitational collapse, they show signs of subsonic infall motions. How extended these motions are, which depends on how the collapse occurs, remains largely unknown. We want to investigate the kinematics of the envelope that surrounds the prototypical prestellar core L1544, studying the cloud-core connection. To our aims, we observed the HCO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (1–0) transition in a large map. HCO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> is expected to be abundant in the envelope, making it an ideal probe of the large-scale kinematics in the source. We modeled the spectrum at the dust peak by means of a nonlocal thermodynamical equilibrium radiative transfer. In order to reproduce the spectrum at the dust peak, a large (∼1 pc) envelope is needed, with low density (tens of cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> at most) and contraction motions, with an inward velocity of ≈ 0.05 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. We fitted the data cube using the Hill5 model, which implements a simple model for the optical depth and excitation temperature profiles along the line of sight, in order to obtain a map of the infall velocity. This shows that the infall motions are extended, with typical values in the range 0.1–0.2 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Our results suggest that the contraction motions extend in the diffuse envelope surrounding the core, which is consistent with recent magnetic field measurements in the source, which showed that the envelope is magnetically supercritical.</jats:p>",

The attempt explaining why the frequency characteristics (modulus and phase) of the inductor complex impedance have such a character in a wide frequency band (up to 500 MHz) was made. It was shown that for constructing an equivalent circuit model (structure and parameters), measuring only the inductors resistance modulus is not enough. It is also necessary to measure the phase of the inductor complex resistance, which is ignored in many works on the synthesis of an e inductor equivalent circuit.

By using a thermoplastic matrix, they can be shaped by stamping processes, which allows for a more efficient production process than classical laminating methods such as vacuum bagging. In addition to the improved impact energy absorption efficiency, the metallic core can be utilised to effectively bond the composite part to adjacent metallic structures. This article presents the influence of the material configuration of fibre-metal laminates consisting of continuous fibre-reinforced thermoplastic outer layers integrated with a layer of metallic aluminium alloy inserts—a number of layers, type and direction of reinforcing fibres—on the static and fatigue flexural properties. In this study, eight laminate configurations were prepared using a one-step variothermal consolidation process. The results showed that in the three-point flexural fatigue test, the samples exceeded 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> cycles at stresses &lt;30% of the static bending strength. Laminates with predominantly longitudinally reinforced layers showed the highest fatigue strength among the FML samples analysed.

We infer temporal variations in ocean dimethyl sulfide emissions and find that springtime (April–June) fluxes of methane sulfonic acid correlate well with satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration in the Irminger Sea. Summertime (July–September) methane sulfonic acid fluxes were 3 to 6 times higher between 2002–2014 than 1972–2001. We attribute this to sea ice retreat day becoming earlier and a coincident increase in chlorophyll-a concentration in the adjacent open coastal waters.</jats:p>"

A modified DFIG equivalent circuit with multi-core resistance connected in parallel was adopted. State-space differential equations of the DFIG was developed incorporating iron and copper loss components while a minimum flux linkage that aids in the minimization of the overall losses was derived. Simulation results showed that losses were minimized when the equivalent core resistances were connected in parallel with minimum permissible current flow. The results obtained during a transient disturbance showed that at different core resistance values of Rfe = 0.75Ω and 0.25Ω, different efficiency values of 83.45% and 41.21% were realized. An unconstrained optimization test carried out on the DFIG variable parameters showed that the DFIG power loss model was controllable with a positive definite value of 691.9801 and 2.9156〖e〗^(+5) for the leading principal determinants of the Hessian matrix.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Functional safety is a key requirement in several application domains in which microprocessors are an essential part. A number of redundancy techniques have been developed with the common purpose of protecting circuits against single event upset (SEU) faults. In microprocessors, functional redundancy may be achieved through multi-core or simultaneous-multi-threading architectures, with techniques that are broadly classifiable as Double Modular Redundancy (DMR) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), involving the duplication or triplication of architecture units, respectively. RISC-V plays an interesting role in this context for its inherent extendability and the availability of open-source microarchitecture designs. In this work, we present a novel way to exploit the advantages of both DMR and TMR techniques in an Interleaved-Multi-Threading (IMT) microprocessor architecture, leveraging its replicated threads for redundancy, and obtaining a system that can dynamically switch from DMR to TMR in the case of faults. We demonstrated the approach for a specific family of RISC-V cores, modifying the microarchitecture and proving its effectiveness with an extensive RTL fault-injection simulation campaign.</jats:p>"

The spin waves were excited by applying microwaves via a wire antenna. The heat induced by the excitation and propagation of spin waves was measured using the lock-in thermography (LIT) technique by periodically modulating the microwave power. The LIT measurements resolved the heat source distributions inside the MC, which is made of an yttrium iron garnet film and periodic grooves with a sub-mm interval, in the backward volume wave geometry. The temperature distribution induced by the spin-wave excitation notably depends on the frequency or wave number of the spin waves, as a result of the formation of rejection bands in the MC. The observed temperature modulation profiles are complicated, but their behavior is consistent with a calculation based on the microwave transmission line approximation of the MCs, demonstrating the applicability of the LIT measurements to the investigation of the spin-wave dynamics in sub-mm scale MCs.</jats:p>",

We aimed to determine how the deficiencies in body/core muscle strength and proprioception may affect PFP development.&#x0D;\nMethods: Fifty patients with diffuse anterior knee pain and/or diagnosed with chondromalacia patella in the study group and 50 healthy adults in the control group were included in this prospective cross-sectional study. The patients with knee disorders except for chondromalacia patella, those who had lower extremity and spinal surgery, and/or had physical therapy in the last 3-months were excluded from the study. Active proprioceptive repositioning test and the prone-bridge test and side-bridge tests was used for primarily assessment of core muscles capacity. The knee functionality was evaluated with Kujala's knee score, and physical activity levels were evaluated with the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.&#x0D;\nResults: The mean age, weight, and median of body mass index were higher in the patient group while active working patients were significantly higher in control group. (p=0.041) The mean of Kujala, Prone-bridge, Side-bridge (right and left) tests were significantly higher in the control group than the patient group. (p=0.012) The mean Flex-30 test was significantly higher in the patient group than control group. (p=0.037) In the study group, there were very strong correlation between hyperextension of body and Kujala tests and between hyperextension of body and prone-bridge tests (p&lt;0.05) while, there was a very strong correlation between hyperextension of body and flex-30 tests in the control group.

However, the resolution of the routinely used destructive techniques is not suitable for the analysis of a large number of samples due to cost. Non-destructive analysis of chlorophyll-a performed by hyperspectral imagery enables the quick determination of indices of past primary productivity. Eighteen indices used in paleo-environmental reconstruction were inventoried to define the best index capable of tracking chlorophyll-a by this technique. All the indices were applied to hyperspectral data measured on the sediment of Lake Bresson, in which detrital organic matter input is likely to skew chlorophyll-a identification, and the results were compared with concentrations measured by a routinely used destructive analysis. The 18 indices all produced a different result and only three indices were positively correlated with chlorophyll-a concentrations (n = 28, p &lt; 0.0001). The detrital organic matter impacts chlorophyll-a characterization and shows the bias produced by the sediment matrix variations. Moreover, artificial modification of the sediment matrix revealed an impact of the mineral phase. To tackle this issue, the indices are normalized by two proxies of the sediment components. This new approach reduces the impact of detrital organic matter, hence the sediment matrix variations also reduce the normalization of the chlorophyll-a indices by a specific proxy of the mineral phase. These results identify the impact of local geochemical features that limit past primary productivity assessment and show the necessity of characterizing the sediment composition prior to tracking the chlorophyll-a by hyperspectral imaging.</jats:p>"

To start with, almost all of these initiatives have utilized core that was originally collected to help with oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development projects. The objectives of core-based studies for CCS are subtly different to those for oil and gas studies. There are several significant reasons why core should be valued in CCS projects. Data from core provide a chance to calibrate lithology and porosity interpretations made from wireline logs that are used to characterize the subsurface and populate geocellular models. Permeability-related attributes, especially directional permeability (\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sub>v</jats:sub>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sub>h</jats:sub>\n            ) and relative permeability in CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            –water mixed fluid systems, are essential to predict CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            injection rates and CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            movement patterns in the reservoir and can only be acquired from core. Although many geomechanical data, necessary to undertake safe injection of CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            and avoid induced fracturing, can be acquired from wireline logs, borehole imaging and downhole tests, core samples from the reservoir and top-seal are required to reveal tensile strength and to calibrate elastic and other geomechanical properties acquired from logs. Top-seal performance is critical for carbon capture and storage; core samples from top-seals are the best way to determine capillary entry pressure and so define the maximum CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            column height and possible CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            leakage rates. The possibility of dissolution reactions between formation water, acidified by high pressure CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            , and minerals in both the reservoir and top-seal is best assessed by detailed petrographic and mineralogical study of core samples and a combination of modelling and core flow-through experiments. In summary, core is essential to CCS projects to determine CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            storage efficiency, CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            injection rates and the optimum way to safely store CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            .\n          </jats:p>",

The comparison with the Serpent2 and NEWT/TRITON sequence from the SCALE package, performed on the NPP Krško fuel test cases, has enabled independent verification of the successful implementation of the VERA depletion/decay calculation sequence applied on the extended nuclide set. Since the VERA is a 3-D core simulator, the focus in the rest of the paper was on the investigation of the 3-D effects and non-linearity of the soluble boron concentration averaging process, which are difficult to assess with most of available computational tools. A difference in the decay heat prediction between the 3-D and 2-D model approaches was analyzed. In addition, the impact of the Inconel grids on the decay heat was determined. Averaging the concentration of soluble boron over the fuel irradiation period has been found to be a viable approach, since it results in slight decay heat overprediction, which is considered conservative for most applications. Finally, demonstration on the Watts Bar Unit 1 cycle 1 depletion has shown formidable VERA capabilities to accurately predict spent fuel decay heat.</jats:p>"

Fine‐needle aspiration and core biopsy (FNACB) of a paraspinal mass showed a monotonous population of intermediate lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm with fine granules, round to slightly irregular nuclei, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Core biopsy revealed diffuse infiltration by cells with a NK cell phenotype, positive Epstein–Barr virus‐encoded small RNA, and negative T‐cell receptor gene rearrangement. Bone marrow biopsy showed the presence of hemophagocytosis without evidence of lymphoma. The disease disseminated to the small bowel late in the clinical course and the patient died shortly after admission.

We revisit the scenario of dust production in typical supernova ejecta in the first 3000 days after explosion, with an improved understanding of the evolving physical conditions and the distribution of the clumps. The generic, nonuniform distribution of dust within the ejecta was determined and using that, the relevant opacities and fluxes were calculated. The dependence of the emerging fluxes on the viewing angle was estimated for an anisotropic, ellipsoidal geometry of the ejecta that imitate SN 1987A. We model the He core from the center to its outer edge as 450 stratified, clumpy, annular shells, uniquely identified by their distinct velocities and characterized by their variations in abundances, densities, and gas and dust temperatures. We find that the formation of dust starts between day 450 and day 550 post-explosion, and it continues until about day 2800, although the first 1600 days are the most productive. The total dust mass evolves from ~10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup> <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> at day 500 to 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> at day 800, finally saturating at about 0.06 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>. The masses of the O-rich dust (silicates, alumina) dominates the C-rich dust (amorphous carbon, silicon carbide) at all times; the formation of carbon dust is delayed beyond 2000 days post-explosion. We show that the opacities are largest between days 800 and 1600, and the characteristic spectral features of O-rich dust species are suppressed at those times. The fluxes emerging along the smallest axes of the ellipsoidal ejecta are found to be the most obscured, while a viewing angle between 16 to 21° with that axis appears to be in best agreement with the fluxes from SN 1987A at days 615 and 775.</jats:p>",

The duality characterized by an interference visibility and a which-path information has trade-off relation known as complementarity. These quantities are related to the first-order coherence, and the interference is based on the phase correlation between lights coming from two arms. However according to quantum optics theory, such a simple wave-particle picture is not enough to understand the nature because the theory showed an importance of higher-order coherence in the sense of both interference and statistical distribution of photons. Second-order intensity correlation is especially crucial to reveal distinctive quantum features of photons with no classical analogue. Here, in an intensity interferometric scenario as represented by the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, we discuss a wave-particle duality of light based on a which-path information and a quantity characterizing a magnitude of the intensity interferometric effect. We show, for classical light, the two quantities obey the complementary principle similar to the case of the double-slit experiment, but do not for nonclassical light. The nonclassical light such as photons at two arms is allowed to show larger which-path information and intensity interference simultaneously beyond the complementary relation. Moreover, the violation reveals a new nonclassical nature of light although both of the above two quantities seem to be understandable classically, which is never found from a consideration of only one side of wave-particle duality.</jats:p>",

The system consists of thermoreceptors, a controller, and effector mechanisms for heat exchange that coordinate to maintain a central core temperature. A principal route for heat flow between the core and the environment is via convective circulation of blood to arteriovenous anastomoses located in glabrous skin of the hands and feet. This paper presents new human experimental data for thermoregulatory control behavior along with a coupled, detailed control system model specific to the interdependent actions of core temperature and glabrous skin blood flow (GSBF) under defined transient environmental thermal stress. The model was tuned by a nonlinear least-squared curve fitting algorithm to optimally fit the experimental data. Transient GSBF in the model is influenced by core temperature, nonglabrous skin temperature, and the application of selective thermal stimulation. The core temperature in the model is influenced by integrated heat transfer across the nonglabrous body surface and GSBF. Thus, there is a strong cross-coupling between GSBF and core temperature in thermoregulatory function. Both variables include a projection term in the model based on the average rates of their change. Six subjects each completed two thermal protocols to generate data to which the common model was fit. The model coefficients were unique to each of the twelve data sets but produced an excellent agreement between the model and experimental data for the individual trials. The strong match between the model and data confirms the mathematical structure of the control algorithm.</jats:p>",

The experimental core build-up composite (CBC) was derived from a self-adhesive cement by the modification of its chemical formula, requiring the use of dedicated dentin and ceramic primers. The adhesive properties to zirconia and dentin were analyzed with a micro-Shear Bond Strength test (mSBS). The mechanical properties were analyzed by a flexural strength test. The results were compared with those obtained for other commercially available cements and core build-up materials, both before and after addition of 2 wt.% fluorographene. The CBC obtained average values in the mSBS of 49.7 ± 4.74 MPa for zirconia and 32.2 ± 4.9 MPa for dentin, as well as values of 110.9 ± 9.3 MPa for flexural strength and 6170.8 ± 703.2 MPa for Young’s modulus. The addition of fluorographene, while increasing the Young’s modulus of the core build-up composite by 10%, did not improve the adhesive capabilities of the primers and cement on either zirconia or dentin. The CBC showed adhesive and mechanical properties adequate both for a restoration material and a luting cement. The addition of 2 wt.% fluorographene was shown to interfere with the polymerization reaction of the material, suggesting the need for further studies.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, the interplay of flaxseed gum (FG) with other food biopolymers, such as milk proteins, under in vitro digestion conditions remains underexplored. The aim of the present work was to investigate the colloidal interplay between flaxseed gum (golden or brown) and milk proteins (sodium caseinate or whey protein isolate) under simulated in vitro digestion conditions and its relationship with the attained in vitro protein digestibility. The presence of flaxseed gum in the milk protein food models and in the oral food boluses obtained was associated with the occurrence of segregative microphase separation. Flaxseed gum exhibited a prominent role in controlling the acid-mediated protein aggregation phenomena, particularly in the sodium caseinate gastric chymes. The addition of FG in the food models was associated with a higher amount of intact total caseins and β-lactoglobulin at the end of the gastric processing step. Monitoring of the intestinal processing step revealed a very advanced cleavage of the whey proteins (&gt;98%) and caseins (&gt;90%). The degree of the milk protein hydrolysis achieved at the end of the intestinal processing was significantly higher in the systems containing flaxseed gum (i.e., 59–62%) than their gum-free protein counterparts (i.e., 46–47%). It was postulated that the electrostatic milk protein complexation capacity and, to a lesser extent, the thickening effect of flaxseed gum influenced the in vitro digestibility of the milk proteins.</jats:p>"

This research aimed to look into the functional properties of green jackfruit rind and core flours to provide helpful information for their use as a flour substitute in noodles and significantly reduce food waste. Having tested the sensory qualities of green jackfruit rind and core powder (JRCF), the three formulations were made by substituting all-purpose flour with 33%, 50%, and 67% green jackfruit rind and core flour. The physicochemical and proximate composition of the most acceptable treatment, a mix of 33% JRCF and 67% APF was analyzed. The noodles made from green jackfruit rind and core flour had a moisture content of 12.05 %, 1.40 % crude ash, 17.56 % crude fat, 6.05 % crude fiber, 4.42 % crude protein, and a pH of 5.63. It was observed that since young green jackfruit contains more acid and is more fibrous, it is preferable to use matured jackfruit. Furthermore, to make it more aesthetically acceptable to consumers, the produced jackfruit rind and core noodles must also enhance their sensory attributes in terms of color and texture.</jats:p>"

Here, we review evidence that infants and toddlers understand a variety of morally relevant behaviors and readily evaluate agents who engage in them. These abilities appear to be rooted in the goals and intentions driving agents’ morally relevant behaviors and are sensitive to group membership. This evidence is consistent with a moral core, which may support later social and moral development and ultimately be leveraged for human cooperation.</jats:p>",

The aim of the study is to determine the effect of giving a combination of core stability and lower extremity strength exercises on the static standing balance ability in children with Down syndrome. This study uses a single subject research on a child with a diagnosis of Down syndrome who is given core stability and lower extremity strength exercise for 4 weeks to improve the ability of static standing balance. The ability of static standing balance in this study was measured using Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Measurements were taken before exercise was given (A1), follow-up (B) and final evaluation (A2). After being given exercise twice for four weeks, there was no increase in the GMFM score, so it was concluded that there was no increase in the ability of static standing balance in children with Down syndrome in this study. In conclusions, giving core stability exercise and lower extremity strength exercise twice for four weeks is considered not to be able to improve the ability of static standing balance in children with Down syndrome.</jats:p>"

Eligible participants were assigned a treatment protocol based on the McKenzie or Alexander technique for four weeks. The p-value was noted as greater than (0.05 non-significant), so the null hypothesis failed to reject it, meaning there was no significant difference between the Alexander technique and McKenzie method in treating lumbosacral radiculopathy. McKenzie was slightly more effective and responded from the first day to the end of the treatment session, but the reoccurrence of LBP was frequent due to weak muscles, poor working posture, and weight lifting in daily life activity. Alexander technique and core stability exercises response was slow in the first two weeks; after two weeks, both Alexander and McKenzie methods showed similar responses but no reoccurrence in Alexander-technique.</jats:p>"

Patients were randomly allocated into groups I, II, III and IV. All the patients were preloaded with 15 ml/kg of normal saline over 15 minutes before institution of subarachnoid block in the sitting position. Warm intravenous fluid and warm intrathecal bupivacaine, warm intravenous fluid and intrathecal bupivacaine at room temperature, intravenous fluid at room temperature and warm intrathecal bupivacaine, and both intravenous fluid and intrathecal bupivacaine at room temperature were administered to patients in groups I, II, III, IV respectively. Data collected included core temperature (tympanic membrane) using a thermoscan, shivering using the 5-point scale of Wrench. Neonatal rectal temperature was measured and adverse effects observed on the parturients recorded. Monitoring of core temperature was continued in the post anaesthesia care unit until full recovery and discharge.&#x0D;\nResults: All the 116 patients completed the study.

The paper presents funding details from 2003-2020, with an analysis of the financial distribution per program and over time, revealing the influence of political and internal management decisions. The paper ends with the presentation of the Core Program in progress, at the time of writing. An obvious conclusion is that without basic support, it is not possible to guarantee the functioning of the NIRDs and to cover the national research strategy evenly. This minimum basis also creates the conditions for international collaborations in the field, and involvement in European research programs, without forgetting the accomplishment of the external community obligations and the internal alignment in which Romania is taking part. NIMRD has been operating for over 50 years and continues to meet the increasingly complex requirements of environmental research.

This paper makes comprehensive use of evolutionary game and principal-agent theory to build an interactive relationship model between government, platform, and public, gradually discusses measures to improve the effect of government regulation, multi-agent governance, and the level of responsibility of subjects, and then puts forward suggestions to achieve collaboration among all subjects. The results show that the level of market information obtained by the government and the probability of merchants being investigated are the key factors affecting the effect of government regulation, and the former is better than the latter. Improving the effort level of the platform is the core issue to achieve the effect of multi-agent governance, and public participation, technology promotion and system improvement are measures to motivate the platform’s responsibility. Giving full play to the advantages of the subjects and coordinating the relationship between the subjects are the key tasks to achieve the multi-agent governance effect of the Internet.</jats:p>"

Efficient shared memory reduction on these multi‐core processors will help share memory programs be more efficient. In this article, we propose a reduction method combined with a barrier method that uses SIMD read/write instructions to combine barrier signaling and reduction value to minimize memory/cache traffic between cores, thereby reducing barrier latency. We compare different barriers and reduction methods on three multi‐core processors and show that the proposed combining barrier/reduction methods are 4 and 3.5 times faster than respectively GCC 11.1 and Intel 21.2 OpenMP 4.5 reduction.</jats:p>",

Their electron diffraction patterns consisted of three indistinct halo rings. The halo ring corresponding to an intermolecular distance of ∼6.4 Å degraded rapidly. Such molecular-scale collapse could have been caused by cross-linking between molecular chains. The degree of electron irradiation damage to the samples changed with the accelerating voltage. The tolerance dose limit of the epoxy resin estimated from the intensity of the halo ring was found to be improved at a higher accelerating voltage. Changes in low-loss electron energy–loss spectra indicated that the mass loss of the epoxy resin was remarkable in the early stage of electron irradiation.</jats:p>",

We also found that the distribution of BSSs in the color–magnitude diagram is characterized by a collimated blue sequence and a red more sparse component, as already observed in three other PCC clusters. A comparison with appropriate collisional models demonstrates that the vast majority of the BSSs lying along the collimated blue sequence is consistent with a generation of coeval (1 Gyr old) stars with different masses originated by an event that highly enhanced the collisional rate of the system (i.e., the core collapse). This study confirms that the segregation level of BSSs is a powerful dynamical diagnostic also of star cluster in a very advanced stage of dynamical evolution. Moreover, it pushes forward the possibility of using the morphology of BSSs in a color–magnitude diagram as a tracer of the core-collapse and subsequent dynamical evolutionary phases.</jats:p>",

A number of researchers have doubts about the fact that the reason of periodic appearance of an oil film on the Alabuga River was the migration of oil from the depths. Some people assumed that it could get to the river in a small amount by accident, for example, farmers spilled it during fieldwork. In 1959, 1-k and 2-k wells were drilled in order to check and study oil occurrences along the Alabuga River. Core wells 1-k and 2-k have traversed the cover deposits of the Meso-Cenozoic and have exposed the basement rocks represented by red flowers of presumably Permian-Triassic age. This made it possible to study the lithology and stratigraphy of the sediments, which were involved in the structure of the area. The angles of inclination of red-colored rocks measured by the core of the 1-k well give an idea of the degree of their disturbance. The facies-lithological features of these rocks, the absence of fauna and flora in them, and other signs indicate that the formation of red-colored deposits occurred under continental conditions. The signs of Permian-Triassic oil found in the 1-k well are of fundamental importance. These oil occurrences are also of interest in the fact that they were detected in the area, where oil was observed to the surface.</jats:p>"

However, it is unclear whether host plant specialization limits microbial community diversity or to what extent herbivores sharing a common host plant evolve similar microbiomes. To investigate whether variation in host plant range influences the assembly of core herbivore symbiont populations we compared bacterial diversity across three milkweed aphid species <jats:italic>(Aphis</jats:italic><jats:italic>nerii, Aphis asclepiadis, Myzocallis asclepiadis</jats:italic>) feeding on a common host plant (<jats:italic>Asclepias syriaca</jats:italic>) using 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Overall, although there was significant overlap in taxa detected across all three aphid species (i.e. similar composition), some structural differences were identified within communities. Each aphid species harbored bacterial communities that varied in terms of richness and relative abundance of key symbionts. However, bacterial community diversity did not vary with degree of aphid host plant specialization. Interestingly, the narrow specialist <jats:italic>A.</jats:italic><jats:italic>asclepiadis</jats:italic> harbored significantly higher relative abundances of the facultative symbiont <jats:italic>Arsenophonus</jats:italic> compared to the other two aphid species. Although many low abundance microbes were shared across all milkweed aphids, key differences in symbiotic partnerships were observed that could influence host physiology or additional ecological variation in traits that are microbially-mediated. Overall, this study suggests overlap in host plant range can select for taxonomically similar microbiomes across herbivore species, but variation in core aphid symbionts within these communities may still occur.</jats:p>"

This allows the fibre orientation in this area to be intentionally manipulated so that, for example, in the case of internal pressure loading, the fibres can be oriented in the tangential main loading direction. This paper deals with the impact of a rotating mold core on the fibre orientation and burst strength of short-and long-fibre-reinforced polypropylene. It is shown that the fibre orientation and strength can be significantly influenced for both short and long fibres, whereby increases in bursting strength of mostly over 80%, in some cases over 200%, could be achieved. The ultimate strength depends, among other things, on the wall thickness used and the fibre content. Major differences between the short-and long-fibre-reinforced polypropylene are less evident in the strength and more in the fibre orientation.</jats:p>",

In this sense, core‐shell polymer particles draw attention because they are already widely used in adsorption, catalysis, and drug delivery, due to their remarkable advantages in surface properties adjustment, excellent mechanical stability, and high chemical resistance, as a result of the combination of the characteristics of the polymers that form the core and shell of the structure. Thus, this review article provides an overview of the synthesis processes of these particles, highlighting the characteristics that can be obtained from each synthesis technique, as well as the most recently used techniques to obtain polymeric particles with core‐shell morphology. The advantages and main challenges for the application of these structures in the immobilization of enzymes are also discussed, providing a general summary of what has been explored in the literature. Despite the potential of application, the use of these materials in the immobilization of enzymes is still little explored, with studies focused mainly on lipases and around the same classes of polymers. Therefore, there is an opportunity window regarding the investigation of the immobilization of other enzymes of commercial interest on these polymeric supports.</jats:p>",

First, the light is launched into the input core of the MCF and the optical power is transferred to the cladding due to the LPG inscribed in that core. The optical power in the cladding is then transferred to the other MCF cladding by evanescent field coupling. The optical power in the cladding of the output MCF is distributed by all its cores due to the identical LPGs inscribed in them. We optimized the LPGs period, their lengths and offset distance to increase the power transfer at 1480 nm. We achieved a power transfer of 92% of the input power, distributed by all MCF cores, in 10.6 cm of length. We also studied the power transfer sensitivity to the LPGs period.</jats:p>",

The numerical model of a core cooled by a conformal channel was based on an existing and working counterpart made of additively manufactured high-strength 1.2709 maraging steel. This study shows that the conformal channel results in a lower average core temperature as compared to the temperature of the same core shape cooled by the conventional method. The course of the stress changes during the mould cycle was also determined. It was found that stresses on the core surface caused the cyclic compression and tension of the material. The necessary strength tests of 1.2709 steel produced by selective laser melting (SLM) within a temperature range of 25 to 550 °C, which were necessary to define the fatigue coefficients by the Seeger approximation method, were also carried out in this study, along with metallographic tests of the fractures of the specimens. Based on the multiaxial fatigue criterion and using the maximum principal deformation hypothesis, the fatigue life of the core and channel surfaces was determined. Based on the calculations, it was shown that crack initiation on the channel surface can occur earlier than on the outer surface of the core.</jats:p>"

Being limited by the size of the article, the authors focus on the second ‘dimension’ - identify the possibilities and limitations of the unfinished-sentences technique as a means for validating the results of the project rather than a means for starting it. The structure of the article contributes to the solution of this task: in the first, introductory part, the author set the research problem as determined by the self-diagnostic mania of the contemporary society (in terms of the level of happiness) and the attempts to classify the factors of happiness; the second part presents the main stages of the project and its conclusions based on the results of the surveys (on the sample of the RUDN University students and on the all-Russian representative online panel); the third, main part presents the results of the unfinished-sentences technique application, which were obtained with the simplest content-analytical coding of the elementary endings. The authors reconstructed a single-type structure of images of a happy/unhappy person (in the context of factors determining such ‘statuses’) and of justice/injustice (taking into account their characteristics) - the core, the near periphery and the far periphery, which differ in their semantic ‘volumes’ and evaluation trends.</jats:p>"

It is concluded that face‐centered cubic phase FeH is stable in the Earth's inner core. The high mobility of hydrogen in the Fe lattice suggests that hydrogen is transferred to a superionic state under the inner core conditions, where the superionic state transfer temperature of H in Fe fcc lattice is ∼500 K higher than that in hcp Fe system. The H concentration in the inner core is estimated to be ∼0.92 wt% to explain its density deficit, this value was further constrained to ∼0.21 wt% by matching the density jump at the inner‐core boundary. H alongside other light elements are required to account for the geophysical observations of the Earth's inner core.</jats:p>",

It explains the development status in all aspects of smart manufacturing, via the example of ceramic circuit board manufacturing and electronic assembly, and outlines future smart manufacturing plans and processes. The research proposed two experiments using artificial intelligence and deep learning to demonstrate the problems and solutions regarding methods in manufacturing and factory facilities, respectively. In the first experiment, a Bayesian network inference is used to find the cause of the problem of metal residues between electronic circuits through key process and quality correlations. In the second experiment, a convolutional neural network is used to identify false defects that were overinspected during automatic optical inspection. This improves the manufacturing process by enhancing the yield rate and reducing cost. The contributions of the study built in circuit board production. Smart manufacturing, with the application of a Bayesian network to an Internet of Things setup, has addressed the problem of residue and redundant conductors on the edge of the ceramic circuit board pattern, and has improved and prevented leakage and high-frequency interference. The convolutional neural network and deep learning were used to improve the accuracy of the automatic optical inspection system, reduce the current manual review ratio, save labor costs, and provide defect classification as a reference for preprocess improvement.</jats:p>",

Lately, there has been a surge in research utilizing this novel technology in treating other neurological and psychiatric ailments. The application of TMS on several neurological disorders requires the induced electric and magnetic fields to be focused and targeted to a small region in the brain. TMS of a focal cortical territory will ensure modulation of specific brain circuitry without affecting unwanted surrounding regions. This can be achieved by altering the properties of the magnetic core material used for the TMS system. In this study, soft ferromagnetic materials having high permeability, high saturation magnetization and low coercivity have been investigated as TMS coil cores in finite element simulations. Also, magnetic field measurements have been carried out using different cores in the TMS coil.</jats:p><jats:p>Finite element analysis of the rat head model is carried out using Sim4life software while investigating variations associated with changing the ferromagnetic core material and shape in the coil.

Simulation results indicated significant magnetic field distribution variation when introducing a ferromagnetic core in TMS coil, concentrating the magnetic field to the targeted region in the rat head model without stimulating adjacent regions. It was observed that the v-tip sharpened core attained the highest magnetic field and best focality among other cores in simulations and experimentally.</jats:p>"

The intervention strategy, based on the “forYOU” model, was structured into three levels of support according to the degree of affliction and the emotional needs of the professionals. A semi-structured survey of all workers involved in an SAE was used to identify potential second victims. Between 2020 and 2021, the SAE operating procedure was activated 23 times. All healthcare workers involved in an SAE (n = 135) received second-level support. The majority were physicians (51.2%), followed by nurses (26.7%). Only 58 (43.0%) received first-level emotional support and 47 (34.8%) met “second victim” criteria. Seven workers (14.9%) required third-level support. A progressive increase in the notification rates was observed. Acceptance of the procedure by professionals and managers was high. This novel approach improved the number of workers reached by the trained staff; promoted the visibility of actions taken during SAE management and helped foster patient safety culture in our setting.</jats:p>"

This study represents the first qualitative inquiry into college student-athletes’ history of injury, medical and nonmedical opioid exposure, and pain management practices. Drawing on surveys (n = 280) and interviews (n = 30) with less-elite (i.e., non-NCAA Division I) athletes attending a large state university, our analyses documented little NUPO in this population, despite significant rates of injury and opioid prescription. Interview participants evinced little knowledge, but high fears, around opioid use, while describing potentially harmful levels of over-the-counter drug use.

Our synthetic strategy is simple and straightforward due to the reactivity of 1,3-positions of azulene, which underwent Lewis acid-catalyzed condensation with pyrrole-2-carbinol.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Background. </jats:bold>In recent decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of malignant neoplasms of the thyroid gland by 20%. In 2020, thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 586,202 people worldwide and caused 43,646 deaths. Diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma has stepped forward due to the introduction of fine needle aspiration biopsy into widespread practice, with the classification of cytological material according to the Bethesda system. However, one category of this classification traditionally remains a gray area of diagnosis. The detection of a follicular tumor in the cytological material (category IV according to Bethesda) does not allow one to reliably classify the formation as benign or malignant and requires surgical intervention. At the same time, in the vast majority of cases, the tumor is benign.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Aim</jats:bold>. To evaluate the possibilities of trephine biopsy for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant neoplasms of the thyroid gland in the cytological category Bethesda IV.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Materials and methods</jats:bold>. The study included 8 patients (2 men and 6 women) with a nodular thyroid gland and a cytological picture of a follicular tumor (Bethesda IV). The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 67 years, mean age 52.12±16.12. The sizes of nodule at US in three projections were accordingly 11,66±1,52; 11.33±1.15; 10.66±1.52 mm. Before the intervention, patients canceled drugs that affect the blood coagulation system. All patients underwent a trephine biopsy under ultrasound guidance with a mandatory assessment of blood supply in the mode of color Doppler mapping and power Dopplerography. Manipulation was performed along the midline of the neck through the isthmus of the thyroid gland. The material was taken from at least two sites, one through the tumor tissue, the other along the edge of the tumor with the capture of the capsule with a 18G needle. Additional biopsies were performed if a tumor site suspicious of malignancy was identified.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> The results of trephine biopsy coincided in 8 cases (100%) with the results of an urgent and planned histological examination. The obtained data were regarded as highly informative in 5 cases (62.5%) and medium informative in 3 cases (37.5%). The material reliably assessed the morphological type of the tumor, the degree of vascularization of the capsule, the presence or absence of invasion into the capsule or vessels. Histological studies made it possible to assess the size of the follicles, the presence of colloid, cell polymorphism, mitoses, and the contents of the cytoplasm; evaluate cell atypia.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>. In the future, trephine biopsy may become an additional opportunity to identify tumor-like formations in patients with follicular thyroid tumors.</jats:p>"

The structure of the particles was confirmed by transmission electron microscope. The fluoride release profile was measured by fluoride ion electrode.

The loaded concentration of fluoride in the particles' core was 148,996 ± 28,484 ppm. NaF@PAA@HA@polyelectrolytes@HA@PAA particles showed selective inhibition of cariogenic microorganisms over probiotic strains and stronger fluoride adhesion on tooth enamel. A burst release (over 80%) of fluoride from the particle-containing toothpaste was observed under cariogenic acidic environment (pH &lt; 5), while it remained extremely low under neutral environment. Compared with the best results of commercial toothpastes, our prototype toothpaste increased enamel fluoride uptake by 8-fold in normal enamel slides and by 11-fold in the slides with induced white spot lesions after either 1- or 7-day treatment. The prototype toothpaste also showed better inhibition of cariogenic microorganisms than the commercial brands. The coverage area of cariogenic bacteria under our toothpaste treatment was 73% on normal enamel slides compared with the commercial brands, while it was 69% in the induced white spot lesions.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Conclusions In our study, an intelligent toothpaste was developed that selectively inhibits cariogenic bacteria by microenvironment proton-triggered fluoride release. Such novel design would accomplish a favorable flora balance for optimal long-term oral health.</jats:p>",

Low-energy physics is described by the massive Schwinger model with multi-species fermions labeled by the band and valley indices. We propose two means to detect this state. One is through an optical measurement of the exciton spectrum, which has been calculated via the ’t Hooft–Berknoff equation with the light-front field theory. We show that the Gell–Mann−Oakes−Renner relation is satisfied by a dark exciton. The second is the nonlinear transport which is related to Coleman’s ‘half-asymptotic’ state.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research to deal with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks was kicked off from long ago and has seen technological advancement along with an extensive 5G footprint. Prior studies, and still newer ones, in the realm of DDoS attacks in the 5G environment appear to be focused primarily on radio access network (RAN) and voice service network, meaning that there is no attempt to mitigate DDoS attacks targeted on core networks (CN) by applying artificial intelligence (AI) in modeling. In particular, such components of a CN as the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF), and User Plane Function (UPF), all being principal functions enabled to provide 5G services as base stations do, provide expansive connectivity with geographically very large area coverage that cannot be matched by the base stations. Moreover, to complete re-registration for one UE, required messages in protocols Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) and HTTP/2 are approximately 40 in number. This implies that a DDoS attack targeting the CN has, once accomplished, a greater than expected impact, when compared to DDoS attacks targeting the RAN. Therefore, security mechanisms for the CN must be put into practice. This research proposes a method, along with a threat detection system, to mitigate signaling DDoS attacks targeted on 5G SA (standalone) CNs. It is verified that the use of fundamental ML classifiers together with preprocessing with entropy-based analysis (EBA) and statistics-based analysis (SBA) enables us to proactively react against signaling DDoS attacks. Additionally, the evaluation results manifest that the random forest achieves the best detection performance, with an average accuracy of 98.7%.</jats:p>"

Here, we propose a new mechanism to circumvent this problem by employing a sandwich panel with designed dynamics quasi-zero-stiffness (QZS) truss cores. The latticed cores are made of programable curved beams, whose shape is carefully designed to meet the demand of both high-pressure resistance and dynamics QZS. An analytical model is developed to evaluate sound transmission of such panel. It is shown that the low-frequency sound insulation performance of the customized panel increases with the hydrostatic pressure and reaches its maximum when the QZS state is triggered. The effective pressure range of the proposed sandwich panel can be further programed by stacking QZS beam lattices of different static load plateaus. The proposed design strategy stems solely from the structural geometry of the curved beams and is therefore materials-insensitive. The linear/inverse relationships between static loading feature and characteristic mechanical properties/geometrical parameters, and the stacking arrangement of lattice bring out the programability of the panel’s bearing capacity. The design strategy, together with the established database, provides a feasible approach for underwater sound insulation of equipment subjected to elevated pressures.</jats:p>",

Due to the high availability of tertiary alcohols, developing methods for their conversion into alkynes and nitriles is particularly attractive. In a previous communication, our group has reported the conversion of alcohols into alkynes through cesium oxalates based on the powerful combination of photochemistry with Ethynyl BenziodoXolones (EBXs). Herein, we report further investigations into this transformation, including our findings on the effect that backbone modification of EBXs has on the deoxyalkynylation of cesium oxalates. In addition, we disclose preliminary data on the development of new deoxycyanation and dethioalkynylation processes. We also report the serendipitous discovery of the C−H alkynylation of 1,2‐dichloroethane.</jats:p>",

In this work, the idea of synthesizing conjugated polymers (polyaniline, PANI) within the core of a core–shell submicron electrospun fiber was tested. To this end, acrylamide/acrylic acid solution containing ammonium persulfate was photopolymerized during electrospinning to prepare the shell of a core–shell electrospun fiber, while the core was produced based on an aniline‐rich solution. Polymerization of aniline occurred during the electrospinning through the contact of ammonium persulfate and aniline at the core of the newly formed fibers as observed by AFM electrical current mode and by Fourier transform infrared results that showed the presence of a highly doped and conductive emeraldine PANI. The ability of the shell of the fibers to swell in water and to lead to materials with low elastic modulus, as common hydrogels, was also detected through AFM images and indentation curves in water. © 2022 Society of Industrial Chemistry.</jats:p>",

The 2D fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is composed of two non-overlapping sub-FBGs, which are laterally separated along the radial direction of the fiber core. Unlike traditional FBGs, the refractive index of the 2D FBG is modulated both on the axial and radial directions of the fiber core, which are realized by spatially encoded diffraction based on a 2D spatially encoded phase mask. Compared with the overlapping grating, the 2D FBG can be fabricated at one time to achieve multi-wavelength output, and its compact structure provides a new idea for multi-wavelength multiplexing. As examples, a single-core multi-channel moiré fiber grating and 2D FBG with three subgratings are designed and fabricated on a single-mode fiber and LMA fiber, respectively. Using a 2D spatially encoded mask can improve the optical fiber refractive index modulation from one- to two- or even three-dimensions, which is helpful for precise manipulation of the complex optical field of optical fiber.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Smart water flooding (SWF) is a promising enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique due to its economic advantages. For this process, wettability alteration is the most accepted controlling effect that leads to increased recovery factors (RFs). The main objective of this work is to investigate how the relative permeability curves’ interpolant affects the SWF mechanisms’ assessment. Wettability alteration is described by shifting these curves in simulations. Numerical simulations of core flooding tests are applied to carbonate at 114.4 °C. A comparison of oil recovery factor (RF), pH and effluent composition is performed for different injection approaches. Mg2+ and SO42− are the interpolant ions and the salinity levels range from 30 to 1 kppm. A simulation of 24 scenarios, 12 for each type of interpolant, is presented. Results show that RF changes significantly, due to salinity and composition, for each interpolant. This has a relevant influence on the interpolant. The greater the dilution, the smaller the effect of the interpolant and brine composition on the recovery estimates. When considering SO42− as an interpolant, the trend is that divalent rich brine (DV) has a higher recovery factor. In contrast, when Mg2+ is the interpolant, DV tends to have a lower recovery. The analysis of ionic exchange and pH variation corroborate the wettability alteration behavior. A pH increase was observed in all scenarios, regardless of the salinity, ion composition or interpolant variation. Also, monitoring the CH3COO-X reduction and SO4-X2 increase equivalent fractions indicated the ion exchange mechanism as being well represented in all simulations. In addition, the results emphasize that even at very low concentrations, SO42− plays a fundamental role in initiating the ion exchange process that culminates in the wettability alteration as a consequence of smart water injection.</jats:p>"

In contrast, this figure is much higher than the national dropout rate, which is 3%. For Papuan students to succeed academically, they ought to have a good career adaptability. Papuan students with higher career adaptability have the resources to be responsible and adapt to the university environment. Career adaptability may be influenced by key factors such as core self-evaluation and perceived peer support.\nMethod. This study examines the role of perceived peer support in moderating the relationship between core self-evaluations and career adaptability. The participants consisted of students from Papua (N=176) who have been actively carrying out their lectures since year 2011-2020.\nResult. The result of the moderation analysis using the Hayes Process shows that perceived peer support significantly moderated the relationship between core self-evaluations and career adaptability (t=2.06, p&lt;.05).\nDiscussion and Conclusion. The role of perceived peer support as a moderator may be influenced by the culture of collectivism prevalent among Papuan students. In this culture, individuals tend to associate their level of social support with their self-assessments. The results of this study provide information on interventions that can be given to the students in order to develop their career adaptability.</jats:p>"

Both orthogonal polarization components of the object are simultaneously reconstructed using an edge point referencing for holography with the coherence waves and with a specially designed tuneable beam displacer. This tuneable beam displacer supports independent recording of the orthogonally polarized speckles at different spatial locations, and hence supports simultaneous reconstruction of the orthogonal polarization components of object from the random light.</jats:p>",

The displacements of the cohesive cores were recorded using a tailored measuring system, based on a laser pointer and a mirror, designed to amplify the real displacements. The cohesive cores were extremely sensitive to small oscillations and behaved as rigid bodies, similar to concrete slabs with three fixed sides and another free. The shape and dimensions of the breach formed on the cohesive cores had roughly the same shape and dimensions as the unprotected area.

We study this question using the wing of<jats:italic>Drosophila melanogaster</jats:italic>, an epithelial tissue that undergoes large-scale tissue flows during pupal stages. We showed previously (Etournay et al., 2015) that pupal wing morphogenesis involves both cellular behaviors that allow relaxation of mechanical tissue stress, as well as cellular behaviors that appear to be actively patterned. The core planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway influences morphogenetic cell movements in many other contexts, which suggests that it could globally pattern active cellular behaviors during pupal wing morphogenesis. We show here, however, that this is not the case: there is no significant phenotype on the cellular dynamics underlying pupal morphogenesis in mutants of core PCP. Furthermore, using laser ablation experiments, coupled with a rheological model to describe the dynamics of the response to laser ablation, we conclude that while core PCP mutations affect the fast timescale response to laser ablation, they do not affect overall tissue mechanics. In conclusion, our work shows that cellular dynamics and tissue shape changes during<jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>pupal wing morphogenesis are independent of one potential chemical guiding cue, core PCP.</jats:p>"

By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organic solar cells still suffer from relatively low conversion efficiency despite significant progress. An Ag:SiO2 core-shell nanoparticle embedded inside the active layer of an organic solar cell is expected to enhance light absorption. Light absorption within the active layer consisting of 70 nm thickness PEDOT: PSS and P3HT: PCBM was calculated using the finite element method for a variable diameter of the silver core, the thickness of the SiO2 shell, and the relative position of nanoparticle inside the active layer. The diameter of the Ag nanoparticle varies from 20 to 50 nm, the thickness of SiO2 varies from 1 to 4 nm, and the position was shifted vertically to 70 nm. The maximum light absorption in the active layer is obtained for silver nanoparticles with a diameter of 40 nm and a SiO2 thickness of 1 nm. The optimum position of the core-shell nanoparticle was found to be not at the interface between the PEDOT: PSS and P3HT: PCBM layers but a little bit shifted down into P3HT: PCBM layer. The highest increase of light absorption, compared to without Ag:SiO2, is 210%, much higher than reported in the literature. Increasing absorption is related to the excitation of surface plasmon resonance of Ag:SiO2 nanoparticles leading to the local field and scattering enhancement in the active layer of the organic solar cell</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Viewing from the psychometric models of modern assessment, it is imperative to note that assessment has been undergoing major constructive modifications. One of the main modifications is the transition from the use of classical test theory (CTT) to modern test models (IRT) as well as methods used in test construction. This is to say that the pendulum swing in test construction techniques is from CTT to IRT. Clearly, the properties of IRT create several benefits in the area of test design and item banking over CTT. This paper estimated the IRT psychometric proprieties (difficulty-1PL, discrimination-2PL and guessing indices-3PL) of West African Examinations Council (WAEC) 2020 core mathematics objectives test examination in Ghana within the remit of IRT. The study revealed that averagely, the 2020 core mathematics objectives test examination were within the difficulty level (1PL) of the examines. In terms of discrimination level (2PL), the psychometric properties indicated that most of the items discriminated among the examinees. However, on the Pseudo-guessing parameter (3PL), it was found that most items were subjected to pseudo-guessing. Theoretically and practically, the way items are constructed could have influenced outcome. Therefore, we strongly advocate and recommend that item writers for examination body like West African Examinations Council (WAEC) should rigorously be trained to be more conscious of theoretical and practical implications of the guessing parameter. This will help in avoiding test items that are prone to pseudo-guessing. </jats:p>"

STAT3 functions as a dimer mediated by phosphorylation of the SRC-homology 2 (SH2) domain, a key target for therapeutic drugs. While great efforts have been employed towards the development of compounds that directly target the SH2 domain, no compound has yet been approved by the FDA due to a lack of specificity and pharmacologic efficacy. Studies have shown that allosteric regulation of SH2 via the coiled-coil domain (CCD) is an alternative drug design strategy. Several CCD effectors have been shown to modulate SH2 binding and affinity, and at the time of writing at least one drug candidate has entered phase I clinical trials. However, the mechanism for SH2 regulation via CCD is poorly understood. Here, we investigate structural and dynamic features of STAT3 and compare the wild type to the reduced function variant D170A in order to delineate mechanistic differences and propose allosteric pathways. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore conformational space of STAT3 and the variant, followed by structural, conformation, and dynamic analysis. The trajectories explored show distinctive conformational changes in the SH2 domain for the D170A variant, indicating long range allosteric effects. Multiple analyses provide evidence for long range communication pathways between the two STAT3 domains, which seem to be mediated by a rigid core which connects the CCD and SH2 domains via the linker domain (LD) and transmits conformational changes through a network of short-range interactions. The proposed allosteric mechanism provides new insight into the understanding of intramolecular signaling in STAT3 and potential pharmaceutical control of STAT3 specificity and activity.</jats:p>"

The research sample consisted of 387 respondents for the exploratory factor analysis and 532 respondents for the confirmatory factor analysis.

The study also provides an overview of the applicability of the CCC3 methodology in coaching practice. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis made it possible to create a 24-item model that describes the core competencies of a coach.

In this paper, we study this problem when the goal is to determine the centroid of the core of a capacity, and we compare four approaches: the Shapley value, the average of the extreme points, the incenter with respect to the total variation distance and the limit of a procedure of uniform contraction. We show that these four centroids do not coincide in general, we give some sufficient conditions for their equality, and we analyse their axiomatic properties. We also discuss how to define a notion of centrality measure indicating the degree of centrality of an additive measure in the core.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This report presents the experimental study of developing a dual-core spark discharge (2C-SD) model for clean combustion. We first studied ignition probability (Pig) of lean methane/air at an equivalence ratio of 0.5 using 2C-SD with different spark-gaps (dgap = 1.0mm and 2.0mm) in a constant volume combustion chamber. We then applied 2C-SD to the engine driving a 2.5-kW generator. The results indicated that Pig is 30% and 45% at dgap=1.0mm and 2.0mm, respectively, while Pig is 0 when using conventional single spark discharge (CSSD). Compared to CSSD, when using 2C-SD the engine power could be improved by 4%-9.7%, depending on the throttle openings. We expect the larger volume of the initial flame kernel by 2C-SD could enhance Pig and quickly reach the critical flame radius before self-sustained propagating. The faster initial flame speed is essential for achieving the optimal combustion phasing, resulting in a higher power.</jats:p>"

Despite the attributions of academic emotion regulation (AER), the core of self-assessment (CSA) to academic buoyancy (AB), no study has ever uncovered their relationships. To this end, the current research intended to test a structural model of English as a foreign language (EFL) university learners’ AER, CSA, and AB. The academic emotion regulation questionnaire (AERQ), the core of self-assessment questionnaire (CSAQ), and the academic buoyancy scale (ABS) were administered to 395 Iranian EFL university learners. Based on the results of structural equation modeling (SEM), AER and CSA predict learners’ AB. Additionally, the contribution of CSA to AB was confirmed. The implications of the findings are to raise learners’ awareness of their personality traits and self-assessment that can foster practical learning and assessment. This study opens new doors for future academic research. The implications of the study may help learners, teachers, administrators, policymakers, and curriculum designers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the predominant dementia globally, with heterogeneous presentation and penetrance of clinical symptoms, variable presence of mixed pathologies, potential disease subtypes, and numerous associated endophenotypes. Beyond the difficulty of designing treatments that address the core pathological characteristics of the disease, therapeutic development is challenged by the uncertainty of which endophenotypic areas and specific targets implicated by those endophenotypes to prioritize for further translational research. However, publicly-funded consortia driving large-scale open science efforts have produced multiple omic analyses that address both disease risk relevance and biological process involvement of genes across the genome. Here we report the development of an informatic pipeline that draws from genetic association studies, predicted variant impact, and linkage with dementia associated phenotypes to create a genetic risk score. This is paired with a multi omic risk score utilizing extensive sets of both transcriptomic and proteomic studies to identify systems level changes in expression associated with AD. These two elements combined constitute our target risk score that ranks AD risk genomewide. The ranked genes are organized into endophenotypic space through the development of 19 biological domains associated with AD in the described genetics and genomics studies and accompanying literature. The biological domains are constructed from exhaustive gene ontology (GO) term compilations, allowing automated assignment of genes into objectively defined disease-associated biology. This rank and organize approach, performed genome-wide, allows the characterization of aggregations of AD risk across biological domains. The top AD-risk associated biological domains are Synapse, Immune Response, Lipid Metabolism, Mitochondrial Metabolism, Structural Stabilization, and Proteostasis, with slightly lower levels of risk enrichment present within the other 13 biological domains. This provides an objective methodology to localize risk within specific biological endophenotypes, and drill down into the most significantly associated sets of GO-terms and annotated genes for potential therapeutic targets.</jats:p>"

The applied method of constructing the cross-section core is original. It uses the replacement of the graphical representation of the tangent to the contour of the cross section with an analytical one, based on the geometric meaning of the first derivative of the function describing the equation of the corresponding contour. This equation is written in relation to the main central axes of inertia of the cross section. Previously, it is necessary to calculate the following geometric characteristics: the cross-sectional area, the main central moments of inertia (using integral dependencies) and the squares of the radii of inertia. This method of constructing the cross-section core is convenient to use if one or two main central axes are axes of symmetry. In this paper, a sinusoid (cosine) is considered as a symmetric function.</jats:p>",

The fluctuation of the drilling parameter was consistent with the core discing section along the core. The failure mode of the core discs was determined by morphology and surface fractal dimension characteristics. Numerical simulation models considering the interaction between the drill bit and the rock were established using ANSYS software. Based on core drilling tests, failure morphology analysis of the core discs, and numerical simulation, the mechanism of granite core discing under low confining pressure is as follows: Tensile failure is caused by the stress concentration of the bit at the core root.

The interaction between the individual health condition and the barriers in the environment of the elderly leads to the development of disability and the limitation of activity and participation in daily activities. Aim: This study was aimed at selecting the category of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) to assess the environment of older adults in Poland in the context of their daily functioning. Materials and methods: The study was designed to develop a user-friendly tool collecting ICF-based data on the living environment of older people, consisting of five phases: (1) the systematic review of the literature, (2) the empirical multicenter study, (3) the qualitative study based on interviews conducted among the elderly, (4) the experts’ study—an assessment of selected codes from the perspective of experts, (5) the consensus conference. Results: Consensus was reached for 20 ICF categories, creating a comprehensive core set for the assessment of the living environment of older people, which included six codes from chapter 1, Products and technology, three codes from chapter 2, Natural environment and human-made changes to the environment, four codes from chapter 3, Support and relationships, four codes from Chapter 4, Attitudes, and three codes from Chapter 5, Services, systems, and policies. Conclusions: The core set for the assessment of the living environment of older people living in Poland is a comprehensive and important set of 20 ICF codes that reflect the most important elements of the environment affecting the health and functioning of the elderly. This set can contribute to the optimal management of care services and support in the area of adapting the environment to the older population. The core set for environmental assessment was developed for use by medical and care facilities, as well as by social workers, who should also pay attention to the elements of the environment that affect the level of functioning of older people. In the future, it may also form the basis of national surveys and screening tests for the assessment of the living environment of older people. Optimizing and enhancing the surrounding environment can contribute to a greater degree of independence, even with existing health problems in the older population.</jats:p>"

We describe γ-core peptides that have been shown to exhibit inhibitory activity against plant and human bacterial and fungal pathogens that make them attractive scaffolds for the development of novel anti-infective agents. Their advantages include origin from natural AMP sequences, broad-spectrum and potent inhibitory activity, and cost-effective production. In addition, some γ-core peptides combine antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions, thus broadening the spectrum of practical applications. Some act synergistically with antimycotics and fungicides, so combinations of peptides with conventionally used antifungal agents can be suggested as an effective strategy to reduce the doses of potentially harmful chemicals. The presented information will pave the way for the design of novel antimicrobials on the basis of γ-core motif peptides, which can find application in medicine and the protection of crops from diseases.</jats:p>"

The narrative literature review intersects so far unconnected categorizations from standardization and power literatures to systematically map out the broad knowledge structure of the power‐related literature on standardization. As a result, the paper details six power‐related notions of standardization. Building on the review, the paper summarizes neglected issues and suggests new avenues for future research. The analysis reveals that research widely tends toward either/or conceptions in terms of the empowering or disempowering dynamics of standardization. To descend from this dichotomous perspective in future research, the paper finally recommends exploring the dialectics of standardization in more detail: first, by analyzing standards as a reflection of existing power structures and contestations; second, by investigating standards as subject to power logics and interests; and third, by scrutinizing standardization as the dynamic interplay of powerlessness and powerfulness.</jats:p>",

This can be obtained by line radiation from impurities, injected from the plasma edge. There are however limitations on the sustainable impurity content, since radiation from the core can lead to a deleterious electron heat sink. Moreover, dilution of the main ions reduces the available fuel. Simultaneously, impurities have an impact on the turbulent transport, both by dilution and by changes in the effective charge. Recent experiments at JET point towards an improvement in plasma confinement in neon seeded discharges with respect to purer equivalent plasmas. In this paper the impact of the impurities on the confinement is studied, isolating various effects. First-principle-based integrated modelling with the QuaLiKiz quasilinear turbulent transport model explains the improvement by a combination of higher pedestal temperature, increased rotation shear, and impurity-induced microturbulence stabilization. These results are optimistic with respect to the maximum impurity levels allowed in ITER and future reactors. Comparison between QuaLiKiz and higher fidelity gyrokinetics has exposed issues with QuaLiKiz impurity peaking predictions with rotation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, probiotic bacteria with not transferable antibiotic resistance represent a sustainable strategy for the treatment and prevention of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in farm animals. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is among the most versatile species used in the food industry, either as starter cultures or probiotics. In the present work, the immunobiotic potential of L. plantarum CRL681 and CRL1506 was studied to evaluate their capability to improve the resistance to ETEC infection. In vitro studies using porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells and in vivo experiments in mice were undertaken. Expression analysis indicated that both strains were able to trigger IL-6 and IL-8 expression in PIE cells in steady-state conditions. Furthermore, mice orally treated with these strains had significantly improved levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α in the intestine as well as enhanced activity of peritoneal macrophages. The ability of CRL681 and CRL1506 to beneficially modulate intestinal immunity was further evidenced in ETEC-challenge experiments. In vitro, the CRL1506 and CRL681 strains modulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL2, CXCL5 and CXCL9) in ETEC-stimulated PIE cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of both strains to beneficially regulate the immune response against this pathogen. Moreover, the oral treatment of mice with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains significantly reduced ETEC counts in jejunum and ileum and prevented the spread of the pathogen to the spleen and liver. Additionally, LAB treated-mice had improved levels of intestinal IL-10 both at steady state and after the challenge with ETEC. The protective effect against ETEC infection was not observed for the non-immunomodulatory TL2677 strain. Furthermore, the study showed that L. plantarum CRL1506 was more efficient than the CRL681 strain to modulate mucosal immunity highlighting the strain specific character of this probiotic activity. Our results suggest that the improved intestinal epithelial defenses and innate immunity induced by L. plantarum CRL1506 and CRL681 would increase the clearance of ETEC and at the same time, protect the host against detrimental inflammation. These constitute valuable features for future probiotic products able to improve the resistance to ETEC infection.</jats:p>"

At low levels of internal control, an increase in R&amp;D investment is associated with a more significant increase in firm performance than at high levels of internal control. Increasing investment in R&amp;D is associated with a slower performance increase at high internal control levels.

A total of 29 voles were radio-tracked from August to September 2021. Home range (95% utilization distribution; UD) and core area (50% UD) were calculated using the kernel density estimator (KDE). The home range (1659.49 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) and core area (317.08 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) were negatively affected by altitude. The lunar phase and temperature negatively and positively influenced the home range and core area, respectively. The home range was positively affected by understory vegetation, whereas the core area was not. The core area increased within microhabitats with a high density of conspecific individuals, with males having a larger home range (2006.19 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) and core area (375.40 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) than females (1043.13 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 213.39 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, respectively).

These sensors were installed on the containment roll support structures in the segments of a production continuous caster to detect the position of the solid–liquid interface and monitor the strand condition during the continuous casting. Distributed Fiber Bragg Grating sensors (FBGs) were used in this work to monitor strain at six roll positions in the caster. The sensor performance was first validated by comparing optical strain measurements with conventional strain gauge measurements in the lab. Next, optical strain measurements were performed on an isolated caster segment in a segment maintenance facility using hydraulic jacks to simulate the presence of a liquid core under the roll. Finally, the sensors were evaluated during caster operation. The sensors successfully detected the load increase associated with the presence of a liquid core under each instrumented roll location. Incidents of bulging and roll eccentricity were also detected using frequency analysis of the optical strain signal. The liquid core position measurements were compared using predictions from computer models (digital twins) in use at the production site. The measurements were in good agreement with the model predictions, with a few exceptions. Under certain transient caster operating conditions, such as spraying practice changes and SEN exchanges, the model predictions deviated slightly from the liquid core position determined from strain measurements.</jats:p>"

Here, we report our findings up to five months post-acute COVID-19. Methods: Main outcomes and measures included pulmonary function tests, imaging tests, and a battery of symptom, physical, emotional, and cognitive assessments 5 months post-acute COVID-19. Findings: Dyspnea, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, brain fog, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms but there were generally no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts (p &gt; 0.05). Many patients had abnormal physical, emotional, and cognitive scores, but most functioned independently; there were no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts (p &gt; 0.05). Six-minute walk tests, lung ultrasound, and diaphragm excursion were abnormal but only in the hospitalized cohort. Pulmonary function tests showed moderately restrictive pulmonary function only in the hospitalized cohort but no obstructive pulmonary function. Newly detected major neurological events, microvascular disease, atrophy, and white-matter changes were rare, but lung opacity and fibrosis-like findings were common after acute COVID-19. Interpretation: Many COVID-19 survivors experienced moderately restrictive pulmonary function, and significant symptoms across the physical, emotional, and cognitive health domains. Newly detected brain imaging abnormalities were rare, but lung imaging abnormalities were common. This study provides insights into post-acute sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection in neurological and pulmonary systems which may be used to support at-risk patients and develop effective screening methods and interventions.</jats:p>"

The interference can be observed through optical simulation software. Past literature has successfully demonstrated the interference via COMSOL Multiphysics®, but the simulation was not restricted to the use of important domains and settings such as perfectly matched layer and surrounding domain causing imprecise simulation results. This paper proposes a simulation of self-image interference in a single mode-no-core-single mode fiber by using the wave-optics module in COMSOL Multiphysics® software. The beam propagation method is used to observe the self-image interference for different self-image indexes ranging from one to four indexes while the self-image length is obtained from the theoretical calculation before a simulation is carried out. The results show that accurate results can be obtained with restricted simulation settings. The number of the self-image index and self-image length produced by the simulation are similar to the calculation. The self-image point is located exactly at the calculated length with a four-decimal point 0.0000 difference, thus overcoming the limitation of the simulated previous work. In the future, the simulation settings and results can be used for reference to simulate the single mode- no-core-single mode fiber structure.</jats:p>",

Pre-attachment resistance was screened based on the germination-inducing activities of the root exudates, while post-attachment resistance was screened through rhizotron evaluation. The 69 WRC accessions showed a wide variation in both pre- and post-attachment resistance.

In the evaluation of post-attachment resistance, the successful parasitism percentages ranged from 1.3% to 60.7%. The results of these resistance evaluations were subjected to cluster analysis, which recognized five groups: group I of 27 accessions, with high pre- and post-attachment resistance; group II of 12 accessions, with high post-attachment resistance but moderate pre-attachment resistance; group III of 4 accessions, with low pre-attachment resistance; group IV of 13 accessions, with low post-attachment resistance; and group V of 13 accessions, with low pre- and post-attachment resistance.

It provides control of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue and orthopedic surgery in dogs, and control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses. A high-speed stability-indicating reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed to determine firocoxib and its related substances in bulk batches of firocoxib drug substance. Firocoxib was dissolved in neat acetonitrile (ACN) and analyzed on a short HALO (fused-core) biphenyl column (30 × 4.6 mm i.d., 2.7-μm particle size) at flow rate of 2.5 mL/min. Column temperature was maintained at 50°C. Mobile phase A is composed of 0.1% of H3PO4 in water and mobile phase B is composed of ACN. Analytes were detected with UV detection at 240 nm and quantitated against an external reference standard. Firocoxib and its related compounds were adequately separated within 4 min by a gradient elution. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness according to method validation guidelines described in The International Conference on Harmonization. The validation data demonstrated that this method is sensitive, accurate, robust, specific and stability-indicating.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Predicting workload behavior during workload execution is essential for dynamic resource optimization in multi-processor systems. Recent studies have proposed advanced machine learning techniques for dynamic workload prediction. Workload prediction can be cast as a time series forecasting problem. However, traditional forecasting models struggle to predict abrupt workload changes. These changes occur because workloads are known to go through phases. Prior work has investigated machine-learning-based approaches for phase detection and prediction, but such approaches have not been studied in the context of dynamic workload forecasting. In this article, we propose phase-aware CPU workload forecasting as a novel approach that applies long-term phase prediction to improve the accuracy of short-term workload forecasting. Phase-aware forecasting requires machine learning models for phase classification, phase prediction, and phase-based forecasting that have not been explored in this combination before. Furthermore, existing prediction approaches have only been studied in single-core settings. This work explores phase-aware workload forecasting with multi-threaded workloads running on multi-core systems. We propose different multi-core settings differentiated by the number of cores they access and whether they produce specialized or global outputs per core. We study various advanced machine learning models for phase classification, phase prediction, and phase-based forecasting in isolation and different combinations for each setting.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We apply our approach to forecasting of multi-threaded Parsec and SPEC workloads running on an eight-core Intel Core-i9 platform.

The first exposure at 2.4 (±0.2) °C and a minimum of 0.8 °C elicited more changes than the second exposure at 4.9 (±0.3) °C and a minimum of 2.4 °C. After the first exposure, the maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm), effective quantum efficiency of PS II, net photosynthesis (PN), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration, and intercellular CO2 concentration were significantly lower, and after the second exposure, the content of chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, β-carotene, and lutein were lower. The content of antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin was higher immediately after both exposures, and that of antheraxanthin was also higher 24 h later. Recovery took longer in trees that were exposed twice.

However, to assure the sustainability required for its long-term success, nuclear will need to deliver innovative solutions as proposed in iMAGINE. One of the most attractive features, but also a key challenge for the envisaged highly integrated nuclear energy system iMAGINE, is the need for a demand driven salt clean-up system based on the principles of reverse reprocessing. The work described provides an insight into the dynamic interplay between a potential salt clean-up system and reactor operation in a plutonium-started core in a dynamic approach. The results presented will help to optimise the parameters for the salt clean-up process as well as to understand the differences which appear between a core started with enriched uranium and plutonium as the fissile material. The integrated model is used to investigate the effects of the initial fissile material on core size, achievable burnup, and long-term operation. Different approaches are tested to achieve a higher burnup in the significantly smaller Pu-driven core. The effects of different clean-up system throughputs on the concentration of fission products in the reactor salt and its consequences are discussed for general molten salt reactor design. Finally, an investigation into how a plutonium loaded core could be used to provide fuel for future reactors through fuel salt splitting is presented, with the outcome that one Pu-started reactor of the same size as a uranium-started core could deliver fuel for 1.5 new cores due to enhanced breeding. The results provide an essential understanding for the progress of iMAGINE as well as the basis for inter-disciplinary work required for optimising iMAGINE.</jats:p>"

The control of vortex polarity is key to the devices based on vortex. In this paper, an irreversible vortex core (VC) switching in Pac-man disks has been investigated by micromagnetic simulations. The switching process is closely related to the evolution of energy densities and there is a sharp peak in the local exchange energy density when VC switching occurs. Irreversible switching of VC can be realized due to the weak interaction between reversed vortex and rotating magnetic field. In the process of VC reversal, the positive and negative magnetization regions of the gyrofield are separated. Moreover, the switching time of VC decreases monotonously with frequency under rotating magnetic fields. When one direction of the rotating magnetic field is turned off, the difference in switching time is attributed to the different motion behaviors of vortex. This work benefits the potential storage applications in vortex-based spintronic devices.</jats:p>",

With dedicated tender x‐ray emission spectrometer coupled with laboratory excitation source, such analysis can be successfully performed also in a smaller lab. In this work, we have gathered VtC x‐ray emission spectra of several sulfur and chlorine compounds measured previously in our home lab using Johansson type tender x‐ray emission spectrometer and MeV proton excitation. Measured spectra are compared to the results of one‐electron density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Theoretical spectra were found in good agreement with the experimental data with few exceptions where systematic discrepancies were observed. The latter was attributed to the simultaneous K and M shell ionization induced by MeV protons, which is not included in the one‐electron DFT theoretical framework. In order to confirm this also experimentally, VtC x‐ray emission spectra of few selected S and Cl compounds induced with three different proton energies were recorded yielding characteristic KM ionization satellite lines, confirmed by their emission energies as well as the dependence of their relative intensity on proton energy.</jats:p>",

With clear advantages due to the solid-state storage of hydrogen, hydrides and in particular complex hydrides have the ability to tackle environmental pollution by offering the alternative of a clean energy source: hydrogen. However, several drawbacks have detracted this material from going mainstream, and some of these shortcomings have been addressed by nanostructuring/nanoconfinement strategies. With the enhancement of thermodynamic and/or kinetic behavior, nanosized complex hydrides (borohydrides and alanates) have recently conquered new estate in the hydrogen storage field. The current review aims to present the most recent results, many of which illustrate the feasibility of using complex hydrides for the generation of molecular hydrogen in conditions suitable for vehicular and stationary applications. Nanostructuring strategies, either in the pristine or nanoconfined state, coupled with a proper catalyst and the choice of host material can potentially yield a robust nanocomposite to reliably produce H2 in a reversible manner. The key element to tackle for current and future research efforts remains the reproducible means to store H2, which will build up towards a viable hydrogen economy goal. The most recent trends and future prospects will be presented herein.</jats:p>"

Here, we propose a core–shell adhesive structure that is obtained through a growth strategy, i.e., an electrically responsive self-growing core–shell structure. This growth strategy results in a specific mushroom-shaped structure with a rigid core and a soft shell, which exhibits excellent adhesion on typical target surfaces with roughness ranging from the nanoscale to the microscale up to dozens of micrometers. The proposed adhesion strategy extends dry adhesives from smooth surfaces to rough ones, especially for rough surfaces with roughness up to dozens or hundreds of micrometers, opening an avenue for the development of dry adhesive-based devices and systems.</jats:p>"

In previous studies, approximately 60% of the participants experience at least a 40% reduction in ADHD symptoms after an oligoantigenic diet (OD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate ADHD symptoms in children approximately 3.5 years after completing a 4-week oligoantigenic diet. Among 28 participants who completed the 4-week diet, 21 were re-assessed for this study after 3.5 years. The severity of ADHD symptoms was assessed with the ADHD-Rating-Scale-IV (ARS). Of 21 participants, 14 fulfilled the responder criterion, whereas 7 did not. At follow-up, 28% of the participants were taking medication. The mean ARS total score improved significantly from T1: M = 29.62 (SD = 9.80) to T2: M = 15.86 (SD = 8.56) between the time points before and after the diet (d = −1.91). There was also a lower ARS total score at the follow-up T5: M = 16.00 (SD = 10.52) compared to before the diet (d = −1.17). This study shows that individually adjusted nutrition significantly improved the ADHD symptomatology of the participants long-term. This suggests that an oligoantigenic diet with subsequent individual nutritional recommendations could become an additional treatment option for children with ADHD.</jats:p>"

A cryoEM structure of these fibrils reveals an ordered 48-residue core, spanning L103 to F151. CPEB3 constructs lacking this amyloidogenic segment form abnormal puncta in cells when compared to wild type CPEB3, with reduced localization in dormant p-bodies and increased localization in stress granules. Removal of the amyloid core segment in CPEB3 also abolishes its ability to regulate protein synthesis in neurons. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the newly identified amyloidogenic segment within the CPEB3 prion domain is important for its regulated aggregation in cells and suggest its involvement in regulating translational activity and potentially long-term memory formation.</jats:p>"

The development of the parallel EELS instrument and fast, sensitive detectors have greatly improved the acquisition speed of EELS spectra. However, the traditional way of core-loss edge recognition is experience based and human labor dependent, which limits the processing speed. So far, the low signal–noise ratio and the low jump ratio of the core-loss edges on the raw EELS spectra have been challenging for the automation of edge recognition. In this work, a convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed to automate the detection and elemental identification of core-loss edges from raw spectra. An EELS spectral database is synthesized by using our forward model to assist in the training and validation of the neural network. To make the synthesized spectra resemble the real spectra, we collected a large library of experimentally acquired EELS core edges. In synthesize the training library, the edges are modeled by fitting the multi-Gaussian model to the real edges from experiments, and the noise and instrumental imperfectness are simulated and added. The well-trained CNN-BiLSTM network is tested against both the simulated spectra and real spectra collected from experiments. The high accuracy of the network, 94.9%, proves that, without complicated preprocessing of the raw spectra, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM network achieves the automation of core-loss edge recognition for EELS spectra with high accuracy.</jats:p>"

The dielectric constant as well as the effective mass are considered to be dependent on the radius. The modifications occurring due to the presence of the magnetic field have been analyzed. We have found that the electronic and optical properties are strongly affected by the magnetic field strength, the spatial confinement and the off-center displacement. The oscillator strengths and the binding energies increase with the magnetic field, but its effect on the binding energies (both ground and excited states) is dimmed by the reduction of the core-to-shell radii ratio and the increase of the off-center displacement to the vicinity of the shell.

This work reports a core–shell structured membrane fabricated on alumina ceramic substrates via a one-step in situ hydrothermal method. The acid resistance of the modified membrane was significantly improved due to the protection provided by a chemically stable carbon layer. After modification, the masses lost by the membrane in the hydrochloric acid solution and the acetic acid solution were sharply reduced by 90.91% and 76.92%, respectively. Kinetic models and isotherm models of adsorption were employed to describe acid adsorption occurring during the membrane process and indicated that the modified membrane exhibited pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir model adsorption. Compared to the pristine membrane, the faster adsorption speed and the lower adsorption capacity were exhibited by the modified membrane, which further had a good performance with treating various kinds of acid solutions. Moreover, the modified membrane could be recycled without obvious flux decay. This modification method provides a facile and efficient strategy for the fabrication of acid-resistant membranes for use in extreme conditions.</jats:p>"

The bipolar variation in the normal component of the magnetic field inside the middle polar region of the tripolar Hall fields indicated the presence of an ion-scale magnetic flux rope. The coexistence of Hall fields and a magnetic flux rope provides the first evidence that the Hall effect in quasi-antiparallel magnetic reconnection can generate the core field inside a magnetic flux rope. There is one dip in the core field of the observed magnetic flux rope. We interpret the core field and the dip with the Hall effect associated with sequential multiple-X-line reconnection. The results of this study shed light on the mechanism of the generation of the core field inside the magnetic flux rope.</jats:p>",

In this article, spatial reasoning skills are malleable and can be improved with teaching/interventions with mental rotation, spatial orientation, spatial visualization, and property-based reasoning. To achieve the study aim, we conducted a survey in total of 2,303 Japanese Grade 4–9 students (10–15 years old). We take the following stages of the procedures in this article: (a) Descriptive statistics; (b) 2 parameter logistic model (2PLM) analysis; and (c) Experiments with the Pearson correlation coefficient. As a result, we identified that a set of a few tasks can be used to check if students have “core” spatial skills in 3D geometry. For both primary and secondary, rotating given representations mentally, and imagining and drawing 3D shapes, are important, and for secondary schools, property-based reasoning is also crucial for further problem-solving skills. Our findings and methodological approach have implications for mathematics education research and practice as our results provide clear, and promising principles for task/units/curriculum design for spatial reasoning in which more robust teaching intervention is necessary. </jats:p>",

It was demonstrated that in order to predict net reservoirs in the interwell space within the pre-Jurassic rock complex using 3D seismic CDP data, correct tie-in of the wave field with the material composition (net reservoir vs. non-reservoir) of the rocks is needed. Since the pre-Jurassic interval is usually only fragmentarily studied by the core (at the top and at the bottomhole), the article considers the option of using neural simulation technology based on well logging parameters to restore the material composition of the pre-Jurassic rocks. Since the approaches to the restoration of the material composition of rocks according to well logging data are based on a set of quantitative indicators of the curves for each type of rocks, the approach of dividing the preJurassic rocks into petrotypes is of great importance. In this study, the petrotypes were separated not only on the basis of the material composition of rocks, but the reservoir properties and logging-based properties were also taken into account. Logging-based material composition was estimated in several stages. At the first stage, petrotypes were separated from core data, which allowed to group all types of rocks described in the wells into six main petrotypes. Then, for each petrotype, based on the analysis of log-log cross-plots, a set of optimal logging parameters was identified. This allowed running a neural simulation based on Self-Organizing Maps and restoring the material composition of the pre-Jurassic complex for further net reservoir prediction from seismic data.</jats:p>"

Maintaining telomere structure integrity and transcription silencing is important to prevent the occurrence of premature aging and aging-related diseases. How telomere silencing is regulated during aging is not well understood. Here, we find that the four core histones are reduced during yeast chronological aging, leading to compromised telomere silencing. Mechanistically, histone loss promotes the nuclear export of Sir2 and its degradation by autophagy. Meanwhile, reducing core histones enhances the autophagy pathway, which further accelerates autophagy-mediated Sir2 degradation. By screening the histone mutant library, we identify eight histone mutants and one histone modification (histone methyltransferase Set1-catalyzed H3K4 trimethylation) that regulate telomere silencing by modulating the core histones–autophagy–Sir2 axis. Overall, our findings reveal core histones and autophagy as causes of aging-coupled loss of telomere silencing and shed light on dynamic regulation of telomere structure during aging.</jats:p>",

A major open question is how genes and genetic pathways sculpt the evolution of eusociality, especially in rudimentary forms of sociality—those with smaller cooperative nests when compared with species such as honeybees that possess large societies. We lack comprehensive comparative studies examining shared patterns and processes across multiple social lineages. Here we examine the mechanisms of molecular convergence across two lineages of bees and wasps exhibiting such rudimentary societies. These societies consist of few individuals and their life histories range from facultative to obligately social. Using six species across four independent origins of sociality, we conduct a comparative meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptomes. Standard methods detected little similarity in patterns of differential gene expression in brain transcriptomes among reproductive and non-reproductive individuals across species. By contrast, both supervised machine learning and consensus co-expression network approaches uncovered sets of genes with conserved expression patterns among reproductive and non-reproductive phenotypes across species. These sets overlap substantially, and may comprise a shared genetic “toolkit” for sociality across the distantly related taxa of bees and wasps and independently evolved lineages of sociality. We also found many lineage-specific genes and co-expression modules associated with social phenotypes and possible signatures of shared life-history traits. These results reveal how taxon-specific molecular mechanisms complement a core toolkit of molecular processes in sculpting traits related to the evolution of eusociality.</jats:p>",

Developed countries worldwide have their own strategies on Industry 4.0, which offer guidelines on its implementation in production processes, with the aim of their complete flexible automation. The core technologies on which Industry 4.0 rests have led to a complete transformation in production processes, especially in the automotive industry. The basic technology of Industry 4.0 is robot technology, i.e., the implementation of industrial and service robots in production processes. The paper provides an analysis of the implementation of industrial robots and service robots in the automation of production processes in the automotive industry with a focus on China. The analysis of the automation of production processes of the automobile industry in China was carried out for two reasons. The first is that China has a growing middle-class population, so demographic trends are encouraging the growing demand for certain products, such as cars. Another reason is that in China (as in Japan, Russia and Western Europe) the average age of factory workers is increasing (the labor force is older), thus the performance of certain tasks becomes more difficult so greater efficiency is not achieved. The paper analyzes vehicle production in China, as well as the readiness of production processes in the automotive industry for the implementation of Industry 4.0.</jats:p>",

Here, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing with microraft array technology to generate human embryonic stem cell lines with endogenously tagged fluorophores for OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Fluorescence time-lapse imaging revealed that pluripotent stem cells show gastrulation-like patterning without direct chemical induction. Directed differentiation to the three primary germ layers—endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm—revealed distinct spatiotemporal patterns of SOX2 and NANOG expression in single cells. Finally, we captured dynamic changes in cell morphology during ectoderm differentiation corresponding to the formation of neural rosettes.

For short cables, the traditional cable tension identification method via frequency measurement has large errors due to the influence of complex boundaries, which affect the accuracy of estimation. A new cable tension estimation method based on mode shape identification with a multiple sensor arrangement on the cable can take the influence of boundary conditions into account and its accuracy has been verified. However, it requires more sensors compared to the traditional frequency-based method, which will significantly increase the cost of long-term monitoring in practice. Therefore, a novel approach for cable tension monitoring considering both cost and accuracy is further proposed in this study. The approach adopts multiple sensors to measure the influence of boundary conditions. Then, only a single sensor is required for long-term monitoring of the cable. In this paper, an analytical model of the cable is firstly established. The influence of boundary conditions is calculated, which ensures the accuracy of mode shape identification. Furthermore, a field experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the new approach. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness and accurateness of the proposed method in long-term short cable tension monitoring.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a vibration data-driven saturable reactor iron core looseness fault diagnosis strategy named CVG-MFICNN based on CVAE-GAN and MFICNN to overcome the two challenges. This strategy uses a novel 1-D CVAE-GAN model to produce generated samples and expand the training set based on imbalanced training samples. An MFICNN model structure is designed to allow the simultaneous processing of multimodal features such as the SST time-frequency spectrum, time-domain vibration sequence, frequency-domain power spectrum sequence, and time-domain statistics. Using these multimodal features and the MFICNN model, the hidden fault information in vibration data can be effectively mined. An experiment is conducted to collect vibration data of saturable reactors with different faults. Models based on the proposed strategy and other methods are trained and tested using the collected data. The comparison results show that the performance of the proposed CVG-MFICNN approach is significantly superior to that of single-feature CNNs, traditional machine learning methods, and classical image classification CNNs in the application of UHVDC thyristor valve saturable reactor iron core looseness fault diagnosis.</jats:p>"

However, if a small amount of the nominal power is drawn from this transformer while using a single core, core losses can be even greater than the power drawn. In the project of this study, a transformer with two different cores will be produced by dividing the core that will provide the total nominal power while manufacturing the transformer instead of a single core. Theoretical studies and simulation results show that this is possible. In the scientific literature, this situation is examined as a parallel study. It is known that transformers that show high variability in the amount of loading throughout the year in the national grid operate at a low occupancy rate. Instead of the single active core, the increase in the occupancy rate will make the second core active and meet the demand by working in parallel with the cores, which will contribute to the country's economy. Here, the switching on and off of the two cores placed in the same tank will be adapted considering the operating range of the cores with the highest efficiency by selecting the true direction of windings. Transformer prototypes to be produced within the scope of the new generation dual-core transformer project will be selected from among transformers with unbalanced load profiles in YEDAŞ responsibility areas, and transformers with a power of 2x50 kVA will be installed to be applied in pilot areas.</jats:p>"

However, external heating may rise the outer core temperatures up to ∼15−20 K. Such low temperatures at the centre of pre-stellar cores are a key factor to constrain the conditions that lead to the formation of gravitationally bound protostellar systems as was recently captured by highly-resolved Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array observations. Here, we report consistent smoothed particle hydrodynamics collapse calculations of cold cores that demonstrate the formation of close protobinary systems via small-scale fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable protostellar disc. The results indicate that mean binary separations, of tens of astronomical units, are a consequence of disc fragmentation in cold pre-stellar cores. Cloud cores initially with temperatures ≤6 K and a low amplitude (a = 0.1), m = 2 density perturbation formed close protobinaries that were followed deep into the non-isothermal collapse for several orbital periods and appeared to survive as independent stellar entities. At temperatures ≥7 K disc fragmentation is no longer observed and the calculations terminate with the formation of a wide protobinary, which may occasionally be accompanied by small substellar objects emerging by fragmentation of the circumbinary disc. When the perturbation amplitude is raised to a = 0.25, disc fragmentation occurs again only in cores with initial temperatures ≤6 K. Therefore, increasing the perturbation amplitude does not necessarily imply that there will be disc fragmentation at higher core temperatures.</jats:p>",

The five alternative wood flour contents tested were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12%, and the alternative curing temperatures 100, 120, 140, and 160°C were studied with 10% wood flour content. The results showed that the cell size and density of the PU foam increased at wood contents above 6%, which reduced the compressive strength of the samples. It was also found for PU with 10% wood content that curing at 100 to 160°C caused a decrease in foam density by 50%,   compared with PU foam cured under the standard conditions (i.e., at room temperature). SEM and cell size measurements show the anisotropy of PU   foam and the increase of foam cell diameter when increasing the curing temperature from standard condition to 140°C. Consequently, the compressive strength and its specific value declined abruptly at elevated curing temperatures, starting from 100°C. These results suggest that elevated curing temperatures cause degradation of the properties of wood-filled PU foam, due to effects on foam cell structure.   </jats:p>"

However, conventional techniques which rely on modulating the electric current to write or manipulate information using skyrmions are not energy efficient. Therefore, in this study, a Ta/Co–Fe–B/Ta/MgO junction that hosts a skyrmion was utilized to fabricate a device to investigate the effect of applying a voltage in the direction perpendicular to the film plane. Magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy was performed in a polar configuration to observe the difference in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy by observing the behavior of the magnetic domain structure and the skyrmions. Our findings suggest that voltage-induced magnetic domain structure modulation and the creation/annihilation of skyrmions are both possible. Furthermore, manipulation of skyrmions was realized by utilizing repulsive magnetic dipole interaction between the voltage-created skyrmion and skyrmion, exhibiting Brownian motion, outside the top electrode. Thus, our proposed method can enable controlling the creation and annihilation of skyrmions and their positions by manipulating the externally applied voltage. These findings can advance unconventional computing fields, such as stochastic and ultra-low-power computing.</jats:p>",

We show Ctnna3 mRNA is highly expressed in peripheral nerves (e.g. vagus and sciatic), where αTcat protein enriches at paranodes and myelin incisure adherens junctions of Schwann cells. We validate αTcat immunodetection specificity using a new Ctnna3-knock-out fluorescence reporter mouse line yet find no obvious Schwann cell loss-of-function morphology at the light microscopic level. CTNNA3/Ctnna3 mRNA is also abundantly detected in oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system via public databases, supporting a general role for αTcat in these unique cell–cell junctions.

From high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations, we identified two types of interfacial layers between TCO and InGaAs: an In/Ga-rich InGaAs oxide layer and an In/Ga-deficient InGaAs layer. These interfacial layers may have a significant impact on the performance of the Schottky barrier contact. An ultra-thin Ni-layer insertion at the TCO/n+-InGaAs interface reduces the contact resistivity by more than an order of magnitude while maintaining high transparency.

The deformation of this structure and its relation to the stiffness of the galvanized steel is investigated. A series of three-point bending response and subsequent failure modes in web-core laser-welded sandwich structure based on galvanised steel is also investigated. The web-core sandwich structure was manufactured using fibre laser welding technique to joint face and web plates perpendicularly to produce a range of lightweight sandwich structure. The role of the number of cores and spacing distance were purposed to determine the overall deformation of global deflection behaviour of the sandwich structure. The results were compared, and it is showed that the acted load produced bending on faceplate and caused debonding at weld joint (between faceplate and web plate). The continued bending was also caused debonding between PVC foam and adjacent plate. Subsequently, load-displacement trace was used as evidence of the comparison, where seven cores with 20 mm spacing distance exhibited higher force, approximately 1.091 kN. The three-point bending test results indicated that the higher number of cores possessed better performance in bending strength. The effect of the spacing distance of web plates in sandwich structure was also examined. In five cores specimen, it is showed that as the spacing distance decreased, the bending strength increased, where bending stiffness value of 18 mm (0.313 kN/mm) is higher than 19 mm (0.288 kN/mm) and 20 mm (0.281 kN/mm). The effectiveness of the sandwich structure depended on the optimal design as to achieve lightweight and its bending strength.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Precast, prestressed hollow core slabs (HCS) are commonly used by the construction industry for floor and roof systems worldwide. Generally, the web shear strength governs the shear design of such members. This is because the web width resisting shear stresses is relatively small and the prestressing force at the bottom of the slabs restrains flexural cracking. Although most of the available design codes follow Mohr’s circle of stress for estimating the web shear cracking capacity of HCS, they produce different and scattered predictions. This paper gives more insight into the web shear design provisions of prestressed HCS in five of the available design codes. These codes include ACI 318, Eurocode 2, European standard EN 1168, CSA-A23.3, and AASHTO LRFD design specifications. A set of 229 data points was established from experimental investigations available in the literature on prestressed HCS that failed in the web shear. The dataset was used for evaluating the web shear design methods in the five codes. The results of the analysis indicated that both the simplified method of AASHTO and the ACI 318-19 method produced very conservative predictions. In contrast, the Eurocode 2 method produced unconservative predictions for most of the specimens in the dataset, whereas the ACI 318-05 method gave unconservative predictions for deeper sections. On the other hand, reasonable predictions were obtained by the EN 1168 method while the CSA-A23.3 method provided better predictions. Proposed modifications were presented for improving the predictions of the ACI 318, Eurocode 2, and EN 1168 web shear design methods for prestressed HCS.</jats:p>"

The deformation properties are closely related to the geodynamic process affecting the continental crust. However, the evolution of the metamorphic core complexes after their formation is still unclear. The Cretaceous Liaonan metamorphic core complex developed in the eastern North China craton provides an ideal environment to study its evolution. In this study, we estimate the paleo-temperature and paleo-stress at the time of formation of the metamorphic core complex dynamical recrystallization of quartz and calculate the thermo-rheological structure of the present Liaonan metamorphic core complex by one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction equation and power-creep law. The results show that compared with the Cretaceous period, the geothermal heat flow value of the present Liaonan metamorphic core complex decreases from 70–80 mW/m2 to 49.4 mW/m2, the thermal lithosphere thickness increases from 59–75 km to 173 km, and the brittle transition depth increases from 10–13 km to about 70 km, showing coupling of the crust–mantle rheological structure. We speculate that the evolution of the thermo-rheological structure of the Liaonan metamorphic core complex is possibly caused by rapid heat loss or lithospheric mantle flow in the Bohai Bay Basin.</jats:p>"

Starch granules are double encapsulated within the outer cell wall and the inner protein matrix of legume cotyledon cells. Despite progress in understanding the role of cell walls in delaying starch digestion, the role of the protein matrix has received little research attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the protein matrix and cell wall may present combined physical barriers retarding enzyme hydrolysis of intracellular starch. Intact cotyledon cells were isolated from navy beans and used to assess the barrier effect of the protein matrix on the digestion of starch under conditions simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract. The cells were pretreated with pepsin at 37 °C and pH 2.0 for 1, 4, or 24 h and without pepsin for 24 h (control) to facilitate removal of the intracellular protein matrix prior to cooking and simulated in vitro digestion. A longer pretreatment time resulted in a lower protein content of the cells and a higher initial rate and extent of starch hydrolysis. We suggest that in addition to the primary cell wall barrier, the protein matrix provides a secondary barrier restricting the accessibility of α-amylase to starch. This study provides a new fundamental understanding of the relationship between the structural organization of legume cotyledon cells and starch digestion that could inform the design of novel low glycemic index foods.</jats:p>"

The application of Waqf Core Principles in risk management, consists of risk management, collection management, counterparty risk, disbursement management, problem waqf assets, provisions, and reserves, transactions with related parties, country and transfer risks, market risk, reputation and waqf asset loss risk, revenue/profit-loss sharing risk, disbursement risk, operational risk and shari’ah-compliant. Two of these regulatios, are counterparty risk, and country and transfer risks are not applicable to the foundation. The counterparty risk has not been applied because cash waqf has never occurred at the Waqf Maintenance and Development Foundation of Pondok Modern, The country and transfer risks due to the absence of assets involving two countries.\r\nKeywords: Risk Management, Waqf Core Principles, Waqf.</jats:p>"

The effects of BaTiO3 (BTO) electric polarization in the [001], [001¯], and [01¯0] directions on the FeSi/TiO2 and CoCo/TiO2 interface terminations are taken into account. We show that the response of the interface geometric and electronic properties to the BTO polarization depends on the interface termination. For instance, the pinning of atoms at the FeSi-terminated interface inhibits the [001] polarization. Through the a-c domain-wall motion, interface hybridized 3dyz states shift in energy and change the minority-spin density of states at the Fermi level, modifying the AMR through the α=ρ↓ρ↑ component. A discussion of the results based on the Campbell–Fert–Jaoul model with s-s and s-d scattering is provided. The electronic states of Co2FeSi inner layers remained mostly unchanged upon the transition between the ferroelectric domains, which indicates that long-range magnetoelastic effects have a negligible influence on the AMR ratio. Hence, the results indicate that interface bonding effects are the origin of the electric-field modulation of the AMR via a-c domain-wall motion in Co2FeSi/BaTiO3 heterostructures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The Oman ophiolite (Samail massif, Sultanate of Oman) is the largest sub-aerial exposure of oceanic lithosphere on Earth and provides the opportunity to study the accretion and alteration of oceanic lithosphere formed under fast-spreading conditions. Drill hole GT3A (23∘06′50.7′′ N, 58∘12′42.2′′ E) of the ICDP (International Continental Scientific Drilling Program) Oman Drilling Project with a length of 400 m aimed at penetrating the dike–gabbro transition of the Samail ophiolite paleocrust in order to shed light on the role of the axial melt lens (AML) during accretion of the lower plutonic crust. AMLs beneath fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges are sandwiched between the sheeted dike complex and the uppermost gabbros and are believed to feed the upper crust and, at least partially, the underlying crystal mush. Typical gabbroic rocks from dike–gabbro transitions of fast-spreading systems are the so-called “varitextured gabbros”, often showing considerable variations in mineral mode, texture and grain size, which are regarded as the frozen fillings of axial melt lenses. Here, we present a detailed petrographic, microanalytical and bulk-chemical investigation of 36 mafic rocks from the drill hole GT3A, which represent mostly varitextured gabbros, revealing a complex formation with several evolution stages. Poikilitic domains formed first, corresponding to an early crystallization stage, where only plagioclase and clinopyroxene of more primitive composition crystallized. Later, domains of granular textures containing also interstitial amphibole and Fe–Ti oxide were formed. This stage is characterized by a magma evolution that underwent crystal fractionation established by lower temperatures due to more efficient hydrothermal cooling at the margin of the AML. A last stage is characterized by pervasive hydrothermal alteration, where all primary minerals have been altered under temperature conditions, varying from the magmatic regime down to greenschist facies. A highlight of this stage is amphiboles showing noticeable compositional zoning. The observation of peculiar microgranular domains, representing relics of stoped exogenic material from the sheeted dike complex, documents the upward migration of an AML in a replenishment event, forcing the AML to burn through previously altered sheeted dikes. This process is responsible for significant assimilation of hydrothermally altered components, indicated by a marked Cl enrichment in the outer zones of magmatic amphiboles. Petrological modeling involving gabbros and basalts revealed that the GT3A rock suite followed a fractional crystallization evolution trend, with a primitive MORB as parental melt with an estimated water content of 0.2 wt % to 0.8 wt %. The modeled liquid lines of descent suggest a magmatic evolution via fractional crystallization, where the basalts correspond to frozen liquids, while the gabbros, especially the more primitive ones, show a significant cumulate component.</jats:p>"

The 5G core implements the newly defined 3GPP network architecture enabling faster connectivity, low latency, higher bit rates and network reliability. The full potential of this set of networks will support a set of critical Internet of things (IoT) and industrial use cases. Nevertheless, several components and interfaces of the next-generation radio access network (NG-RAN) have proven to be vulnerable to attacks that can potentially obstruct the network’s capability to provide reliable end-to-end communication services. Various inherent security flaws and protocol-specific weaknesses have also been identified within the 5G core itself. However, little to no research has gone into testing and exposing said core-related weaknesses, contrary to those concerning the NG-RAN. In this paper, we investigate, describe, develop, implement and finally test a set of attacks on the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) inside the 5G core. We find that, by transmitting unauthorised session control packets, we were able to disrupt established 5G tunnels without disrupting subscribers’ connectivity to the NG-RAN, thus hindering the detection of said attacks. We evaluate the identified PFCP attacks in a drone-based scenario involving 5G tunnelling between two swarms.</jats:p>"

However, upon storing RBCs, a wide range of damage-associate molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as cell-free DNA, nucleosomes, free-hemoglobin, and poly-unsaturated-fatty-acids are generated. DAMPs can further damage RBCs; thus, the quality of stored RBCs declines during the storage and limits their shelf-life. Since these DAMPs consist of either positive or negative charged species, we developed taurine and acridine containing electrospun-nanofibrous-sheets (<jats:italic>Tau-Acr</jats:italic>NFS), featuring anionic, cationic charges and an DNA intercalating group on their surfaces. We show that <jats:italic>Tau-Acr</jats:italic>NFS are efficient in scavenging DAMPs from stored human and mice RBCs ex vivo.

We perform RBC-transfusion studies in mice to reveal that intermittent removal of DAMPs enhances the quality of stored-old-RBCs equivalent to freshly collected RBCs, and increases their shelf-life by ~22%. Such prophylactic technology may lead to the development of novel blood bags or medical device, and may therefore impact healthcare by reducing transfusion-related adverse effects.</jats:p>"

Through drying, compression and shear test, the average moisture content of the crab‐apple was determined to be 84.57%. And the test results showed that, in the axial direction, the average compressive strength was 0.4137 MPa, and the shear strength was 0.05023 MPa. In the radial direction, the average compressive strength was 0.4462 MPa, and the shear strength was 0.05114 MPa, with anisotropy. The effects of different cutting wedge angle on the force on pulp were studied, and the relevant control system designed. Through the site test of authoritative institutions, the equipment has achieved 98.7% of complete core removal rate and 95.8% of complete ring‐shaped fruit slices rate, and the output has reached 750 kg/h, increasing productivity by more than 10% with low failure rate, and also provides an important reference for the research and development of core removal equipment of other multi‐core fruits. Crab‐apple fruit slices processing enterprises mostly use manual or semi‐automatic equipment for the crab‐apple removal, which restricts development of local crab‐apple processing industry chain. The study has designed an automatic crab‐apple removal and slicing equipment based on the study of physical characters of crab‐apple and analysis of different cutting wedge surface. The experimental results of crab‐apple physical characters show that the crab‐apple pulp is anisotropic. The site test results show that the equipment significantly improves the level of automation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During exocytosis, the fusion of secretory vesicle with plasma membrane forms a pore that regulates release of neurotransmitter and peptide. Heterogeneity of fusion pore behavior has been attributed to stochastic variation in a common exocytic mechanism, implying a lack of biological control. Using a fluorescent false neurotransmitter (FFN), we imaged dense core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis in primary mouse adrenal chromaffin cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy at millisecond resolution and observed strikingly divergent modes of release, with fast events lasting &lt;30 ms and slow events persisting for seconds. Dual imaging of slow events shows a delay in the entry of external dye relative to FFN release, suggesting exclusion by an extremely narrow pore &lt;1 nm in diameter. Unbiased comprehensive analysis shows that the observed variation cannot be explained by stochasticity alone, but rather involves distinct mechanisms, revealing the bimodal nature of DCV exocytosis. Further, loss of calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 increases the proportion of slow events without changing the intrinsic properties of either class, indicating the potential for independent regulation. The identification of two distinct mechanisms for release capable of independent regulation suggests a biological basis for the diversity of fusion pore behavior.</jats:p>",

Then the QD SAs are applied to the erbium‐doped fiber laser (EDFL) ring cavity system, and a mode‐locked laser pulse with a pulse width of 635 fs is generated. In addition, the pulse width is determined by the carrier recovery time, which is closely related to the defect density in the material. A large number of defects are eliminated in the QDs by hydrogen fluoride (HF) treatment, and the pulse width is reduced from 635 to 450 fs. Results of time‐resolved photoluminescence and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) show that HF treatment indeed reduces defects in InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs, indicated by the decrease of the carrier recovery time. This is different from the reported 2D SA materials, which usually reduce the carrier recovery time by increasing the defect density. This study will inspire new applications of QDs in ultrafast photonics and nonlinear optics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mixed or intermediate soils are widely used in the construction of embankment dams. Unfavourable climate conditions and poor quality control may result in the use of mixed soils as under-compacted dam cores, with moisture content highly in excess of the optimum. It is thus essential to design safe filters to prevent internal erosion and piping from wet, under-compacted mixed-soil cores in embankment dams. In this study, 87 no-erosion filter tests were performed on seven mixed core soils having dissimilar geotechnical specifications with diverse moisture contents and compaction ratios. The experimental findings showed that the filter performance (success or failure at preventing erosion) depends on moisture in excess of optimum, the filter D<jats:sub>15</jats:sub>(particle size with 15% finer in filter gradation) and the fines content of the core soil. An increase in excess moisture necessitates a smaller D<jats:sub>15</jats:sub>to inhibit erosion, to the extent that filters respecting accepted criteria may fail to hinder erosion in the case of excessively wet and under-compacted cores. Overall, for group II, cores the criterion of D<jats:sub>15</jats:sub> &lt; 0.7 mm was found to be applicable for soils with compaction ratios over 96%, provided that they are non-dispersive and have a fines content less than 80%.

Methods. Roots (n=48) randomly divided into 4 groups (n=12) according to the obturation protocol; (1) iRoot SP in bulk; (2) iRoot SP with gutta-percha; (3) GuttaFlow Bioseal in bulk; (4) GuttaFlow Bioseal with gutta-percha. Six horizontal sections were obtained from each root (n=72). Effect of sealers on bond strength was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Results. Highest mean value was obtained in iRoot-Bulk group and lowest in GuttaFlow Bioseal-GP group. Both iRoot SP groups had significantly higher bond strength values than both GuttaFlow Bioseal groups (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between iRoot-GP and iRoot-Bulk groups (P=0.603) also GuttaFlow Bioseal-GP and GuttaFlow Bioseal-Bulk groups (P=0.684). Conclusion. Based on findings, using calcium silicate-based sealer in bulk can be also suitable in clinical practice.</jats:p>",

The discontinuous reinforcements included sheet molding compound (SMC), bulk molding compound (BMC), and the discontinuous prepreg based platelets that were chopped from the woven trim scrap. Hybrid sandwich configurations using different core materials exhibited improvements in flexural mechanical properties, while providing more progressive failure under both flexural and compressive loading. Compressive strength in polyester SMC and woven laminate was significantly lower than flexural strength, while BMC and chopped platelets exhibited similar levels of strength in flexure and compression. Overall, hybridized compression molding produced sandwich structures can be used to control the failure progression and to improve the structural characteristics of composite, especially under flexural loads. The trim scrap core sandwich configuration had mechanical properties comparable with the BMC core hybrid. Therefore, trim scrap upcycling can be an efficient approach to reducing the amount of material waste during the manufacturing. </jats:p>",

These structures are very prone to different damages, which affects the structure’s performance. In this study, the numerical three-point bending test is carried out to evaluate the flexural performance of the damaged and repaired panel by comparing it with the intact panel values. The response surface methodology (RSM) is then adopted to analyze the core plug replacement properties’ effect on the flexural performances of the repaired honeycomb sandwich panel. Adequate models between the core plug replacement design parameters and the repaired panel flexural responses are built and discussed. In addition, aiming to determine the optimized core plug replacement parameters of the proposed repaired panel flexural performances, an optimization technique is implemented. </jats:p>",

Up to now, the intermediate regime between these two populations has remained mostly unexplored.

Spectroscopically, LSNe appear to form a continuum between Type Ic SNe and SLSNe. Given their intermediate nature, we model the light curves of all LSNe using a combined magnetar plus radioactive decay model and find that they are indeed intermediate, not only in terms of their peak luminosity and spectra, but also in their rise times, power sources, and physical parameters. We subclassify LSNe into distinct groups that are either as fast evolving as SNe Ib/c or as slow evolving as SLSNe, and appear to be either radioactively or magnetar powered, respectively. Our findings indicate that LSNe are powered by either an overabundant production of <jats:sup>56</jats:sup>Ni or by weak magnetar engines, and may serve as the missing link between the two populations.</jats:p>",

Re-cently, green synthesis of nanoparticles using plant extracts has gained more attention, since they are simple, cost-effective, non-toxic, environment friendly and easily scaled up for large-scale synthesis. There is a great demand for synthesizing Copper nano-particles (CuNPs) by simple and less expensive methods. The peels of a variety of fruits have gained attention as a natural source of antioxidants. Green synthesis of CuNPs was successfully obtained from bio-reduction of copper sulfate pentahydrate solutions using &lt;i&gt;Musa acuminata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Citrus sinensis&lt;/i&gt;. CuNPs have been appropriately characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy and SEM analysis. It was observed that CuNPs synthesized from dried orange peel extract had better anti-microbial and antioxidant activi-ty than the fresh orange peel and showed great activity than all the other three samples. Since copper is well-known for its anti-microbial properties, we assumed that fabricating CuNP from banana and orange peel extract can increase its efficiency. The antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles was analyzed using gram-positive (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;), gram-negative (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;), and fungal (&lt;i&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/i&gt;) species. Due to their benign and stable nature and antimicrobial property, these CuNPs may be well utilized for industrial and medicinal purposes.</jats:p>"

A large proportion of such chemicals are present in very low concentrations and may have synergistic effects, even at their no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). Complex mixtures of contaminants are very difficult to assess by traditional toxicological methods. There is increasing attention on how different pollutants induce adverse physiological functions in the human body through effects on the circadian rhythm. However, it is very difficult to screen for compounds with circadian-rhythm-disrupting effects from a large number of chemicals or their complex mixtures. We established a stable firefly luciferase reporter gene knock-in U2-OS cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 to screen circadian-rhythm-disrupting pollutants. The luciferase gene was inserted downstream of the core clock gene BMAL1 and controlled by an endogenous promoter. Compared to detection systems using exogenous promoters, these cells enable the detection of compounds that interfere with the circadian rhythm system mediated by BMAL1 gene expression. The U2-OS knock-in cells showed BMAL1 and luciferase activity had parallel changes when treated with BMAL1 inhibitor and activator. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter gene has high sensitivity and is faster and more cost-effective than classic toxicology methods. The knock-in cell line can be used for high-throughput and efficient screening of circadian-rhythm-disrupting chemicals such as drugs and pollutants.</jats:p>"

The device, with a length of 21 mm, had extinction ratios (ERs) of 20.5 dB, 10.4 dB and 15.7 dB for the E21, E12 and E11 modes, respectively, over the C-band.

This research collected various samples from soil and animal (sheep, goat, horse, cow, and camel), blood and organs (kidney and liver) in the Mongolian countryside. These samples were processed, and the concentration of metals was quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP/MS). As previously reported, arsenic was found at high levels of accumulation in soil. Selenium is another concern, as median concentration in one area exceeded the maximum allowable level. Cadmium and selenium were found to be highly accumulated in animal kidney. This research revealed the current pollution level in Mongolia based on evaluation of soil and animals. The concentration in animals could not indicate that animals had severe effects because of heavy metal exposure. However, kidney is eaten in Mongolia, and so there is a direct connection to human health, and this research suggested the possible risks posed by each edible animal. In particular, evaluation of metals in livestock is rare in Mongolia. This result can contribute to animal and human health in Mongolian communities.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we have advanced our previous study by including the effect of Saturn. To maintain focus on the effect of this planet, and in order to be consistent with previous studies, we did not include the effect of the nebular gas. Results demonstrate that, as expected, Saturn’s perturbation decreases the rate of accretion by scattering many planetesimals out of Jupiter’s accretion zone. It also increases the velocities with which planetesimals encounter the envelope, which in agreement with our previous findings enhances their breakup due to the ram pressure. Results also show that, because the effect of Saturn in scattering of planetesimals increases with its mass, this planet might not have played a significant role in the accretion of planetesimals by proto-Jupiter during the early stage of its growth. Finally, the late accretion of planetesimals, as obtained in our previous study, appears in our new results as well, implying that, combined with the rapid infall of the gas, it can result in the mixing of material in the outer regions of the envelope, which may explain the enhancement of the envelope’s high-<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> material.</jats:p>",

According to recent studies, not only the nature of the cluster molecules, but also the macroscopic structure of the materials determines their non‐linear optical properties. Here we present a systematic study of cluster dimers of the compounds AdR<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and [(RT)<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>] (T = Si, Ge, Sn) with R = methyl, phenyl or 1‐naphthyl to gain fundamental knowledge about the interactions in the materials. For all compounds, a similar type of dimer structures with a staggered arrangement of substituents was determined as the energetically most favorable configuration. The binding energy between the dimers, determined by including London dispersion interactions, increases with the size of the core and the substituents. The cluster interactions can be classified as substituent‐substituent‐dominated (small cores, large substituents) or core–core‐dominated (large cores, small substituents). Among various possible dimer conformers, those with small core–core distances are energetically preferred. Trimer and tetramer clusters display similar trends regarding the minimal core–core distances and binding energies. The much lower energy barrier determined for the rotation of substituents as compared to the rotation of the cluster dimers past each other indicates that the rotation of substituents more easily leads to different conformers in the material. Thus, understanding the interaction of the cluster dimers allows an initial assessment of the interactions in the materials.</jats:p>",

The disease is most widely transmitted from an infected mother to her baby, after exposure to infected blood or body fluids or unsafe sexual contact. Pregnant women, adolescents, and all adults at high risk for chronic infection are recommended to be screened for hepatitis B. Serological tests allow the distinction between acute and chronic hepatitis. Meanwhile, the molecular tests performed provide detection and quantification of viral DNA, genotyping, drug resistance, and pre-core/core mutation analysis to confirm infection and follow monitoring disease progression in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Because, the current treatment is only based on nucleotide analogs and pegylated interferons that save lives by decreasing liver cancer death, liver transplant, slowing or reversing the progression of liver disease as well as the virus infectivity. In this review, we clearly light the role of Hepatitis B Core Antibody, therefore clinicians understand the need to screen for hepatitis B core antigen (Anti-HBc), proper interpretation of HBV biomarkers, and that “anti-HBc only” indicates HBV exposure, lifelong persistence of cccDNA with incomplete infection control, and potential risk for reactivation.\n\nKey words: Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis B Core Antibody (Anti-HBc/HbcAb).</jats:p>",

EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200 are core components of the U5 snRNP, which is crucial for spliceosome function as it coordinates and performs the last steps of the splicing reaction. Several studies have demonstrated U5 snRNP proteins as targeted during viral infection, with a limited understanding of their involvement in virus–host interactions. In the present study, we deciphered the respective impact of EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200 on viral replication using mammalian reovirus as a model. Using a combination of RNA silencing, real-time cell analysis, cell death and viral replication assays, we discovered distinct and partially overlapping novel roles for EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200 in cell survival, apoptosis, necroptosis, and the induction of the interferon response pathway. For instance, we demonstrated that EFTUD2 and SNRNP200 are required for both apoptosis and necroptosis, whereas EFTUD2 and PRPF8 are required for optimal interferon response against viral infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that EFTUD2 restricts viral replication, both in a single cycle and multiple cycles of viral replication. Altogether, these results establish U5 snRNP core components as key elements of the cellular antiviral response.</jats:p>"

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has been used as a powerful tool for identifying community composition, but it does not necessarily provide quantitative information due to several methodological limitations. Thus, the quantification of eDNA through metabarcoding is an important frontier of eDNA-based biomonitoring. Particularly, the qMiSeq approach has recently been developed as a quantitative metabarcoding method and has attracted much attention due to its usefulness. The aim here was to evaluate the performance of the qMiSeq approach as a quantitative monitoring tool for fish communities by comparing the quantified eDNA concentrations with the results of fish capture surveys. The eDNA water sampling and the capture surveys using the electrical shocker were conducted at a total of 21 sites in four rivers in Japan. As a result, we found significant positive relationships between the eDNA concentrations of each species quantified by qMiSeq and both the abundance and biomass of each captured taxon at each site. Furthermore, for seven out of eleven taxa, a significant positive relationship was observed between quantified DNA concentrations by sample and the abundance and/or biomass. In total, our results demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding with the qMiSeq approach is a suitable and useful tool for quantitative monitoring of fish communities. Due to the simplicity of the eDNA analysis, the eDNA metabarcoding with qMiSeq approach would promote further growth of quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.</jats:p>"

The compatibility with a cementitious matrix and the effects of TiO2@CoAl-LDH on cement hydration, surface microstructure, and the microscopic mechanical properties of mortar were investigated by AFM, microhardness testing, FESEM, and BET analysis. Meanwhile, the effects of TiO2@CoAl-LDH introduction methods on the photocatalytic performance and durability of the photocatalyst were systematically evaluated by methylene blue (MB) removal ratio and wear testing. The results show that TiO2@CoAl-LDH exhibits enhanced compatibility with cementitious matrices and a higher photocatalytic capacity than individual CoAl-LDH and nano-TiO2. The photocatalytic mortar prepared via spraying technology (CM-C) displays a higher photocatalytic capacity than that prepared via the smearing method (CM-S). Among them, the mortar with two layers of photocatalytic coatings (CM-C2) has the highest MB removal ratio, which reached 95.1% within 120 min of UV-visible light irradiation. While on the other hand, the wear test revealed that the smeared mortar has a higher photocatalytic capacity and better photocatalyst durability than the sprayed mortar.

Core fracture classification was the fundamental issue of the project. In this study, three grade classifications for core fractures were proposed. Comprehensive classification of core fractures was carried out using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)–fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method. Finally, the fracture classification results were validated against numerical simulation. The grade-1 fracture classification included hydraulic fractures, drilling-induced fractures and core cutting-induced fractures. A total of 214 hydraulic fractures were observed. For the grade-2 classification, the hydraulic fractures were divided into 47 tensile fractures and 167 shear fractures. For the grade-3 classification, the shear fractures were subdivided into 45 tensile-shear fractures and 122 compression-shear fractures. Based on the numerical verification of the core fracture classifications, the dataset acquired was applied to analyze the spatial distribution of tensile and shear fractures. Results showed that the tensile fractures were mainly in the near-wellbore area with lateral distances of less than 20–25 m from the wellbore. The shear fractures were mainly in the far-wellbore area with lateral distances of 20–30 m from the wellbore. These results provide a basis for understanding the fracture types, density, and failure mechanisms of post-fracturing conglomerate reservoir.</jats:p>"

However, most cancers have shown treatment resistance after several months of inhibitor usage, and reports indicate resistance is often associated with the reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway. It is widely accepted that an effective MAPK therapy will have a significant impact on curtailing cancer growth and improving patient survival. However, despite more than three decades of intense research and pharmaceutical industry efforts, an FDA‐approved, effective anti‐cancer ERK inhibitor has yet to be developed. Here, we present the design, optimization, and biological characterization of ERK1/2 inhibitors that block catalytic phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as RSK but also modulate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK without directly inhibiting MEK.

It is commonly accepted that the CCE promotes the sea surface cooling (SSC) primally through the enhanced vertical mixing, while the contributions from the wind-driven advection and the near-inertial advection to the differences in the sea surface temperature (dSST) were underestimated. This study found that the presence of CCE contributed to the stronger along-track cold advection, which dominated the increase in the SSC near the radius of maximum wind (RMW) to the right of Trami’s track, and the stronger cross-track warm advection was acting to prevent the cooling induced by the vertical mixing. During the relaxation stage, the stronger near-inertial advection within the CCE accounted largely for the amplification and the redistribution of the dSST. As for the dynamic responses, the enhanced upwelling and downwelling within the CCE explained the larger cooling and warming in the subsurface temperature oscillations. The wind-driven acceleration of the currents in the mixing layer was larger during the typhoon–eddy interaction so that the CCE became an efficient mixer, thus contributing to the rapid surfacing of the cold water and the ensuing stronger wind-driven advection. These results highlight the importance of the advection processes in the modulating effect of the CCE. Therefore, 3D ocean models are needed to incorporate the mesoscale features of the oceanic eddies for realistically reproducing the upper-ocean responses to tropical cyclones (TCs).</jats:p>",

The complex propolis composition requires an accurate and reproducible characterization of samples to standardize the quality of the material sold to consumers.

This choice was made due to the complexity of the sample with the presence of several compounds. The optimized method was hyphenated with mass spectrometry detection allowing the detection of 23 different compounds. A step‐by‐step strategy was used to optimize temperature, flow rate, mobile phase composition, and re‐equilibration time. Reverse‐phase separation was achieved with a C18 fused‐core column packed with the commercially available smallest particles (1.3 nm). Using a fused‐core column with ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography allows highly efficient, sensitive, accurate, and reproducible determination of compounds extracted from propolis with an outstanding sample throughput and resolution. Optimized conditions permitted the separation of the compounds in 5.50 min with a total analysis time (sample‐to‐sample) of 6.50 min.</jats:p>",

Here we present syngeneic graft models of aggressive, metastasis-prone histopathology-specific NSCLC tumor types driven by KRAS mutation and loss of LKB1 (KL): adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) and adenocarcinoma (AC). We show that subcutaneous injection of primary KL; ASC cells results in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors with high levels of stromal infiltrates, lacking the source heterogeneous histotype. Despite forming subcutaneous tumors, intravenously injected KL;AC cells were unable to form lung tumors. In contrast, intravenous injection of KL;ASC cells leads to their lung re-colonization and lesions recapitulating the mixed AC and SCC histopathology, tumor immune suppressive microenvironment and oncogenic signaling profile of source tumors, demonstrating histopathology-selective phenotypic dominance over genetic drivers. Pan-ERBB inhibition increased survival, while selective ERBB1/EGFR inhibition did not, suggesting a role of the ERBB network crosstalk in resistance to ERBB1/EGFR. This immunocompetent NSCLC lung colonization model hence phenocopies key properties of the metastasis-prone ASC histopathology, and serves as a preclinical model to dissect therapy responses and metastasis-associated processes.</jats:p>",

The CORE‐OM is a commonly used 34‐item self‐report instrument measuring psychological problems/distress covering four domains: subjective well‐being, problems/symptoms, functioning and risk. Despite its broad application, only a few studies have used IRT to examine the psychometric properties, and the properties of the Swedish version have only been examined in one initial study. The present study included 1,011 clients with mild to moderate symptoms of distress, applying for psychotherapy at an outpatient training clinic in Sweden. Clients' responses were subjected to classical item analyses as well as IRT (Rasch) analysis using the partial credit model. The classical analyses demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and acceptable levels of item discrimination for the majority of the items, although lower for some items, particularly in the Risk domain. IRT analyses showed that there was a rather good match between item and respondent locations and the measurement precision was high. Disordered step and average measures for some of the items in the Risk domain indicate that these items were problematic from a psychometric point of view and only applicable for a minority of the participants. Differential item functioning for gender in some of the items suggests that they might need to be revised to minimise potential gender bias.</jats:p>",

The results from the phylogenetic and population structures showed a high level of agreement, with 232 germplasms being classified into three main groups. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) test indicated that 96% of the total variance was derived from within populations, which revealed a low differentiation among populations. A core collection composed of 157 germplasms was firstly constructed thereafter, of which the diversity parameters non-significantly differed from the original population. These results revealed the genetic diversity and population structure of C. hystrix germplasms, which have implications for germplasm management and genome-wide association studies on C. hystrix, as well as for core collection establishment applications in other wood-producing hardwood species.</jats:p>"

There are more hydraulic fractures than expected, and clustering across a range of scales from approximately 1 cm to 50 m. The largest cluster correlates with high microseismic event density. Diversion, bifurcation, and segmentation structures may account for the large number of fractures observed and the orientation spread. Reactivation of sealed natural fractures and bedding planes is relatively uncommon. Proppant sand packs and patches occur in a few locations, particularly where hydraulic fractures are complex.\n          </jats:p>",

Thermally expandable microspheres (TESs) were used as a blowing agent, while bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers served both as a reinforcing agent and as a means of improving biocompatibility. PHBV was plasticized with acetyltributylcitrate to reduce the processing temperature and ensure the maximum efficiency of the TES agent. The morphological investigation results for plasticized PHBV foams showed well-organized porous structures characterized by a porosity of 65% and the presence of both large pores (&gt;100 µm) and finer ones, with a higher proportion of pores larger than 100 µm being observed in the PHBV nanocomposite containing TESs and BC. The foamed structure allowed an increase in the water absorption capacity of up to 650% as compared to the unfoamed samples. TESs and BC had opposite effects on the thermal stability of the plasticized PHBV, with TESs decreasing the degradation temperature by about 17 °C and BC raising it by 3–4 °C. A similar effect was observed for the melting temperature. Regarding the mechanical properties, the TESs had a flexibilizing effect on plasticized PHBV, while BC nanofibers showed a stiffening effect. An in vitro cytotoxicity test showed that all PHBV compounds exhibited high cell viability. The addition of TESs and BC nanofibers to PHBV biocomposites enabled balanced properties, along with lower costs, making PHBV a more attractive biomaterial for engineering, packaging, or medical device applications.</jats:p>"

The intermediate layer of resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles can be sequentially deposited on Cu nanowires to form CuO@RF@Ag core-shell nanowires by a two-step wet chemical approach. The appropriate resorcinol weight and silver nitrate concentration can be favorable to grow the CuO@RF@Ag nanowires with higher surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement for detecting rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. Compared with CuO@Ag nanowires grown by ion sputtering, CuO@RF@Ag nanowires exhibited a higher SERS enhancement factor of 5.33 × 108 and a lower detection limit (10−12 M) for detecting R6G molecules. This result is ascribed to the CuO@RF@Ag nanowires with higher-density hot spots and surface-active sites for enhanced high SERS enhancement, good reproducibility, and uniformity. Furthermore, the CuO@RF@Ag nanowires can also reveal a high-sensitivity SERS-active substrate for detecting amoxicillin (10−10 M) and 5-fluorouracil (10−7 M). CuO@RF@Ag nanowires exhibit a simple fabrication process, high SERS sensitivity, high reproducibility, high uniformity, and low detection limit, which are helpful for the practical application of SERS in different fields.</jats:p>"

Such metal‐free electrode materials suffer realistically from low electronic conductivities and insufficient utilization of active sites. Herein, thermally imidized polyimides are synthesized by polycondensation between 2,6‐diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ) and anhydrides. A quinone‐containing polyimide (PMAQ) derived from pyromellitic dianhydride and DAAQ is found to exhibit the highest capacity and rate performance. Furthermore, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are encapsulated in densely interlaced PMAQ nanoflakes by in situ polymerization to form core‐shell heterostructured composites (CNT@PMAQ). Remarkably, the CNT@PMAQ cathode delivers reversible capacities of 163 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 0.05 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 122 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 5 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively.

This study crafts an unusual strategy to engineering macromolecular chains and building core‐shell heteroarchitectures to unlock the barrier of low utilization ratio of active sites toward high‐rate charge storage. Coupling bipolar electrode materials into symmetric full batteries will further stimulate the development of low‐cost sustainable batteries.</jats:p>",

However, new zircon U-Pb dates for the tephra suggest that the tephra was deposited ca. 207 ka during MIS 7, with wide-ranging implications for chronologies of glaciation, paleoclimate, relict permafrost, and phylogeography. We analyzed ~1900 detrital glass shards from 28 samples collected at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1345 in the Bering Sea, which has a well-constrained age model from benthic foraminiferal δ18O. Except for one possibly contaminant shard dated at 165 ka, Old Crow tephra was absent from all samples spanning 220–160 ka. Old Crow tephra appeared abruptly at 157 ka, comprising &amp;gt;40% of detrital shards between 157 and 142 ka. This abrupt increase in the concentration of detrital Old Crow tephra, its absence in earlier intervals, and its presence at low concentrations in all samples between 134 and 15 ka collectively indicate that the tephra was deposited during the middle of MIS 6 with a likely age of 159 ± 8 ka. As a result, the late Quaternary chronostratigraphic framework for unglaciated northwest North America remains intact, and the timing of key events in the region (e.g., bison entry into North America; interglacial paleoclimate; permafrost history; the penultimate glaciation) does not require wholesale revision.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Kiwifruit belonging to the Actinidiaceae family is a perennial, dioecious vine called ‘the king of fruits’ due to its considerably nutritious and sweet characteristics. A. chinensis complex, including two main groups, A. chinensis var. chinensis and A. chinensis var. deliciosa, is a major component of Actinidia due to their huge economic value and the high degree of development and utilization. Wild resources are widely distributed in China, but are under serious threat due to extreme environments and destroyed habitats. Thus, it is of great significance for the conservation of kiwifruit resources and the sustainable development of the kiwifruit industry to evaluate the genetic diversity of existing genetic resources and to systematically construct a core collection of the A. chinensis complex. In this study, 40 high polymorphism microsatellites markers were used to investigate all accessions from the A. chinensis complex. A total of 888 alleles were marked with 22.2 alleles in each locus. The expected heterozygosity was 0.846, the observed heterozygosity was 0.622, the polymorphism information content was 0.835, and the Shannon information index was 2.369. Among these loci, the observed heterozygosity of 38 loci was lower than expected. The inbreeding coefficient was 0.257, which indicates that frequent hybridization occurred between close relatives. Analyses of molecular variance showed that genetic variations mainly came from the population. Finally, a core collection containing 93 accessions was constructed. The bank not only perfectly represented the genetic diversity of the original population, but also had excellent potential for development and utilization. Our research provides a crucial reference for the future conservation, germplasm identification, and genetic breeding of kiwifruit.</jats:p>"

We explore effects of the EOS based on the Dirac–Brückner–Hartree–Fock theory through comparisons with those based on the variational method. We also examine effects of the differences in the composition of nuclei and nucleons by using the same EOS as the variational method but employing two different treatments in computations of nuclear abundances. We perform numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae adopting the three EOSs. We also perform numerical simulations of the long-term evolution over 70 s of the proto-neutron star cooling. We show that the impacts of different modeling of the composition are remarkable as in those due to different treatments of uniform matter in the gravitational collapse, bounce and shock propagation. The cooling of a proto-neutron star and the resulting neutrino emission are also affected by the compositional difference even if the same treatment is used in computing uniform matter of the EOS.</jats:p>",

The genetic diversity of C. oleifera germplasms resources in Guizhou was studied based on fruit traits and simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers to build a core collection. This paper aims to provide a scientific basis for the collection, management, development, and utilization of C. oleifera resources in Guizhou province. The variation coefficients among and within varieties of seven fruit phenotypic traits of C. oleifera ranged from 11.79% to 61.76% and from 8.15% to 42.31%, respectively, showing rich phenotypic variation. Furthermore, 12 SSR markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity. These primers generated 214 polymorphic bands, and the average number was 17.833. The average number of effective alleles (Ne), Shannon’s information index (I), observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), polymorphic information content (PIC), and major allele frequency (MAF) were 8.999, 2.301, 0.965, 0.50, 0.836, and 0.238, respectively. The results showed that 12 SSR markers had high polymorphism, and the genetic diversity of 167 C. oleifera germplasm resources was high. Based on SSR molecular marker information and fruit traits clustering, 167 C. oleifera germplasm resources were divided into three groups. When constructing core collections based on fruit traits and molecular marker information, the PowerCore-25 of core collections greatly preserves fruit traits and improves genetic diversity. This paper can provide a reference for the genetic diversity and fruit traits variation of C. camellia germplasm resources in Guizhou Province. It is significant for establishing a core collection, thus promoting germplasm innovation and the development of the oil tea industry in Guizhou.</jats:p>"

The variation of outcomes reported in trials to assess the most effective treatment interventions for uncomplicated UTIs has meant that comparing and synthesising the outcomes across trials is challenging and limits the reliability of evidence which would otherwise inform healthcare decisions. Objective: Develop a Core Outcome Set (COS) for interventions for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in otherwise healthy adults. Methods: The COS development consisted of three phases: (1) A systematic review to identify outcomes reported in randomised trials and systematic reviews of randomised trials comparing the effectiveness of any interventions for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in otherwise healthy adults; (2) Outcomes identified in the systematic review were prioritised in an online 3-round modified Delphi survey with healthcare practitioners (n = 68), researchers (n = 5), and people who have experienced or cared for someone experiencing a UTI (n = 180); (3) An online consensus meeting to determine the final COS with healthcare practitioners and policymakers (n = 9), researchers (n = 4), and people who have experienced or cared for someone experiencing a UTI (n = 7). Results: We identified a large number of outcomes. Through the use of robust consensus methods, those outcomes were reduced to a core set of six outcomes that should, at a minimum, be measured and reported in randomised trials and systematic reviews of interventions treating uncomplicated UTIs in adults.</jats:p>"

We performed a surface characterization of the photo-oxidized graphene micro-sheets using an original scanning photoelectron microscopy system that enables element-selective electronic and chemical state analysis with a high spatial resolution. We succeeded for the first time in experimentally revealing the progression of the photo-oxidation reaction in graphene from the edge. During the photo-oxidation process, hole doping from the adsorbed molecules occurred first. The reaction proceeded selectively to the edges of the graphene sheets. Defects were then introduced by chemical reactions with adsorbed molecules, and finally the graphene sheets decomposed and disappeared.</jats:p>",

Herein, a series of donor−acceptor type and crosslinked core−shell nanoparticles are designed and applied in phototransistors as a charge‐trapping electret. The outer shell is composed of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA); while the inner core comprises donors of thiophene and bithiophene (2T) and acceptors of benzothiazole (BT), naphthalenediimide (NDI), and hexafluorobenzene‐naphthalenediimide (FB‐NDI). It is found that the core−shell and donor−acceptor design play an important role in the charge trapping, photoresponse, and the corresponding device performance.

The haplotype network visualized the pre-Omicron, intact-Omicron, and post-Omicron variants and revealed their evolutionary direction. The correlation analysis showed the correlation feature of the core mutations in Omicron. Moreover, we found some core mutations, such as 142D, 417N, 440K, and 764K, reversed to ancestral residues (142G, 417K, 440N, and 764N) in the post-Omicron variant, suggesting the reverse mutations provided sources for the emergence of new variants.

Its economic evaluation is a contentious issue. This paper proposes a method for selecting the type of conductors based on the life cycle cost (LCC) of a transmission line, which includes the initial investments, operation costs, maintenance costs, failure costs, and discard costs. The mathematical model of electromagnetic loss differs due to the various operational circumstances surrounding a transmission line; therefore, a novel three‐dimensional electromagnetic–fluid–thermal coupling model based on the finite element method (FEM) was proposed. The simulation error of ACCC and aluminium conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) conductors is 2.56% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to the experimental value. Subsequently, the LCC model is applied in the economic analysis of a 1000‐kV transmission line, and the costs of ACCC conductors and ACSR conductors under different annual power load utilization hours are calculated. The results indicate that the overhead power transmission line with ACCC conductors saves at least 2 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> ¥/km compared with ACSR when annual utilization hours reach 3500 h; meanwhile, energy saving benefits are achieved.</jats:p>",

This is especially the case for those that have long been geographically isolated, possibly through multiple glaciations, as they can contribute significantly to species' overall genetic diversity. However, distinguishing between glacial relict and more recently established warm‐edge populations is difficult especially in the absence of a continuous fossil record. In this study, we investigate the origin of anomalously low‐elevation warm‐edge populations of the dominant cool temperate Japanese tree <jats:italic>Fagus crenata</jats:italic> in the northeast Kanto (NEK) region. We sought to determine whether these populations are glacial relicts or, rather, were established via dispersal in the Holocene using chloroplast and nuclear genetic data, species distribution modeling and comparison with populations in a well‐established glacial refugia (south‐central Kyushu [SCK]) and of mid‐late Holocene age (southern Hokkaido [SH]). Whole chloroplast genome “mining” revealed a similar amount of haplotype diversity in NEK and SCK while there was no chloroplast variation in SH. Populations in NEK, particularly the lowest elevation sites, harbored unique haplotypes providing evidence for their persistence since the Last Glacial Maximum as supported by species distribution models under two of three general circulation models. NEK populations also lacked the genetic signatures of recent expansion that characterize the most northern‐edge populations in SH. We conclude that warm‐edge populations in NEK are most likely relicts of glacial refugia and should be given high priority for conservation.</jats:p>",

Aimed at elucidating meniscus pathophysiology, previous studies have investigated the shear properties of the meniscus fibrocartilaginous core. However, the meniscus is structurally inhomogeneous, with an external cartilaginous envelope (tibial and femoral surface layers) wrapping the tissue core. To date, little is known about the shear behavior of the surface layers. The objective of this study was to measure the dynamic shear properties of the surface layers and derive empirical relations with their composition. Specimens were harvested from tibial and femoral surface layers and core of porcine menisci (medial and lateral, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 10 each). Frequency sweep tests yielded complex shear modulus (<jats:italic>G*</jats:italic>) and phase shifts (δ). Mechanical behavior of regions was described by a generalized Maxwell model. Correlations between shear moduli with water and glycosaminoglycans content of the tissue regions were investigated. The femoral surface had the lowest shear modulus, when compared to core and tibial regions. A 3‐relaxation times Maxwell model satisfactorily interpreted the shear behavior of all tissue regions. Inhomogeneous tissue composition was also observed, with water content in the surface layers being higher when compared with tissue core. Water content negatively correlated with shear properties in all regions. The lower measured shear properties in the femoral layer may explain the higher prevalence of meniscal tears on the superior surface of the tissue. The heterogenous behavior of the tissue in shear provides insight into meniscus pathology and has important implications for efforts to tissue engineer replacement tissues.</jats:p>",

In this study, the effect of steam and air pyrolysis conditions on the mechanical properties of re-cycled carbon fiber (r-CF) recovered from carbon fiber-reinforced thermosetting (epoxy/4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone) plastics (CFRPs) was investigated. Steam pyrolysis enhanced resin degradation relative to N2. The tensile strength of the recovered r-CF was reduced by up to 35.12% due to oxidation by steam or air. However, the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) tended to increase by 9.18%, which is considered to be due to the increase in functional groups containing oxygen atoms and the roughness of the surface due to oxidation. The recycling of CFRP in both a steam and an air atmosphere caused a decrease in the tensile strength of r-CF. However, they were effective methods to recover r-CF that had a clean surface and increased IFSS.</jats:p>"

The emission intensity and the apparent ignition temperature were strongly dependent on the metal type, with Mg showing higher intensities. On the other hand, the effect of the binder showed that the ignition behaviour, emission intensity, and spectral purity were influenced by the nature and exothermicity of the binder.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Herpesviruses replicate their genomes and assemble their capsids in the host cell nucleus. To progress towards morphogenesis in the cytoplasm, herpesviruses evolved the strategy of nuclear egress as a highly regulated process of nucleo-cytoplasmic capsid transition. The process is conserved among α-, β- and γ-herpesviruses and involves the formation of a core and multicomponent nuclear egress complex (NEC). Core NEC is assembled by the interaction between the nucleoplasmic hook protein, i.e., pUL53 (human cytomegalovirus, HCMV), and the integral membrane-associated groove protein, i.e., pUL50. Our study aimed at the question of whether a panherpesviral NEC scaffold may enable hook-into-groove interaction across herpesviral subfamilies. For this purpose, NEC constructs were generated for members of all three subfamilies and analyzed for multi-ligand interaction using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach with randomized pUL53 mutagenesis libraries. The screening identified ten library clones displaying cross-viral shared hook-into-groove interaction. Interestingly, a slightly modified Y2H screening strategy provided thirteen further changed-hook pUL53 clones having lost parental pUL50 interaction but gained homolog interaction. In addition, we designed a sequence-predicted hybrid construct based on HCMV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) core NEC proteins and identified a cross-viral interaction phenotype. Confirmation was provided by applying protein–protein interaction analyses in human cells, such as coimmunoprecipitation settings, confocal nuclear rim colocalization assays, and HCMV ΔUL53 infection experiments with pUL53-complementing cells. Combined, the study provided the first examples of cross-viral NEC interaction patterns and revealed a higher yield of human cell-confirmed binding clones using a library exchange rate of 3.4 than 2.7. Thus, the study provides improved insights into herpesviral NEC protein binding specificities of core NEC formation. This novel information might be exploited to gain a potential target scaffold for the development of broadly acting NEC-directed inhibitory small molecules.</jats:p>"

The effects of leaders’ personal and workplace resources on their health and work–life balance have often slipped under the radar, as most studies are directed outwardly and focus on follower outcomes. With this study, we closed a gap in the research and investigated the positive effects of remote work, autonomy, and leaders’ core-self evaluations (CSE) on two important leader outcomes: health and work–life balance. We hypothesized that the relationship between remote work and the outcomes would be moderated by leaders’ CSE and their autonomy—in such a way that leaders with lower resources benefit more from remote work and achieve better health and work–life balance the more days they spend working from home. A sample of 367 leaders reported their frequency of working from home, their autonomy, and CSE. Their health and work–life balance were assessed five months later. Results showed a moderating effect of CSE on both outcomes, indicating that leaders with low CSE benefit more in terms of health and work–life balance. There was no moderating effect of autonomy. Leaders with high resources (autonomy and CSE) had overall higher levels of health and work–life balance regardless of work location. Practitioners in organizations should consider working from home as a resource for leaders, particularly if personal resources are lower.</jats:p>"

Herein, a novel NIR detection method based on energy conversion by upconversion (UC) materials is demonstrated. Nanoparticles (NPs) containing erbium (Er) ions are used as the UC material. Conventional NPs that contain ≈2 mol% Er ions have very weak light absorption ability, which is dramatically improved by incorporating high concentrations of Er ions (≈100 mol%). By coating the NP surfaces with inorganic perovskite containing heavy atoms (CsPbBr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) instead of organic alkyl chains, the thermal vibrations that deactivate the UC emission are suppressed effectively, resulting in high UC emission quantum efficiency of &gt;5%. The perovskite coating process facilitates the introduction of the NPs into CsPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> thin films (which absorbs visible light only) and forms highly crystalline and uniform thin films. The resulting CsPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> thin film can be excited with NIR light, showing the emission from CsPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> via the UC. This enables fabrication of a UC‐based photodetector generating a photocurrent signal through the energy conversion process from NIR to visible light.

Methods: Both clinical trials and the INternational Stroke Perfusion Imaging REgistry (INSPIRE) were used. Patients with acute computed tomography perfusion scan with an ischaemic core of ≥70 mL were included. A Markov model was constructed to simulate the long-term costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life year) post-index stroke. Effectiveness of EVT (modified Rankin scale score at 3 months) was derived from the trials and INSPIRE registry (compared to matched patients not treated with EVT), respectively. Results: Based on the trial and real-world data, the overall results revealed varied health benefits and costs due to EVT, with reduced health benefits and increased costs from EVT treatment in everyday practice. The long-term simulation estimated that offering EVT to large vessel occlusion stroke patients with large ischaemic core was associated with greater benefits (1.12 vs. 0.25 quality-adjusted life year gains) and lower (−A$19,320) or higher costs (A$11,278), using trial and real-world data, respectively. The incremental cost of the EVT procedure (i.e., A$14,356) could be primarily offset to a different extent by the reduction in costs related to the nursing home care (−$31,986 vs. −A$1,874) in the clinical trial and real-world practice. Conclusions: Our results highlight the potential gaps when implementing an effective intervention in the real world and the importance of the rigorous selection of large infarct core patients for EVT. </jats:p>"

It is important to obtain fundamental insight into the synergistic effects arising from interactions between NTP-activated species and catalysis. However, it remains a challenge due to difficulties associated with the <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> characterization of NTP-activated species. In this study, CO was explored in dielectric barrier discharge by applying <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> transmission infrared (TIR) absorption spectroscopy; TIR enables the measurement of the vibrational temperature of CO while observing the surface reaction of excited CO to form intermediates species over wurtzite ZnO. The reaction behavior of activated CO correlates with the vibrational temperature of CO, showing vibrationally-excited CO reacts with lattice oxygen via the Mars–van Krevelen type mechanism; thus leading to higher activity compared with conventional thermal catalysis. This work helps to understand the fundamental chemistry and provides new insight into NTP-activated CO and its catalysis.</jats:p>",

Here, we present high-resolution e-MERLIN observations clearly indicating the presence of sub-kpc jets; this may have implications for the proposed origin of the minihalo emission, providing an ongoing source of relativistic electrons rather than a single burst sometime in the past, as previously assumed in simulations attempting to reproduce observational characteristics of minihalo-hosting systems.</jats:p>",

An unknown virus, designated CX-2, was isolated from a diseased cucumber sample by single lesion isolation on <jats:italic>Chenopodium quinoa</jats:italic> leaves.

The portable MinION sequencer released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies was used to detect viral sequences in dsRNA of CX-2-infected leaf tissue. The whole genome sequence of CX-2 was completed by Sanger sequencing and analyzed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with species-specific primers and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with anti-coat protein antisera were developed for virus detection in the field [see Additional file 1].</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Icosahedral particles about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the crud leaf sap of CX-2-infected <jats:italic>C. quinoa</jats:italic> plant. The complete genome sequence of CX-2 was determined as 4577 nt long and shared 97.0–97.2% of nucleotide identity with that of two cucumber Bulgarian latent virus (CBLV) isolates in Iran and Bulgaria. Therefore, CX-2 was renamed CBLV-TW. In 2020–2022 field surveys, melon yellow spot virus (MYSV) had the highest detection rate of 74.7%, followed by cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) (32.0%), papaya ringspot virus virus watermelon type (PRSV-W) (10.7%), squash leaf curl Philippines virus (SLCuPV) (9.3%), CBLV (8.0%) and watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV) (4.0%).

Detection methods including RT-PCR and indirect ELISA have been developed to detect CBLV and to investigate cucumber viruses in central Taiwan. The 2020–2022 field survey results showed that MYSV and CCYV were the main threats to cucumbers, with CBLV, SLCuPV and WSMoV were occasionally occurring.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

The drying and shrinkage characteristics of cortex and core were investigated under different hot air drying conditions, and the EMDs of the cortex and core in different drying stages were determined by the slope method considering the moisture content and shrinkage.

In this work, a general route to modify the interfaces of electron conductor is strategically developed via introducing a well‐designed core@dual–shell structure based on SnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>nanoparticles grafted by potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) and polyethylene oxide (PEO). This graded bimolecular strategy is desired as it efficiently decouples the processes of defect healing and crystallization engineering. Synergistic effects of KSCN and PEO lead to superior structural uniformity at the buried interfaces, enhanced charge collection, as well as the suppressed carrier recombination. Consequently, a significant increase of efficiency from 20.0% to 23.01% is achieved, accompanied by a remarkable open‐circuit voltage of 1.19 V and extremely low energy losses down to 0.4 eV. Moreover, this interfacial configuration enables the unencapsulated devices to have greatly improved performance longevity by retaining 87% of initial power after 5112 h storage in air, as well as strong mechanical endurance by maintaining over 80% of initial efficiency after 4700 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 5 mm for flexible devices.

Network analysis was applied to a sample of <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 179 SCZ patients (age range: 19–70 years, mean=39.5, SD=9.9) who met clinical criteria for gambling disorder-related problems. Variables included in the network were the core GD symptoms according to the DSM-5, psychotic and paranoid ideation levels, global psychological distress, GD severity measures (debts and illegal behavior related with gambling), substances (tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs), and personality profile. The nodes with the highest authority in the network (variables of highest relevance) were personality traits and psychological distress. Four empirical modules/clusters were identified, and linkage analysis identified the nodes with the highest closeness (<jats:italic>bridge</jats:italic> nodes) to be novelty seeking and reward dependence (these traits facilitate the transition between the modules). Identification of the variables with the highest centrality/linkage can be particularly useful for developing precise management plans to prevent and treat SCZ with GD.</jats:p>",

In this article, the surface modification of carbon black particles based on core–shell structure design as a promising candidate material for bone tissue engineering applications is presented. TiC/TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/SrCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐coated carbon black particles were prepared via molten salt synthesis and hydrothermal process at various temperatures to study the effects of temperature on crystal structure, morphologies, surface wettability, and biological functions. Phase composition, morphologies, and elemental distributions were studied by X‐ray diffraction, field‐emission scanning electron microscope, and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, respectively. Cell proliferation, cell viability, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and calcium deposition were also investigated. The investigation showed that the reaction temperature played an important role in the crystallinity, phase formation, nanotopography, and biological functions of the particles. The particles treated at 250°C offered favored surface properties of roughness, composition, crystallite size, and wettability for cell adhesion, proliferation, ALP activity, and calcium deposition. As a result, these bioactive core–shell particles would be a promising filler material for bone tissue engineering applications.</jats:p>",

The larger magnetic field is required to vanish the topological Hall resistivity in the martensite phase in comparison to the premartensite phase, which manifests the more stable skyrmion textures in the martensite phase.

A motion-incorporated planning technique was employed to simulate treatment delivery of 10 lung cancer patients’ clinical VMAT plans using original and three scaling-up (by 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 cm) motion waveforms from single-breath four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and multi-breath time-resolved 4D magnetic resonance imaging (TR-4DMRI). The planning tumor volume (PTV = ITV + 5 mm margin) dose coverage (PTV D95%) was evaluated. The repeated waveforms were used to move the isocenter in sync with the clinical leaf motion and gantry rotation. The continuous VMAT arcs were broken down into many static beam fields at the control points (2°-interval) and the composite plan represented the motion-incorporated VMAT plan. Eight motion-incorporated plans per patient were simulated and the plan with the native 4DCT waveform was used as a control. The first (D95% ≤ 95%) and second (D95% ≤ 90%) plan breaching points due to motion amplitude increase were identified and analyzed. The PTV D95% in the motion-incorporated plans was 99.4 ± 1.0% using 4DCT, closely agreeing with the corresponding ITV-based VMAT plan (PTV D95% = 100%). Tumor motion irregularities were observed in TR-4DMRI and triggered D95% ≤ 95% in one case. For small tumors, 4 mm extra motion triggered D95% ≤ 95%, and 6–8 mm triggered D95% ≤ 90%. For large tumors, 14 mm and 21 mm extra motions triggered the first and second breaching points, respectively. This study has demonstrated that PTV D95% breaching points may occur for small tumors during treatment delivery. Clinically, it is important to monitor and avoid systematic motion increase, including baseline drift, and large random motion spikes through threshold-based beam gating.</jats:p>"

Metal nanowire networks are promising next-generation TCEs, but best-performing examples rely on expensive metal catalysts (palladium or platinum), vacuum processing, or transfer processes that cannot be scaled. This work demonstrates a metal nanowire TCE fabrication process that focuses on high performance and simple fabrication. Here we combined direct and plating metallization processes on electrospun nanowires. We first directly metallize silver nanowires using reactive silver ink. The silver catalyzes subsequent copper plating to produce Ag–Cu core–shell nanowires and eliminates nanowire junction resistances. The process allows for tunable transmission and sheet resistance properties by adjusting electrospinning and plating time. We demonstrate state-of-the-art, low-haze TCEs using an all-atmospheric process with sheet resistances of 0.33 Ω sq<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and visible light transmittances of 86% (including the substrate), leading to a Haacke figure of merit of 652 × 10<jats:sup>–3</jats:sup> Ω<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

The product with the highest oxygen vacancy was found at 400 °C (named CuO/C-400 °C), which increased catalytically active sites and enhanced the charge-transfer efficiency. The sensing performance was afterward explored by amperometry under an optimal applied potential at 0.5 V (vs. SCE), presenting a broad detection range from 5.0 µM to 25.325 mM (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.9998) with a sensitivity of 244.71 µA mM<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>− 2</jats:sup>, and a detection limit of 1 µM. Furthermore, the reliability and selectivity of CuO/C-400 °C sensors were extensively explored in the presence of artificial serum/saliva samples with gradient glucose concentrations. The human blood samples were also detected with high recoveries compared with the clinical Hexokinase method. Hence, the prepared CuO/C-400 °C sensor with a broad detection range and high selectivity can be applied for the diabetes diagnosis ex vivo without further dilution for real-time analysis in practical applications.</jats:p>"

However, the future impacts of climate change on solar PV and the wind energy potential in the region are still unclear. This study investigates the expected future impacts of climate change on solar PV and wind energy potential over West Africa using an ensemble of three regional climate models (RCMs). Each RCM is driven by three global climate models (GCMs) from the new coordinated high-resolution output for regional evaluations (CORDEX-CORE) under the RCP8.5 scenario. Two projection periods were used: the near future (2021–2050) and the far future (2071–2100). For the model evaluation, reanalysis data from ERA5 and satellite-based climate data (SARAH-2) were used. The models and their ensemble mean (hereafter Mean) show acceptable performance for the simulations of the solar PV potential, the wind power density, and related variables with some biases. The Mean predicts a general decrease in the solar PV potential over the region of about −2% in the near future and −4% in the far future. The wind power density (WPD) is expected to increase by about 20% in the near future and 40% in the far future. The changes for solar PV potential seem to be consistent, although the intensity differs according to the RCM used. For the WPD, there are some discrepancies among the RCMs in terms of intensity and direction. This study can guide governments and policymakers in decision making for future solar and wind energy projects in the region.</jats:p>"

Especially CpfCs, which are found in the CPD pathway, are currently in the spotlight of research. This pathway was identified in 2015 and revealed that the correct substrate for these ferrochelatases is coproporphyrin III (cpIII) instead of protoporphyrin IX, as believed prior the discovery of the CPD pathway. The chemistry of cpIII, which has four propionates, differs significantly from protoporphyrin IX, which features two propionate and two vinyl groups.

For the practical application of HD maps, it is significant to regularly update environmental changes in HD maps. Conventional approaches require expensive mobile mapping systems and considerable manual work by experts, making it difficult to achieve frequent map updates. In this paper, we show how frequent and automatic updates of lane marking in HD maps are made possible with enormous crowdsourced data. Crowdsourced data is acquired from onboard low-cost sensing devices installed on many city buses and taxis in Seoul, South Korea. A large amount of crowdsourced data is daily accumulated on the server. The quality of sensor measurement is not very high due to the limited performance of low-cost devices. Therefore, the technical challenge is to overcome the uncertainty of the crowdsourced data. Appropriately filtering out a large amount of low-quality data is a significant problem. The proposed HD map update strategy comprises several processing steps including pose correction, observation assignment, observation clustering, and landmark classification. The proposed HD map update strategy is experimentally verified using crowdsourced data. If the changed environments are successfully extracted, then precisely updated HD maps are generated.</jats:p>"

The anti-corrosion and adsorption characteristics were assessed using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods were used to evaluate the inhibitive performance of the inhibitors on the metal surface. Then, both DFT/DFTB calculations and molecular dynamic simulations were further adopted to investigate the interaction between organic inhibitor molecules and the metal surface. The protective layers assembled using the active constituents, such as carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, of the three plant-based products offer high electrochemical stability at high temperatures and robust protection against aggressive acidic solutions. All electrochemical measurements showed that the inhibition performance of extracts increased by increasing their concentration and improved in the following order: FEAE &gt; ZZAE &gt; ITAE. Further, these extracts worked as mixed-type inhibitors to block the anodic and cathodic active sites on the mild steel surface. Multi-level computational approaches revealed that FEAE is the most adsorbed inhibitor owing to its ability to provide electron lone pairs for electrophilic reactions. The experimental and theoretical results showed good agreement. These results indicate the possibility of replacing conventional compounds with natural substituted organic products in the fabrication of hybrid materials with effective anti-corrosion performance.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to assess the welfare impacts of raising surplus calves destined for veal with their dam for 2 or 4 weeks until transport. Surplus calves from one dairy farm were separated from their dam at birth (n = 39) or kept with the dam (n = 37) until transport to the veal farm at either 2 (n = 50) or 4 (n = 26) weeks of age, with abrupt separation for dam-reared calves. Calf measures of body weight, health, immunity, haematology and behaviour were recorded at the dairy and veal farms. Dam-reared calves had higher body weights in weeks 3, 4 and 5 at the DF, as well as at arrival at the veal farm, but by slaughter this advantage was lost. More dam-reared calves had fever in week 3 and showed signs of disease in week 5 at the dairy farm. Dam-reared calves did not differ in IgG, IgA or IgM levels but had higher counts of white blood cells, which could reflect a higher pathogen exposure rather than improved immunity. Dam-reared calves displayed more fear towards humans in a human approach test at 5 and 7 weeks after arrival at the veal farm, and more frequent social behaviours at the veal farm at 9 and 16 weeks of age. In conclusion, it seems that there may be both advantages and disadvantages to keeping veal calves with the dam in terms of welfare in the current system.</jats:p>"

A comprehensive analysis of the thermal and phase behavior of dendrimers allows us to detect a similar performance of dendrimers of both generations which, in our opinion, can be due to the similar ratio of rigid and flexible blocks in the dendrimers regardless the generation of carbosilane cores. The propensity to crystallization and ordering after the annealing procedure was confirmed by DSC and SWAXS.

We simulated a binary variable associated with 20 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). WQSRSRH was used to test for the association between the microbiome and the simulated variable, adjusted for sex, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The WQSRSRH method was also compared to other standard methods for microbiome analysis. The method was further illustrated using real data from the Growth and Obesity Cohort in Chile to assess the association between the gut microbiome and body mass index. In the analysis with simulated data, WQSRSRH predicted the correct directionality of association between the microbiome and the simulated variable, with an average sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 70%, respectively, in identifying the 20 associated OTUs. WQSRSRH performed better than all other comparison methods. In the illustration analysis of the gut microbiome and obesity, the WQSRSRH analysis identified an inverse association between body mass index and the gut microbe mixture, identifying Bacteroides, Clostridium, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus as important genera in the negative association. The application of WQSRSRH to the microbiome allows for analysis of the mixture effect of all the taxa in the microbiome, while simultaneously identifying the most important to the mixture, and allowing for covariate adjustment. It outperformed other methods when using simulated data, and in analysis with real data found results consistent with other study findings.</jats:p>"

Light-induced proton transfer could occur from the Schiff base toward Glu107, reorienting Ser76, followed by subsequent proton transfer toward His80.

Through magneto‐transport measurements and first‐principles calculations, here robust spin–orbit coupling (SOC)‐induced properties of a ferromagnetic topological surface state in FeSi and their controllability via hybridization with adjacent materials are demonstrated. In comparison to the case of its naturally oxidized surface, the ferromagnetic transition temperature is greatly increased beyond room temperature and the effective SOC strength is almost doubled at the surface in proximity to a wide‐bandgap fluoride insulator. Those enhanced magnetic properties enable room‐temperature magnetization switching, being applicable to spin–orbit torque based spintronic devices.

We characterized cell diversity and identified novel collecting duct (CD) cell subtypes in cystic kidneys. We further found that CD cells appear to take different cell fate trajectories, and the first and the most important step might take place around day 14 in Pkd1 homozygous kidneys. After that day, increased numbers of CD cells showed highly proliferative and fibrotic characteristics, as detected in later-stage Pkd1 homozygous kidneys, both of which should contribute to cyst growth and renal fibrosis. With a newly developed modeling algorithm, called CellChat Explorer, we identify cell-to-cell communication networks mediated by the ligand receptor, such as MIF-CD44/CD74, in cystic kidneys, and confirm them via the expression patterns of ligands and receptors in four major cell types, which addresses the key question as to whether and how Pkd1 mutant renal epithelial cells affect their neighboring cells. The allele-specific gene expression profiles show that the secretion of cytokines by Pkd1 mutant epithelial cells may affect the gene expression profiles in recipient cells via epigenetic mechanisms, and vice versa.

Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 386 older adults in nursing homes in Hunan Province, China. Assessments included the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form for nutrition risk, Dietary Diversity Score for dietary diversity and Mini Mental State Examination for cognitive status. Sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex and educational level), health-related characteristics (e.g., food intake, self-care status and medication), body composition (e.g., body mass index [BMI], protein, body fat mass [BFM], percent body fat [PBF], skeletal muscle index [SMI] and total body water [TBW]) and anthropometric parameters data (e.g., calf circumference [CC], upper arm circumference [UAC], handgrip and gait speed) were also collected. Malnutrition and their associated risk were analyzed by multivariable Poisson regression analysis. Results: In total, 32.4% of participants (n = 125) were at risk of malnutrition and 49.7% (n = 192) suffered from sarcopenia. Nutritional status was positively associated with age (risk ratio [RR] = 1.03), sarcopenia (RR = 1.88), tooth loss affecting food intake (RR = 1.45), low self-care status (RR = 1.82) and moderate/inadequate dietary diversity (RR = 2.04) and negatively associated with one child (RR = 0.27), BMI (RR = 0.82), protein (RR = 0.76), BFM (RR = 0.91), PBF (RR = 0.94), SMI (RR = 0.65), TBW (RR = 0.94), CC (RR = 0.89) and UAC (RR = 0.86). Conclusions: Age, number of children, sarcopenia, food intake, self-care status, dietary diversity and body composition were associated with malnutrition among nursing home residents. For vulnerable groups, researchers should focus on raising the body composition indicators, such as BMI, protein, BFM, SMI and TBW and measuring CC and UAC for initial screening.</jats:p>"

Such an approach is computationally intensive and may not necessarily result in efficient generation or collection of nonlinear signals from the designed structure. Here, we report hybrid-genetic optimization (HGA) based design and experimental demonstration of second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement from Fabry–Perot structures of single and double multilayer gallium selenide (GaSe) flakes with bottom silicon dioxide, and index matched polymethyl methacrylate spacer/encapsulation layers.

The manufacturing quality was examined by microscopic examination and non‐destructive computed tomography (CT) scanning. The results indicated that manufacturing voids are mainly concentrated in the printed carbon fiber bundles, resulting from inadequate infiltration between the reinforcement and the matrix. Flatwise compression tests were conducted to compare the mechanical performance of sandwich structures with the fiber‐adjacent and fiber‐interleaved core. The results clearly demonstrated that the fiber‐interleaved design can significantly improve the mechanical performance of the sandwich structures (i.e., 44% higher in elastic modulus and 119% higher in strength). Furthermore, three‐point bending tests were conducted to investigate the flexural behavior. Fractographic analysis demonstrated that the main failure modes under these loading conditions include fiber pull‐out and breakage, delamination, local core crushing, fiber/matrix and panel/core debonding.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have suggested neuroprotective benefits for the brain and retina from pharmacological modulation of S1R and/or S2R. However, the effect of such modulation on AMD pathology remains underexplored. Here, we evaluated S1R- or S2R-selective modulation in an AMD-related model of Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice with a disrupted visual cycle that predisposes RPE and photoreceptors to illumination-induced damage. For S1R modulation, we used (+)-pentazocine, which is a high-affinity S1R-selective drug. For S2R modulation, we chose CM398, a high-affinity and highly S2R-selective ligand with drug-like properties. Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice received a single i.p. injection of (+)-pentazocine or CM398 or vehicle 30 min before illumination. Pretreatment with (+)-pentazocine improved electroretinogram a- and b-waves compared to that with vehicle. Consistently, in another AMD-related mouse model induced by tail-vein injected NaIO3, S1R genetic ablation aggravated photoreceptor loss. In Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice, pretreatment with CM398 appeared to partially avert illumination-induced photoreceptor loss and autofluorescent granule formation that signals RPE damage, as revealed by optical coherence tomography. Thus, this study using AMD-related models provides evidence of photoreceptor protection afforded by selective modulation of S1R or S2R.</jats:p>"

Axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (<jats:sc>jam</jats:sc>) modeling is applied to 6000 star particles for each system to recover the underlying matter distribution.

The biases correlate with the dynamical status, which is a result of contraction motions due to tidal effects in quiescent systems or galactic winds in star-forming systems, driving them out of equilibrium. After including Gaia DR3 proper motion errors, we find proper motions can be as useful as line-of-sight velocities for nearby systems at &lt; ∼60 kpc. By extrapolating the actual density profiles and the dynamical constraints down to scales below the resolution, we find the mass within 150 pc can be an unbiasedly constrained ensemble, with a scatter of ∼0.255 dex. We show that the contraction of member stars in nearby systems is detectable based on Gaia DR3 proper motion errors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid (β-amyloid) plaques. These plaques activate microglia to secrete inflammatory molecules, which damage neurons in the brain. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanism of microglia activation can provide a therapeutic strategy for alleviating microglia-induced neuroinflammation. The aldose reductase (AR) enzyme catalyzes the reduction of glucose to sorbitol in the polyol pathway. In addition to mediating diabetic complications in hyperglycemic environments, AR also helps regulate inflammation in microglia. However, little is known about the role of AR in β-amyloid-induced inflammation in microglia and subsequent neuronal death. In this study, we confirmed that AR inhibition attenuates increased β-amyloid-induced reactive oxygen species and tumor necrosis factor α secretion by suppressing ERK signaling in BV2 cells. In addition, we are the first to report that AR inhibition reduced the phagocytotic capability and cell migration of BV2 cells in response to β-amyloid. To further investigate the protective role of the AR inhibitor sorbinil in neurons, we co-cultured β-amyloid-induced microglia with stem cell-induced neurons. sorbinil ameliorated neuronal damage in both cells in the co-culture system. In summary, our findings reveal AR regulation of microglia activation as a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease.</jats:p>"

Two sets of low velocity zones (LVZs) are clearly observed: one with a flat style beneath the western Lhasa terrane and Higher Himalaya at 18–20 km depth and the other with two west‐dipping shapes below the western Yarlung‐Zangbo suture within 10–30 km depth. These LVZs caused by partial melting and aqueous fluids are disconnected, impeding the formation of crustal flow. A discontinuous east‐dipping intra‐crustal discontinuity and a sharp Moho offset of 7 km under the Aniqiao‐Motuo shear zone are identified, suggesting that the underthrusting of the Indian lower crust and pure shear mechanisms jointly dominate crustal deformation in the core of the EHS.</jats:p>",

Civil, marine and automotive industries are some examples of the sectors that use SPs frequently. This work demonstrates the potential of manufacturing Z-pin-reinforced foam core SPs, using a design strategy that indicated optimal values for both pin position and angle, keeping the same pin diameter as determined in a previous study. A simple search algorithm was applied to optimize each design, ensuring maximum flexural stiffness. Designs using optimal pin position, optimal pin angle and optimal values for both parameters are herein investigated using numerical and experimental approaches. The optimal pin position yielded an increase in flexural stiffness of around 8.0% when compared to the non-optimized design. In this same comparison, the optimal pin angle by itself increased the flexural stiffness by about 63.0%. Besides, the highest increase in the maximum load was found for those composites, molded with optimized levels of pin position and pin angle, which synergistically contributed to this result. All results were demonstrated with numerical and experimental results and there was a good agreement between them.</jats:p>"

However, the limited amount of intracellular H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> makes achieving high-performance chemodynamic therapy challenging. Herein, we report a core-shell nanoplatform with dual-responsive disassembly that self-supplies H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and undergoes an autocatalytic Fenton reaction for enhanced chemodynamic therapy. The platform was designed by coating glucose oxidase-mimicking nanozyme gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a metal-polyphenol network (Au@MPN). Both ATP and low pH can disassemble the Au@MPN to release Fe(III), which can then be reduced into Fe(II) by the simultaneously released tannic acid (TA). In particular, the exposed AuNPs can catalyze the oxidation of intracellular glucose to produce H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Subsequently, Fe(II) and the self-supplied H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> induce an efficient Fenton reaction for chemodynamic therapy by generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that are highly toxic to cancer cells. Moreover, tumor growth can be effectively suppressed after both intratumoral and intravenous Au@MPN administration.

It can collect microscopic information about walnuts in the classification roller and guide its optimization design. In this process, simulation parameters are essential factors that ensure the effectiveness of the simulation. In this study, the crucial parameters of thin-skinned walnut particles in classification simulation were determined by combining the discrete element method (DEM) and physical tests. Firstly, the moisture content, shear modulus, stacking angle, and some contact parameters in the shell and kernel were obtained by drying test, compression test, cylinder lifting test, and physical test of contact parameters, respectively. A walnut model was constructed using reverse modeling technology. Then, the ranges of the rest contact parameters were determined using simulation inversion based on the Generic EDEM Material Model database. Second, the parameters significantly influencing the stacking angle were screened via the Plackett–Burman test using contact parameters as factors and stacking angle as the index. The results revealed that the walnut–walnut static friction coefficient, walnut–walnut rolling friction coefficient, and walnut–steel plate static friction coefficient significantly affect the stacking angle. The steepest ascent experiment produced the optimal value intervals of crucial parameters. Besides, a quadratic regression model of important parameters was built using the Box–Behnken test to achieve the optimal parameter combination. The stacking and classification experiments verified that the stacking angle and morphology are mostly similar under calibration parameters without any considerable differences. The relative error was only 0.068%. Notably, the relative error of the average staying time of walnut in the classification roller was 0.671%, and the dimensionless distribution curves of stay time were consistent. This study provides technological support to the simulation analysis of walnut classification and recommends novel methods and references to determine the parameters of other shell materials.</jats:p>"

The confinement width obtained from the PL image is 5.5 × 10<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> nm, consistent with nanoscale 1D confined trions with the diffraction limit broadening.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimization of graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) for high-frequency applications requires further understanding of the physical mechanisms concerning charge carrier transport at short channel lengths. Here, we study the charge carrier transport in GFETs with gate lengths ranging from 2 μm down to 0.2 μm by applying a quasi-ballistic transport model. It is found that the carrier mobility, evaluated via the drain–source resistance model, including the geometrical magnetoresistance effect, is more than halved with decreasing the gate length in the studied range. This decrease in mobility is explained by the impact of ballistic charge carrier transport. The analysis allows for evaluation of the characteristic length, a parameter of the order of the mean-free path, which is found to be in the range of 359–374 nm. The mobility term associated with scattering mechanisms is found to be up to 4456 cm2/Vs. Transmission formalism treating the electrons as purely classical particles allows for the estimation of the probability of charge carrier transport without scattering events. It is shown that at the gate length of 2 μm, approximately 20% of the charge carriers are moving without scattering, while at the gate length of 0.2 μm, this number increases to above 60%.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigate the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), located in the lateral hypothalamus and critically involved in feeding behaviors, as a target of lPB projection neurons. Optogenetic activation of lPB-PSTN terminals in male mice promote avoidance behaviors, aversive learning, and suppressed feeding. Inactivation of the PSTN and lPB-PSTN pathway reduces fear-induced feeding suppression. Activation of PSTN neurons expressing pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide enriched in the PSTN, is sufficient for inducing avoidance behaviors and feeding suppression. Blockade of PACAP receptors impaires aversive learning induced by lPB-PSTN photomanipulation. These findings indicate that lPB-PSTN pathway plays a pivotal role in fear-induced feeding suppression.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Metal nanoparticles are effective radiosensitizers that locally enhance radiation doses in targeted cancer cells. Compared with other metal nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) exhibit high biocompatibility, low toxicity, and they increase secondary electron scatter. Herein, we investigated the effects of active-targeting GNPs on the radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) in prostate cancer cells. The impact of GNPs on the RIBE presents implications for secondary cancers or spatially fractionated radiotherapy treatments. Anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibodies were conjugated with PEGylated GNPs through EDC–NHS chemistry. The media transfer technique was performed to induce the RIBE on the non-irradiated bystander cells. This study focused on the LNCaP cell line, because it can model a wide range of stages relating to prostate cancer progression, including the transition from androgen dependence to castration resistance and bone metastasis. First, LNCaP cells were pretreated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or PSMA-targeted GNPs (PGNPs) for 24 h and irradiated with 160 kVp X-rays (0–8 Gy). Following that, the collected culture media were filtered (sterile 0.45 µm polyethersulfone) in order to acquire PBS- and PGNP- conditioned media (CM). Then, PBS- and PGNP-CM were transferred to the bystander cells that were loaded with/without PGNPs. MTT, γ-H2AX, clonogenic assays and reactive oxygen species assessments were performed to compare RIBE responses under different treatments. Compared with 2 Gy-PBS-CM, 8 Gy-PBS-CM demonstrated a much higher RIBE response, thus validating the dose dependence of RIBE in LNCaP cells. Compared with PBS-CM, PGNP-CM exhibited lower cell viability, higher DNA damage, and a smaller survival fraction. In the presence of PBS-CM, bystander cells loaded with PGNPs showed increased cell death compared with cells that did not have PGNPs. These results demonstrate the PGNP-boosted expression and sensitivity of RIBE in prostate cancer cells.</jats:p>"

Currently, fermented beverages are part of the culture of people living in the Colombian Andean Region, and they are a vital part of their cosmology and ancestral vision. Chicha, Forcha, Champús, and Masato are some of the most common Colombian Andes region’s traditional fermented beverages. These drinks come from the fermentation of maize (Zea maize), but other cereals such as wheat or rye, could be used. The fermentation is carried out by a set of bacteria and yeasts that provide characteristic organoleptic properties of each beverage. In this work, the information collected from the metagenomics analyses by sequencing ITS 1-4 (Internal Transcriber Spacer) and the 16S ribosomal gene for fungi and the V3-V4 region of the rDNA for bacteria allowed us to identify the diversity present in these autochthonous fermented beverages made with maize. The sequencing analysis showed the presence of 39 bacterial and 20 fungal genera. In addition, we determined that only nine genera of bacteria and two genera of fungi affect the organoleptic properties of smell, colour, and flavour, given the production of compounds such as lactic acid, alcohol, and phenols, highlighting the critical role of these microorganisms. Our findings provide new insights into the core microbiota of these beverages, represented by Lactobacillus fermentum, Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</jats:p>"

The improved illumination source and collimator enable fast spectrum acquisition and identification of the key interference peaks of the four rays. A fitting-based estimate of the interference peaks fully exploits a wealth of spectra acquired at different rotation angles and can help to retrieve the diameter of the cladding tubes with high resolution of 0.17 µm, which exceeds the diffraction limit of the probe light. We also report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the polarization and the transverse mode dependences in the side-scattering interference spectra, with which the glass wall thicknesses of the cladding tubes can be estimated on the basis of our four-ray interference model as well.</jats:p>",

MLF-CLs were produced in three different miltefosine doses by solvent-casting a thin miltefosine-polymer film around the periphery of a methafilcon hydrogel, which was then lathed into a contact lens. During seven days of in vitro testing, all three formulations demonstrated sustained release from the lens at theoretically therapeutic levels. Based on the physicochemical characterization of MLF-CLs, MLF-CL’s physical properties are not significantly different from commercial contact lenses in terms of light transmittance, water content and wettability. MLF-CLs possessed a slight reduction in compression modulus that was attributed to the inclusion of polymer-drug films but still remain within the optimal range of soft contact lenses. In cytotoxicity studies, MLF-CL indicated up to 91% viability, which decreased proportionally as miltefosine loading increased. A three-day biocompatibility test on New Zealand White rabbits revealed no impact of MLF-CLs on the corneal tissue. The MLF-CLs provided sustained in vitro release of miltefosine for a week while maintaining comparable physical features to a commercial contact lens. MLF-CL has a promising potential to be used as a successful treatment method for Acanthamoeba keratitis.</jats:p>"

Both patterns demonstrate the surface segregation of Al atoms during relaxation and subsequent quenching of the initial configurations containing 5000 atoms in 1:1 ratio (nanoparticle radius 3 nm). During cooling, the temperature of the nanoparticles decreased from 1000 K to 0,01 K with a low for atomistic simulation cooling rate. Experimentally binary Ni-Al nanoparticles with a radius of about 100 nm (76Ni:24Al at.%) were synthesized by the wire electric explosion. The experimental intensity distributions obtained from the data of energy-dispersive analysis under the action of an electron beam are presented and analyzed. These distributions correspond to a greater extent to the initial configurations in our molecular dynamics experiments, i.e., they are obviously nonequilibrium. At the same time, it was concluded that the final molecular dynamic configurations are also not entirely equilibrium.</jats:p>",

The expressions of the distributions of both electric field and magnetic field in the focal region of an objective were first derived from the vectorial Debye theory, and then numerical calculations were carried out to obtain the focused intensity distribution and the Poynting vector of CPRPB near the focus. Numerical calculations indicate that as CPRPB is focused on an objective of high numerical aperture (NA), two nonuniform self-focusing spots occur at both sides of the geometrical focus of the objective symmetrically, and the angle between their directions is 90 degrees. The stronger is the strength of cross-phase modulation, the flatter are the ellipses of the self-focusing spots, and the smaller is the intensity at the geometrical focus of the objective. Numerical calculations also demonstrate that the optical gradient force produced by tightly focused CPRPB in the focal region can be manipulated in magnitude and in direction by tuning the strength of cross-phase modulation. Due to these properties of tightly focused CPRPB, they might find applications in the manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles and so on.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to present the largest multicenter inventory of lymph nodes sampled either by CNB or surgical excision in patients with suspected lymphoma and to compare their diagnostic performance in routine pathologic practice. We reviewed 32 285 cases registered in the French Lymphopath network, which provides a systematic expert review of all lymphoma diagnoses in France, and evaluated the percentage of CNB and surgical excision cases accurately diagnosed according to the World Health Organization classification. Although CNB provided a definitive diagnosis in 92.3% and seemed to be a reliable method of investigation for most patients with suspected lymphoma, it remained less conclusive than surgical excision, which provided a definitive diagnosis in 98.1%. Discordance rates between referral and expert diagnoses were higher on CNB (23.1%) than on surgical excision (21.2%; P = .004), and referral pathologists provided more cases with unclassified lymphoma or equivocal lesion through CNB. In such cases, expert review improved the diagnostic workup by classifying ∼90% of cases, with higher efficacy on surgical excision (93.3%) than CNB (81.4%; P &amp;lt; 10−6). Moreover, diagnostic concordance for reactive lesions was higher on surgical excision than CNB (P = .009). Overall, although CNB accurately diagnoses lymphoma in most instances, it increases the risk of erroneous or nondefinitive conclusions. This large-scale survey also emphasizes the need for systematic expert review in cases of lymphoma suspicion, especially in those sampled by using CNB.</jats:p>",

This genetic resource from the primary center of sorghum diversity and domestication is important for broadening the genetic diversity of elite cultivars through breeding. However, due to the large size of the collection, we aimed to select a core set that captures the maximum genetic and phenotypic diversity, in order to facilitate detailed genetic and phenotypic evaluation at a reduced cost. To achieve this, we genotyped the entire collection in 2020 using Diversity Array Technology sequencing (DArTseq). A total of 27,560 SNPs were used to select a core collection of 310 accessions using the GenoCore software. A comparison of core set and the whole collection based on the polymorphism information content, observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity and minor allele frequency showed no significant difference between the two sets, indicating that the core collection adequately captures the genetic diversity and allelic richness present in the whole collection. The core collection captures all the five major sorghum races and the 10 intermediate hybrids. The most strongly represented race is guinea (24.5%), while caudatum-bicolor is least frequent (0.69%). Landraces account for 92.2% of the core collection, whereas breeder’s lines, weedy accessions and released varieties contribute 2.2%, 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively.</jats:p>",

It increases processing capabilities and quality of service of cloud-based neural processing units (NPUs) by improving their hardware utilization and by reducing design latency, with two innovations. First, a custom coarse-grained multi-threaded RNN/Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hardware architecture, switching tasks among threads when RNN computational engines meet data hazards. Second, the partitioning of this hardware architecture into multiple full-fledged sub-accelerator cores, enabling spatially co-execution of multiple RNN/LSTM inferences. These innovations improve the exploitation of the available parallelism to increase runtime hardware utilization and boost design throughput. Evaluation results show that a dual-threaded quad-core Remarn NPU achieves 2.91 times higher performance while only occupying 5.0% more area than a single-threaded one on a Stratix 10 FPGA. When compared with a Tesla V100 GPU implementation, our design achieves 6.5 times better performance and 15.6 times higher power efficiency, showing that our approach contributes to high performance and energy-efficient FPGA-based multi-RNN inference designs for datacenters.</jats:p>",

Drosophila photoreceptors are an excellent model system to study the mechanisms of polarized transport. Rab11 is the key factor regulating the post-Golgi transport of rhodopsin 1 (Rh1; also known as NinaE), a photoreceptive protein, to the rhabdomere, a photoreceptive plasma membrane. Here, we found that neuronal Synaptobrevin (nSyb) colocalizes with Rab11 on the trans-side of Golgi stacks and post-Golgi vesicles at the rhabdomere base, and nSyb deficiency impairs rhabdomeric transport and induces accumulation of Rh1 and vesicles in the cytoplasm; this is similar to the effects of Rab11 loss. These results indicate that nSyb acts as a post-Golgi SNARE toward rhabdomeres. Surprisingly, in Rab11-, Rip11- and nSyb-deficient photoreceptors, illumination enhances cytoplasmic accumulation of Rh1, which colocalizes with Rab11, Rabenosyn5, nSyb and Arrestin 1 (Arr1). Arr1 loss, but not Rab5 dominant negative (Rab5DN) protein expression, inhibits the light-enhanced cytoplasmic Rh1 accumulation. Rab5DN inhibits the generation of Rh1-containing multivesicular bodies rather than Rh1 internalization. Overall, these results indicate that exocytic Rh1 mingles with endocytosed Rh1 and is then transported together to rhabdomeres.</jats:p>",

We showed that the microhabitat rather than the geographic location and rice variety was the primary driver of the rice microbiome assemblage. The diversity and network complexity of the rice-associated microbiome decreased steadily from far to near the roots, rice exterior to interior, and from belowground to aboveground niches. Remarkably, the microbiomes of the roots, stems, and seeds of the rice interior compartments were not greatly influenced by the external environment. The core bacterial endophytes of rice were primarily comprised of 14 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), 10 of which, especially ASV_2 (<jats:italic>Pantoea</jats:italic>) and ASV_48 (<jats:italic>Xanthomonas</jats:italic>), were identified as potentially vertically transmitted taxa because they existed across generations, were rarely present in exterior rice microhabitats, and were frequently isolated from rice seeds. The genome sequences of <jats:italic>Pantoea</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Xanthomonas</jats:italic> isolated from the parental and offspring seeds showed a high degree of average nucleotide and core protein identity, indicating vertical transmission of seed endophytes across generations. In silico prediction indicated that the seed endophytes <jats:italic>Pantoea</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Xanthomonas</jats:italic> possessed streamlined genomes with short lengths, low-complexity metabolism, and various plant growth-promoting traits. We also found that all strains of <jats:italic>Pantoea</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Xanthomonas</jats:italic> exhibited cellulase activity and produced indole-3-acetic acid.

Our results provide insights on vertically transmitted microbiota and suggest new avenues for improving plant fitness via the manipulation of seed-associated microbiomes. </jats:p>\n                \n              </jats:sec>"

This paper presents an AutoML (automated machine learning) approach to automated machine learning model configuration identification for data composed of two modalities: texts and images. The approach is based on the idea of representation evolution, the process of automatically amplifying heterogeneous representations across several modalities, optimized jointly with a collection of fast, well-regularized linear models. The proposed approach is benchmarked against 11 unimodal and multimodal (texts and images) approaches on four real-life benchmark datasets from different domains. It achieves competitive performance with minimal human effort and low computing requirements, enabling learning from multiple modalities in automated manner for a wider community of researchers.</jats:p>"

Although IEG expression is mainly regulated at the level of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase-II (Pol-II) promoter-proximal pausing and its release, the role of ERK in this process remains unknown. Here, we identified negative elongation factor (NELF)-A as an ERK substrate. Upon growth factor stimulation, ERK phosphorylates NELF-A, which dissociates NELF from paused Pol-II at the promoter-proximal regions of IEGs, allowing Pol-II to resume elongation and produce full-length transcripts. Furthermore, we found that in cancer cells, PP2A efficiently dephosphorylates NELF-A, thereby preventing aberrant IEG expression induced by ERK-activating oncogenes. However, when PP2A inhibitor proteins are overexpressed, as is frequently observed in cancers, decreased PP2A activity combined with oncogene-mediated ERK activation conspire to induce NELF-A phosphorylation and IEG upregulation, resulting in tumor progression. Our data delineate previously unexplored roles of ERK and PP2A inhibitor proteins in carcinogenesis.</jats:p>"

Three-dimensional (3D) graphene was grown by the thermal CVD method on the nickel foam and subsequently coated with thin films of anatase employing the sol–gel method. Thereafter, it was gratifyingly demonstrated that the hybrid nanomaterial, TiO2/3D-GF-Ni, was able to bring about more than 90% decolorization of methyl orange dye after 30 min under simulated sunlight irradiance. Moreover, the efficiency of the methyl orange decolorization was 99.5% after three successive cycles.

The zwitterionic polymer had excellent adsorption and hydration groups, which could effectively combine with bentonite through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic attraction, strengthening the hydration film thickness on the surface of bentonite, and promoting the stable dispersion of drilling fluid. In addition, the reverse polyelectrolyte effect of zwitterionic polymers strengthened the drilling fluid’s ability to resist high-temperature and high-salt. The AADN-based drilling fluid showed excellent rheological and filtration control properties (FLAPI &lt; 8 mL, FLHTHP &lt; 29.6 mL) even after aging at high-temperature (200 °C) and high-salt (20 wt% NaCl) conditions.

Herein, a simple and general synthesis strategy is proposed for the construction of a multienzyme biocatalyst by compartmentalizing glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase (GOx and HRP) within core–shell zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIF)‐8@ZIF‐8 nanostructures. Owing to the combined effects of biomimetic mineralization and the fine regulation of the ZIF‐8 growth process, the uniform shell encloses the seed (core) surface by epitaxial growth, and the bienzyme system is accurately localized in a controlled manner. The versatility of this strategy is also reflected in ZIF‐67. Meanwhile, with the ability to covalently bind divalent metal ions, lithocholic acid (LCA) is used as a competitive ligand to improve the pore structure of the ZIF from a single micropore to a hierarchical micro/mesopore network, which greatly increases mass transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the multienzyme cascade reaction is exemplified by the oxidation of <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>‐phenylenediamine (OPD). The findings show that the bienzyme assembly strategy significantly affects the biocatalytic efficiency mainly by influencing the utilization efficiency of the intermediate (Hydrogen peroxide, H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) between the step reactions.

TGNC-DOX showed potent photothermal response and reversible photothermal stability following irradiation with 808 nm NIR laser irradiation. Further, TGNC-DOX showed laser-responsive and pH-dependent drug release behavior suggesting its suitability for chemo-photothermal therapy, specifically at the tumor microenvironment site. Cellular viability, cellular uptake, ROS generation, and apoptosis assays suggested selective localization of TGNC-DOX in cancer cells that showed a significant cytotoxic effect against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Moreover, the developed TGNC-DOX showed ferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The event of TGNC-DOX-mediated thermal ablation is marked by a significant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis, as affirmed by flow cytometry. NIR-808 laser-responsive photothermal therapy of cancer cells was found to be more effective than without NIR-808 laser-treated cells, suggesting the fundamental role of photothermal ablation.

The middle layer is a honeycomb manufactured using FDM additive technologies. The mechanical properties of the honeycomb were assessed by a homogenization procedure. The outer layers of the shell are thin, and they are made of carbon-filled plastic. The model is based on a higher-order shear theory and accounts for the orthotropy of the mechanical properties of all the shell layers. Each layer of the shell is described by five variables (three displacement projections and two rotation angles of the normal to the middle surface). The properties of linear vibrations were studied using discretization by the Rayleigh?Ritz method. Because the middle layer of the shell is far lighter and more compliant in comparison with the outer layers, the computational process has some features. The eigenferquencies and eigenmodes of the shell were found for a further analysis of nonlinear vibrations. The mathematical model of forced vibrations of the shell under geometrically nonlinear deformation is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations derived by the assumed-mode method. Nonlinear periodic vibrations and their bifurcations were studied using a numerical procedure, which is a combination of the continuation method and the shooting technique. The properties of the nonlinear periodic vibrations and their bifurcations in the regions of fundamental and subharmonic resonances were studied numerically. A spherical panel and a hyperbolic paraboloid panel were considered. It was shown that when a disturbing force is applied at a point out of the panel’s center of gravity, the panel’s eigenmodes interact, and the frequency response and the bifurcation diagram change qualitatively in comparison with the case where that force is applied at the panel’s center of gravity. An agreement between the results was studied as a function of the number of terms in the Rayleigh-Ritz and assumed-mode expansions.</jats:p>",

In the frequency region of 1.0–1.5 THz, the designed NC-RCF can stably transmit 82 OAM modes.

The algorithm is processed in the following steps. Firstly, the initial image processing area is set according to the floating field of the camera’s light stripe, followed by setting the adaptive image processing area according to the actual position of the light stripe. Secondly, the center of light stripe is obtained by using the method of combining the upper contour with the barycenter of the bidirectional gray-scale. The obtained center of the light stripe is optimized by reducing the deviation from adjacent center points. Finally, the slope and intercept are used to complete the breakpoint. The experimental results show that the algorithm has the advantages of high speed and precision and has specific adaptability to the laser stripes of the complex environment. Compared with other conventional algorithms, it greatly improves and can be used in industrial detection.</jats:p>"

However, transdermal active compound delivery by topical liquid formulation application is inhibited by skin barriers, and the skincare efficacy of DMNs is restricted by the low encapsulation capacity and incomplete insertion. In this study, topical serum application via a dissolvable micro-channeling system (DMCS) was used to enhance serum delivery through micro-channels embedded with DMNs. Transdermal serum delivery was evaluated after the topical-serum-only application and combinatorial serum application by assessing the intensity of allophycocyanin (APC) loaded with the serum in the porcine skin. APC intensity was significantly higher in the skin layer at a depth of 120–270 μm upon combinatorial serum application as compared to topical-serum-only application. In addition, the combinatorial serum application showed significantly improved efficacy in the clinical assessment of skin hydration, depigmentation, improvement of wrinkles, elasticity, dermal density, skin pores, and skin soothing without any safety issues compared to the serum-only application. The results indicate that combinatorial serum application with DMCS is a promising candidate for improving skincare treatments with optimal transdermal delivery of active compounds.</jats:p>"

Current client-server applications usually use multiresolution out-of-core proposals; nevertheless, the construction of the data structures required is very time-consuming. Furthermore, these multiresolution approaches present problems regarding point density changes between different levels of detail and artifacts due to the rendering of elements entering and leaving the field of view. We present an autotuning multiresolution out-of-core strategy to avoid these problems. Other objectives are reducing loading times while maintaining low memory requirements, high visualization quality and achieving interactive visualization of massive point clouds. This strategy identifies certain parameters, called performance parameters, and defines a set of premises to obtain the goals mentioned above. The optimal parameter values depend on the number of points per cell in the multiresolution structure. We test our proposal in our web-based visualization software designed to work with the structures and storage format used and display massive point clouds achieving interactive visualization of point clouds with more than 27 billion points.</jats:p>",

The retina is abundant with circulating low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which are taken up by LDL receptor (LDLR) in the RPE and Müller cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of LDLR in the NaIO3-induced model of dry AMD. Confluent primary human RPE (hRPE) and LDLR-silenced ARPE-19 cells were stressed with 150 µM tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH) and caspase 3/7 activation was determined. WT and Ldlr−/− mice were administered NaIO3 (20 mg/kg) intravenously. On day 7, fundus imaging, OCT, ERG, and retinal thickness were measured. Histology, TUNEL, cleaved caspase 3 and lipid accumulation were assessed. Treatment of hRPE with tBH markedly decreased LDLR expression. Caspase 3/7 activation was significantly increased in LDLR-silenced ARPE-19 cells treated with tBH. In Ldlr−/− mice, NaIO3 administration resulted in significant (a) retinal thinning, (b) compromised photoreceptor function, (c) increased percentage of cleaved caspase 3 positive and apoptotic cells, and (d) increased lipid droplet accumulation in the RPE, Bruch membrane, choroid, and sclera, compared to WT mice. Our findings imply that LDLR loss leads to lipid accumulation and impaired retinal function, which may contribute to the development of AMD.</jats:p>"

We deduced the spin mixing conductance from the Pt thickness dependence of the SMR to find the high interface quality of the optimized Pt/YIG grown on Si in terms of spin current. We also clarified that the SMR correlates well with the magnetization, the interface roughness, and carrier density.

For this reason, we designed and validated a Condensed Protocol for the neuropathologic diagnoses of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, Lewy Body disease neuropathologic change, as well as chronic microvascular lesions, hippocampal sclerosis of aging, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In this study, the Condensed Protocol is updated to include frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD] tau (corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Pick disease), FTLD-TDP, and limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. The same 20 brain regions are sampled and processed in 5 tissue cassettes, which reduces reagent costs by approximately 65%. Three board-certified neuropathologists were blinded to the original Northwestern University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Original Protocol neuropathological diagnoses and all clinical history information. The results yielded near uniform agreement with the original comprehensive Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center neuropathologic assessments. Diagnostic sensitivity was not impacted. In summary, our recent results show that our updated Condensed Protocol is also an accurate and less expensive alternative to the comprehensive protocols for the additional neuropathologic diagnoses of FTLD Tau and TDP43 proteinopathies.</jats:p>",

The experiments demonstrate that the air pressure sensitivity of the single hole sensor was −3.548 nm/MPa, with a linearity of 99.45%, while its response times for air pressure’s rise and fall were 4.25 s and 2.52 s, respectively. The air pressure sensitivity of the ten-hole sensor was up to −3.786 nm/MPa, with a linearity of 99.47%, while its response times for air pressure’s rise and fall were 2.17 s and 1.30 s, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the pressure sensitivity of the sensor with an anti-resonant reflecting guidance mechanism mainly comes from the refractive index change of the air inside the hollow core fiber. The proposed device with multi-holes drilled by a femtosecond laser has the advantages of fabrication simplicity, low cost, fast response time, good structural robustness, high repeatability, high sensitivity to air pressure, and insensitivity to temperature (only 10.3 pm/°C), which makes it attractive for high pressure sensing applications in harsh environments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Deer antlers constitute a unique mammalian model for the study of both organ formation in postnatal life and annual full regeneration. Previous studies revealed that these events are achieved through the proliferation and differentiation of antlerogenic periosteum (AP) cells and pedicle periosteum (PP) cells, respectively. As the cells resident in the AP and the PP possess stem cell attributes, both antler generation and regeneration are stem cell-based processes. However, the cell composition of each tissue type and molecular events underlying antler development remain poorly characterized. Here, we took the approach of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and identified eight cell types (mainly <jats:italic>THY1</jats:italic><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> cells, progenitor cells, and osteochondroblasts) and three core subclusters of the <jats:italic>THY1</jats:italic><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> cells (SC2, SC3, and SC4). Endothelial and mural cells each are heterogeneous at transcriptional level. It was the proliferation of progenitor, mural, and endothelial cells in the activated antler-lineage-specific tissues that drove the rapid formation of the antler. We detected the differences in the initial differentiation process between antler generation and regeneration using pseudotime trajectory analysis. These may be due to the difference in the degree of stemness of the AP-THY1<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and PP-THY1<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> cells. We further found that androgen-RXFP2 axis may be involved in triggering initial antler full regeneration. Fully deciphering the cell composition for these antler tissue types will open up new avenues for elucidating the mechanism underlying antler full renewal in specific and regenerative medicine in general.</jats:p>"

This scheme is beneficial to solving the problem of the large driving power of silica-based thermo-optic switches at this stage. Compared with the switching power of all-silica devices, the power consumption can be reduced from 116.11 mW (TE) and 114.86 mW (TM) to 5.49 mW (TE) and 5.96 mW (TM), which is close to the driving power of the reported switches adopting polymer material as the core.

Carbon fiber and graphene composites have great potential as EMI shielding materials due to their unique microstructure and electrical conductivity. In this work, a novel kind of core-shell composite is fabricated based on the pore-rich pine needles-derived carbon fibers (coded as PNCFs) core and the graphene shell. The pore-rich PNCFs are created by KOH activation, and the integration between the pore-rich PNCFs and the graphene relies on a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The conductivity of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene core-shell composite reaches 4.97 S cm−1, and the composite has an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (SE &gt; 70 dB over X-band (8.2–12.4 GHz)) and achieves a maximum value of ~77 dB at 10.4 GHz, which is higher than many biobased EMI shielding materials in the recent literature. By calculation and comparison, the large absorption loss (accounting for 90.8% of total loss) contributes to reducing secondary radiation, which is quite beneficial for stealth uses. Thus, this work demonstrates a promising design method for the preparation of green high-performance composites for EMI shielding and stealth applications (such as warcrafts, missiles, and stealth wears).</jats:p>"

Experimental data are compared to theoretical calculations performed at the coupled cluster, restricted active space perturbation theory to second-order and time-dependent density functional levels of theory. We demonstrate (1) that both N and O K-edge XA spectra are sensitive to the amount of dynamical electron correlation included in the theoretical description and (2) that for a complete description of XP spectra, additional orbital correlation and orbital relaxation effects need to be considered. The normal AE spectra are dominated by a singlet excitation channel and well described by theory. The resonant AE spectra, however, are more complicated. While the participator decay channels, dominating at higher kinetic energies, are well described by coupled cluster theory, spectator channels can only be described satisfactorily using a method that combines restricted active space perturbation theory to second order for the bound part and a one-center approximation for the continuum.</jats:p>",

The impact resistance of the corrugated sandwich structure was studied by analysing the residual velocity of the projectile, the impact force of the target plate, and the failure mode. The impact resistance of the corrugated sandwich structure was analysed when four types of composite materials were used as the front and back panels of the corrugated sandwich structure. The results showed that, compared with the metal aluminium panel, the impact resistance of the structure was high when ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres were used as the positive panel. When the composites were used as the back panel, although the residual velocity was lower than metal aluminium, the impact force was higher than metal aluminium, with more serious damage form of the target plate. Thus, the impact resistance of composite front panel/metal aluminium core/metal aluminium back panel sandwich structure was better than the all-metal aluminium corrugated sandwich structures. The results of this paper can provide a reference for the design of novel lightweight multifunctional structures. </jats:p>",

However, the identity of the cell surface receptor that detects HAPLN1 and thereby engenders pro-tumorigenic signaling in MM cells remains unknown. Here, we performed an unbiased cell surface biotinylation assay and identified chaperonin 60 (CH60) as the direct binding partner of HAPLN1 on MM cells. Cell surface CH60 specifically interacted with TLR4 to evoke HAPLN1-induced NF-κB signaling, transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, and drug resistance in MM cells. Collectively, our findings identify a cell surface CH60-TLR4 complex as a HAPLN1 receptor and a potential molecular target to overcome drug resistance in MM cells.</jats:p>",

However, a putative mechanism has not been determined. LC-MS/MS revealed that CYP2B6 metabolizes PUFAs, with a preference for metabolism of ALA to 9-HOTrE and to a lesser extent 13-HOTrE with a preference for metabolism of PUFAs at the 9- and 13-positions. To further study the role of CYP2B6 <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, humanized-CYP2B6-transgenic (hCYP2B6-Tg) and Cyp2b-null mice were fed a 60% high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Compared to Cyp2b-null mice, hCYP2B6-Tg mice showed reduced weight gain and metabolic disease as measured by glucose tolerance tests, however hCYP2B6-Tg male mice showed increased liver triglycerides. Serum and liver oxylipin metabolite concentrations increased in male hCYP2B6-Tg mice, while only serum oxylipins increased in female hCYP2B6-Tg mice with the greatest increases in LA oxylipins metabolized at the 9 and 13-positions. Several of these oxylipins, specifically 9-HODE, 9-HOTrE, and 13-oxoODE, are PPAR agonists. RNA-seq data also demonstrated sexually dimorphic changes in gene expression related to nuclear receptor signaling, especially CAR &gt; PPAR with qPCR suggesting PPARγ signaling is more likely than PPARα signaling in male mice. Overall, our data indicates that CYP2B6 is an anti-obesity enzyme, but probably to a lesser extent than murine Cyp2b’s. Therefore, the inhibition of CYP2B6 by xenobiotics or dietary fats can exacerbate obesity and metabolic disease potentially through disrupted PUFA metabolism and the production of key lipid metabolites.</jats:p>"

This photoacoustic patch integrates an array of ultrasonic transducers and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diodes on a common soft substrate. The high-power VCSEL diodes can generate laser pulses that penetrate &gt;2 cm into biological tissues and activate hemoglobin molecules to generate acoustic waves, which can be collected by the transducers for 3D imaging of the hemoglobin with a high spatial resolution. Additionally, the photoacoustic signal amplitude and temperature have a linear relationship, which allows 3D mapping of core temperatures with high accuracy and fast response. With access to biomolecules in deep tissues, this technology adds unprecedented capabilities to wearable electronics and thus holds significant implications for various applications in both basic research and clinical practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hexagon-shape graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) limited by zigzag edges only (with doubly and triply coordinated atoms) have unique increased reactivity. Despite the high systems symmetry (D6h) the Carbon atoms in GNFs occupy non-equivalent positions. Can such physical and chemical characteristics of GNFs, which depend of the atom position in the cluster, definition? This characteristic together with the simplicity of its calculation makes it possible to predict the properties of nanoflakes obtained from GNFs by introducing single and multiatomic vacancies into them or by replacing Carbon atoms with electron withdrawing and electron donating atoms. This characteristic includes the C1s core-level binding energy shifts, the maxima of which characterize the C atoms of a certain type.  The proposed work is devoted to quantum chemical calculations of the electronic density of states (DOS) of pristine hexagon-shape GNF C96 (multiplicity, M=5), their saturated counterpart –polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(PAH) C96H24 (M=1) and their derivatives with one and two single vacancies in the ground electronic state (GES). All calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) method with the involvement of the valence-split basis set 6-31G (d,p). Systems with open shells were considered using the UB3LYP exchange-correlation functional. The obtained spectra were fitted using Gaussian curve fitting program to determine the binding energy for each peak.  The Gaussian function distribution of the theoretically calculated C1s core-level binding energy shifts of GNFs testified the presence of six peaks, each of which refers to a certain type of Carbon atoms. The C1s peak with the highest binding energy (-285.57 eV) is caused by contributions from the doubly coordinated edge cyclic chain (ECC) Carbon atoms. The C1s orbitals of the central hexagon (CHex) atoms and the first cyclic chain (FCC) atoms form delocalized molecular orbitals (MOs) in different parts of the cluster.  The analogous spectrum of PAH C96H24 is slightly shifted to the region of lower binding energies  and  contains  only  two well-defined  peaks.  The peak  with  a higher binding energy (-284.36 eV) is generated by the 1s states of the CHex atoms and the atoms of the FCC, which are bounded to the CHex atoms.  The electronic DOS difference in C1s core-level spectra of GNF C96 (M=5) and their saturated counterpart PAH C96H24 is established due to the presence of two weakly bounded π-systems in GNF and common conjugated system in PAH.  The electronic DOS of defect-containing cluster C96-1(1) (M=3) (one CHex atom has been removed from the C96nanoflake) is generated by the C1s core-level atoms of the second cyclic chain (SCC), which are located at the different distances from the center of the nanoflake. The peak of the lowest intensity (-284.63 eV) appears in the spectrum as a reflection of the appearance  of  doubly  coordinated  Carbon  atoms  surrounding  the  single  vacancy in the C96-1(1) nanoflake.  The analysis of the electronic DOS of the C1s core-level spectrum of the C96-2(1) nanoflakeis shown, that doubly coordinated Carbon atoms, concentrated around two single vacancies, are essentially non-equivalent. If the MO with the lowest binding energy is localized on two of them – the MO with the highest binding energy is localized on the third atoms (one around each single vacancy).  The electronic C1s core-level DOS spectrum of defect-containing molecular systems with one C96-1(1)H24 and two C96‑2(1)H24 single vacancies are similar to the analogous spectrum of PAH C96H24. In the first of them – one additional maximum appears due to C1s atoms surrounding the single vacancy. In the second – there are two additional maxima, each of which is generated by C1s core-level atoms adjacent to individual vacancies.</jats:p>",

The work describes the most relevant interactive methods for enhancing the cognitive activity of university students from the perspective of contextual learning; uses the experience of their practical application in mathematics classes as an example. The research is novel in that it develops and clarifies scientific ideas about modern interactive methods used in the setting of contextual learning when teaching non-core disciplines to university students and substantiates the possibility of their effective application in the educational process to enhance students’ cognitive activity. As a result, modern interactive methods used in contextual learning at the university have been identified and analysed; the most relevant ones for the use in the process of studying non-core disciplines in order to enhance the cognitive activity of students have been determined. The selected interactive teaching methods were tested in contextual classes in mathematics with the students of an agricultural university in various training programmes. The contextual nature of the classes was due to the presence of problem-based socio-contextual situations, which were resolved by using interactive teaching methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Efforts to eliminate malaria transmission need evidence-based strategies. However, accurately assessing end-game malaria elimination strategies is challenging due to the low level of transmission and the rarity of infections. We hypothesised that presumptively treating individuals during reactive case detection (RCD) would reduce transmission and that serology would more sensitively detect this change over standard approaches. We conducted a cluster randomised control trial (NCT02654912) of presumptive reactive focal drug administration (RFDA–intervention) compared to the standard of care, reactive focal test and treat (RFTAT—control) in Southern Province, Zambia—an area of low seasonal transmission (overall incidence of ~3 per 1,000). We measured routine malaria incidence from health facilities as well as PCR parasite prevalence / antimalarial seroprevalence in an endline cross-sectional population survey. No significant difference was identified from routine incidence data and endline prevalence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had insufficient numbers of malaria infections (i.e., 16 infections among 6,276 children) to assess the intervention. Comparing long-term serological markers, we found a 19% (95% CI = 4–32%) reduction in seropositivity for the RFDA intervention using a difference in differences approach incorporating serological positivity and age. We also found a 37% (95% CI = 2–59%) reduction in seropositivity to short-term serological markers in a post-only comparison. These serological analyses provide compelling evidence that RFDA both has an impact on malaria transmission and is an appropriate end-game malaria elimination strategy. Furthermore, serology provides a more sensitive approach to measure changes in transmission that other approaches miss, particularly in very low transmission settings.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:bold>Trial Registration:</jats:bold> Registered at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/\" xlink:type=\"simple\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</jats:ext-link> (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02654912\" xlink:type=\"simple\">NCT02654912</jats:ext-link>, 13/1/2016).</jats:p>"

Human defensin (HD) 5 is an innate immune peptide with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, but its complicated structure makes its preparation difficult. Herein, we truncated the HD5 structure by extracting the highly conserved γ-core motif. A structure-activity study showed that this motif was ineffective in killing bacteria in the absence of specific spatial conformation. Notably, after the introduction of two intramolecular disulfide bonds, its antibacterial activity was markedly improved. Glu and Ser residues were then replaced with Arg to create the derivative RC18, which exhibited stronger potency than HD5, particularly against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Mechanistically, RC18 bound to lipid A and lipoteichoic acid at higher affinities than HD5. Furthermore, RC18 was more efficient than HD5 in penetrating the bacterial membranes. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that five Arg residues, Arg1, Arg7, Arg9, Arg15, and Arg18, mediated most of the polar interactions of RC18 with the phospholipid head groups during membrane penetration. In vivo experiments indicated that RC18 decreased MRSA colonization and dramatically improved the survival of infected mice, thus demonstrating that RC18 is a promising drug candidate to treat MRSA infections.</jats:p>"

Applying green polishing techniques to obtain an ultrasmooth sapphire surface that is scratch-free and has low damage at high polishing efficiency is a great challenge. In this paper, novel diamond/SiO2 composite abrasives were successfully synthesized by a simplified sol-gel strategy. The prepared composite abrasives were used in the semi-fixed polishing technology of sapphire wafers, where the polishing slurry contains only deionized water and no other chemicals during the whole polishing process, effectively avoiding environmental pollution. The experimental results showed that diamond/SiO2 composite abrasives exhibited excellent polishing performance, along with a 27.2% decrease in surface roughness, and the material removal rate was increased by more than 8.8% compared with pure diamond. Furthermore, through characterizations of polished sapphire surfaces and wear debris, the chemical action mechanism of composite abrasives was investigated, which confirmed the solid-state reaction between the SiO2 shell and the sapphire surface. Finally, applying the elastic-plastic contact model revealed that the reduction of indentation depth and the synergistic effect of chemical corrosion and mechanical removal are the keys to improving polishing performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper details a benchmarking and validation workflow using digital rock physics (DRP) to evaluate the effectiveness of various percussion sidewall core (PSWC) acquisition methods. The workflow consists of obtaining digital rock properties and images of reference material to compare with material obtained from laboratory percussion sidewall acquisition, including novel designs. This workflow allows insight into the acquisition processes and potential sources of damage in the PSWC technique, and potentially other rock sampling techniques, and offers an opportunity to evaluate its appropriateness as a subsurface rock sample acquisition method.  Sample cubes from six outcrop sandstone formations of known properties were used in the testing program to cover a wide range of particularly low and medium unconfined compressive strengths (UCS). Multiple control rotary plug samples were cut from each sandstone formation. The sample cubes were then used as the parent material in laboratory testing of various designs of PSWC bullets. The PSWC bullets, including novel designs, were shot in simulated downhole environments. Both control rotary plug samples and PSWC test core samples were imaged with high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) at resolutions between 2 and 11 μm, and digital rock analysis was conducted on all samples. Using pre- and post-test images, the damage could be identified, and petrophysical properties, including porosity and permeability, could be determined and directly compared with DRP results from control samples and available routine core analysis (RCA) results.  DRP provides unique insight to evaluate and quantify changes (or lack of changes) to the sample material subjected to the PSWC acquisition. Damage encountered in the test samples includes grain crushing and compaction that degrades storage and transport properties and dilatant zones that locally enhance transport properties. The presence, frequency, and distribution of these zones are dependent on experimental parameters. In all cases, undisturbed rock fabric could be identified in each sample, and intact texture was verified by comparison with reference material.   A novel and efficient method for acquiring and evaluating subsurface samples was developed and benchmarked. Lab results indicate this method may be equally applicable to low- and mid-range UCS rocks. This approach enables a cost-effective reservoir characterization strategy. By optimizing PSWC bullet design and coupling this with mature, image-based digital rock technology, this work demonstrated that the samples and results obtained by this method are representative and that the controls on storage and transport properties are well understood.</jats:p>",

Data on the accuracy of HER2-Low status between core needle biopsy (CNB) and surgical excision specimen (SES) samples are lacking. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of HER2-Low status diagnosis between CNB and SES samples. Methods: Consecutive early-stage breast cancer patients who underwent surgery from January 2009 to March 2022 with paired CNB and SES samples were retrospectively reviewed. HER2-Low was defined as IHC 1+ or IHC2+ and FISH-negative. Concordance rates were analyzed by the Kappa test. Further clinicopathological characteristics were compared among different HER2 status and their changes. Results: A total of 5610 patients were included, of whom 3209 (57.2%) and 3320 (59.2%) had HER2-Low status in CNB and SES samples, respectively. The concordance rate of HER2 status in the whole population was 82.37% (Kappa = 0.684, p &lt; 0.001), and was 76.87% in the HER2-Negative patients (Kappa = 0.372, p &lt; 0.001). Among 1066 HER2-0 cases by CNB, 530 patients were classified as HER2-Low tumors. On the contrary, in 3209 patients with HER2-Low tumor by CNB, 387 were scored as HER2-0 on the SES samples. ER-negative or Ki67 high expression tumor by CNB had a high concordance rate of HER2-Low status. Conclusions: A relatively low concordance rate was found when evaluating HER2-Low status between CNB and SES samples in HER2-Negative breast cancer patients, indicating the necessity of retesting HER2 low status at surgery, which may guide further therapy in the era of anti-HER2 ADCs.</jats:p>"

As the only enzyme for the de novo synthesis of ribonucleotides, RRM2 is closely related to the development of tumorigenesis. However, not much is currently known about the functional roles of RRM2 in breast cancer (BRCA), and whether BBR regulates the migration and invasion of BRCA cells by regulating the expression of RRM2 remains to be determined. We study the effects of BBR on BRCA cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo by using colony formation assays, EdU assays, and xenograft models. Transcriptome sequencing, the random forest algorithm, and KEGG analysis were utilized to explore the therapeutic target genes and relative pathways. The expression of RRM2 in BRCA patients was analyzed with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, the GEPIA website tool, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the UALCAN database. The survival probability of BRCA patients could be predicted by survival curve and nomogram analysis. Molecular docking was used to explore the affinity between BBR and potential targets. Gain- and loss-of-function methods were employed to explore the biological process in RRM2 participants. We comprehensively investigated the pharmacological characteristics of BBR on BRCA cell lines and discovered that BBR could inhibit the proliferation of BRCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Combining transcriptome sequencing and KEGG analysis, we found that BBR mainly affected the biological behavior of BRCA cells via HIF-1α and AMPK signal pathways. Additionally, by using bioinformatics and molecular docking, we demonstrated that RRM2 plays an oncogenic role in BRCA samples and that it acts as the hub gene of BBR on BRCA cells. Knockdown and overexpression studies indicated that RRM2 promoted BRCA cell migration as well as invasion in vitro by affecting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our study demonstrated the significance of BBR regulating HIF-1α and AMPK signaling pathways in BRCA cells. Moreover, we revealed the carcinogenic role and potential mechanism of RRM2 as a core regulatory factor of BBR in BRCA in controlling BRCA invasion, migration, and EMT, suggesting that RRM2 may be a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for BRCA therapy.</jats:p>"

The challenge is to accurately monitor the development of high-risk carotid plaques and promptly identify patients, who are unresponsive to best medical therapy, and hence targeted for carotid surgical interventions to prevent stroke. Inflammation is a key operator in destabilisation of plaques prior to clinical sequelae. Currently, there is a lack of imaging tool in routine clinical practice, which allows assessment of inflammatory activity within the atherosclerotic plaque. Herein, we have used a periarterial cuff to generate a progressive carotid atherosclerosis model in apolipoprotein E–deficient mice. This model produced clinically relevant plaques with different levels of risk, fulfilling American Heart Association (AHA) classification, at specific timepoints and locations, along the same carotid artery. Exploiting this platform, we have developed smart molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes consisting of dual-targeted microparticles of iron oxide (DT-MPIO) against VCAM-1 and P-selectin, to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of statin therapy on progressive carotid atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that in vivo DT-MPIO-enhanced MRI can (i) quantitatively track plaque inflammation from early to advanced stage; (ii) identify and characterise high-risk inflamed, vulnerable plaques; and (iii) monitor the response to statin therapy longitudinally. Moreover, this molecular imaging–defined therapeutic response was validated using AHA classification of human plaques, a clinically relevant parameter, approximating the clinical translation of this tool. Further development and translation of this molecular imaging tool into the clinical arena may potentially facilitate more accurate risk stratification, permitting timely identification of the high-risk patients for prophylactic carotid intervention, affording early opportunities for stroke prevention in the future.\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Nitrate in Antarctic snow has seasonal cycles in nitrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios that reflect its sources and atmospheric formation processes,\nand as a result, nitrate archived in Antarctic ice should have great potential to record atmospheric chemistry changes over thousands of\nyears. However, sunlight that strikes the snow surface results in photolytic nitrate loss and isotopic fractionation that can completely obscure the\nnitrate's original isotopic values. To gain insight into how photolysis overwrites the seasonal atmospheric cycles, we collected 244 snow samples\nalong an 850 km transect of East Antarctica during the 2013–2014 CHICTABA traverse. The CHICTABA route's limited elevation change, consistent\ndistance between the coast and the high interior plateau, and intermediate accumulation rates offered a gentle environmental gradient ideal for\nstudying the competing pre- and post-depositional influences on archived nitrate isotopes. We find that nitrate isotopes in snow along the transect\nare indeed notably modified by photolysis after deposition, and drier sites have more intense photolytic impacts. Still, an imprint of the original\nseasonal cycles of atmospheric nitrate isotopes is present in the top 1–2 m of the snowpack and likely preserved through archiving in\nglacial ice at these sites. Despite this preservation, reconstructing past atmospheric values from archived nitrate in similar transitional regions\nwill remain a difficult challenge without having an independent proxy for photolytic loss to correct for post-depositional isotopic\nchanges. Nevertheless, nitrate isotopes should function as a proxy for snow accumulation rate in such regions if multiple years of deposition are\naggregated to remove the seasonal cycles, and this application can prove highly valuable in its own right.\n                    </jats:p>"

The higher prevalence of trans-PCGs indicates the dominated effects of trans-regulation in driving expression differences and shaping adaptive phenotypic plasticity between breeds, which were supported by functional enrichment analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The temperature of the earth is one of the most important climate parameters. Proxy records of past climate changes, in particular temperature, are a fundamental tool for exploring internal climate processes and natural climate forcings. Despite the excellent information provided by ice core records in Antarctica, the temperature variability of the past 2000 years is difficult to evaluate from the low accumulation sites in the Antarctic continent interior. Here we present the results from the Aurora Basin North (ABN) ice core (71° S, 111° E, 2690 m a.s.l.) in the lower part of the East Antarctic plateau where accumulation is substantially higher than other ice core drilling sites on the plateau, and provide unprecedented insight in East Antarctic past temperature variability. We reconstructed the temperature of the last 2000 years using two independent methods: the widely used water stable isotopes (δ18O), and by inverse modelling of borehole temperature and past temperature gradients estimated from the inert gas stable isotopes (δ40Ar and δ15N). This second reconstruction is based on three independent measurement types: borehole temperature, firn thickness, and firn temperature gradient. The δ18O temperature reconstruction supports stable temperature conditions within 1 °C over the past 2000 years, in agreement with other ice core δ18O records in the region. However, the gas and borehole temperature reconstruction suggest that surface conditions 2 °C cooler than average prevailed in the 1000–1400 CE period, and support a 20th century warming of 1 °C. These changes are remarkably consistent with reconstructed Southern Annular Mode (SAM) variability, as it shows colder temperatures during the positive phase of the SAM in the beginning of the last millennium, with rapidly increasing temperature as the SAM changes to the negative phase. The transition to a negative SAM phase after 1400 CE is however not accompanied by a warming in West Antarctica, which suggests an influence of Pacific South American modes, inducing a cooling in West Antarctica while ABN is warming after this time. A precipitation hiatus during cold periods could explain why water isotope temperature reconstruction underestimates the temperature changes. Both reconstructions arguably record climate in their own way, with a focus on atmospheric and hydrologic cycles for water isotopes, as opposed to surface temperature for gases isotopes and borehole. This study demonstrates the importance of using a variety of sources for comprehensive paleoclimate reconstructions.\n                        </jats:p>"

Six CPLOs related to the core curriculum, including the ability to design and evaluate packaging systems, as well as students' professionalism and teamwork skills, were developed using consensus building with all teaching faculty. Relationships, from specific to broad (i.e., CLOs to CPLOs to MSU‐LGs), were mapped with the SoP faculty. This mapping scheme (class‐specific CLOs supporting broader program CPLOs and, ultimately, MSU‐LGs) was developed to guarantee alignment of expectations for learning from the course to the packaging program to the MSU‐LGs. From Fall 2018 until Fall 2019, assessment tools, including rubrics and assignments intended to evaluate learning, were developed to assess core and elective courses offered by the SoP. Data collection of each student's performance was conducted utilizing Watermark's VIA software from Fall 2018 until Fall 2021 and continuous. Assessment of student performance provided evidence of learning across the SoP curriculum as well as how CLOs, delivered and assessed at the individual student level, translate into competence achieved at the programmatic and university levels.</jats:p>",

Based on the self-focusing effect and the temporal profile of the laser pulse, a discrete focus hypothesis is proposed, which can effectively elaborate the damage process.</jats:p>",

Among them, the DYRK1A protein kinase is thought to be implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Down syndrome, and as such, has emerged as an appealing therapeutic target. DYRKs are a subset of the CMGC (CDK, MAPKK, GSK3 and CLK) group of kinases. Within this group of kinases, the CDC2-like kinases (CLKs), such as CLK1, are closely related to DYRKs and have also sparked great interest as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Based on inhibitors previously described in the literature (namely TG003 and INDY), we report in this work a new class of dihydroquinolines exhibiting inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range on hDYRK1A and hCLK1. Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in AD. Pleasingly, the most potent dual kinase inhibitor 1p exhibited antioxidant and radical scavenging properties. Finally, drug-likeness and molecular docking studies of this new class of DYRK1A/CLK1 inhibitors are also discussed in this article.</jats:p>"

Retroviral sequences were prevalent; 74.1% of all samples were positive, with distinct correlations between virus, site and host bat species. Detected retroviruses comprised Myotis myotis, Myotis ricketti, Myotis daubentonii and Galidia endogenous retroviruses, murine leukemia virus-related virus and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum retrovirus (RFRV). A near-complete genome of a local RFRV strain with identical genome organization and 2.8% nucleotide divergence from the prototype isolate was characterized. Bat coronavirus sequences were detected with a prevalence of 24.1%, where analyses on the ORF1ab region revealed a novel alphacoronavirus lineage. Astrovirus sequences were detected in 25.9%of all samples, with considerable diversity. In 9.2% of the samples, other viruses including Actinidia yellowing virus 2, bat betaherpesvirus, Bole tick virus 4, Cyclovirus and Rhopalosiphum padi virus were identified. Conclusions: Further monitoring of bats across Kenya is essential to facilitate early recognition of possibly emergent zoonotic viruses.</jats:p>"

Six adamantane-based purine nucleosides showed an antiproliferative activity in the micromolar range.

We studied functional parameters of maternal and neonatal HDL in 192 obese women (pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 29), who were at high risk for GHTN. Maternal blood samples were collected longitudinally at &lt;20 weeks, at 24–28 and 35–37 weeks of gestation. Venous cord blood was collected immediately after birth. Maternal and cord blood were used to determine functional parameters of HDL, such as HDL cholesterol efflux capacity, activity of the vaso-protective HDL-associated enzyme paraoxonase-1, and levels of the HDL-associated anti-inflammatory apolipoprotein (apo)M. In addition, we determined serum anti-oxidative capacity. Thirteen percent of the women were diagnosed with GHTN. While we found no changes in measures of HDL function in mothers with GHTN, we observed impaired HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and paraoxonase-1 activity in cord blood, while serum antioxidant capacity was increased. Of particular interest, increased maternal paraoxonase-1 activity and apoM levels in early pregnancy were associated with the risk of developing GHTN. GHTN significantly impairs HDL cholesterol efflux capacity as well as HDL PON1 activity in cord blood and could affect vascular health in offspring. Maternal paraoxonase-1 activity and apoM levels in early pregnancy associate with the risk of developing GHTN.</jats:p>"

This study describes proteins that form the inner core layer of <jats:italic>I. scapularis</jats:italic> tick cement as disrupting these proteins will likely stop formation of the outer cortical layer. The inner core cement layer completes formation by 24 h of tick attachment. Thus, we used laser-capture microdissection to isolate cement from cryosections of 6 h and 24 h tick attachment sites and to distinguish between early and late inner core cement proteins. LC–MS/MS analysis identified 138 tick cement proteins (TCPs) of which 37 and 35 were unique in cement of 6 and 24 h attached ticks respectively. We grouped TCPs in 14 functional categories: cuticular protein (16%), tick specific proteins of unknown function, cytoskeletal proteins, and enzymes (13% each), enzymes (10%), antioxidant, glycine rich, scaffolding, heat shock, histone, histamine binding, proteases and protease inhibitors, and miscellaneous (3–6% each).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), as an emerging endocrine disrupter, has been considered one of the persistent organic contaminants in water. It is urgently necessary to develop an efficient technique for the effective removal of TBBPA from water. Herein, a one-step hydrothermal synthesis route was employed to prepare a novel iron-carbon core-shell nanoparticle (Fe@MC) for effectively activating persulfate (PS) to degrade TBBPA. Morphological and structural characterization indicated that the prepared Fe@MC had a typical core-shell structure composed of a 5 nm thick graphene-like carbon shell and a multi-valence iron core. It can be seen that 94.9% of TBBPA (10 mg/L) could be degraded within 30 min at pH = 7. This excellent catalytic activity was attributed to the synergistic effect of the porous carbon shell and a multi-valence iron core. The porous carbon shell could effectively prevent the leaching of metal ions and facilitate PS activation due to its electron transfer capability. Furthermore, numerous micro-reaction zones could be formed on the surface of Fe@MC during the rapid TBBPA removal process. Radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technology indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS), including OH, SO4−, O2−, and 1O2, were involved in the TBBPA degradation process. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the carbon atoms linked by phenolic hydroxyl groups would be more vulnerable to attack by electron-rich groups; the central carbon was cracked and hydroxylated to generate short-chain aliphatic acids.

In addition to promoting a circular economy, this architecture holds great promise for replacing secondary structural components in sustainable construction and transportation facilities. The statistical analysis responses are associated with the equivalent density of the panels, flexural strength and modulus of the panels, skin stress and core shear strength and modulus. Individual bamboo rings are also characterised using physic mechanical and interfacial bonding tests. Treated aluminium face sheets provide the best mechanical performance compared to glass fibre-reinforced composite (GFRP) ones by increasing the overall properties of the sandwich panels. The specific face sheet material and void percentage affect the equivalent density, with lower values (~ 0.48 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) when using GFRP skins, larger bamboo rings and cubic packing. Sandwich panels with 30 mm bamboo rings and hexagonal packing provide higher flexural properties, i.e. ~ 43 MPa strength and ~ 7.6 GPa modulus, and skin stress (~ 288 MPa), while those with 20 mm bamboo rings have higher shear stiffness (~ 132 MPa) and resistance (~ 3.33 MPa). Sandwich panels made with aluminium skins show evident skin-polymer debonding, while those with GFRP have premature skin failure and lower structural performance. The proposed sandwich panels present remarkable and competitive mechanical performance concerning commercial analogous structures, generally used in the aeronautical and automotive industries.</jats:p>"

In this study, we first compared the KI efficiency of mouse ES cells with CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector and ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and confirmed that KI efficiency was significantly increased by using RNP. Using CRISPR/Cas9 RNP and circular plasmid with homologous arms as a targeting vector, knock-in within ES cell clones could be obtained efficiently without drug selection, thus potentially shortening the vector construction or cell culture period. Moreover, by incorporating a drug-resistant cassette into the targeting vectors, double DNA KI can be simultaneously achieved at high efficiency by a single electroporation. This technique will help to facilitate the production of genetically modified mouse models that are fundamental for exploring topics related to human and mammalian biology.</jats:p>"

The nanoparticles exhibited a high magnetic saturation value (79.4 and 63.8 emu/g, correspondingly) to facilitate magnetic separation. It has been shown that surface properties play a key role in the adsorption process. Both types of organic dyes—cationic (Rhodomine C) and anionic (Congo Red and Eosine)—were well adsorbed by the Fe3O4 nanoparticles’ surface, and the adsorption process was described by the polymolecular adsorption model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 58, 22, and 14 mg/g for Congo Red, Eosine, and Rhodomine C, correspondingly. In this case, the kinetic data were described well by the pseudo-first-order model. Carbon-coated particles selectively adsorbed only cationic dyes, and the adsorption process for Methylene Blue was described by the Freundlich model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 14 mg/g. For the case of Rhodomine C, the adsorption isotherm has a polymolecular character with a maximum adsorption capacity of 34 mg/g. To realize the targeted destruction of the carcinoma cells, the Fe3O4@C nanoparticles were functionalized with aptamers, and an experiment on the Ehrlich ascetic carcinoma cells’ destruction was carried out successively using a low-frequency alternating magnetic field. The number of cells destroyed as a result of their interaction with Fe3O4@C nanoparticles in an alternating magnetic field was 27%, compared with the number of naturally dead control cells of 6%.</jats:p>"

It exhibits a layered structure composed of apatitic and hydrated layers and can incorporate various dicarboxylate ions into the hydrated layer. Saturated dicarboxylic acids (HOOC(CH2)nCOOH) with an odd number of methylene groups (–CH2–) exhibit lower incorporation fractions than those with an even number of methylene groups, possibly owing to a compositional dependence on the synthetic method. In this study, calcium carbonate, phosphoric acid, and various amounts of glutaric acid were used to produce glutarate-ion-incorporated OCP by a wet chemical method, which is different from the conventional synthetic strategy. While utilising 1–20 mmol of glutaric acid during synthesis did not produce the desired product, using 25 mmol of glutaric acid resulted in the formation of single-phase glutarate-ion-incorporated OCP with a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.57 and a 90% incorporation fraction of glutarate ions. This glutarate-ion-incorporation fraction is significantly higher than that reported in the previous studies (35%). Thus, the synthetic procedure proposed herein was able to produce single-phase OCP containing glutarate ions with a high incorporation fraction. Our findings can contribute to development of novel functional ceramic biomaterials in the future.</jats:p>"

Setting and participants: Quasi-experimental, controlled, single-center study. The included participants were doctors, nurses, health workers, cleaning staff, and non-healthcare supportive staff. The main outcome was contracting COVID-19 anytime during the period of taking the prophylaxis, confirmed by RT-PCR. A total of 336 participants, without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 and without any known contact with family members, were included in the trial; 230 were assigned to HCQ and 106 declined to take any drug. Results: Among the participants, 43 (18.7%) in the HCQ group and 11 (10.4%) participants in the control group developed COVID-19. For the evaluation of side effects, we evaluated 12-lead ECGs of both groups at the baseline and after 4 weeks to monitor QTc interval. A total of 91% (198 of 217) participants in the prophylaxis group and 92% (11 of 12) in the control group had a QTc &lt; 45o msec, which is within normal limits. Conclusions: Although the number of symptomatic infections in health personnel was lower in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. However, in the absence of any effective pre-exposure prophylaxis medicine for COVID-19, practicing proper infection prevention and control (IPC) and vaccination is the only way forward.</jats:p>"

In late September 2021, EHDV was reported in cattle farms in central/western Tunisia. It rapidly spread throughout the country with more than 200 confirmed outbreaks. We applied a combination of classical and molecular techniques to characterize the causative virus as a member of the serotype EHDV-8. This is the first evidence of EHDV- 8 circulation since 1982 when the prototype EHDV-8 strain was isolated in Australia. This work highlights the urgent need for vaccines for a range of EHDV serotypes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The major method used to reduce the magnetic loss of soft magnetic composites (SMCs) is to coat the magnetic powder with an insulating layer, but the permeability is usually sacrificed in the process. In order to achieve a better balance between low losses and high permeability, a novel photodecomposition method was used in this study to create a ZnO insulating layer. The effect of the concentration of diethyl zinc on the formation of a ZnO insulating film by photodecomposition was studied. The ZnO film was best formed with a diethyl zinc n-hexane solution at a concentration of around 0.40 mol/L. Combined with conventional coupling treatment processes, a thin and dense insulating layer was coated on the surface of iron powder in situ. Treating the iron powder before coating by photodecomposition led to a synergistic effect, significantly reduced core loss, and the effective permeability only decreased slightly. An iron-based soft magnetic composite with a loss value of 124 kW/m3 and an effective permeability of 107 was obtained at the frequency of 100 kHz and a magnetic field intensity of 20 mT.</jats:p>"

However, low-loss coupling of light between fiber arrays or multicore fibers and standard linear arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) or photodiodes (PD) still represents a challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D-printed facet-attached microlenses (FaML) offer an attractive path for connecting multimode fiber arrays as well as individual cores of multimode multicore fibers to standard arrays of VCSEL or PD. The freeform coupling elements are printed <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">in situ</jats:italic> with high precision on the device and fiber facets by high-resolution multi-photon lithography. We demonstrate coupling losses down to 0.35 dB along with lateral 1 dB alignment tolerances in excess of 10 μm, allowing to leverage fast passive assembly techniques that rely on industry-standard machine vision. To the best of our knowledge, our experiments represent the first demonstration of a coupling interface that connects individual cores of a multicore fiber to VCSEL or PD arranged in a standard linear array without the need for additional fiber-based or waveguide-based fan-out structures. Using this approach, we build a 3 × 25 Gbit/s transceiver assembly which fits into a small form-factor pluggable module and which fulfills many performance metrics specified in the IEEE 802.3 standard.</jats:p>",

Much like the fusion between Artificial Intelligence and Electronic Design Automation (EDA), many efforts have been made to apply deep neural networks (DNN) such as convolutional neural networks to prototype and characterize next-gen optoelectronic devices commonly found in Photonic Integrated Circuits. However, state-of-the-art DNN models are still far from being directly applicable in the real world: e.g., DNN-produced correlation coefficients between target and predicted physical quantities are about 80%, which is much lower than what it takes to generate reliable and reproducible nanophotonic designs. Recently, attention-based transformer models have attracted extensive interests and been widely used in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In this work, we for the first time propose a Transformer model (POViT) to efficiently design and simulate photonic crystal nanocavities with multiple objectives under consideration. Unlike the standard Vision Transformer, our model takes photonic crystals as input data and changes the activation layer from GELU to an absolute-value function. Extensive experiments show that POViT significantly improves results reported by previous models: correlation coefficients are increased by over 12% (i.e., to 92.0%) and prediction errors are reduced by an order of magnitude, among several key metric improvements. Our work has the potential to drive the expansion of EDA to fully automated photonic design (i.e., PDA). The complete dataset and code will be released to promote research in the interdisciplinary field of materials science/physics and computer science.</jats:p>"

Serotonergic receptors are also affected in AD. Polymorphisms in genes of serotonin (5HT) receptors have been mostly associated with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In this study, we examined if AD patients carrying different genotypes in 5HTR1B rs13212041, 5HTR2A rs6313 (T102C), 5HTR2C rs3813929 (−759C/T), and 5HTR6 rs1805054 (C267T) polymorphisms have a higher risk of faster disease progression (assessed by neuropsychological testing), are more prone to develop AD-related pathology (reflected by levels of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] AD biomarkers), or have an association with an apolipoprotein E (APOE) haplotype. This study included 115 patients with AD, 53 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 2701 healthy controls. AD biomarkers were determined in the CSF of AD and MCI patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), while polymorphisms were determined using either TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays or Illumina genotyping platforms. We detected a significant decrease in the CSF amyloid β1–42 (Aβ1–42) and an increase in p-tau181/Aβ1–42 ratio in carriers of the T allele in the 5HTR2C rs3813929 (−759C/T) polymorphism. A significantly higher number of APOE ε4 allele carriers was observed among individuals carrying a TT genotype within the 5HTR2A T102C polymorphism, a C allele within the 5HTR1B rs13212041 polymorphism, and a T allele within the 5HTR6 rs1805054 (C267T) polymorphism. Additionally, individuals carrying the C allele within the 5HTR1B rs13212041 polymorphism were significantly more represented among AD patients and had poorer performances on the Rey–Osterrieth test. Carriers of the T allele within the 5HTR6 rs1805054 had poorer performances on the MMSE and ADAS–Cog. As all four analyzed polymorphisms of serotonin receptor genes showed an association with either genetic, CSF, or neuropsychological biomarkers of AD, they deserve further investigation as potential early genetic biomarkers of AD.</jats:p>"

Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) is a UBL covalently conjugated with intracellular proteins through ufmylation, a reaction analogous to ubiquitylation. Ufmylation is involved in processes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation, ribosome-associated protein quality control at the ER and ER-phagy. However, it remains unclear how ufmylation regulates such distinct ER-related functions. Here we identify a UFM1 substrate, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), that localizes on the ER membrane. Ufmylation of CYB5R3 depends on the E3 components UFL1 and UFBP1 on the ER, and converts CYB5R3 into its inactive form. Ufmylated CYB5R3 is recognized by UFBP1 through the UFM1-interacting motif, which plays an important role in the further uyfmylation of CYB5R3. Ufmylated CYB5R3 is degraded in lysosomes, which depends on the autophagy-related protein Atg7- and the autophagy-adaptor protein CDK5RAP3.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Peanut (<jats:italic>Arachis hypogaea</jats:italic> L.) is an important source of edible oil and protein for human nutrition. The quality of peanut seed oil is mainly determined by the composition of fatty acids, especially the contents of oleic acid and linoleic acid. Improving the composition of fatty acids in the seed oil is one of the main objectives for peanut breeding globally. To uncover the genetic basis of fatty acids and broaden the genetic variation in future peanut breeding programs, this study used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify loci associated with target traits and developed diagnostic marker. The contents of eight fatty acid components of the Chinese peanut mini-core collection were measured under four environments. Using the phenotypic information and over one hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), GWAS were conducted to investigate the genetics basis of fatty acids under multi-environments. Overall, 75 SNPs were identified significant trait associations with fatty acid components. Nineteen associations were repeatedly identified in multiple environments, and 13 loci were co-associated with two or three traits. Three stable major associated loci were identified, including two loci for oleic acid and linoleic acid on chromosome A09 [mean phenotypic variation explained (PVE): 38.5%, 10.35%] and one for stearic acid on B06 (mean PVE: 23%). According to functional annotations, 21 putative candidate genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis were found underlying the three associations. The allelic effect of SNP A09-114690064 showed that the base variation was highly correlated with the phenotypic variation of oleic acid and linoleic acid contents, and a cost-effective Kompetitive allele-Specific PCR (KASP) diagnostic marker was developed. Furthermore, the SNP A09-114690064 was found to change the cis-element CAAT (-) in the promoter of <jats:italic>ahFAD2A</jats:italic> to YACT (+), leading dozens of times higher expression level. The enhancer-like activity of <jats:italic>ahFAD2A</jats:italic> promoter was identified that was valuable for enriching the regulation mechanism of <jats:italic>ahFAD2A</jats:italic>. This study improved our understanding on the genetic architecture of fatty acid components in peanut, and the new effective diagnostic marker would be useful for marker-assisted selection of high-oleic peanut breeding.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapid and accurate detection of acute myocardial infarction can improve patients’ chances of survival. Cardiac troponin I (cTn I) is an important diagnostic biomarker for acute myocardial infarction. However, current immunoassays are insufficient to accurately measure cTn I, as they have limited detection sensitivity and are time-consuming. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a brilliant fingerprints diagnostic technique characterised by ultrasensitivity, fast response, and qualitative and quantitative analysis capabilities. In this study, reporter molecules (4-Mercaptobenzoic acid, 4-MBA) embedded Au@Ag core-shell nanospheres as SERS nanotags were prepared for the detection of cTn I. As the Raman reporters were embedded between the core and the shell, they could be protected from the external environment and nanoparticle aggregation. Excellent SERS performances were obtained due to the enhanced local electromagnetic field in the gap of core and shell metals. In a standard phosphate buffered saline (PBS) environment, the limit of detection for cTn I was 0.0086 ng mL−1 (8.6 ppt) with a good linear relationship. The excellent Raman detection performance was attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance effect and strong electromagnetic field enhancement effect produced by the gap between the Au core and the Ag shell. The SERS nanotags we prepared were facile to synthesize, and the analysis procedure could be completed quickly (15 min), which made the detection of cTn I faster. Therefore, the proposed SERS nanotags have significant potential to be a faster and more accurate tool for acute myocardial infarction diagnostics.</jats:p>"

Currently, outbreaks are mitigated through strict quarantine measures and the culling of affected herds, resulting in massive economic losses to the global pork industry. In 2019, an ASFV outbreak was reported in Mongolia, describing a rapidly progressing clinical disease and gross lesions consistent with the acute form of ASF; the virus was identified as a genotype II virus. Due to the limited information on clinical disease and viral dynamics within hosts available from field observations of the Mongolian isolates, we conducted the present study to further evaluate the progression of clinical disease, virulence, and pathology of an ASFV Mongolia/2019 field isolate (ASFV-MNG19), by experimental infection of domestic pigs. Intramuscular inoculation of domestic pigs with ASFV-MNG19 resulted in clinical signs and viremia at 3 days post challenge (DPC). Clinical disease rapidly progressed, resulting in the humane euthanasia of all pigs by 7 DPC. ASFV-MNG19 infected pigs had viremic titers of 108 TCID50/mL by 5 DPC and shed virus in oral secretions late in disease, as determined from oropharyngeal swabs. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the ASFV-MNG19 strain used in this study was a genotype II strain highly similar to other regional strains. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ASFV-MNG19 is a virulent genotype II ASFV strain that causes acute ASF in domestic swine.</jats:p>"

In this study, we identify a plant-unique endosomal regulator termed BLISTER (BLI), which colocalizes and associates with the retromer complex by interacting with the retromer core subunits VPS35 and VPS29. Depletion of BLI perturbs the assembly and membrane recruitment of the retromer core VPS26-VPS35-VPS29 trimer. Consequently, depletion of BLI disrupts retromer-regulated endosomal trafficking function, including transport of soluble vacuolar proteins and recycling of endocytosed PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins from the endosomes back to the PM. Moreover, genetic analysis in<jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>mutants reveals BLI and core retromer interact genetically in the regulation of endosomal trafficking.

The remaining five vaccinated and infected (VI) macaques had significantly reduced plasma viral loads compared with the infected controls (IC). A significant increase in systemic central memory CD4+ T cells and mucosal CD8+ effector memory T-cell responses was detected in vaccinated RMs compared to controls. Variability in lymph node SIV-Gag and Env specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokine responses were detected in the VI RMs while all three VP RMs had more durable cytokine responses following vaccination and prior to challenge. VI RMs demonstrated predominately SIV-specific monofunctional cytokine responses while the VP RMs generated polyfunctional cytokine responses. This study demonstrates that varicella virus-vectored SIV vaccination with protein boosts induces a 37.5% efficacy rate against pathogenic SIV challenge by generating mucosal memory, virus specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies, and polyfunctional T-cell responses.</jats:p>"

Clinical variables included the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), measuring physical disability and cognition, respectively. SMRI, dMRI, and rs-fMRI data were parcellated into 100 cortical (Schaefer atlas) and 14 subcortical (FSL-FIRST) regions to obtain networks of morphological covariance, structural connectivity, and functional connectivity, respectively. Following statistical harmonization and preprocessing, connectivity matrices were merged in a multiplex, from which regional coreness, defined as the probability of a node being part of the multiplex core, and coreness disruption index (κ), quantifying the global weakening of the core-periphery structure, were computed.</jats:p><jats:p>The associations of regional coreness and κ with disease status (PwMS versus healthy controls), clinical phenotype, and physical (EDSS) and cognitive (SDMT z-scores) disability were tested with permutation testing, one-way ANOVA, and Spearman and Pearson correlation, respectively.

The development of antibiotics with a different mechanism of action is seriously required. Here, we identified an allosteric inhibitory site buried inside eukaryotic mitochondrial heme-copper oxidases (HCOs), the essential respiratory enzymes for life. The steric conformation around the binding pocket of HCOs is highly conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes, yet the latter has an extra helix. This structural difference in the conserved allostery enabled us to rationally identify bacterial HCO-specific inhibitors: an antibiotic compound against ceftriaxone-resistant <jats:italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</jats:italic>. Molecular dynamics combined with resonance Raman spectroscopy and stopped-flow spectroscopy revealed an allosteric obstruction in the substrate accessing channel as a mechanism of inhibition. Our approach opens fresh avenues in modulating protein functions and broadens our options to overcome AMR.</jats:p>"

Our findings indicated that the RIC facilities across the 21 RCMI Centers provide access to major research equipment and are managed by experienced faculty and staff who provide expert consultative and technical services.

The separations of the two Ly<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> cores are 11.07 ± 2.26 kpcs (1.47 ± 0.3″) and 9.73 ± 1.55 kpcs (1.31 ± 0.21″), with Ly<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> line luminosities of ∼3.35  ×  10<jats:sup>44</jats:sup> erg s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and ∼6.99  ×  10<jats:sup>44</jats:sup> erg s <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for QSO1 and QSO2, respectively. The miniJPAS NB images show evidence of extended Ly<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> and CIV morphology for both QSOs and extended HeII morphology for QSO1.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> These two QSOs may be potential candidates for the new enormous Lyman alpha nebula (ELAN) found from the miniJPAS survey due to their extended morphology in the shallow depth and relatively high Ly<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> luminosities. We suggest that galactic outflows are the major powering mechanism for the double-core Ly<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> morphology. Considering the relatively shallow exposures of miniJPAS, the objects found here could merely form the cusp of a promising number of such objects that will be uncovered in the upcoming full Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerated Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) survey and deep integral field units (IFU) observations with 8–10 m telescopes will be essential for constraining the underlying physical mechanism that is responsible for the double-cored morphology.</jats:p>",
