      "abstract": "<jats:p>A multidisciplinary approach is being used to characterize unconventional reservoir rock, providing high-quality porosity, saturation, and grain density data. Higher-frequency (23 MHz) NMR with 2D T1/T2 mapping provides a bird’s-eye view of residual core fluids, including additional characterization detail regarding hydrocarbon and water mobility. Multi- Heating Rate Pyrolysis (MHR), a specialized staged temperature ramp pyrolysis method, provides added clarity and separatory power of mobile vs. immobile hydrocarbons to aid in the HF NMR segmentation process and understanding hydrocarbon producibility. Ongoing workflows elucidate the efficacy of the HF NMR over the historical GRI approach in saturation determination and understanding the formation dependent nuances in determining mobile hydrocarbons in conjunction with MHR pyrolysis. This integrated workflow uncovers the power of using a multifaceted approach to understanding the microporous unconventional reservoir media.  The study underpins the particle-size-dependent nature of fluid losses, both water and hydrocarbon, determined by carrying out experiments with HF NMR on intact and crushed reservoir rock of different mesh sizes before going through the GRI extraction and measurement process. Additionally, while particle size is an import factor of fluid loss, XRD results and additional formation information indicate that both clay, rock quality, and fluid quantity and quality are also controls on fluid losses.  Hydrocarbon producibility can be better determined in different formations using HF NMR and MHR pyrolysis in conjunction. In unconventional samples, where the hydrocarbon has low molecular mobility, the HF NMR and MHR pyrolysis show good agreement between the two methods, and the MHR results can define the fractions of hydrocarbon that are likely to be produced. In formations where hydrocarbons have high-molecular mobility, the volatile components suffer losses due to the sample-size reduction in pyrolysis preparation. The nonvolatile components are preserved and can be identified by MHR pyrolysis. The producible fractions can then be uncovered by using the difference in the full hydrocarbon volumes determined by HF NMR and the low-molecular mobility hydrocarbons determined by MHR pyrolysis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the ultra-low permeability of unconventional tight rocks negatively influences production, such a petrophysical property leads to reduced probabilities that drilling cuttings are invaded by drilling fluids before drill cuttings are collected at wellsite. In this study, higher frequency (HF, 23MHz) NMR 2-D T1-T2 mapping techniques are used for the first time to study fresh drill cuttings to evaluate influences of the drilling mud, and changes of the liquids inside drill cuttings. Results are compared to that of core samples to ensure the validity of the drill cuttings analysis. Selected fresh drilling cuttings of four different depths of a Permian basin well were analyzed using a 23MHz NMR instrument. The 2-D NMR T1-T2 mapping techniques with an echo spacing time of 0.07 ms and 61 T1 wait steps were used. NMR maps were taken on the “as received” drilling cuttings samples weighing in broad range of 17 to 50g to cover practically available ranges of sample volumes. The sizes of the cuttings are between 5 to 10 mm of any dimension. The initial samples were surface cleaned by wiping off visible mud, then mapped several times during a period of 5 weeks. Each NMR measurement took 15 to 30 minutes. NMR 2-D Maps of unconventional cuttings can provide total liquid porosity and saturations reliably when performed in conjunction with a Boyle’s law gas-filled porosity. The results are comparable to that of core samples. No significant differences were observed between “as received” and surface cleaned samples suggesting liquids in the drilling mud evaporated when samples arrived in the lab. It further suggests that the analysis at wellsite would enable us to work with cutting samples that are less contaminated or altered. All T1-T2 maps of drilling cuttings samples over the period of 5 weeks show liquid losses but at a relatively slow rate. The results indicate that the speeds of the oil and water evaporation from the samples depend on pore sizes of samples from different depths.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Core cleaning is a fundamental step in laboratory core analysis since it affects the interpretation of core data, thus its applications. For example, the thoroughness of core cleaning is an essential factor for characterizing reservoir rock wettability (Ma and Amabeoku, 2015). Although well-established core cleaning methods exist, characterizing the effectiveness of these methods continues to be a challenge. In this study, we present an innovative method based on NMR T_2 measurements at 100% water saturation (S_W1). Since T_2 of the water phase is sensitive to oil coating on solid surface, the shift in T_2 log-mean (T_2LM ) for water after cleaning provides a direct measurement for detecting rock surface cleanliness. The effectiveness of two standard cleaning protocols are evaluated on ten outcrop cores including sandstone, dolomite, limestone, and chalk. Rock surface cleanliness after each cleaning stage is characterized by the ratio of (T_2LM^end)⁄(T_2LM^start ) at S_W1, where (T_2LM^end)⁄(T_2LM^start )&lt;1 indicates increased cleanness or more water wetness. Therefore, a method is developed for characterizing the effectiveness of cleaning and can be used to select optimal and economical means for cleaning reservoir core samples or cuttings.</jats:p>",

Concerns among both the vaccinated and the unwilling center on the vaccine’s efficacy and its safety. Thus, this study aimed to identify whether the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination is related to the sources of information people use to learn about the vaccine. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 800 participants registered in an Internet research panel across Japan who completed a questionnaire on their sources of information about the vaccine, demographics, and vaccination status. Vaccine willingness/hesitancy and refusal were set as dependent variables in the logistic regression analysis, with sources of vaccine information and other socio-demographic variables set as independent variables. The results of the analysis found that the information sources significantly associated with willingness to vaccinate were TV (AOR 2.44 vs. vaccine refusal/hesitation), summary websites of COVID-19 by non-experts (AOR 0.21, vs. vaccine refusal/hesitation), Internet video sites (AOR 0.33, vs. vaccine refusal/hesitation), and the personal websites of doctors (AOR 0.16, vs. vaccine refusal/hesitation).

These curves were then loaded into a 3D dynamic model and the model was run under different salinity conditions to quantify the incremental oil recovery from Optimum Salinity Waterflooding and to visualize the process in 2D.

Despite the importance of glycoforms, we lack tools to detect specific glycoforms of mouse Muc21. In this study, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize different glycoforms of Muc21. We used membrane lysates of Muc21-expressing TA3-Ha cells or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells transfected with Muc21 as antigens. Specificity testing, utilizing Muc21 glycosylation variant cells, showed that mAb 1A4-1 recognized Muc21 carrying glycans terminated with galactose residues, whereas mAb 18A11 recognized Muc21 carrying sialylated glycans. mAb 1A4-1 stained a majority of mouse mammary carcinoma TA3-Ha cells in vitro and in engrafted tumors in mice, whereas mAb 18A11 recognized only a subpopulation of these. mAb 1A4-1 was useful in immunohistochemically detecting Muc21 in normal squamous epithelia.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in cancer development and thus is a viable target for cancer treatment. STAT3 functions as a dimer mediated by phosphorylation of the SRC-homology 2 (SH2) domain, a key target for therapeutic drugs. While great efforts have been employed towards the development of compounds that directly target the SH2 domain, no compound has yet been approved by the FDA due to a lack of specificity and pharmacologic efficacy. Studies have shown that allosteric regulation of SH2 via the coiled-coil domain (CCD) is an alternative drug design strategy. Several CCD effectors have been shown to modulate SH2 binding and affinity, and at the time of writing at least one drug candidate has entered phase I clinical trials. However, the mechanism for SH2 regulation via CCD is poorly understood. Here, we investigate structural and dynamic features of STAT3 and compare the wild type to the reduced function variant D170A in order to delineate mechanistic differences and propose allosteric pathways. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore conformational space of STAT3 and the variant, followed by structural, conformation, and dynamic analysis. The trajectories explored show distinctive conformational changes in the SH2 domain for the D170A variant, indicating long range allosteric effects. Multiple analyses provide evidence for long range communication pathways between the two STAT3 domains, which seem to be mediated by a rigid core which connects the CCD and SH2 domains via the linker domain (LD) and transmits conformational changes through a network of short-range interactions. The proposed allosteric mechanism provides new insight into the understanding of intramolecular signaling in STAT3 and potential pharmaceutical control of STAT3 specificity and activity.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Author Summary</jats:title><jats:p>In all living organisms, the proliferation and survival of cells are regulated by various proteins. Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3(STAT3) protein is one of the important proteins. However, the abnormal regulation of these proteins will lead to cancer cell. The constitutive activation of STAT3 has been linked to several types of solid tumors, leukemia, and lymphomas. Consequently, STAT3 proteins have been a key target for cancer therapy. SH2(SRC-homology 2) domain is the key interaction site, great efforts have been attributed to target SH2 domain, which specificity has been a major challenge in drug discovery. Research showing regulation of SH2 domain via CCD has opened a new path for drug discovery, however is challenged by poor understanding of the allosteric mechanism. Here, we show that CCD regulates SH2 conformation via a rigid backbone. The perturbations in CCD is transmitted through α-helix to the rigid core that concert the movement of CCD and LD (Link domain), leading to structural changes in the SH2 domain. The present findings provide allosteric mechanism with atomistic details underlying the regulation of CCD to SH2 domain in STAT3 protein. Which allows informed drug design targeting CCD for desired downstream effect on SH2 domain and the overall STAT3 function.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

How such guild-level structure supports the gut microbiota to stably provide essential health-relevant functions to the host remains elusive. With high quality metagenome-assembled genomes as network nodes, here we identified a core microbiome signature made up of two robust competing guilds that together correlate with a wide range of host health conditions. Genomes in these two guilds kept their ecological relationship unchanged despite experiencing profound abundance changes during a 3-month high fiber intervention and 1-year follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes. The genomes of one guild harbored more genes for plant polysaccharide degradation and butyrate production, while the other guild had more genes for virulence or antibiotic resistance. A Random Forest regression model showed that the abundance distributions of these genomes were associated with 41 out of 43 bio-clinical parameters in the study cohort. With these genomes as reference, Random Forest modeling successfully classified case and control of 8 chronic diseases in 12 independent metagenomic datasets from 1,816 participants across ethnicity and geography. This core microbiome signature49 may facilitate ecological management of chronic diseases.</jats:p>"

These observations contradict models of steady inner core rotation and models that posit much faster rotation rates. The reversal of polarity, timing, and rotation rates is consistent with a model of oscillations about an equilibrium with gravitational locking of the mantle and inner core due to lateral density variations. The model, which has a 6-year period, can explain the variation in the length of day, which has oscillated fairly steadily for the past decades. Inner core oscillation would also allow interpretations of causal connections between inner core and mantle lateral variations, which are problematic if the inner core consistently superrotates.</jats:p>",

For zoos considering using technology to bolster scientific efforts or enhance the welfare of primates in their care, touchscreen activities offer a solution that has a long and proven record of primate use in laboratory settings as well as a history of usage in the zoo world. We review the options that are available for zoos to build their own touchscreen systems and we offer as an alternative our pre-built apparatus, Apex, and primate software suite, ApeTouch, both of which are tailored for use in a zoo setting. The efficacy and utility of these tools are demonstrated in a training study with four macaque groups of different species that were previously naïve to touchscreens. All of the groups in the study learned to use the device and displayed a consistent engagement with the touchscreen tasks over 95 daily sessions of exposure. In the final stage of the training, two of the four groups displayed an above-chance level performance on a numerical sequencing task.</jats:p>"

This post-translational modification controls key cellular processes like the degradation of proteins, endocytosis, subcellular localization and activity of proteins. The ubiquitination, which can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays important roles during brain development. Furthermore, deregulation of the Ub system is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. We have used a publicly available RNAseq database to conduct an extensive genome-wide gene expression analysis of the core components of the Ub machinery, covering Ub genes as well as E1, E2, E3 and DUB genes. The ubiquitination network was merely governed by <jats:italic>Uba1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Ube2m</jats:italic>, the predominant E1 and E2 genes, respectively. There expression was positively regulated during cortical formation. The principal genes coding for HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus), RBR (RING-in-between-RING), and RING (really interesting new gene) E3 Ub ligases were also prominently regulated. <jats:italic>Pja1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Dtx3</jats:italic> (RING ligases) and <jats:italic>Stub1</jats:italic> (U-box RING) were the most highly expressed E3 Ub ligase genes and displayed distinct developmental expression patterns. Moreover, &gt; 80 DUB genes were expressed during corticogenesis with two prominent actors <jats:italic>Uch-l1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Usp22</jats:italic> that were strongly up-regulated. Several components of the Ub system overexpressed in cancers were highly expressed in the cerebral cortex under conditions not related to tumour formation or progression. Altogether, this work provides an in-depth overview of the transcriptomic changes during the embryonic formation of the cerebral cortex. The data also offer new insight for the characterization of the Ub system and may contribute to a better understanding of its involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.</jats:p>"

Cerebral edema affects the occurrence of hypoattenuation, originating from the inner edge of the infarct and extending to the core.

Several scalable approaches have have been proposed to address this challenge, like the Algorithm for Proven and Young (APY). In APY, genotyped animals are partitioned into core and non-core subsets, which induces a sparser inverse of genomic relationship matrix. The partitioning into subsets is often done at random. While APY is a good approximation of the full model, the random partitioning can make results unstable, possibly affecting accuracy or even reranking animals. Here we present a stable optimisation of the core subset by choosing animals with the most informative genotype data.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>We derived a novel algorithm for optimising the core subset based on the conditional genomic relationship matrix or the conditional SNP genotype matrix.

The core subsets were constructed (1) at random, (2) based on the diagonal of genomic relationship matrix, (3) at random with weights from (2), or (4) based on the novel conditional algorithm.

In this paper, the refined three-dimensional digital core of shale with fracture matrix pore dual medium is reconstructed by using the improved four parameter growth method and two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion model. Finally, the effective resistivity of digital core under different fracture parameters is simulated and calculated by finite element method, and the variation law of digital core resistivity under different wettability and fracture arrangement is analyzed.

They are, even coming from underground, facing weathering and dissolution &amp; precipitation process, which makes the rock salt outcrop structure probably different from halite core. In this paper, physical property and chemical composition comparisons were conducted first to determine the difference between conventional rock salt outcrop and the halite core. The creep behavior of rock salt, shale, and halite core was investigated respectively by creep tests and DIC analysis. The results show that shale creeps are accompanied by fluctuation and the sample is compressive in both axial and radial. The fine grain rock salt has a smooth strain &amp; time relation and the sample has a negative (tensile) volumetric strain as well as radial strain. However, the composite halite core creeps in a pattern between \"soft rock\" (rock salt) and \"hard rock\" (shale). Creeping with fluctuation, the sample dilates in radial while the volume is compressive. DIC analysis shows that the high strain area is concentrated at the boundary between different components.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>1.

Meanwhile, corresponding differentiation has taken place among the weeaboos, typically including “core weeaboo” group and “pan weeaboo” group. Generally, “core weeaboos” refer to a group of people who are deeply involved in the weeaboo culture. On one hand, in the online community, “core weeaboos” tend to reject normal interaction with “pan weeaboos”, who they think are not deeply involved in the culture; on the other hand, due to the long-term prejudice of the mainstream culture against the weeaboos, the “core weeaboo” group has also suffered from the exclusion from the mainstream culture for a long time, thus forming a unique chain of “multiple exclusion”. With the “core weeaboo” group as the research object, this paper conducts online and field research on the phenomenon of “multiple exclusion” in the relevant groups by means of questionnaire and interview. It is found that the phenomenon of “multiple exclusion” in essence can be considered a two-way interaction between the “core weeaboo” group and the mainstream culture. In order to alleviate this phenomenon, this paper advocates that mainstream culture should increase its understanding of subcultural groups, and actively encourage high-quality “fusion”, so as to reduce the adverse effects on corresponding subcultural groups.</jats:p>"

In long-haul bidirectional MCF transmissions, Rayleigh backscattering is one of the major causes of inter-core crosstalk (XT). In this paper, we derive approximate expressions for Rayleigh backscattered XT and discuss the accuracy of the approximations.

The results of both sub-studies can be grouped into three overarching categories of required competencies: communication skills on different levels, organisational leadership &amp;amp; staff management, and academic excellence &amp;amp; deeper knowledge of the respective field of science. To ensure future success of RIs and CFs this needs to be an integral part in the field of scientific and research education.</jats:p>"

In particular, the existence of the mode known as the free core nutation in the fluid core is known to amplify the forced nutations in the near-diurnal retrograde frequency band (as measured in the planetary frame of reference). Due to their proximity in shape and frequency, this mode is sometimes equated with the so-called spin-over mode, which denotes the free oscillation of a steadily rotating ellipsoidal fluid core. Through a careful study of the freely rotating two-layer planetary model with a rigid mantle and an inviscid fluid core, we show that the spin-over mode frequency corresponds to that where the sum of the external and internal torques on the mantle is balanced, causing it to rotate steadily. The presence of dissipation at the core−mantle boundary causes the free core nutation to become damped and slightly offsets its resonance frequency. We show that this offset, which is ≈−1 day for Earth, can be interpreted as the result of the proximity of the free core nutation frequency to that of the spin-over mode, which now corresponds to a minimum in the magnitude of the transfer function for nutations. We also show how this proximity leads to a slightly lower quality factor for the resonance than that computed from the usual formula. We conclude by discussing possible implications of this mechanism for Mars, the Moon, and the long-term evolution of Earth.</jats:p>",

This paper shows the VHDL IP 8-bit CISC microprocessor core development which is intended as an open core for teaching applications in the digital systems laboratory. The core is fully open and therefore, the user can have access to all internal signals as well as the opportunity to make changes to the structure itself which is very useful when lecturing microprocessor design. The main advantages of the present core, compared with commercially available equivalent cores, are that it is not vendor sensitive allowing its implementation in almost any FPGA family and being an open core, it can be fully monitored and modified to fit specific design constrains. Several tests were performed to the microprocessor core, including an embedded microcontroller with RAM, ROM and I/O capabilities. The present development includes a meta-assembler and linker to embed user programs in a ROM, which is automatically generated as a VHDL description</jats:p>"

To hide the dsRNA from host recognition, the genome remains encapsidated in transcriptionally active proteinaceous core capsids that transcribe and release +RNA. <jats:italic>De novo</jats:italic> +RNAs and core proteins must repeatedly assemble into new progeny cores in order to logarithmically amplify replication. Reoviruses also produce outercapsid (OC) proteins µ1, σ3 and σ1 that assemble onto cores to create highly stable infectious full virions. Current models of reovirus replication position amplification of transcriptionally-active cores and assembly of infectious virions in shared factories, but we hypothesized that since assembly of OC proteins would halt core amplification, OC assembly is somehow regulated. Using kinetic analysis of virus +RNA, core and OC proteins, core assembly and whole virus assembly, assembly of OC proteins was found to be temporally delayed. All viral RNAs and proteins were made simultaneously, eliminating the possibility that delayed OC RNAs or proteins account for delayed OC assembly. High resolution fluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that core amplification occurred early during infection at peripheral core-only factories, while all OC proteins associated with lipid droplets (LDs) that coalesced near the nucleus in a µ1–dependent manner. Core-only factories transitioned towards the nucleus despite cycloheximide-mediated halting of new protein expression, while new core-only factories developed in the periphery. As infection progressed, OC assembly occurred at LD-and nuclear-proximal factories. Silencing of OC µ1 expression with siRNAs led to large factories that remained further from the nucleus, implicating µ1 in the transition to perinuclear factories. Moreover, late during infection, +RNA pools largely contributed to the production of <jats:italic>de-novo</jats:italic> viral proteins and fully-assembled infectious viruses. Altogether the results suggest an advanced model of reovirus replication with spatiotemporal segregation of core amplification, OC complexes and fully assembled virions.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>NON-TECHNICAL AUTHOR SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>It is important to understand how viruses replicate and assemble to discover antiviral therapies and to modify viruses for applications like gene therapy or cancer therapy. Reovirus is a harmless virus being tested as a cancer therapy. Reovirus has two coats of proteins, an inner coat and an outer coat. To replicate, reovirus particles need only the inner coat, but to become infectious they require the outer coat. Strangely, inner and outer coat proteins are all made by the virus at once, so it was unknown what determines whether newly made viruses will contain just the inner coat to continue to replicate, or both coats to transmit to new hosts. Our experiments reveal that the inner coat proteins are located in a different area of an infected cell versus the outer coat proteins. The location therefore determines if the newly made viruses contain just the inner coat versus both coats. Reoviruses have evolved extravagant mechanisms to be able to efficiently take on the best composition required for replication and transmission.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background</jats:bold>: Most justice-involved youth are supervised in community settings, where assessment and linkage to substance use (SU) treatment services are inconsistent and fragmented. Only 1/3 of youth with an identified SU need receive a treatment referral and even fewer initiate services. Thus, improving identification and linkage to treatment requires coordination across juvenile justice and behavioral health (BH) agencies. The current study examines the comparative effectiveness of two bundled implementation intervention strategies for improving SU treatment initiation, engagement, and continuing care among justice-involved youth supervised in community settings. Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) served as the conceptual framework for study design and selection/timing of implementation intervention components, and the BH Services Cascade served as the conceptual and measurement framework for identifying and addressing gaps in service receipt.<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: Part of a larger Juvenile Justice-Translational Research for Adolescents in the Justice System (JJ-TRIALS) Cooperative, this study involved a multisite, cluster-randomized control trial where sites were paired then randomly assigned to receive Core (training teams on the BH Services Cascade and data-driven decision making; supporting goal selection) or Core+Enhanced (external facilitation of implementation teams) intervention components. Youth service records were collected from 20 juvenile justice community supervision agencies (in five states) across five study phases (baseline, pre-randomization, early experiment, late experiment, maintenance). Implementation teams comprised of justice and BH staff collaboratively identified goals along the BH Cascade and used data-driven decision-making to implement change.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: Results suggest that Core intervention components were effective at increasing service receipt over time relative to baseline, but differences between Core and Core+Enhanced conditions were non-significant. Time to service initiation was shorter among Core+Enhanced sites, and deeper Cascade penetration occurred when external facilitation (of implementation teams) was provided. Wide variation existed in the degree and nature of change across service systems. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Findings demonstrate the criticality of early EPIS phases, demonstrating that strategies provided during the formative exploration and preparation phases produced some improvement in service receipt, whereas implementation-focused activities produced incremental improvement in moving youth farther along the Cascade. <jats:bold>Trial registration</jats:bold>: ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02672150; Date of registration: 2/3/2016 (retrospectively registered); https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02672150</jats:p>"

What are the characteristics and is the inflation process in these countries sufficiently homogeneous? Are the analysed inflation rates converging, so that there is an indication that these countries tend to form the optimal currency area. We used a unit root test to check the stationarity of a series of average inflationary differentials. They are calculated as the difference between inflation rate in a given country and the inflation rate in EMU. If the convergence process took place, the inflationary differentials will decrease and tend to zero. The variance of differentials will also decrease, so the series of average inflationary differentials will be stationary. The analysis showed that there is a unit root in the series, thus it is not stationary, and we cannot conclude that the process of convergence of inflation rates in the core countries happened. The paper also analyzes the autocorrelation functions of inflation rates, to determine the persistence of inflation, i.e. how long it takes for the shock that caused the inflation growth of 1%, to die off. The values of the first autocorrelation coefficients are high, while the next ones fall slowly, so it takes a long time for the impact of the inflation shock to disappear. In addition, the correlograms of inflation rates are quite heterogeneous, which indicates that inflationary processes differ.</jats:p>",

Following the introduction of the 7-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in South Africa in 2009 and 2011, respectively, a decrease in both invasive pneumococcal infections and asymptomatic carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci were reported. In this study, we described the changing epidemiology of the pneumococcal carriage population in South Africa, by sequencing the genomes of 1825 isolates collected between 2009 and 2013. Using these genomic data, we reported the changes in serotypes, Global Pneumococcal Sequence Clusters (GPSCs), and antibiotic resistance before and after the introduction of PCV13. The pneumococcal carriage population in South Africa has a high level of diversity, comprising of 126 GPSCs and 49 serotypes. Of the ten most prevalent GPSCs detected, six were predominantly found in Africa (GPSC22, GPSC21, GPSC17, GPSC33, GPSC34 and GPSC52). We found a significant decrease in PCV7 serotypes (19F, 6B, 23F and 14) and an increase in non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) (16F, 34, 35B and 11A) among children &lt;2 years of age. The increase in NVTs was driven by pneumococcal lineages GPSC33, GPSC34, GPSC5 and GPSC22. Overall, a decrease in antibiotic resistance for 11 antimicrobials was detected in the PCV13 era. Further, we reported a higher resistance prevalence among vaccine types (VTs), as compared to NVTs; however, an increase in penicillin resistance among NVT was observed between the PCV7 and PCV13 eras. The carriage isolates from South Africa predominantly belonged to pneumococcal lineages, which are endemic to Africa. While the introduction of PCV resulted in an overall reduction of resistance in pneumococcal carriage isolates, an increase in penicillin resistance among NVTs was detected in children aged between 3 and 5 years, driven by the expansion of penicillin-resistant clones associated with NVTs in the PCV13 era.</jats:p>",

They are mechanical methods based on the partial relaxation of the RSs that occur when a proper geometry variation of the analysed component is introduced by drilling a hole (HDM) or a proper annular groove (RCM). The RS computation is performed by measuring the strains relaxed on surface and then by combine properly such measured strains with the influence coefficients previously computed accurately by using a numerical codes that consider the geometry of the particular component to be examined. In such a manner, the HMs can be potentially applied to any RS distribution independently from the cause that have caused them. In more detail, the HMs can be used for the analysis of the RS on welded joint by using both classical welding methods, as MIG or TIG processes, or modern methods as friction stir welding, etc. In the present chapter, after a brief presentation of the theory of the HMs, their application to various cases of welding joints are treated, and the possible limitation are discussed.</jats:p>"

The plasmonic effect is one the most prominent and effective ways to capture more incident light and also provide good carrier dynamic management. Here, we systematically introduce spherical gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with different radii in the absorber layer of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The overall enhanced optical absorption of around 14.20% and 20.02% is achieved for incorporated monolayer and bilayer Au NPs, respectively, in the active layer compared to the pure perovskite layer. Moreover, we employ the metal (Au)-dielectric (TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) nanoparticles in the absorber layer. The optical absorption increases as the core-shell size decreases. The optical absorption elevates in both Au@TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> core-shell and Au@SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> core-shell 17.5% and 3.5%, respectively. These results support superior separation and transfer of charge in the existence of plasmonic NPs.

Box-Behnken design (BBD) under response surface methodology (RSM) were applied to evaluate the effects of the process variables such as pH, adsorbent dosage, and initial PR concentration (Co). The results indicated that a good correlation between the estimated and experimental values was found for the PR decolorization efficiency from aqueous media using Fe3O4/NiMn-LDH (R2 = 0.99). Furthermore, the statistical model obtained from BBD was sufficient to estimate the PR decolorization on Fe3O4/NiMn-LDH (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The optimal conditions for the PR decolorization efficiency were determined as 5.38, 24.59 mg, and 25.39 mg/L for pH, adsorbent dosage, and Co, respectively which resulted in 86.93% the PR decolorization efficiency.

It is often measured in the laboratory from reservoir core samples or evaluated from well test data. The prediction of reservoir rock permeability utilizing well log and seismic data is important because the core analysis and well test data are usually only available from a few wells in a field and are associated with high coring and laboratory analysis costs. In this work, a joint inversion strategy based on Multi Attribute Analysis (MAA) and Deep Feed-forward Neural Networks (DFNNs) algorithm was applied to predict the spatial variations of key petrophysical parameters (porosity, permeability, and saturation) for inter-well regions. In this method, acoustic impedance (AI) models are computed from post-stack seismic amplitude data by seismic inversion in the time domain with measured log density and velocity as constraints. The obtained results reveal that the proposed strategy, which combines MAA and PNNs, leads to the optimization of lateral and vertical facies heterogeneities and accurate prediction of reservoir parameter distribution. The time slice maps of inverted porosity and permeability at various time intervals indicate a reasonable calibration with the measured core and well log data. The methodology proposed in this study may be considered useful for other basins in Kansas with similar geological settings and anywhere in the world for reservoir characterization, particularly for carbonate Cambrian-Ordovician formations and variable depositional environments.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>1. INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Recently, acoustic impedance (AI) mapping, which is derived from the inversion of poststack seismic amplitude data, has emerged as a widely used technique for predicting spatial reservoir properties. It has been proposed that the inverted models of AI, i.e., P-impedance, S-impedance, and density, can be used to estimate lithofacies, petrophysical, and elastic parameters (Singha and Chatterjee 2014; Leiphart and Hart 2001; Pramanik et al. 2004; Calderon 2007; Kumar et al. 2016; Kumar et al. 2016; Walls et al. 2002). Based on the literature, several researchers have developed geological features and petrophysical properties using particular seismic attributes. For example, Russell et al. (2004), demonstrated how seismic attributes may be used to estimate the porosity cube. They employed stepwise regression and neural network approaches to create the porosity cube. De Groot and Aminzadeh (2004) employed the seismic attribute to discover faults, cracks, gas chimneys, and salt bodies in the ground.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Its main objective is to demonstrate the key GFR technologies and to perform tests of innovative materials. The reactor core is based on the standard and MOX pin type fuel in the first phase of the project. The active core of a large GFR 2400 makes use of ceramic materials, but in the first ALLEGRO core MOX fuel will be used. It will be mainly to demonstrate the viability of the technology and to acquire necessary experimental data for further research. In the presented works are identified the main discrepancies between ALLEGRO and GFR 2400 designs, the sensitivity analysis was performed for both reactors. Neutronic characterization is aimed to determination of the standard neutronic parameters using conventional computational systems.

The formation of cell stimulation-induced nuclear RelA foci was abolished in the presence of hexanediol, suggesting an underlying process of liquid-liquid phase separation. The gained SEs induced a switch-like expression and enhanced cell-to-cell variability in transcriptional response. These properties were correlated with the number of gained cis-regulatory interactions, while switch-like gene induction was associated with the number of NF-κB binding sites in SE.

For samples with sufficent coverage (19/20 samples with coverage &gt; 8X), we could unambigously identify <jats:italic>L. interrogans</jats:italic> sv Icterohaemorrhagiae (14 samples), <jats:italic>L. kirschneri</jats:italic> sv Grippotyphosa (4 samples) and <jats:italic>L. interrogans</jats:italic> sv Pyrogenes (1 sample) as the infecting strain.\nConclusions\n We obtained for most of our clinicall samples high quality genomic data at suitable coverage for confident core genome genotyping of the agent of leptospirosis. The ability to generate culture-free genomic data opens new opportunities to better understand the epidemiology and evolution of this fastidious pathogen.</jats:p>"

The applicability of the global isomorphism transformation and the dependence of its parameters on the screening length of the Yukawa potential are discussed. These parameters determine both the slope of the rectilinear diameter of the liquid–vapor binodal and the Zeno-element, which are the core ingredients of the fluid–LG isomorphism. We compare the Zeno-element parameters with the virial Zeno-line parameters, which are commonly used in the literature for the formulation of generalized law of the correspondent states. It is demonstrated that the Zeno-element parameters appear to be sensitive to the liquid state instability when the interaction potential becomes too short-ranged, while the virial ones do not show any peculiarities connected with this specific of the HCAYF.</jats:p>",

Splicing and polyadenylation (PA) are well-known examples of PTR that can regulate not only gene expression but also their function. Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) has already been shown to be essential to many biological processes (e.g., proliferation, cell differentiation, etc) and has also been implicated in the development and progression of multiple diseases (e.g., cancer, hematological and immune disorders, etc.). Although several sequencing methods have been developed to sequence only the transcript termination site (TTS), the number of publicly available data derived from these methods is extremely limited in comparison to traditional RNA-Seq data. To overcome this limitation, we created a new framework - Compositional Regression of Polyadenylation Differences (CORE-PAD) - for the study of differential APA events using traditional bulk RNA-seq data. Through simulated data, we showed that CORE-PAD has higher accuracy than other methods (accuracy = 0.98) in detecting APA events. We applied CORE-PAD across prostate cancer (PCa) samples with impaired CDK12 and “wild” samples. We found multiple genes presented differential PA site usage, including DNA repair genes. Most notably, we notice that many genes that exhibit differential APA were not differentially expressed at gene level, meaning they are potentially “silent drivers” that cannot be capture through standard differential gene expression analysis. These findings highlight the importance of studying APA, which can help shed light into another layer of regulation occurring between transcription and translation. This is especially important since these events can be source of neoantigens or targeted mRNA degradation which could be explore for new treatments. Finally, the CORE-PAD framework was designed to take advantage of our recently published recount3 resource making over 750,000 RNA-Seq samples of human and mouse origin readily available for analysis, enabling studies of APA across thousands of phenotypes in an accurate and accessible way.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Eddie L.

We employed an iterative assembly process and polishing with one lane of high-accuracy Illumina reads, obtaining a final size of the assembly of 377.36 Mb that had high contiguity (fragment N50 length = 12 Mb) and accuracy, as evidenced by the exceptionally high completeness of the benchmarked set of conserved single-copy orthologous genes (BUSCO completeness = 99.1%). These quality metrics place our assembly ahead of the published Coleopteran genomes, including that of an insect model, the red flour beetle (<jats:italic>Tribolium castaneum</jats:italic>). The structural annotation of the nuclear genome assembly contained a highly-accurate set of 16,371 protein-coding genes, with only 2.8% missing BUSCOs, and the expected number of non-coding RNAs. The number and structure of paralogous genes in a gene family like Sigma GST is lower than in another scarab beetle (<jats:italic>Onthophagus taurus</jats:italic>), but higher than in the red flour beetle (<jats:italic>Tribolium castaneum</jats:italic>), which suggests expansion of this GST class in Scarabaeidae.

However, the principles on which cyclin–CDK complexes organize the temporal order of cell cycle events are contentious<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. One model proposes that S-CDKs and M-CDKs are functionally specialized, with substantially different substrate specificities to execute different cell cycle events<jats:sup>4–6</jats:sup>. A second model proposes that S-CDKs and M-CDKs are redundant with each other, with both acting as sources of overall CDK activity<jats:sup>7,8</jats:sup>. In this model, increasing CDK activity, rather than CDK substrate specificity, orders cell cycle events<jats:sup>9,10</jats:sup>. Here we reconcile these two views of core cell cycle control. Using phosphoproteomic assays of in vivo CDK activity in fission yeast, we find that S-CDK and M-CDK substrate specificities are remarkably similar, showing that S-CDKs and M-CDKs are not completely specialized for S phase and mitosis alone. Normally, S-CDK cannot drive mitosis but can do so when protein phosphatase 1 is removed from the centrosome. Thus, increasing S-CDK activity in vivo is sufficient to overcome substrate specificity differences between S-CDK and M-CDK, and allows S-CDK to carry out M-CDK function. Therefore, we unite the two opposing views of cell cycle control, showing that the core cell cycle engine is largely based on a quantitative increase in CDK activity through the cell cycle, combined with minor and surmountable qualitative differences in catalytic specialization of S-CDKs and M-CDKs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant demonstrated the vulnerability of the plants on the loss of electrical power for several days, so called extended station blackout (SBO). A set of measures have been proposed and implemented in response of the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. The purpose of the study was to investigate the application of the deterministic safety analysis for core heatup prevention strategy of the extended SBO in pressurized water reactor, lasting 72 h. The prevention strategy selected was water injection into steam generators using turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump (TD-AFW) or portable water injection pump. Method for assessment of the necessary pump injection flowrate is developed and presented. The necessary injection flowrate to the steam generators is determined from the calculated cumulative water mass injected by the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump in the analysed scenarios, when desired normal level is maintained automatically. The developed method allows assessment of the necessary injection flowrates of pump, TD-AFW or portable, for different plant configurations and number of flowrate changes. The RELAP5/MOD3.3 Patch04 computer code and input model of a two-loop pressurized water reactor is used for analyses, assuming different injection start times, flowrates and reactor coolant system losses. Three different reactor coolant system (RCS) coolant loss pathways, with corresponding leakage rate, can be expected in the pressurized water reactor (PWR) during the extended SBO: normal system leakage, reactor coolant pump seal leakage, and RCS coolant loss through letdown relief valve unless automatically isolated or until isolation is procedurally directed. Depressurization of RCS was also considered. In total, six types of RCS coolant loss scenarios were considered. Two cases were defined regarding the operation of the emergency diesel generators. Different delays of the pump injection start following the station blackout were assumed and analysed. For each scenario, two kinds of SBO calculations for two-loop PWR were performed, base and verification. Base calculations were needed to determine necessary minimum flowrate for steam generators feeding in such a way that they are not overfilled or emptied. Namely, it was assumed that instrumentation is not available during extended SBO. The verification calculations have been then performed to verify if the determined minimum flowrates are sufficient to prevent the core heatup. The calculated results show effectiveness of the proposed extended SBO prevention strategy provided that the water injection is available in the first two hours after SBO occurring at full power. If diesel generator is running after loss of offsite power for some time, e.g. one hour, the available time for steam generator water injection is significantly longer. The obtained results demonstrate the need for assessment of the pump injection flowrates before the utilization of the pump for mitigation of the event. The applicability of the developed method for assessment of the required pump injection flowrate has been validated on PWR.</jats:p>"

This paper shows the example of an online student competition course in Sustainable Food for Master students based on action-learning principles and the five core competences of Observation, Participation, Dialogue, Visioning, and Reflection. The course ran three times from 2019-2022 and 85 students assessed themselves in these five competences by responding to 17 rating statements. Analyses revealed significant improvement in all competences except Participation after the course. Yet since Participation was highest rated before the course, rating of this competence was not less than other competences at the end. Practicing these five core competences and integrating competency self-assessments into educational activities can contribute to a paradigm shift in education that fosters the cultivation of competences for sustainability and that may be applicable to other courses.</jats:p>"

Defining empathy instead as the attempted representation, or simulation, of another's subjective internal experiences (whether sensory, affective, or cognitive) would increase its clarity and empirical utility. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>As future aircraft become lighter and more aerodynamically efficient, thrust requirements will decrease, reducing the core size of the engine. Furthermore, in the pursuit of improved fuel burn, engine overall pressure ratio and bypass ratio will increase, further driving down engine core size. These drivers together mean that the core size, or corrected mass flow rate at the compressor exit, for future single-aisle aircraft applications will shrink below 3.0 lbm/s. Traditionally, this small core compressor size is in the domain of axi-centrifugal designs, machines that are typically less efficient and limited to pressure ratios of ∼25 due to stress and thermomechanical fatigue in the centrifugal impeller. In this light, NASA, Pratt &amp; Whitney and the Raytheon Technologies Research Center embarked upon a program to develop technologies to enable an all-axial high-pressure compressor with a core size below 3.0 lbm/s and an overall pressure ratio greater than 50.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the challenges with an all-axial high-pressure compressor at this core size is the small span at the rear of the compressor. As core size is scaled down, the rotor tip clearances do not scale with span, leading to significant efficiency penalties. This paper documents a numerical and experimental effort to mitigate this penalty through design optimization and technology insertion, enabling an estimated 5 to 10% fuel burn reduction relative to 2020 best-in-class. The experimental program consisted of two builds of a high-speed rig: a baseline build and a second build to insert technology to manage large rotor tip gap/span ratios. The results demonstrated a reduction in the sensitivity of the compressor to large clearance ratios, which would be likely at the end-of-life of a small core application. The test campaign demonstrated that, with the insertion of technology, small core compressors can maintain a similar efficiency to current best-in-class large core size compressors.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In addition to advancing the state-of-the-art of technology, the program also advanced the modeling standards for multistage compressors with large clearance-to-span ratios. The validation of this approach is described in the paper.</jats:p>",

In recent decades, Bangladesh has been experiencing with loads of environmental issues, leading to persistent deteriorating environmental state. Consequently, the cause of ‘environment conservation’ has been felt to realize and the primary responsibility vests on the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Department of Environment. Accordingly, the country is in the constant process of internalizing the international environmental commitments into its national regulatory regime. Approximately two hundred national legal instruments are linked, to some extent, with the diverse aspects of environmental governance. Despite the specific responsibilities as allocated to the different governmental agencies through abundant environmental laws, their implementation status is far behind the international standards. Multiple and interconnected reasons fuel the environmental anarchies, obstructing to ensure the sound environmental management in Bangladesh and a threat to sustainable development. Most importantly, the non-integration of various environmental concerns into the developmental action agendas, at the planning, implementing and monitoring stage is the overarching cause. As ‘right to environment’ and ‘environmental justice’ depend on effective environmental legal and policy instruments, this article predominantly attempts to provide an overview of the statutory provisions, efficacy and implementation gaps in those environmental legislations of Bangladesh which are so far officially recognized as ‘core environmental laws’.\nDhaka University Law Journal, 2022, 33(1), 73-98</jats:p>"

Apart from their duty of safeguarding its borders, the Military personnel’s are also engaged in Search and Rescue operations (SAR) across the globe. The SAR is conducted both for Military personnel’s and Civilians. The search and rescue operations are carried on varied demographic regions ranging from Snow areas ( -500 C) to Deserts ( +550 C), also SAR is conducted during natural calamities like Earthquake, Floods, Tsunami, Avalanche, Landslides etc. But the main challenge for any Military personnel in SAR is to identify whom to rescue first. By saying this we mean that if the personnel has the knowledge about the Vitals of the individual he/she is rescuing then he/she will be able to assess the gravity of the situation through those vitals. Vitals like SP02, Blood Pressure, Pulse rate can predict the survivability factor of the individual. So it means that if out of three individuals the Vitals of 1st person are serious and Vitals of the 2nd Person are Normal and the Vitals of the 3rd Person are Null, then it can be predicted that the 1st person should be rescued first and the 2nd person be rescued Second and the 3rd person whose Vitals are Null can be presumed dead and shall be rescued at the last. Now the main challenge comes, and that is how to gather those Vitals. The answer to this problem has been suggested through the experiments conducted in this paper. This paper suggests for a wireless sensor wrist band supporting LoRaWAN protocol ( Long Range Wide Area Network). The LoRaWAN uses LoRa Radio to transmit in low power at long-range wide area network. The aforementioned wristband shall transmit data to the AWS Cloud using AWS IoT Core. The AWS Cloud will aggregate the data received from all the people wearing the wrist band. From the aforesaid data those persons can be easily identified whose Vitals are critical. This will prove to be a Life Saver for Armed forces.</jats:p>"

We derive an analytic explosion condition for spherically symmetric core-collapse supernovae. The derivation starts with the exact governing equations, considers the balance of integral forces, includes the important dimensionless parameters, and includes an explicit set of self-consistent approximations. The force explosion condition is $\\tilde{L}_\\nu \\tau _g - 0.06 \\tilde{\\kappa } \\gt 0.38$, and only depends upon two dimensionless parameters. The first compares the neutrino power deposited in the gain region with the accretion power, $\\tilde{L}_\\nu \\tau _g = L_{\\nu } \\tau _g R_{\\rm NS}/ (G \\dot{M} M_{\\rm NS})$. The second, $\\tilde{\\kappa } = \\kappa \\dot{M} / \\sqrt{G M_{\\rm NS} R_{\\rm NS}}$, parametrizes the neutrino optical depth in the accreted matter near the neutron star surface. Over the years, many have proposed approximate explosion conditions: the critical neutrino-luminosity, ante-sonic, and time-scale conditions. We are able to derive these other conditions from the force explosion condition, which unifies them all. Using numerical, steady-state and fully hydrodynamic solutions, we test the explosion condition. The success of these tests is promising in two ways. One, the force explosion condition helps to illuminate the underlying physics of explosions. Two, this condition may be a useful explosion diagnostic for more realistic, three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic core-collapse simulations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The circadian clock is conserved at both the level of transcriptional networks as well as core genes in plants, ensuring that biological processes are phased to the correct time of day. In the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the core circadian SHAQKYF-type-MYB (sMYB) genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and REVEILLE (RVE4) show genetic linkage with PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9) and PRR7, respectively. Leveraging chromosome-resolved plant genomes and syntenic ortholog analysis enabled tracing this genetic linkage back to Amborella trichopoda, a sister lineage to the angiosperm, and identifying an additional evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage in light signaling genes. The LHY/CCA1–PRR5/9, RVE4/8–PRR3/7, and PIF3–PHYA genetic linkages emerged in the bryophyte lineage and progressively moved within several genes of each other across an array of angiosperm families representing distinct whole-genome duplication and fractionation events. Soybean (Glycine max) maintained all but two genetic linkages, and expression analysis revealed the PIF3–PHYA linkage overlapping with the E4 maturity group locus was the only pair to robustly cycle with an evening phase, in contrast to the sMYB–PRR morning and midday phase. While most monocots maintain the genetic linkages, they have been lost in the economically important grasses (Poaceae), such as maize (Zea mays), where the genes have been fractionated to separate chromosomes and presence/absence variation results in the segregation of PRR7 paralogs across heterotic groups. The environmental robustness model is put forward, suggesting that evolutionarily conserved genetic linkages ensure superior microhabitat pollinator synchrony, while wide-hybrids or unlinking the genes, as seen in the grasses, result in heterosis, adaptation, and colonization of new ecological niches.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a dynamic modeling and stability analysis of sandwich beams with a partially filled magneto-rheological (MR) fluid core covered by laminated composite face sheets in the supersonic flow regime. The equations of motion of the resulting system are formulated using energy expressions and the Hamilton principle. Finite element modeling is employed to solve the equations with different boundary conditions. Initially, free vibration analysis is performed and the effect of the magnetic field on the natural frequencies of the beam is reported. In order to minimize the weight, the magnetorheological fluid is filled at selected cells in the core layer. The locations and sizes of these cells affect the modal characteristics and flutter stability of the beam. Also, the impact of core layer thickness under different boundary conditions is studied. Furthermore, the influence of magnetic field on the critical pressure in supersonic flow regime is investigated using first-order piston theory to identify the unstable regions. The results revealed that the size and position of the MR section in the beam and the applied magnetic field strength drastically influence the natural frequencies of partially treated magnetorheological laminated sandwich beams. The influencing variables are identified from main-effect plots using analysis of variance study.</jats:p>",

In addition, 5G uses a new frequency band, along with other new technologies that use much higher radio frequencies (28 GHz compared to 4G's 2.5 GHz) to transfer more data at higher speeds, with reduced downloads and less delay. This new mmWave interface allows more devices to be used within the same cluster; 4G can support about 4,000 devices per km2, while 5G will support about a million. This means that more streaming data from various video services, voice calls and other services will be transmitted on mobile networks.&#x0D;\nThe fifth generation mobile communication standard (5G) is a new stage in the development of technologies, which is designed to expand the possibilities of Internet access through radio access networks.</jats:p>",

We found that the number of resonance peaks in the absorption cross-section spectra depends on the number of metal-dielectric interfaces of the nanostructure, as predicted by plasmonic hybridization theory. Furthermore, the absorption cross-section spectra can be precisely controlled by changing the thickness of the shell and the dielectric constant of the medium.</jats:p>",

The article represents main types of sources using for investment and financing as well as the concept and measures to improve the investment attractiveness of an aviation company. In the current situation, the problem of mobilization and efficient use of investments is particularly important for the effective implementation of aviation companies' activities. Stimulation of investment activity, development of a clear investment strategy, defining main priorities in the mobilization of investment resources become the most important conditions for the sustainable growth and high-quality development of the aviation business. Among key incentives for financing of investment activities are the state guarantee system of investors’ rights, investment protection mechanism, and the provision of tax and customs benefits for investment organizations. Sources and methods of financing investment projects of aviation companies, in accordance with the experience of world business practice, in most cases, if not primarily, are determined by a set of factors. In addition, the level of effectiveness of sources of financing for an investment project depends to a greater extent on the competence of the investor or managers. This particularly affects competencies in the market sectors, as well as factors such as technological features and awareness of the properties of each investment financing tool.</jats:p>"

This enables the organic integration and development of all parts of the body, as well as the coordination of the upper and lower limbs. Core strength training is conducive to improving its physical strength in the youth group. Objective: To study the influence of core strength on adolescents’ motor skills and physical literacy. Methods: 40 teenagers were selected for group training. The experimental group performed core strength training, while the control group used traditional strength training. After the training period, the improvement of the physical fitness and motor skills of the two groups of volunteers was analyzed. Results: There were statistical differences between the two groups of young athletes in various technical and physical fitness indicators. Conclusion: Core strength training can improve the basic skills of young athletes, such as fast running, jumping and so on, but the effect of improving high physical fitness is not obvious. The experiment shows that a certain period of core strength training can improve their physical and motor skills. In future training for youth, core strength training should be advocated.

By studying memes, scholars understand these ‘units of culture’ as forms of participatory content that can fulfill political functions. To explore whether users ascribe memes a political role and consider them an alternative to or supplement of traditional political participation, this study provides a user-centered perspective focusing on core motives of meme use. Via a Delphi method interview approach, participants discuss uses and gratifications of memes in political contexts. A qualitative content analysis provides insight into the role and impact of memes in social movements and everyday politics. The findings show that users perceive memes as a tool for easy, effortless engagement in the public sphere driven by the interplay of self-expression, social identity, and entertainment motives. Participants also discuss potentials and limitations of memes in political contexts, concluding that political memes can only support other efforts. The study contributes to our understanding of memes from a psychological perspective and establishes a basis for further research on deliberative political practices from a user perspective.</jats:p>"

This activity is generally anticipated by the internal and external cues from the environment. In circadian rhythm of our body is regulated by a transcriptional –translational Auto-regulatory loop which leads to the molecular oscillations of our “core clock genes” at a specific cellular level. In the many mammalian and animal models, the master pacemaker is in the hypothalamus at the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that can regulate downstream oscillations in the peripheral tissues of the brain. The core clock genes are self- sustained and cell autonomous not only on the pace maker but also on the other dissociated cultured cells and peripheral tissues. Here we can review the general mechanisms involved in the clock genes that is responsible for the circadian rhythmicity in epileptic syndromes and these findings can elucidate the cell specific expression of the clock genes in different syndromes. In the recent past there has been considerable amount of progress in elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that is involved in understand the core clock gene expression and the circadian rhythms effects on epileptic syndromes. However, there is very little understanding on how these two mechanisms interact to cause a core clock genes disruptions plays an important role. Recent studies in several animal models have shown the effects of time of the day on the neurophysiology and path-physiology in the epileptic syndrome. Together, these evidences from the past suggest that there can be a common mechanism underlying the circadian rhythmicity and epileptogenesis mechanism.</jats:p>",

The 5G core implements the newly defined 3GPP network ar- chitecture enabling faster connectivity, low latency, higher bit rates and network reliability. The full potential of this set of networks will support a set of critical Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial use cases. Nevertheless, several compo- nents and interfaces of the Next-Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) have proven to be vulnerable to attacks that can potentially obstruct the net- work’s capability to provide reliable end-to-end communication services. Various inherent security flaws and protocol-specific weaknesses have also been identified within the 5G core itself. However, little to no research has gone into testing and exposing said core-related weaknesses, contrary to those concerning the NG-RAN. In this paper, we investigate, describe, develop, implement and finally test a set of attacks on the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) inside the 5G core. We find that, by transmitting unauthorised session control packets, we were able to disrupt established 5G tunnels without disrupting subscribers’ connectivity to the NG-RAN, thus hindering the detection of said attacks. We evaluate the identi- fied PFCP attacks in a drone-based scenario involving 5G tunnelling between two swarms.</jats:p>"

In combination, oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios also provide information on sea surface temperature at the oceanic moisture source locations where polar precipitation originates. Temperature reconstructions obtained from ice-core records generally rely on linear approximations of the relationships among local temperature, source temperature, and water-isotope values. However, there are important nonlinearities that significantly affect such reconstructions, particularly for source region temperatures. Here, we describe a relatively simple water-isotope distillation model and a novel temperature reconstruction method that accounts for these nonlinearities. Further, we examine in detail many of the parameters, assumptions, and uncertainties that underlie water-isotope distillation models and their influence on these temperature reconstructions. We provide new reconstructions of absolute surface temperature, condensation temperature, and source region evaporation temperature for all long Antarctic ice-core records for which the necessary data are available. These reconstructions differ from previous estimates due to both our new model and reconstruction technique, the influence of which is investigated directly. We also provide thorough uncertainty estimates for all temperature histories. Our reconstructions constrain the pattern and magnitude of polar amplification in the past and reveal asymmetries in the temperature histories of East and West Antarctica.\n                    </jats:p>"

Charges are generated using an electron beam energy of 5 keV in the perpendicular configuration and collected by a nanoscale electrode which establishes a nanojunction with the Si sample. The surface recombination velocity is equal to zero. The Ge–Si core–shell is assumed to exhibit type II confinement of band edge alignment in which holes are trapped inside the core and electrons inside the shell. The collection and trapping probabilities of a created carrier, when it emerges at the sample surface, are controlled by its electric nature (hole or electron), by distances separating it from the core–shell nanocrystal and from the nanoelectrode. Carrier probabilities and collection are also controlled by opening angles allowing the emerged charge to “see” the core–shell nanocrystal and the nanoelectrode. Results show that the electron trapping is distance independent, and it does not affect the induced current, while the hole collection and trapping processes depend on each other up to a threshold distance of ∼200 nm. Beyond this distance, no modification is observed either in the induced current, suggesting that the nanocrystal can no longer be detected, or in the hole capture process, suggesting a no potential overlapping between the nanocrystal and the nanoelectrode.</jats:p>",

For targeted searches of GWs from CCSNe, optical observations can be used to increase the sensitivity of the search by restricting the relevant time interval, defined here as the GW search window (GSW). The extent of the GSW is a critical factor in determining the achievable false alarm probability for a triggered CCSN search. The ability to constrain the GSW from optical observations depends on how early a CCSN is detected, as well as the ability to model the early optical emission. Here we present several approaches to constrain the GSW, ranging in complexity from model-independent analytical fits of the early light curve, model-dependent fits of the rising or entire light curve, and a new data-driven approach using existing well-sampled CCSN light curves from Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We use these approaches to determine the time of core-collapse and its associated uncertainty (i.e., the GSW). We apply our methods to two Type II SNe that occurred during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3: SN 2019fcn and SN 2019ejj (both in the same galaxy at <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = 15.7 Mpc). Our approach shortens the duration of the GSW and improves the robustness of the GSW compared to the techniques used in past GW CCSN searches.</jats:p>",

This is because such materials facilitate to harness the localized surface plasmon resonant absorption of plasmonic metal nanoparticles tunable across the entire ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV–vis–NIR) region, for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of surrounding semiconductors via multiple energy and charge carrier flow channels. Herein, the recent synthetic progresses achieved in wet chemical preparation of plasmonic metal@semiconductor core–shell photocatalysts are outlined. Tentatively, the reported synthetic approaches are classified into three major groups including the epitaxial seeded growth, the kinetically overdriven nonepitaxial seeded growth, and the cation exchange‐facilitated (CEf) nonepitaxial growth dictated by chemical thermodynamics. Special focuses are laid on elucidating the fundamental correlation of the synthetic mechanism with the crystallographic and physical properties of the resultant nanostructures that strongly dominate the synergistic coupling efficiency between plasmonic metal and semiconductor. Of these, the promise of CEf nonepitaxy in curbing the formation of interfacial defect states and promoting extraction of plasmonic hot carriers from the large lattice‐mismatched hybrid photocatalysts is detailedly elaborated. A comprehensive understanding in this scope is of significance for rationally architecting the plasmonic metal@semiconductor core–shell nanostructures toward disclosing fascinating horizons in photocatalytic solar‐to‐fuel conversion.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Additionally, karst features in core, such as vugs and small cavities, are seldom characterized in a quantitative way or are overlooked. We introduce a new methodology, called the non-matrix quick pass (NMQP), which allows for the collection of non-matrix features in a rapid yet quantitative fashion at a rate of 12 to 20 m of core per hour. The NMQP methodology offers enough vertical resolution so that observations can be integrated with other wellbore data types (e.g., wireline logs, well tests, and production logs).

The main safety feature is based on integral primary circuit configuration, bringing together compact design of the reactor core (121 fuel assembly), control rod drive mechanism (CRDM), 8 primary heat exchangers (PHE), 4 passive decay heat removal systems (DHRS), 8 pumps, and other integral components. A high power density core based on silicide fuel and APMT (FeCrAl) stainless steel cladding is selected to achieve a high thermal power. Initial representative first core nuclear design is proposed by Westinghouse. Full core 3D depletion calculation was performed using PARCS code. The cross section library is prepared using FA2D code and verified using Polaris sequence from SCALE 6.2 beta5. The axial and radial reflectors are assumed to be homogeneous water-APMT mixtures. The axial reflectors are both assumed to be 12 inch (30.48 cm) sections composed of 30% APMT steel by volume. The radial reflector is assumed to be 90% APMT steel by volume. The reflector constants were calculated using SCALE TRITON sequence. The thermal hydraulic part of the model is based on COBRA subchannel code coupled to PARCS code. Initial depletion calculation is based on one thermal hydraulics channel per fuel assembly approach. The hot fuel assembly is determined using separate pin-by-pin COBRA subchannel model and pin power reconstruction data from PARCS. The objective of the paper is demonstration of LWR design methodology applicability to silicide fuel and identification of possible improvements in the first core design.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Liner shipping, which offers the door-to-door transportation service, has pre-determined departure, arrival and transfer ports and carries cargo mainly through container ships, has been playing a key role in the global cargo transportation industry for more than 60 years and is still growing rapidly. Therefore, understanding of the relationship between service quality, customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions in liner shipping is of critical importance for global competition. From this standpoint, this study aims to determine whether customer satisfaction creates an alternative effect through its mediating effect on the causal relationship between core service quality and customers’ behavioral intentions in liner shipping sector. To do so, it obtains data through survey from forwarder companies that operate in Turkey and analyzes the obtained data using SPSS v22 and AMOS v22 statistical package software. This study concludes that core service quality has a positive effect on customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions, and that customer satisfaction has a mediating effect on the relationship between core service quality and behavioral intentions. It reveals that core service quality and customer satisfaction are important constructs for future behavioral intentions. In conclusion, this study suggests that business managers in liner shipping sector need to incorporate core services that will positively affect customer satisfaction in their marketing policies, and to engage in managerial activities that enhance customer satisfaction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a strong propensity in the western philosophical tradition to conflate the mind and the conscious self. This tendency is demonstrated in the structure of Descartes’ Meditations, which, despite the extensive criticism it has received over the years, still serves as the most comprehensive and well-articulated statement of the assumptions underpinning the contemporary western conception of mind. Descartes thinks of the mind and self as being one by unhesitatingly identifying the referent of the indexical term “I” with the res cogitans, the thinking substance. Descartes’ well-known dualism between mind and matter is the result of the fact that thinking substance is, of course, metaphysically independent of extended material. Descartes also believes that conscious thought and subjective experience are unquestionably unqualified components of mental substance, and this specific method of classification has infused our conceptual legacy so thoroughly that the boundary he draws seems nearly self-evident. Thoughts and subjective presentations lie on the nonmaterial side of the dividing line, if a dualism with matter is to be entertained. I will provide a general summary of the Indian stance in this essay, as well as examine some of the alternative dualism’s theoretical ramifications and compare them critically to certain contemporary applications of the Cartesian model. The paper’s central thesis is that the traditional Indian distinction between pure consciousness and matter has special philosophical significance, particularly in light of the ongoing debate over the connection between consciousness and mental representation as well as the effort to provide a computational and/or naturalistic account of mentality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of machine learning has made a revolution in various applications such as object detection, image/video recognition, and semantic segmentation. Neural networks, a class of machine learning, play a crucial role in this process because of their remarkable improvement over traditional algorithms. However, neural networks are now going deeper and cost a significant amount of computation operations. Therefore they usually work ineffectively in edge devices that have limited resources and low performance. In this paper, we research a solution to accelerate the neural network inference phase using FPGA-based platforms. We analyze neural network models, their mathematical operations, and the inference phase in various platforms. We also profile the characteristics that affect the performance of neural network inference. Based on the analysis, we propose an architecture to accelerate the convolution operation used in most neural networks and takes up most of the computations in networks in terms of parallelism, data reuse, and memory management. We conduct different experiments to validate the FPGA-based convolution core architecture as well as to compare performance. Experimental results show that the core is platform-independent. The core outperforms a quad-core ARM processor functioning at 1.2 GHz and a 6-core Intel CPU with speed-ups of up to 15.69× and 2.78×, respectively</jats:p>"

NEK have analyzed the response to the severe accidents, and based on the results of this analysis, proposed the measures to be implemented in the shortest possible time. In response to SNSA request NEK has developed the Safety Upgrade Program (SUP) which contains a comprehensive set of measures for plant safety improvements. SUP Phase 1 has been implemented during the Outage 2013. This paper presents the work done on the evaluation of impact of plant modifications planned for implementation in Phases 2 and 3 of NEK Safety Upgrade Program on the quantitative figure of merit for the plant risk significance – total core damage frequency (CDF). A significance of the most valuable measures in terms of contribution to the CDF reduction was determined and a new fractional contribution of initiators categories was obtained. The quantification of total CDF was made by employment of RiskSpectrum PSA code and running a predefined set of analytical cases for all initiator categories covered by the scope of NEK PSA model. The basis for analysis was NEK’s most recent at-power PSA model which reflects the plant status with plant modernization implemented in SUP Phase 1. The analysis was done in two steps. In the first step plant modifications planned for SUP Phase 2 were addressed and in the second step plant modernization measures and upgrades planned in SUP Phase 3 were modeled in addition to those already modelled in the first step.</jats:p>"

The elastomeric core served as the stretchable spring and the CNTYs braiding, with shape changing capabilities, as the conductive shell. A variety of samples were produced having various braiding angles on an elastomeric core and subsequently loaded in tension, and their stress–strain behavior was characterized. The model predicts the stress–strain behavior of the composite as a function of the initial braiding angle and the number of pitches. The innovative aspect was included in the model related to the friction between the braid and the core. Results indicated good agreement between the theoretical simulations and the experimental results which was not discussed in previous studies. Since the rate of the diameter decrease of the CNTYs braid was higher than that of the elastomeric core diameter, squeezing out of the core through the braid inter yarn space occurred. This limited the maximum potential extension of the braid. Thus, a critical strain was defined where the braid came into contact with the core. The addition of the friction stresses made a significant contribution to the overall stresses and the accuracy of the theoretical simulation, and its agreement with the experimental results. An apparent friction coefficient was proposed to account for the effect of the elastomer core/braid interactive restriction and squeezing out of the elastomer through the braiding, as observed in experimental results. As the CNTYs are conductive, a stretchable conductive composite was obtained having a resistivity of 9.05 × 10<jats:sup>–4</jats:sup> Ohm*cm, which remained constant throughout the tensile loading until failure and under cyclic loading.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, intensive studies have focused on FG sandwich plates to investigate their mechanical behaviors. However, these mechanical behaviors are still in need of further investigation, particularly with respect to the major parameters. In this context, this paper intends to parametrically investigate the free-vibration behavior of the FG sandwich plate with a homogeneous core by developing a reliable and effective numerical method. This numerical method was based on hierarchical models, developed from the spectral model accuracy, and the 2-D natural element method (NEM). The hierarchical models were derived from the 3-D elasticity and the NEM was characterized by high smooth interpolation functions. From the verification experiments, the proposed method shows a good agreement with the reference and a uniform convergence to the 3-D elasticity. The free vibration characteristics of FG sandwich plates with a homogeneous core were investigated using the proposed numerical method. It was found that the calibrated fundamental frequency was significantly influenced by the type of material composing the core, the volume fraction index, the relative thickness and position of core layer, and the plate aspect ratio.</jats:p>"

This framework builds on the centre–periphery financial model of uneven regional credit and economic growth, originally proposed by Victoria Chick and Sheila Dow in 1988. In the era of deregulated financial flows and market-based credit, the core–periphery relationship has become a three-level hierarchical system, in which Latin American nations occupy a subordinate place. The key drivers of this structural shift within these nations have been the liberalisation of cross-border financial flows and investment, the deregulation of banking and the adoption of private pension systems. These drivers’ adoption can be traced to both push and pull factors: specifically, recurrent financial crises requiring external intervention (especially by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)), and the possibility of engaging with the financial instruments and megabanks driving the globalisation of finance. Participating in this hierarchical system has required importing elements of the financial architecture that evolved in the 1980s in advanced economies and has also arguably deepened this region’s financial dependency and vulnerability.</jats:p>",

For the 300 MWel class design, complete core meltdown may need to be considered in case of a severe accident. This study proposes the new in-vessel retention (IVR) concept of the SMR class super FR (super FR-IVR), which can avoid recriticality even if the whole core relocates to the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). The core characteristics with a given set of design specifications and criteria are evaluated based on fully coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics core burnup calculations. The debris criticality is evaluated based on Monte Carlo based method to consider the RPV lower plenum and debris configurations. The relationships between the 300 MWel class core design with the inner vessel diameter of 2.32 m and the IVR design are revealed. By reducing the operation cycle length from 720 days to 360 days and increasing the core inlet temperature from 280 °C to 370 °C, the required IVR submergence level could be reduced from 2.18 m to 1.38 m, assuming that the debris bed (melt pool) is homogeneous. However, when fully stratified debris configurations are assumed, the required disperser height and the corresponding IVR submergence level may increase to about 2.70 m.</jats:p>",

Mainstreaming these ecosystem services into policy and decision-making requires accurate information at the local level. This paper aims to quantify provisioning and regulating freshwater ecosystem services potential in the Kangchenjunga Landscape using a hydro-ecological model. This study is the first to use the J2000 hydrological model to estimate annual and seasonal WES. The model output was validated against snow-cover and river discharge, after conducting a sensitivity analysis of the input parameter. High precipitation and low evapotranspiration resulted in rich water availability in the landscape. It was found that the precipitation amount in the landscape is highly seasonal, resulting in high variation in water availability. Snowfall, accounting for 4% of the total precipitation still plays an important role in regulating water resources. Nearly 100% of the discharge during the dry period originates from groundwater and melt runoff. This study highlights the importance of the presence of snow and glacier to sustain the ecosystem in the landscape. This model-derived information could further be used for decision-making and evaluating the impact of climatic and land use changes.</jats:p>",

However, there is still no non-invasive method to sense core body temperature. This study proposed an algorithm that estimates core body temperature based on electrocardiogram signals. A total of 12 healthy men (mean age ± SD = 39.6 ± 13.4) performed an ergometric exercise load test under two conditions of exercise load in an environmental chamber adjusted to a temperature of 35°C and humidity of 50%. Vital sensing data such as electrocardiograms, core body temperatures, and body surface temperatures were continuously measured, and physical data such as body weight were obtained from participants pre- and post-experiment. According to basic physiological knowledge, heart rate and body temperature are closely related. We analyzed the relationship between core body temperature and several indexes obtained from electrocardiograms and found that the amount of change in core body temperature had a strong relationship with analyzed data from electrocardiograms. Based on these findings, we developed the amount of change in core body temperature estimation model using multiple regression analysis including the Poincaré plot index of the ECG R-R interval. The estimation model showed an average estimation error of -0.007°C (average error rate = -0.02%) and an error range of 0.457–0.445°C. It is suggested that continuous core body temperature change can be estimated using electrocardiogram signals regardless of individual characteristics such as age and physique. Based on this applicable estimation model, we plan to enhance estimation accuracy and further verify efficacy by considering clothing and environmental conditions.</jats:p>"

The subjects were divided into two different groups as the experimental group (n=9, age: 19.41±2.48) and the control group (n=9, age: 21.12±2.32). The control group continued their normal volleyball training. In the experimental group, in addition to volleyball training, a core strength training program was applied 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Core exercises are known as Mountain Climbers, Bicycle Crunch, Leg Raises, Russian Twist, Side Plank, Bridge, Abdominal Crunch, Jack Knife, Superman, Plank Jack were performed on the experimental group. Static balance scores were measured with the Biodex Balance System balance test device. A speed test (30 m) was applied. Anaerobic power was measured with the vertical jump test. Independent Samples T-Test was used for statistical evaluation between the experimental and control groups. Paired Samples T-Test was used for in-group comparisons. After the core training program was applied to the experimental group, significance was determined in the speed, anaerobic power and static balance scores (p&amp;lt;0.05).

Modal analysis techniques have gained great interest due to their ability to identify patterns in the data and extract valuable information about the system being considered. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) relies on elements of the Koopman approximation theory to compute a set of modes, each associated with a fixed oscillation frequency and a decay/growth rate. Extracting these details from large datasets can be computationally expensive due to the need to implement singular value decomposition of the input data matrix. Sketching algorithms have become popular in numerical linear algebra where statistical theoretic approaches are utilized to reduce the cost of major operations. A sketch of a matrix is another matrix, which is significantly smaller, but still sufficiently approximates the original system. We put forth an efficient DMD framework, SketchyDMD, based on a core sketching algorithm that captures information about the range and corange (their mutual relationship) of input data. The proposed sketching-based framework can accelerate various portions of the DMD routines, compared to classical methods that operate directly on the raw input data. We conduct numerical experiments using the spherical shallow water equations as a prototypical model in the context of geophysical flows. We show that the proposed SketchyDMD is superior to existing randomized DMD methods that are based on capturing only the range of the input data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Groundnut is a very important crop in the West and Central Africa (WCA) region, accounting for almost 70% of Africa’s groundnut production in 2019. Despite its economic importance, the crop’s yield is still low. For a high yield and profitable economic returns, optimal plant density is a fundamental crop management practice. Plant density experiments were conducted at the ICRISAT-Mali research station between 2016 and 2021 over the main rainy and dry seasons to determine the optimum density for maximum groundnut yield and economic benefits. The treatments contained row spacing of 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, 60 cm, 70 cm, 80 cm, 90 cm, and 100 cm, with intra-row spacing of 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm. Results showed that when plant density was increased, dry pod yield, production value, and net economic benefit per hectare increased in a no moisture stress scenario. During the rainy season, the 40 cm × 10 cm spacing gave the highest dry pod yield (1693 kg), production value ($891.6), and net benefit ($403.5) per hectare. The highest dry pod yield (3703 kg), production value ($2173), and net benefit ($1510.2) per hectare were obtained from 30 cm × 10 cm spacing during the dry season. The number of pods per plant and 100 SW increased with lower plant densities. Therefore, it is recommended to increase plant density to at least 222,000 plants per hectare in the Sudan Savannah agroecology of WCA.</jats:p>"

The calculations are performed in three steps: (a) Koopmans’ theorem, where the orbitals of the electronic ground state are used unchanged also for the ions, (b) Hartree–Fock or self consistent field (SCF) approximation in which the orbitals are allowed to relax after 1s ionization (ΔSCF), (c) dynamic correlation effects on top of SCF. For open-shell molecules 1s ionization leads to ions in several spin states, mostly to a pair of a triplet and a singlet state. In several cases one or both of these ionic states are only poorly described by a single-reference SCF wavefunction, therefore a multi-reference complete active space self consistent field (CAS-SCF) wavefunction is used instead. The correlation effects are evaluated by means of our multi-reference coupled electron pair approximation program. The accuracy of the calculated CEBEs is in the order of 0.1–0.4 eV. This is in agreement with experimental results for NO and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. But there exist only very few gas phase data for CEBEs of open-shell molecules.</jats:p>",

In the mock-up reactor, the major flow path of the reactor is linearly scaled except for the core region which is replaced by 57 dummy fuel assemblies. In addition, the experiment measures core inlet flow rates by a specially designed turbine installed in each dummy fuel assembly. In the experiment, both four-loop balanced and unbalanced operating conditions are tested. The experimental results show that the flow in the major flow path of the mock-up reactor has entered the self-modeling zone and the flow field characteristics are the same as the prototype. The core inlet flow rates of different tests show similar distributions, which all meet the hydraulic performance requirements. Moreover, the effect of impeller rotation on the flow field of the core inlet has also been studied. The study indicates that the flow distribution is almost unaffected by the swirl flow.</jats:p>"

Kök değerlerin aktarımında Türkçe ders kitaplarında yer alan metinlerin, özellikle de öyküleyici metinlerin önemi büyüktür. Buradan hareketle araştırmanın amacı ortaokul Türkçe ders kitaplarındaki öyküleyici metinlerin kök değerleri aktarma açısından durumunu ortaya koymaktır. Araştırma, nitel araştırma olarak planlanmıştır. Araştırmada doküman analizi kullanılmıştır. Araştırmanın inceleme nesnesini 2021-2022 eğitim öğretim yılında okutulan ortaokul Türkçe ders kitaplarının öyküleyici metinleri ve etkinlikleri oluşturmaktadır. Bu bağlamda 8 Türkçe ders kitabında yer alan 28’i dinleme/izleme, 74’ü okuma metni olmak üzere toplamda 102 metin incelenmiştir. İnceleme kapsamında Türkçe Dersi Öğretim Programı (2019)’nda yer verilen 10 kök değer incelenen öyküleyici metinlerde ve bu metinlerin etkinliklerinde tespit edilmiştir. Verilerin çözümlenmesinde içerik çözümleme tekniklerinden kategorisel çözümleme kullanılmıştır. İçerik analizine tabi tutulan veriler, bulgularda tablolar hâlinde frekans verilerek sunulmuştur. Tüm sınıf düzeylerindeki ders kitaplarının öyküleyici metinlerinde yer alan kök değerlerin okuma metinlerine, okuma metinlerinin etkinliklerine, dinleme/izleme metinlerine ve dinleme/izleme metinlerinin etkinliklerine dağılımları incelendiğinde, kök değerlerde homojen bir dağılımın bulunmadığı sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Değerlerin dağılımında bir denge bulunmamaktadır. Ayrıca öyküleyici metinlerinde en çok kök değerin kullanıldığı ders kitabı “Ortaokul Türkçe 5. Sınıf Ders Kitabı”dır. Sınıf düzeyi arttıkça öyküleyici metinlerde kullanılan kök değerlerin sayısında da azalma olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Ders kitaplarının öyküleyici metinlerinde en sık yer verilen kök değerler yardımlaşma ve sevgi değerleriyken en az yer verilen kök değerler ise adalet ve sabırdır. Ayrıca vatanseverlik, adalet, dürüstlük, öz denetim, sorumluluk, dostluk kök değerlerinin bazı kitapların öyküleyici metinlerinde hiç yer almadığı da tespit edilmiştir.

Indeed, it allows the rapid acquisition of a large amount of data that are spatialized on the studied object with a low-cost, compact, and automatable sensor. This practical article aims to present the current state of knowledge on the use of hyperspectral imaging for sediment core analysis (core logging). To use the full potential of this type of sensor, many points must be considered and will be discussed to obtain reliable and quality data to extract many environmental properties of sediment cores. Hyperspectral imaging is used in many fields (e.g., remote sensing, geosciences and artificial intelligence) and offers many possibilities. The applications of the literature will be reviewed under five themes: lake and water body trophic status, source-to-sink approaches, organic matter and mineralogy studies, and sedimentary deposit characterization. Afterward, discussions will be focused on a multisensor core logger, data management, integrated use of these data for the selection of sample areas, and other opportunities. Through this practical article, we emphasize that hyperspectral imaging applied to sediment cores is still an emerging tool and shows many possibilities for refining the understanding of environmental processes.</jats:p>"

One group cross section was generated using the WIMS-ANL. For core lifetime analysis, these group cross sections were employed in the REBUS-ANL programme. A simple reactivity rundown was performed to estimate the core lifetime for HEU and LEU cores at two power levels using the REBUS-ANL code (full and half power). The lifetime of the LEU core was predicted to be approximately 11.91 percent longer than that of the HEU core at full power and 11.81 percent at half power based on the results obtained. This is in good agreement with the value 11 percent reported in the literature, indicating that the selected LEU core can be operated for a longer period of time than the HEU core.</jats:p>"

Results show that multiple same-level and multi-level telescoping nests were able to capture various weather events in greater details by resolving smaller-scale flow structures. Two-way updates do not introduce numerical errors in their corresponding parent grids where the nests are located. The cases of Hurricane Laura's landfall and an atmospheric river in California were found to be more intense with increased levels of telescoping nesting. All nested grids run concurrently, and adding additional nests with computer cores to a setup does not degrade the computational performance nor increase the simulation run time if the cores are optimally distributed among the grids.\n                    </jats:p>"

In order to study the different ice-shedding forms of the dynamic response of this distribution system, the author established a conductor-insulator and pole-conductor system with two finite element models to study the linear section and corner section of the line in different forms of ice-shedding and ice-shedding rate under the influence of the line ice-shedding response degree. The results show that the pole-conductor model is a good model for the design of distribution lines with carbon fiber cores. The results also show that the ice jump height of the pole-conductor model is smaller than that of the conductor-insulator model, which is related to the coupling relationship between the composite pole and aluminum conductor composite core. The stay wire of the corner pole will absorb most of the energy generated by ice-shedding. In addition, when non-uniform ice-shedding, the line vibration is more violent, the jump height is higher, and the maximum axial force generated after ice-shedding is greater, which has certain safety risks.</jats:p>",

In this work, we give constraints on the explosion timescale based on <jats:sup>56</jats:sup>Ni synthesized by supernova explosions. First, we systematically analyze multiband light curves of 82 stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) to obtain bolometric light curves, which is among the largest samples of the bolometric light curves of SESNe derived from the multiband spectral energy distribution. We measure the decline timescale and the peak luminosity of the light curves and estimate the ejecta mass (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>ej</jats:sub>) and <jats:sup>56</jats:sup>Ni mass (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>Ni</jats:sub>) to connect the observed properties with the explosion physics.

The results show that Ag doping does not change the crystallinity of ZnO, but broaden its photo-response property. The coating of N doped carbon can improve the specific surface area of photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of all samples was evaluated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) solution under UV light irradiation for 25 min. Ag/ZnO@N-carbon exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity for degradation of RhB with a degradation of 98.65%. Furthermore, Ag/ZnO@N-carbon also has high stability.

It is necessary to monitor the neutron flux and control the chain reaction, therefore, the ex-core neutron flux measurement is one of the main safety and control systems. The main advantage of this arrangement of detectors is a fast response to neutron flux change, which determines the reactor power change. Regarding to the new reactor concepts, it is important to deal with improved detection systems suitable for these reactors. Many of the modern reactor concepts are based on a graphite moderator or reflector, which is also the case of the TEPLATOR. The TEPLATOR is a solution of a district heating system based on heavy water as a moderator and graphite as a reflector. The TEPLATOR is designed to use irradiated fuel from the commercial pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor, which has low to intermediate burnup. This work is focused on the verification of the possible use of the special neutron measuring system placed in the graphite reflector. The Monte Carlo code serpent was used for the calculations performed in this work.</jats:p>",

We discuss cellular, structural, functional, and gene expression criteria by which the microglial assembly of dense-core plaques in the Alzheimer’s brain parallels the construction of granulomas by macrophages in other settings. We compare the genesis of these plaques to the macrophage assembly of mycobacterial granulomas, the defining histopathological features of tuberculosis.

In this contribution, I use three significant historical cases of failure (ca. 1890, 1960, 2006), and a closer look at the emergence of the concept around 1860/70, to elucidate core assumptions related to the specific practices of animal-human knowledge transfer, and to analyze the explanations provided by historical actors after each of the failures. Based on these examples, I argue that the epistemological status of the animal model changed from that of a helpful methodological tool for addressing specific questions, but with precarious validity, to an obligatory method for the production of strong knowledge on human diseases. As a result, there now exists a culture of biomedical research in human disease that, for more than a century, has taken the value of this methodological tool as self-evident, and more or less beyond question.</jats:p>",

Digital to analog converters is a leading part of these converters, which are widely used in most audio and video circuits. In this thesis, we have proposed a 4-bit 1GS/s DAC for CUWB-IR usage. To enhance the above performance with superior speed and the need for linearity, every significant block containing the convenient sources, current switches, and deglitcher were designed optimally and a new DAC converter circuit was developed which improves the linearity. The designed DAC was performed using a commercial 130 nm CMOS process. DAC INL/DNL≤0.22LSB features more than high Nyquist bandwidth at extremely low power losses of 0.45 mW.

Structural behavior of studied walls in terms of; first crack load, ultimate load, service load ,ductility ratio and energy absorption were investigated in addition to crack pattern and mode of failure for all tested specimens. Theoretical study was conducted by finite element software (ABAQUS) to evaluate the experimental results and this theoretical study gave good results comparing with the experimental results. This study revealed that the ultimate load for control (CO) specimen was more than the ultimate load for the other specimens that reinforced with welded wire mesh (W), expanded metal mesh (EX) and tenax SS30 mesh (TE). In addition, using the ultimate load for one layer of expanded steel mesh (EX1) was greater than the ultimate load for specimens that reinforced with one layer of welded wire mesh (W1) and one layer tenax mesh (TE1), as well using two layers of expanded steel mesh (EX2) was greater than specimens that reinforced with two layers of welded wire mesh (W2) and two layers of tenax mesh (TE2).

Ice-core data have become central to our understanding of climate change in the past, and to assessments of possible future climate change. Hot-water ice-coring drills are often used to recover ice-core samples from a desirable depth in conjunction with a full-scaled hot-water drilling systems. However, the recovered cores had the varying quality. In hot-water ice-coring drilling, many small nozzles are used to spray water out and melt out a cylindrical ice. Parameters of the nozzle, which mainly includes angle, diameter and quantity, are the most critical part of the drilling system. To improve the ice-core quality in hot-water ice-coring drilling, the influence mechanism of annular hot-water jets formed by nozzle with different parameters on ice-core quality was studied. Heat transfer law of annular jet on the ice-core was studied using the numerical simulation. Totally nine kinds of nozzle with different parameters were designed by using the orthogonal design method and the corresponding calculation domain model of ice was established. The ANSYS FLUENT software was used to analyze the heat flow field, variation trend of heat transfer to the ice-core with different nozzle parameters was researched. The result indicated that the heat transfer of hot water to ice core increased with the larger nozzle diameter while decreasing with the increase of nozzle quantity and nozzle angle. The result can help to give a reference for the design of hot-water ice-coring drill head used in the polar regions.</jats:p>",

An employment pool of skilled applicants who understand agriculture as a whole and comprehend applied concepts of STEM is needed, especially now as the world has stepped into an era of scientific and precision-based agriculture. School-based agricultural education (SBAE) provides opportunities to facilitate the application of core scientific ideas in real-world settings, as many agricultural contexts and problems typically involve numerous disciplines. This study analyzed the effects of purposeful science illumination on students' content knowledge of scientific core ideas and technical floriculture concepts. Students who received a specialized science illuminated curriculum displayed higher achievement on core science and technical floriculture content than their peers who received the standard curriculum. Further, students whose teachers received specialized training in STEM illumination outperformed the other two groups of students in both scientific core ideas and technical floriculture concepts. It is recommended that teachers seek both content-specific professional development opportunities and specialized curricula. Lastly, focus should be placed on methods of instruction to allow for students to engage with core scientific ideas within the context of agriculture.</jats:p>"

We investigate the spatial distributions of the O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni abundances in the intracluster medium with CCD detectors, and those of N, O, Ne, Mg, Fe, and Ni with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). The abundances of most of the elements show a sharp drop within the central 18 arcsec, although different detectors and atomic codes give significantly different values. The abundance ratios of the above elements, including Ne/Fe with RGS, show relatively flat radial distributions. In the innermost regions with the dominant Fe–L lines, the measurements of the absolute abundances are challenging. For example, AtomDB and SPEXACT give Fe = 0.5 and 1.4 solar, respectively, for the spectra from the innermost region. These results suggest some systematic uncertainties in the atomic data and response matrices at least partly cause the abundance drop rather than the metal depletion into the cold dust. Except for super-solar N/Fe and Ni/Fe, sub-solar Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe, the abundance pattern agrees with the solar composition. The entire pattern is challenging to reproduce with the latest supernova nucleosynthesis models. Observed super-solar N/O and comparable Mg abundance to stellar metallicity profiles imply that the mass-loss winds dominate the intracluster medium in the brightest cluster galaxy. The solar Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe ratios indicate a significant contribution of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions of Type Ia supernovae.</jats:p>",

Post operative morbidity reporting following surgery for paediatric brain tumours is poor due to the lack of a common language when reporting harms. One solution is to develop a core adverse outcome set to stipulate the minimum post operative harms that should be reported. The COMBAT (Core post operative morbidity set for paediatric brain tumours) Project will develop a core adverse outcome set that can be applied to post operative paediatric brain tumour patients to harmonise how harms are measured and reported, enabling comparison between different trials, studies and clinical services. We aim to generate interest in the COMBAT Project and invite collaboration with healthcare professionals and researchers experienced in paediatric neuro oncology surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS : A systematic review will identify harms reported in post operative paediatric brain tumour patients and how they are measured. We will engage with national and international stakeholders including healthcare professionals, researchers, patients and their carers. Qualitative interviews with patients and carers will identify any important harms not extracted in the systematic review. A Delphi survey will be created from the harms identified. An international consensus meeting will be held to finalise the core adverse outcomes set. The final core adverse outcome set will be published and disseminated to encourage uptake. DISCUSSION: There is a clear need for a common language to harmonise measurement and reporting of harms following surgery for paediatric brain tumour patients. The core adverse outcome set will be developed with collaboration with key stakeholder groups to ensure it is representative. It will be used to standardise surgical morbidity outcome measurement and reporting in trials, studies and clinical practice and will inform future research in this field.</jats:p>",

When considering concentrating solar power (CSP) coupled with an sCO2 power block and sensible thermal storage, the technology presents a clean source for utility-scale power generation to support baseload or peak-load electrical demand. However, the LCOE of the technology is still considered higher than the competing technologies and should be reduced to better compete in the market; 2030 targets for dispatchable solar plants are 5¢/kWh for baseload CPS and 10¢/kWh for peaker plants, as set by the United States Department of Energy. In response to this need, this study is targeting improvements in the power cycle pre-cooler to reduce power block contribution to LCOE.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This study considers a dry cooler, as CSP plants are sensitive to water consumption because many installations are slated for remote or arid locations where solar irradiance is very high, but water is scarce. Furthermore, the power block footprint for an sCO2 system is quite compact, especially as compared to a steam cycle. Therefore, there is interest in installing a more compact dry cooler that is proportional to the reduced footprint sCO2 power block, while conventional dry coolers are an order of magnitude larger. The competing goals of size, performance, and cost were considered in this study to develop a compact dry cooler that can easily be packaged with the power block, significantly reducing the installation and transport cost compared to the current state of the art, while maintaining or improving upon the heat transfer performance and impact on plant LCOE. This paper details the high-level findings of a large dry cooler sensitivity study for design point selection, design of the compact dry cooler, expected year-round performance for the dry cooler and the power cycle, and the predicted LCOE for a 30-year plant life. It was found that an aluminum heat exchanger core can be suitably designed to meet the pressure and temperature requirements for a pre-cooler in an sCO2 recompression Brayton cycle. The dry cooler assembly was found to have improved heat transfer performance, allowing for increased cycle efficiencies and a reduced plant LCOE. When coupled with a centrifugal blower and compact transition duct, the dry cooler assembly was able to reduce the installation footprint by over 50%.</jats:p>",

Further MTT assays demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity of the CCLMs in HeLa/MCF‐7 cells.

The crystal structure of a complex of LL-37 with M87 protein, an antigenic M protein variant from a strain that is an emerging threat, revealed a novel interaction mode. The M87 coiled coil unfurled and asymmetrically exposed its hydrophobic core to capture LL-37. A single LL-37 molecule was bound by M87 in the crystal, but in solution additional LL-37 molecules were recruited, consistent with a ‘protein trap’ neutralization mechanism. The interaction mode visualized crystallographically was verified to contribute significantly to LL-37 resistance in an M87 Strep A strain and was identified to be conserved in a number of other M protein types that are prevalent in human populations. Our results provide specific detail for therapeutic inhibition of LL-37 neutralization by M proteins.</jats:p>"

It also discusses how difficulty interpreting facial expressions and social interactions impedes the acquisition of socio-emotional vocabulary. It then turns to social communication, also known as pragmatics, as well as to comprehension, and explains why these aspects of language are, to varying degrees, universally impaired across the autism spectrum. Finally, it offers further discussion of non-speaking autism: why it often correlates with nonverbal autism and what the underlying issues appear to be.

Follow up was through cancer registries up until 2012. Deaths were divided into those from PC and those from other causes according to WHO criteria. For every case, the number of positive cores (NPC), the Maximum Cancer Length in a core (MCL), the total CL (TCL) and the percentage of positive cores (%+cores) was calculated and univariate and multivariate analysis using PSA, T-stage and Gleason score/Grade group were performed. In addition, the presence of stromal gaps (SG) was recorded and where present, length was assessed both including and excluding the SG. Univariate models were run on the patients where SG made a difference to the MCL.All variables of extent showed a significant association with prostate cancer death in the univariate models. In multivariate models, incorporating PSA, T-stage and Gleason score/Grade group, only %+cores was a significant predictor of outcome with a 10% increase in %+cores resulting in a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.07 (LRT p &gt; Χ2 = 0.01). There were 120 patients where SG made a difference to the MCL and a total of 20 events in this group. Including SG, on univariate analysis the median MCL was 10 mm and HR was 1.16 (p=0.007), not including SG the median MCL was 6 mm and HR was 1.23 (p=6.3x10-4). Inclusion or exclusion of SG made no significant difference to TCL as a predictor of outcome.Cancer extent is a strong predictor of prostate cancer death but only %+cores adds to the multivariate model.

Based on simple random sampling and in line with the Godden (2004)’s sample size formula, a sample of 38 was selected out of a population of 52 financial institutions. The selected financial institutions have 209 core value statements, which were classified into seven value dimensions: commitment to customers, commitment to stakeholders, commitment to employees, commitment to diversity, commitment to integrity, entrepreneurship, and corporate social responsibility. Using both content and descriptive analyses, the study found that commitment to integrity (33.97%) and commitment to customers (23.92%) are two most popular out of the seven value dimensions. However, commitment to employees constitutes as low as 1.44% of the value dimensions. It is therefore recommended that financial institutions in Nigeria should increase their commitment to employees and practically institutionalize and integrate their core values in the heart of the employees rather than making it a mere statement in black and white</jats:p>"

Despite its prominence, key pathogenicity determinants for the aggressive nature of hemibiotrophic infection remain unknown. In this study, genome sequencing and annotation of G. boninense T10 were carried out using the Illumina sequencing platform and comparative genome analysis was performed with previously reported G. boninense strains (NJ3 and G3). The pan-secretome of G. boninense was constructed and comprised of 937 core orthogroups, 243 accessory orthogroups, and 84 strain-specific orthogroups. A set of core candidate effector proteins (CEPs) were found to be enriched with catalytic protein classified as the carbohydrate-active enzymes, hydrolases as well as non-catalytic proteins. Differential expression analysis revealed an upregulation of CEP genes which was linked to the suppression of PTI signaling cascade while the downregulation of CEP genes was linked to the inhibition of PTI by preventing host defense elicitation. Genome architecture analysis revealed the one-speed architecture of the G. boninense genome and the lack of preferential association of CEP genes to the transposable elements. The findings obtained from this study would aid in the characterization of pathogenicity determinants and molecular biomarkers of BSR disease.</jats:p>"

Interestingly, the trap states and photocurrent kinetics are affected by humidity and ammonium gas, which provide another multifunctional aspect of the WDPE.

The developments of novel techniques and materials have focused on overcoming the practical difficulties in the HES (production, storage and utilization). Comparatively, considerable attention needs to be provided in the hydrogen storage systems (HSS) because of physical-based storage (compressed gas, cold/cryo compressed and liquid) issues such as low gravimetric/volumetric density, storage conditions/parameters and safety. In material-based HSS, a high amount of hydrogen can be effectively stored in materials via physical or chemical bonds. In different hydride materials, Mg-based hydrides (Mg–H) showed considerable benefits such as low density, hydrogen uptake and reversibility. However, the inferior sorption kinetics and severe oxidation/contamination at exposure to air limit its benefits. There are numerous kinds of efforts, like the inclusion of catalysts that have been made for Mg–H to alter the thermodynamic-related issues. Still, those efforts do not overcome the oxidation/contamination-related issues. The developments of Mg–H encapsulated by gas-selective polymers can effectively and positively influence hydrogen sorption kinetics and prevent the Mg–H from contaminating (air and moisture). In this review, the impact of different polymers (carboxymethyl cellulose, polystyrene, polyimide, polypyrrole, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polymethylpentene, and poly(methyl methacrylate)) with Mg–H systems has been systematically reviewed. In polymer-encapsulated Mg–H, the polymers act as a barrier for the reaction between Mg–H and O2/H2O, selectively allowing the H2 gas and preventing the aggregation of hydride nanoparticles. Thus, the H2 uptake amount and sorption kinetics improved considerably in Mg–H.</jats:p>"

The indirect tensile strength of the Brazilian test can be obtained through this suggested method. The simple iterative procedure based on the least square method was suggested. While suggested method works best for inclined cores in determining five independent elastic constants, horizontally or vertically layered cores require the empirical relation to determine the second shear modulus. Validation against Asan gneiss shows that the proposed method determines five elastic constants with acceptable variation in comparison with those determined by the conventional method using multiple cores. The indirect tensile strength of the Brazilian test can be evaluated with the determined elastic constants as inputs, but it can differ depending on the method determining elastic constants. According to the observed variations in the experiment results, the better understanding of the mechanism of the Brazilian test and the further experimental validation are recommended.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>1.

The anisotropic elastic constants have to be considered for in-situ stress measurement by the overcoring method (Van Heerden, 1983), design of underground structure (Sanio, 1985), and numerical modeling of hydraulic fracturing (Kahn et al., 2012). The tensile strength needs to be carefully determined for the stability analysis for mine roof (Nova and Zaninetti, 1990) and the design of drilling or rock excavation (Yarali and Kahraman, 2011); therefore, accurate determination of tensile strength is important. The transversely isotropic (TI) model has been commonly used to characterize anisotropic rock owing to its applicability and simplicity (Amadei, 1996; Exadaktylos, 2001).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

A composite pulse (CP), which has been well investigated in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is a technique that suppresses the influence of systematic errors by replacing a single operation with a sequence of operations. In one-qubit operations, there are two typical systematic errors, Pulse Length Error (PLE) and Off Resonance Error (ORE). Recently, it was found that PLE robust CPs have a clear geometric property. In this study, we show that ORE robust CPs also have a simple geometric property, which is associated with trajectories on the Bloch sphere of the corresponding operations. We discuss the geometric property of ORE robust CPs using two examples.</jats:p>"

Methods: Eighteen healthy male swimmers (age: 13 ± 2 years, height: 159.6 ± 14.5 cm, weight: 48.7 ± 12.4 kg) were recruited from the Public Authority for Sports swimming pool in Dammam and randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group performed a six-week core-training program consisting of seven exercises (three times/week) with regular swimming training. The control group maintained its regular training. Swimming performance and neuromuscular parameters were measured pre- and post-interventions. Results: The experimental group benefitted from the intervention in terms of the 50 m swim time (−1.4 s; 95% confidence interval −2.4 to −0.5) compared with the control group. The experimental group also showed improved swimming velocity (+0.1 m.s−1), stroke rate (−2.8 cycle.min−1), stroke length (+0.2 m.cycle−1), stroke index (+0.4 m2·s−1), total strokes (−2.9 strokes), and contraction time for erector spinae (ES; −1.5 ms), latissimus dorsi (LD; −7 ms), and external obliques (EO; −1.9 ms). Maximal displacement ES (DM-ES) (+3.3 mm), LD (0.5 mm), and EO (+2.2 mm) were compared with the baseline values for the experimental group, and TC-ES (5.8 ms), LD (3.7 ms), EO (2.5 ms), DM-ES (0.2 mm), LD (−4.1 mm), and EO (−1.0 mm) were compared with the baseline values for the control group. The intergroup comparison was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05; DM-ES p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The results indicate that a six-week core-training program with regular swimming training improved the neuromuscular properties and the 50 m freestyle swim performance of the experimental group compared with the control group.</jats:p>"

Various candidates are limited by actual sequencing data from an experiment. Here we developed RaptGen, which is a variational autoencoder for in silico aptamer generation. RaptGen exploits a profile hidden Markov model decoder to represent motif sequences effectively. We showed that RaptGen embedded simulation sequence data into low-dimensional latent space on the basis of motif information. We also performed sequence embedding using two independent SELEX datasets. RaptGen successfully generated aptamers from the latent space even though they were not included in high-throughput sequencing. RaptGen could also generate a truncated aptamer with a short learning model. We demonstrated that RaptGen could be applied to activity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. We concluded that a generative method by RaptGen and latent representation are useful for aptamer discovery.</jats:p>"

Although target-site has been the most prevalent and studied type of resistance, non-target-site resistance (NTSR) is increasing. However, the genetic factors involved in NTSR are widely unknown. In this study, four gene groups encoding putative NTSR enzymes, namely, cytochrome-P450, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), and nitronate monooxygenase (NMO) were analyzed. The monocot and dicot gene sequences were downloaded from publicly available databases. Phylogenetic trees revealed that most of the CYP450 resistance-related sequences belong to CYP81 (5), and in GST, most of the resistance sequences belonged to GSTU18 (9) and GSTF6 (8) groups. In addition, the study of upstream promoter sequences of these NTSR genes revealed stress-related cis-regulatory motifs, as well as eight transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were identified. The discovered TFBS were commonly present in both monocots and dicots, and the identified motifs are known to play key roles in countering abiotic stress. Further, we predicted the 3D structure for the resistant CYP450 and GST protein and identified the substrate recognition site through the homology approach. Our description of putative NTSR enzymes may be used to develop innovative weed control techniques to delay the evolution of NTSR.</jats:p>"

Thus, the study aimed at assessing correlation amongst the core &amp; lower limb muscles and functional status. Methods and procedures: 84 participants between 70-79 yrs of age ()(Male:Female = 1) were assessed for core strength, Lower limb strength and functional mobility using pressure biofeedback, five times sit to stand and timed up and go test respectively and data was tabulated &amp; analyzed further in SPSS. Results: Spearman's correlation was used in this study which showed significant positive correlation between core strength and lower limb strength with lower limb functional status. (r(Core)=0.813, r(5SST) =0.893; p(Core)=0.00, p(5SST) =0.00) Discussion: Optimal core stability helps maintain the center of gravity within the altered base of support and this could be a reason for individuals with good core strength having better functional mobility. Also force of muscle contraction is directly proportional to velocity of movement which is seen reduced in lower limb musculature because of aging in this population. Conclusion: The present study concluded that strong correlation of core strength and lower limb strength with functional mobility exists among middle old elderly population</jats:p>"

The inherent drawbacks of biobased polyamide 56 (PA56) such as poor notched impact strength limit its applications. Core‐shell structured impact modifiers consisting of a soft glycidyl methacrylate grafted poly(ethylene–octene) (POE‐g‐GMA) shell and a rigid polypropylene core were synthesized through the differences in interfacial tensions. Core‐shell rubber (CSR) particles were used to toughen biobased PA56 by melt blending. PA56/CSR composites exhibited a 560% increase in the impact strength, while the tensile performance loss was slight. This desirable toughness of biobased PA56 is attributed to the cavitation that occurred in POE‐g‐GMA shell which can induce shear bands and shear yielding, forming the fibrils. Characterizations, including X‐ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), melt rheological tests, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were conducted to study the toughening mechanism. The results indicated the massive shearing yielding, the cavitation of the CSR and interfacial debonding between the POE‐g‐GMA and the PP were the principal toughening mechanisms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Paleoclimate proxy records have non-negligible uncertainties that arise from both the proxy measurement and the dating processes. Knowledge of the dating uncertainties is important for a rigorous propagation to further analyses, for example, for identification and dating of stadial–interstadial transitions in Greenland ice core records during glacial intervals, for comparing the variability in different proxy archives, and for model-data comparisons in general. In this study we develop a statistical framework to quantify and propagate dating uncertainties in layer counted proxy archives using the example of the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05). We express the number of layers per depth interval as the sum of a structured component that represents both underlying physical processes and biases in layer counting, described by a regression model, and a noise component that represents the fluctuations of the underlying physical processes, as well as unbiased counting errors. The joint dating uncertainties for all depths can then be described by a multivariate Gaussian process from which the chronology (such as the GICC05) can be sampled. We show how the effect of a potential counting bias can be incorporated in our framework. Furthermore we present refined estimates of the occurrence times of Dansgaard–Oeschger events evidenced in Greenland ice cores together with a complete uncertainty quantification of these timings.\n                    </jats:p>"

The data are sourced from primary and secondary data. The primary data are sourced from IT sector employees. The secondary information is sourced from earlier publications related to sustainable leadership, sustainable competitive advantage, and core competencies. The primary data were collected through the field survey method, although some were collected via an online mode. The sample size was 297. The study used a simple stratified random sampling technique. The study results described a significant effect of sustainable leadership on sustainable competitive advantage. Sustainable leadership improves the prospects of associations in terms of their creation, constant advancement, sustained competitive edge, and long-term success. Sustainable leadership is a wellspring of gaining the upper hand for associations. Sustainable leadership benefits associations, development, consistent improvement, a supported upper hand, and long haul achievement. The study also found that the core competencies significantly influence the competitive advantage. The discoveries of the current study have significant ramifications for customers, top administration, and policymakers. The practitioners of IT companies are urged to cultivate an inventive and open correspondence climate in their associations dependent on existing logical discoveries. Likewise, they could utilize the current outcomes as a benchmark for gradually expanding their qualities and limits, which may prompt better natural productivity.</jats:p>"

In particular, we explore the role that core values should have in radical innovation processes and in guiding the ability of organisations in learning and unlearning, i.e., identifying and developing abilities and competences coherent with the values of the organisation. First, the paper provides a conceptual explanation: it clarifies and highlights the characteristics and implications that core values should have when considered within a radical innovation approach, in particular their ability to be embodied in design objects (meaningful to internal individuals and external customers), and their ability to be open to contingency, deriving their strength from their ability to evolve and be reinterpreted. Secondly, based on this, we put forward a design-driven and interpretation-based facilitation method to support organisations in making sense of their past and future core values and illustrate this method by positioning it when compared with other existing methods. An overview of the outputs of the method and their knowledge value for the organisation together with an illustration conclude the paper. </jats:p>",

Claiming that the complex dynamics of the 21st-century classroom can be managed best by reflective teachers. Through the reflective process, teachers are empowered as change agents to modify learning environments to benefit their students. Teachers hold the power to influence student learning. Therefore, it is important to understand the training processes that serve to produce reflective practitioners. In conducting rigorous cross-cultural comparative research, identifying common evaluative indicators underpinned by a theoretical framework is critical. Hence, the principles of the pre-service emerging reflective teacher training (PERTT) model were explored quantitatively and explained qualitatively to specifically focus on teachers’ perceptions of their experiences of the psychosocial interpersonal process outcomes of the teacher-training environment (i.e. reflective practices, instructional scaffolding, guidance and support, modelled behaviours and reinforcement) provided during their teacher training. Such an exploration is critical because the philosophical underpinnings of the PERTT model have not been interrogated outside of Barbados. The findings demonstrate that there is merit to key theoretical principles of the PERTT model based on the lived experiences of the teachers in Antigua and Barbuda, England, and Canada during their teacher training. </jats:p>",

Recently, several core structures of patient-derived tau paired helical filaments (PHFs) have been solved revealing a structural variability that often correlates with a specific tauopathy. To further characterize the dynamics of these fibril cores, to screen for strain-specific small molecules as potential biomarkers and therapeutics, and to develop strain-specific antibodies, recombinant in-vitro models of tau filaments are needed. We recently showed that a 95-residue fragment of tau (from residue 297 to 391), termed dGAE, forms filaments in vitro in the absence of polyanionic co-factors often used for in vitro aggregation of full length tau. Tau(297-391) was identified as the proteolytic resistant core of tau PHFs and overlaps with the structures characterized by cryo-electron microscopy in ex-vivo PHFs, making it a promising model for the study of AD tau filaments in vitro. In the present study, we used solid-state NMR to characterize tau(297-391) filaments and show that such filaments assembled under non-reducing conditions are more dynamic and less ordered than those made in the presence of the reducing agent, DTT. We further report the resonance assignment of tau(297-392)+DTT filaments and compare it to existing core structures of tau.</jats:p>"

It was determined by the method of X-ray diffraction, that in the place of the interaction of PMMA and the shell, the degree of ordering of the polymer is higher than that in the volume of the polymer core.

Nigeria having a Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) has been long interested in fuel technological research not just to develop the area but also to meet with resolution on the nuclear treaty set out by the global nuclear regulatory body. In this study, reactor kinetic parameters such as effective delayed neutron fractions, prompt neutron lifetime as well as mean neutron generation time were analysed for Nigerian Research Reactor-1 (NIRR-1). Serpent Monte Carlo code 1.17 is used in the analysis. For delayed neutron parameters determination, we used fission probability iteration under one averaged generation time and neutron population rate.The calculated values for delayed neutron were recorded as analogue prompt and implicit prompt neutron lifetime, reproduction time and emission time are in the order of 3×10-7 (s), in agreement with the calculated data from the nuclear data libraries and some literature.The result for delay neutron fraction and other time-based parameters support the fuel core conversion for NIRR-1.The computational and pictorial results obtained from Serpent code simulation described well the transient behavior of the delayed neutron in this reactor.The analytical results also spelled out the relevance and compatibility of low enriched uranium dioxide fuel over higher enriched type.The result of this study conforms with other results obtained from similar reactors but with different Monte Carlo codes and with higher enriched uranium</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Identifying depositional facies and diagenetic modifications from BHI logs in sections without core is challenging due to heterogeneities in fabric of the carbonaceous rock, which are below the resolution of the BHI logs in these complex reservoirs. This is mainly due to different diagenetic processes resulting in different types of reservoir rocks (RRTs) with different petrophysical properties in the same geological facies. This work describes an innovative new workflow that uses a deep learning model to identify heterogeneities of fabric (textures) in complex carbonate reservoirs in sections without core; as input we use conventional (gamma ray, density, neutron, sonic), NMR, BHI (acoustic imaging) logs, core CT images and physical porosity and permeability measurements from plugs. This new workflow combines supervised deep learning and unsupervised machine learning methods, consisting of four steps: (1) Identification of textures in Core CT (2) Calibration of features of BHI logs in core section (3) Training a deep learning model with cropped images from BHI logs to extract texture curves (4) train a machine learning regression model with texture curves, WL logs and plug porosity and permeability values to propagate prediction of textures, porosity and permeability along the well. The texture curves generated by the ML model are in good match with the recognized core section textures (CT Images). The results show that the NMR Total Porosity has a good correlation with the porosity predicted by the regression model. In addition, the petrophysical data from plugs measured in the laboratory show a good match with the porosity and permeability predicted in the core zone. In the non-core zone, the predicted textures by the ML model relate to the heterogeneities of the carbonaceous rock fabric and the propagation of the petrophysical properties have good correlation with the predicted textures. In some cases, vuggy porosity combined with fractures do not allow correct porosity measurement with NMR or density tools due to the sensitivity of these tools to poor borehole conditions. In these cases, the NMR presents a fast relaxation of the T2 distribution due to the heterogeneity of these carbonaceous fabric and therefore the porosity and permeability measurements will be affected. The ML model uses CT Textures to calibrate BHI Crops in the core section zone and NMR and Basic logs as input, improving the recognition of the textural heterogeneities and refine the traditional Rock typing of these complex Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs.</jats:p>",

In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin (Ge)/hydroxyapatite (HA) core‐shell nanocomposites have been produced by the coaxial electrospinning method. Coaxial electrospinning is an efficient method for scaffold preparation to provide an interconnected porous fibrous scaffold. The prepared nanocomposite simultaneously benefited from the good mechanical behavior of the core PCL polymer. The desired biological properties also originated from the outer layer of the Ge/HA nanocomposite. Nanofibrous scaffolds' properties were characterized using SEM, TEM, FTIR, TGA, DSC, tensile test, contact angle, and MTT assay. The morphology of the as‐electrospun nanofibers was investigated using SEM and TEM, which revealed a defect‐less fibrous morphology. TEM images showed the core‐shell structure of the prepared scaffold nanofibers. The contact angle test showed that the presence of HA nanoparticles has improved the wettability of fibrous composites. In addition, HA nanoparticles could effectively strengthen the polymer scaffolds. The highest UTS value of 4.1 MPa was obtained in the PCL/(Ge+10%HA) sample. The cytotoxicity results revealed that the prepared scaffolds were utterly biocompatible. Moreover, significant cell proliferation of osteosarcoma cells was observed at high HA contents. The interconnected pores allowed cells to migrate into the scaffolds and grow inside. Based on the obtained results, PCL/(Ge/ HA) core‐shell nanofibers could be a promising candidate for bone scaffolds.</jats:p>",

Strong core muscles function as hubs in the biological motor chain, which create a fulcrum for the four limbs’ strength and establish a channel for the cohesion, transmission, and integration of the upper and lower limbs. In other words, core training optimizes the transfer and overall control of motion and force to the terminal segment within athletic actions. Meanwhile, core training could increase stability and stiffness in the spine to reduce unrequired “energy leaks” and torso movement during the exertion of external loads. This mechanism could help athletes achieve better skill performance. Therefore, this review suggests that core training should be considered integrated into athletes’ daily training routines.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Systematic Review Registration</jats:bold>: [<jats:ext-link>https://inplasy.com/</jats:ext-link>], identifier [INPLASY2021100013].</jats:p>"

Our previous work designed a music generation system that created personalized music based on participants' emotions predicted from EEG data. Although our system effectively induced emotions, unfortunately, it suffered from two problems. The first is that a long EEG recording is required to train emotion prediction models. In this paper, we trained models with a small amount of EEG data. We proposed emotion prediction with meta-learning and compared its performance with two other training methods. The second problem is that the generated music failed to consider the participants' emotions before they listened to music. We solved this challenge by constructing a system that adapted an iso principle that gradually changed the music from close to the participants' emotions to the target emotion. Our results showed that emotion prediction with meta-learning had the lowest RMSE among three methods (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.016).

The test bed was in a complexly folded metasedimentary carbonate mica phyllite with a NW-SE structural grain. Monitoring included electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) that shows the presence of a well-defined electrical conductivity high that defines a fold structure occupying much of the test bed with an orientation similar to the local structure. The nature of this folded conductive unit was evaluated using a range of methods characterizing the rock and geophysical properties. These included core examination, high resolution XRF analyses on selected core intervals, and wireline geophysical logs. Electrical resistivity profiles from the wireline geophysical surveys are consistent with the electrical resistivity tomographic three-dimensional images, and the XRF profiles show elevated levels of sulfur in the vicinity of the interpreted conductivity anomalies. The compositional and wireline logging data are consistent with interpretations from the ERT data. Based upon these observations the best candidate for the source of the high electrical conductivities is the presence of significant amounts of sulfides within the unit making up the folds.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>1. INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The EGS Collab Project has developed two test beds within the underground of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) located in Lead, SD, USA. The test beds support investigations of fracturing, stimulation, and modeling of these processes at the 10-meter scale in crystalline rocks (Kneafsey et al., 2018). The experiments support the implementation of geothermal utilization by improving the ability to predict and control fractures created and stimulated during the experiments (Kneafsey et al., 2019; Kneafsey et al., 2020). The first test bed (E-1) is located on the 4850 Level of SURF (1.5 km below the surface), and the second (E-2) is located on the 4100 Level. Of these experimental areas, only results from Test Bed E-1 will be discussed here. A major part of the monitoring of the test bed experiments consisted of the application of a range of geophysical techniques that were active as the fracturing and stimulation of regions in the test bed were conducted. These techniques were also employed to characterize the state of the test bed prior to the experiment initiation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sektor kelautan dan perikanan di Indonesia khususnya Provinsi Lampung memiliki potensi perikanan yang cukup tinggi, yaitu sebesar 387.000 ton/tahun. Akan tetapi, tingkat pemanfaatan perikanan tangkap di Provinsi Lampung berdasarkan Laporan Statistik Perikanan Tangkap, Dinas Kelautan dan Perikanan Provinsi Lampung pada tahun 2014 baru mencapai 157.969 ton/tahun. Angka pemanfaatan tersebut baru mencapai 41,57 % dari total potensi perikanan tangkap provinsi Lampung. Salah satu faktor penting dalam mengembangkan sektor perikanan tangkap adalah dengan mengetahui komoditas dan alat penangkapan ikan (API) unggulan pada daerah tertentu. Penelitian ini dilakukan di Pelabuhan Perikanan Kuala Stabas (PP Kuala Stabas), Provinsi Lampung. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menentukan komoditas perikanan unggulan dan jenis alat tangkap yang tepat untuk pemanfaatan  perikanan di PP Kuala Stabas. Metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan ialah dengan wawancara dan responden utama dipilih dengan metode snow-ball sampling. Selain itu, penelitian ini menggunakan metode Comparative Performance Index (CPI) untuk menentukan komoditas perikanan unggulan dan metode analisis skoring untuk menentukan API unggulan. Berdasarkan analisis CPI, komoditas perikanan unggulan di PP Kuala Stabas ialah ikan setuhuk (blue marlin) dengan massa rata-rata ikan sebesar 102,1 kg. Kemudian, hasil kajian terhadap seleksi jenis alat tangkap unggulan dengan metode skoring diperoleh bahwa alat rawai berada pada prioritas utama berdasarkan kajian aspek biologi, jaring gelung berdasarkan kajian aspek teknis, sosial, dan ekonomi, serta jaring rampus berdasarkan kajian aspek ekosistem perairan. Oleh karena itu, dapat disimpulkan bahwa jaring gelung merupakan alat tangkap terbaik yang dapat digunakan dalam pemanfaatan perikananan di PP Kuala Stabas.&#x0D;\nKata kunci: alat tangkap ikan, CPI, ikan setuhuk, komoditas perikanan, PP Kuala Stabas, tuna</jats:p>"

However, for sandwich panels with a low-density foam core, local phenomena like indentation and wrinkling may occur in the upper face sheet at the loading punch, thus the intended load capacity of the sandwich panel will not be reached.

However, for the 3-point bending test using specimen with a very high panel length / thickness ratio a large part of the load transfer is done in the upper face sheet with less involvement of shear in the core. Although core fracture is observed in the experiments, both the FE-simulated and experimentally found maximum load agree well with the load capacity as determined from analytical formula for local failure in the upper face sheet. The FE-simulated vertical displacement at maximum load differs though.</jats:p>",

New opportunities are provided by the fabrication of a novel class of nanocomposites with a nanolaminate architecture. In this work, by using the iterative lift-off/float-on process combined with wet depositions, we incorporated cm-size graphene monolayers produced via Chemical Vapour Deposition into a poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix with a controlled, alternate-layered structure. The produced nanolaminate shows a significant improvement in mechanical properties, with enhanced stiffness, strength and toughness, with the addition of only 0.06 vol% of graphene. Furthermore, oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability measurements performed at different relative humidity levels, reveal that the addition of graphene leads to significant reduction of permeability, compared to neat PMMA. Overall, we demonstrate that the produced graphene–PMMA nanolaminate surpasses, in terms of gas barrier properties, the traditional discontinuous graphene–particle composites with a similar filler content. Moreover, we found that the gas permeability through the nanocomposites departs from a monotonic decrease as a function of relative humidity, which is instead evident in the case of the pure PMMA nanolaminate. This work suggests the possible use of Chemical Vapour Deposition graphene–polymer nanolaminates as a flexible gas barrier, thus enlarging the spectrum of applications for this novel material.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Refractive index (RI) is a unique attribute of bio-analytes which highly relies upon their concentrations or the activity/infectivity of the microbes. In this paper, a dual-polarized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) RI sensor based on a decentered propagation-controlled core photonic crystal fiber (PCF) has been studied. Fine-tuned light guidance is realized by scaling down the core air holes. The external surface of the fiber is metalized with a thin gold layer that maximizes the chemical stability by reducing the chances of oxidation. The deposition of the core from the central position reduces the core to analyte distance resulting in efficient coupling as well as greater sensitivity. Finite element method (FEM) based numerical investigation warrants promising sensing performances in wavelength and amplitude interrogation methods. The proposed sensor is viable for the RI range from 1.33 to 1.39, where it demonstrates the highest wavelength sensitivities of 13,700 and 15,400 nm/RIU and highest amplitude sensitivities of 852 RIU<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and 654 RIU<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> in x-and y-polarized modes, respectively. It also exhibits high sensor resolutions of 7.30 × 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup> RIU and 6.49 × 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup> RIU, and high figure of merits of 216 and 256 RIU<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> for x and y-polarized modes, respectively. Along with the liberty of selecting light sources, the highly sensitive nature of the sensor will enable accurate detections of different organic compounds and bio-molecules.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Besides absorbing light, the core antenna complex CP43 of photosystem II is of great importance in transferring excitation energy from the antenna complexes to the reaction center. Excitation energies, spectral densities, and linear absorption spectra of the complex have been evaluated by a multiscale approach. In this scheme, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations are performed employing the parameterized density functional tight binding (DFTB) while the time-dependent long-range-corrected DFTB scheme is applied for the excited state calculations. The obtained average spectral density of the CP43 complex shows a very good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the excitonic Hamiltonian of the system along with the computed site-dependent spectral densities was used to determine the linear absorption. While a Redfield-like approximation has severe shortcomings in dealing with the CP43 complex due to quasi-degenerate states, the non-Markovian full second-order cumulant expansion formalism is able to overcome the drawbacks. Linear absorption spectra were obtained, which show a good agreement with the experimental counterparts at different temperatures. This study once more emphasizes that by combining diverse techniques from the areas of molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry, and open quantum systems, it is possible to obtain first-principle results for photosynthetic complexes, which are in accord with experimental findings.</jats:p>",

Core competencies in general are linked with job productivity, job performance, and organisational performance. In Malaysia, initiatives are currently underway to produce competent and professional Halal executives. As for now, the competencies of halal executives are yet to be defined. Defining and identifying the core competencies is pivotal as the Malaysian Halal industry needs to appoint more competent halal executives to serve the halal-certified companies. Thus, this article aims to identify the set of competencies for halal executives via a literature review. This would allow for the further development of the Halal executive core competencies conceptual model. In addition, the background of Halal executives in the Malaysian Halal industry is also discussed to provide context for this review article. The conceptual model proposed is useful in discussing and developing the idea of core competencies, especially in the halal manufacturing industry context. A comprehensive core competencies model is useful for preparing future halal executives, evaluating halal executives' practises in the workplace, and for their lifelong professional development. Other countries could use the same core competencies framework to inform the development of the human resource related to Halal.</jats:p>"

However, the collection and distribution of these forms of charity can be beset by challenges. The challenges include inadequate infrastructure for collecting and disbursing funds, a lack of transparency and accountability, corruption, and cultural and social barriers to giving. The study argues that addressing these challenges requires a technological approach that involves implementing forms for collecting and distributing Zakat and Sadaqah using WordPress core files. The study's key objective is to ensure transparency, accountability and avoid the corrupt practice of multi-collection of Zakat and Sadaqah funds using digital platforms to collect, manage, and distribute zakat, which is very useful because it provides much convenience for its users. Therefore, the study presents a technological (software) solution to some challenges that Zakat and Sadaqah institutions face while collecting and distributing Zakat and Sadaqah using an existing content management system (WordPress) core architecture. In achieving this, we used the Design Thinking method. The design process adopted the Agile software design steps in the implementation of the system. The study resulted to revolutionized management of zakat funds and created a more efficient and accountable ecosystem for the collection and distribution of Zakat in Ibadan.\nKeywords: Zakat and Sadaqah, Islam, WordPress, Charity, Poverty alleviation\n </jats:p>"

However, the existing works consider only the prediction of a conflict between two transactions and provide a static HTM configuration for all workloads. To solve the problems, we proposes a hybrid transactional memory scheme based on both abort prediction and an adaptive retry policy, called HyTM-AP. First, our HyTM-AP can predict not only conflicts between concurrently running transactions, but also the capacity and other aborts of transactions by collecting the information of transactions previously executed. Second, our HyTM-AP can provide an adaptive retry policy based on machine learning algorithms, according to the characteristic of a given workload. Finally, through our experimental performance analysis using the STAMP benchmark, our HyTM-AP shows 12~13% better performance than the existing HyTM schemes.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A helically twisted ring-core hole assisted fiber (HAF) is proposed for an arbitrary higher-order spatial state generation. In usual circular core fibers, HE and EH modes are degenerate and have vector field distributions. We will show the degeneracy of these modes having specific azimuthal mode order is lifted by periodically placing air-holes around the core with specific symmetry while preserving their vector field distributions. It is called spontaneously broken degeneracy (SBD) in this paper. Azimuthal order of the SBD modes can be changed with the arrangement of surrounding air-holes. By using this SBD modes, it is shown that arbitrary higher-order spatial state generation, including orbital angular momentum (OAM) state, is possible based on a geometric phase existing in twisted fibers. Furthermore, by using periodically inverted twisting, efficient OAM state generation is possible by accumulating the geometric phase. The topological charge can be changed by changing the arrangement of surrounding air-holes. Since the mechanism does not depend on a phase matching, such as a long-period grating, but on a topological effect, the wavelength dependence is very small, leading to novel and efficient mechanism for the manipulation of the spatial state of the light.</jats:p>",

However, since the application of volatile memories is relatively recent, basic research on the volatility function in the materials is still lacking. In this study, we focused on electrochemically doped protons inside the TiO2 thin film as one of the simplest platforms for volatile functions and aimed to clarify the design principle for volatile memories. It was found that the proton volatility from the TiO2 surface can be controlled by the slow proton diffusion inside a few-nm SiO2 cap layer, where TiO2 and SiO2 can be viewed as a proton container and a sealing cap, respectively. It was further shown that both volatile and nonvolatile protons exist in TiO2 thin films, and hence, suppressing the influence of the latter would be essential for exploiting functions from volatile protons. These results indicate that simple material stacks with nanoscale thickness can control volatile protons in solid-state devices, providing a basic design principle for volatile memories.</jats:p>",

To decrease the fall risk, it is important to evaluate the detailed features of the gait of patients with OA. This study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal parameters of gait in patients with end-stage hip OA, especially foot trajectory. We measured normal speed gait in patients with hip OA and in healthy controls (HCs) using inertial measurement units attached to shanks. The stride lengths in the affected and unaffected sides in the patients with hip OA were shorter than those in the HCs, but the position of maximum foot clearance was not significantly different between the two groups. The patients with hip OA compensated the position of maximum foot clearance to avoid fall risk. The horizontal plane foot trajectory in patients with hip OA suggests that the lateral bending of the trunk during walking, which is frequently seen in them, was a result of the lateral distance at swing down being located significantly more medially on the unaffected side than on the affected side. Herein, a new gait parameter of lateral distance at swing was discovered by a detailed evaluation of three-dimensional foot trajectory of female patients with end-stage hip OA.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to investigate the use of a novel wireless non-invasive heat flux-based thermometer in acute stroke patients admitted to a stroke unit and compare the measurements with the currently used infrared (IR) tympanic temperature readings. The study encompassed 30 acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent continuous measurement (Tcore) with the novel wearable non-invasive CORE device. Paired measurements of Tcore and tympanic temperature (Ttym) by using a standard IR-device were performed 3–5 times/day, yielding a total of 305 measurements. The predicted core temperatures (Tcore) were significantly correlated with Ttym (r = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001). The comparison of the Tcore and Ttym measurements by Bland–Altman analysis showed a good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of 0.11 ± 0.34 °C, and no proportional bias was observed (B = −0.003, p = 0.923). The Tcore measurements correctly predicted the presence or absence of Ttym hyperthermia or fever in 94.1% and 97.4% of cases, respectively. Temperature monitoring with a novel wireless non-invasive heat flux-based thermometer could be a reliable alternative to the Ttym method for assessing core temperature in acute ischemic stroke patients.</jats:p>"

Self‐report questionnaire data were collected from 85 patients with an eating disorder. Most participants (91.7%) experienced intrusive images related to body weight and shape and self‐worth, and results confirms that these images were highly distressing and vivid. We found that intrusive images were linked to autobiographical memories, and that negative and distressing intrusive images were positively associated with negative core beliefs.

In this work, with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as the core, chitosan (CS) and halloysite (HNT) as the shell, a biobased FR (APP@CS@HNT) with a core‐shell structure was prepared through the self‐assembly method. The flame retardancy of PLA composites has been improved with the addition of the FR (APP@CS@HNT). With the loading of 17 wt% APP@CS@HNT, the PLA composite shows a high limiting oxygen index value (29.4%) and achieves vertical burning (UL‐94) test V0 rating. Compared with pure PLA, the cone calorimetry test indicates that the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release decrease from 299.88 to 152.29 kW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and from 102.0 to 71.2 MJ/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, respectively. The addition of APP@CS@HNT can also improve the smoke suppression performance of PLA composites. Such enhanced flame retardancy is mainly attributed to APP@CS@HNT prompting the PLA matrix to produce more continuous and denser carbon layers at a lower temperature to form physical barriers.</jats:p>",

In the present work, novel Physella Acuta Snail Shell particle reinforced aluminium metal–matrix composites are developed to facilitate cost-effective and sustainable manufacturing. These green composites are developed by stir-casting with LM0 as matrix material and snail shell as reinforcement with a distinct percentage (by weight) of inclusion. The influence of snail shells is analyzed through tribological, morphological, and corrosion studies. Aluminium–matrix composite Al98SNS2 with 98% (by weight) aluminium matrix and 2% (by weight) snail shell reinforcement exhibits superior performance in all investigations. Al98SNS2 composite exhibits the least wear rate in the atmosphere of deionized water and 3.5% NaCl. Corrosion deteriorates the surface roughness irrespective of the percentage of incorporation of snail shell reinforcement. However, the deterioration is minimal in Al98SNS2. The current research findings indicate that the incorporation of snail shell in aluminum metal–matrix composites promotes cost-effective, sustainable, and eco-friendly manufacturing.</jats:p>"

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of a pentacylindrical allophycocyanin core and phycocyanin-containing rod of a thermophilic cyanobacterial hemidiscoidal PBS. The structures define the spatial arrangement of protein subunits and chromophores, crucial for deciphering the energy transfer mechanism.

Microorganisms have been detected in every ecosystem on Earth, as well as in any built environment that has been investigated. Drinking water sources, drinking water treatment plants and distribution systems provide peculiar microbial ecological niches, dismantling the belief of the “biological simplicity” of drinking water. Nevertheless, drinking water microbiomes are understudied compared to other microbiomes. Recent DNA sequencing and meta-omics advancements allow a deeper understanding of drinking water microbiota. Thus, moving beyond the limits of day-to-day testing for specific pathogenic microbes, new approaches aim at predicting microbiome changes driven by disturbances at the macro-scale and overtime. This will foster an effective and proactive management of water sources, improving the drinking water supply system and the monitoring activities to lower public health risk. Here, we want to give a new angle on drinking water microbiome research. Starting from a selection of 231 scientific publications on this topic, we emphasize the value of biodiversity in drinking water ecosystems and how it can be related with industrialization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The last 10 years have witnessed numerous new developments and advancements in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) rock core analysis both in conventional and unconventional reservoirs. On the hardware side, NMR instruments are now capable of handling hundreds of thousands of radio frequency (RF) pulses, and the pulses can be more closely spaced than ever. This allows measuring samples with very fast relaxation times, which was not possible before. Higher field NMR spectrometers operating at frequencies of ~12 MHz and ~20 MHz (in addition to the standard low-field ~2 MHz instruments) were introduced, which drastically improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and even allowed two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) NMR imaging to be performed on the samples to complement traditional relaxation measurements. Another consequence of using higher field instruments is that even samples with a very low amount of NMR signal can now provide useful data in a reasonable amount of time. Additional hardware improvements include the development of NMR-compatible high-temperature and high-pressure vessels and faster and more robust electronics and computers, which allow faster data acquisition, processing, and a more user-friendly environment for new NMR pulse sequence design and implementation. Following the hardware improvements, new applications were developed for rock core analysis, including modified Carl-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequences for minimizing sample heating. NMR-based wettability, relative permeability, capillary pressure, cuttings, and long core measurements have also been successful. In unconventionals, NMR-based gas isotherm measurements and fluid-typing measurements are now common practices. This review paper sets out to summarize the recent NMR developments in the industry as well as provide references where more details can be found on each topic.</jats:p>",

The case of circular core oscillations in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis is considered. The steady flow structure strongly depends on the dimensionless oscillation frequency. In the frequency range where there are no inertial waves, the flow resembles a classical Taylor column with an almost uniform distribution of the angular velocity. With an increase in the oscillation amplitude above a certain threshold level, a two-dimensional azimuthal wave is excited at the column boundary. The wave velocity is determined by the intensity of the liquid differential rotation and does not depend on the Ekman number. In the case of oscillation with a frequency less than twice the rotation rate, the inertial waves propagate in fluid bulk and introduce a significant correction to the steady velocity profile. At high amplitudes, the triadic subharmonic resonance of inertial waves is excited. The triadic interactions simultaneously manifest themselves in two regions of the spherical shell, generating secondary waves with the same frequencies, but different wavenumbers: subharmonic waves with shorter (respectively, longer) wavelengths are observed in outer (respectively, inner) regions of the shell. In some cases, the third (intermediate) region with subharmonic waves of intermediate wavelength can be observed. The development of the triadic resonance leads to a strongly nonlinear response in the form of a system of steady vortices with well-defined azimuthal periodicity.</jats:p>",

The use of probiotics in animal production and human nutrition can solve many problems caused by inadequate antibiotic treatment, growth promoters, disease prevention, and improved management. Market demand for probiotics is increasing worldwide, including Indonesia, where these are mainly imported. This situation renders peptone as a media component for isolation and identification of probiotics or as a media for testing bacteria in microbiological work. Pangasius fillet waste (P) and pineapple core (C) are agro-industrial wastes used as raw materials for peptone production. The purpose of this study was to see how the ratio of P to C affects the output of peptone from agro-industrial wastes for use as a component of laboratory media for the growth of microorganisms. Protein P hydrolysis was carried out directly by mixing C in various ratios (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) with different incubation times (T), 1 day (T1), 2 days (T2), and 3 days (T3). The P: C ratio of 3:1 with an incubation time of one day (T1) was the best for peptone production, with a yield of 42.88±2.66%, the protein content of 5.68±0.13%, degree of hydrolysis of 90.16±2.28%, and 15 amino acids. The effects of commercial and modified MRS broth media containing peptone on LAB growth were non-significantly different, with an average total LAB of 9.084-9.128 log CFU/mL. In conclusion, peptone extracted from P using crude bromelain from C can be used as a nitrogen source to formulate MRS broth for LAB growth.</jats:p>",

Peer-to-peer networks seem to be a promising tool to support adolescents during that time. While co-development often concentrates on the end-user, this paper focuses on the peer facilitators of an online peer encouragement network (OPEN2chat), where adolescents can chat with peer facilitators about their problems. We conducted 3 group discussions with 18 peer facilitators after a testing phase to improve the process of these interactions. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data after transcription. The four main themes were the responsibility of the peer facilitators toward their peers, especially their role of giving advice; the interaction process itself; time management; and technology aspects of the application. Including these stakeholders in the development process empowered the young people, helped eliminate problems with the application, and made the researchers more sensitive toward potential issues and emotions that peer facilitators encounter that may have been missed without a co-development process. Eliminating these problems might also help establish a better environment and support system for the actual end-users.</jats:p>"

For the thermal management problem when the operating power of a chip changes dynamically, an intelligent method combining BP neural network and genetic algorithm is used for distribution optimization of coolant flow under the condition with a fixed total mass flow rate. Firstly, a sample point dataset containing temperature field information is obtained by numerical calculation of convective heat transfer, and the constructed BP neural network is trained using these data. The “working condition–flow distribution–temperature” mapping relationship is predicted by the BP neural network. The genetic algorithm is further used to optimize the optimal flow distribution strategy to adapt to the dynamic change of power. Compared with the commonly used uniform flow distribution method, the intelligently optimized nonuniform flow distribution method can further reduce the temperature of the chip and improve the temperature uniformity of the chip.</jats:p>"

Access to WWC information is important in the Andean region of South America, as its climatic and environmental characteristics make it especially vulnerable to extreme weather events and climate variability and change. However, the production, access and dissemination of WWC services and information is insufficient in the region. Consequently, strengthening the capacity of the responsible institutions to provide WWC services is an urgent need. A sustainable approach to capacity development should take place along the entire value chain of WWC services. This ensures that users have timely access to information that responds to their needs in support of their decision-making process.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To meet the need to improve both the capacity to provide relevant and timely WWC services and its use to inform decision-making, risk management, and the design of adaptation interventions, two complementary development projects &amp;amp;#8211; ENANDES and BRAVA &amp;amp;#8211; are being developed jointly in the region. ENANDES is ongoing since 2021 and includes three national meteorological and hydrological services (NMHS) (IDEAM Colombia, SENAMHI Peru and DMC Chile) and the WMO Regional Climate Centre for Western South America (CIIFEN), BRAVA, funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, includes three additional NMHSs (INAMHI Ecuador, SENAMHI Bolivia and SMN Argentina) and other WMO regional centers (the Regional Climate Centre for Southern South America, and Regional Training Centers in Peru and Argentina). This institutional complexity, together with the diversity of activities involved in the two initiatives, will require a highly innovative coordination, as well as agile ways of transferring knowledge and experience among the involved partners.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the main challenges of the ENANDES / BRAVA initiatives is to build a South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC) to facilitate and intensify regional cooperation and to foster exchange of knowledge and experiences to finally enable mutual development. The mechanism envisioned within the initiatives to establish sustainable SSTC is the so-called &amp;amp;#8220;regional core of expertise&amp;amp;#8221; (NUREX). The NUREX will be a virtual entity in which all involved partners actively participate. It will serve as an intermediary or &amp;amp;#8220;broker&amp;amp;#8221; to manage, reconcile and balance technical knowledge needs and capacities among all partners. Our contribution will present the NUREX concept, its set-up, governance and mechanisms that enable the beneficiary NMHSs to effectively collaborate. However, as the development of such an entity is still in its early stages, we believe it will benefit greatly from the discussions and exchange of experiences at EMS2022.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The circular coil design in the primary and secondary for wireless power transfer (WPT) in electric vehicles is studied in this research. The suggested coil design is used to develop mathematical design utilizing numerical solutions. Later, using Multisims software, this coil design is produced in simulation.

However, understanding their physical origin and relation to the other large-scale structures in the lowermost mantle are limited due to an incomplete mapping of ULVZs at the CMB. The SKS and SPdKS seismic waveforms is routinely used to infer ULVZ presence, but has thus far only been used in a limited epicentral distance range. As the SKS/SPdKS wavefield interacts with a ULVZ it generates additional seismic arrivals, thus increasing the complexity of the recorded wavefield. Here, we explore utilization of the multi-scale sample entropy method to search for ULVZ structures. We investigate the feasibility of this approach through analysis of synthetic seismograms computed for PREM, 1-, 2.5-, and 3-D ULVZs as well as heterogeneous structures with a strong increase in velocity in the lowermost mantle in 1- and 2.5-D. We find that the sample entropy technique may be useful across a wide range of epicentral distances from 100° to 130°. Such an analysis, when applied to real waveforms, could provide coverage of roughly 85% by surface area of the CMB.</jats:p>"

The predicted failure loads were in good agreement with test results. An important finding is that the cure stresses in the foam are significant and should not be ignored. Additionally, the analysis correctly predicted the failure initiation location, which was verified using high speed photography during the tensile test.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hyperspectral drill-core scanning adds value to exploration campaigns by providing continuous, high-resolution mineralogical data over the length of entire boreholes. However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.</jats:p>"

The as-deposited film showed x-ray diffraction patterns corresponding to the B2 ordering. Annealing at 600 and 700 °C after the deposition resulted in the appearance of the (111) diffraction peak, which is characteristic of the L21 ordering. Although anomalous Hall conductivity and transverse thermoelectric conductivity decreased from those of the as-deposited film with the annealing-induced L21 ordering, the low anomalous Hall conductivity of the 700 °C-annealed film was consistent with the theoretically estimated low value. These results show the significant influence of crystalline ordering on the electrical and thermoelectric transport properties. The annealing process is beneficial for studying the exotic physics arising from topological band features in the L21-ordered Co2FeSn thin films.</jats:p>",

Therefore, based on E. tarda’s integrated core complete sequenced genomes, the study aimed to design a subunit vaccine based on T and B cell epitopes employing immunoinformatics approach. Initially, the top immunodominant and antigenic epitopes were predicted from the core complete sequenced genomes of the E. tarda genome and designed the vaccine by using linkers and adjuvant. In addition, vaccine 3D structure was predicted followed by refinement, and molecular docking was performed for the analysis of interacting residues between vaccines with TLR5, MHC-I, and MHC-II, respectively. The final vaccine constructs demonstrated strong hydrogen bond interactions. Molecular dynamic simulation of vaccine-TLR5 receptor complex showed a stable structural binding and compactness. Furthermore, E. coli used as a model organism for codon optimization proved optimal GC content and CAI value, which were subsequently cloned in vector pET2+ (a). Overall, the findings of the study imply that the designed epitope vaccine might be a good option for prophylaxis for E. tarda.</jats:p>"

The prestressing strands will not be fully developed near the ends of the hollow‐core units, which significantly affects the shear capacity and makes them prone to transverse and web cracking under deformation demands. In addition, initial end slip of the strands caused during cutting of the units in the production process may exacerbate this effect. This vulnerability of hollow‐core slabs was remarked during the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, where an estimated 22% of the damaged buildings presented transverse cracking to hollow‐core units, sometimes accompanied by evident web cracking. The observed damaged, produced by earthquake‐imposed deformations, highlighted the urgency to advance the understanding of the behavior of hollow‐core floors. Subsequently, an experimental testing program was initiated to investigate the properties of extruded concrete and the shear strength of hollow‐core units under different shear span‐to‐depth or aspect ratios. The 200 mm deep specimens were loaded well beyond the peak shear force to study the postpeak behavior of the hollow‐core units. Additionally, the present study evaluates the effect of initial end slip of the prestressing strands on the pre and postpeak capacity of the units. The results obtained are compared against the formulations provided by commonly used design standards such as the New Zealand concrete standard NZS3101:2006, the ACI 318‐19, as well as the fib Model Code 2010 and the BS EN 1168:2005.</jats:p>",

During endochondral ossification, two general types of chondrocytes differentiate. Immature chondrocytes (IMM) represent the early stages of cartilage differentiation, while mature chondrocytes (MAT) undergo additional stages of differentiation, including hypertrophy and stimulating matrix mineralization and degradation. Venn diagram analyses generally revealed a high degree of conservation between chondrocyte transcriptomes of the limb and head, including<jats:italic>SOX9</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>COL2A1</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>ACAN</jats:italic>expression.

Gene co-expression network (GCN) analyses of limb and head chondrocyte transcriptomes estimated the core GRN governing cartilage differentiation. Two discrete portions of the GCN contained genes that were differentially expressed in limb or head chondrocytes, but these genes were enriched for biological processes related to limb/forelimb morphogenesis or neural crest-dependent processes, respectively, perhaps simply reflecting the embryonic origin of the cells. A core GRN driving cartilage differentiation in limb and head was revealed that included typical chondrocyte differentiation and maturation markers, as well as putative novel “chondrocyte” genes. Conservation of a core transcriptional program during chondrocyte differentiation in both the limb and head suggest that the same core GRN was co-opted when cartilage appeared in different regions of the skeleton during vertebrate evolution.</jats:p>"

Although metal‐organic framework nanoparticles (nanoMOFs) as carriers can support drug delivery, achieving the synergy of aqueous lubrication and stimuli‐responsive drug release is challenging. In this work, a core‐shell nanoMOFs@poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) microgel hybrid via one‐pot soap‐free emulsion polymerization is developed. Programmable growth of the PNIPAm microgel layer on the surface of nanoMOFs is achieved by tuning the concentration of the monomer and the crosslinker in the reaction. Reversible swelling‐collapsing behaviors of the hybrid are realized by tuning the temperature below and above the lower critical solution temperature. When used as water lubrication additives, the hybrid enables reductions in both the coefficient of friction and wear volume. In vitro thermal‐responsive drug release is demonstrated on the diclofenac sodium‐loaded hybrid by controlling the swelling and collapsing states of the PNIPAm nanolayer. Moreover, the good biocompatibility of the hybrid is verified by culturing toward HeLa and BEAS‐2B cells. These results establish a nanoMOFs@microgel hybrid that can achieve friction and wear reduction and thermal‐responsive drug release.</jats:p>",

Past research in this area tends to foreground either the curriculum or teachers' practices. We propose a more comprehensive view of science instruction, one that requires attention to teachers' practice, the instructional task, and students' engagement. In this study, by examining the implementation of the same lesson across three different classrooms, our analysis of classroom videos and artifacts of students' work revealed how the interaction of teachers' practices, students' intellectual engagement, and a cognitively demanding task together support rigorous instruction. Our analyses shed light on their interaction that shapes opportunities for students' thinking and sensemaking throughout the trajectory of a science lesson.

Reservoir oil saturation is the fraction of the porosity of a zone occupied by oil. The trapping may increase with the increase of porosity. Oil reservoirs represent a significant fraction of the reservoirs in the world-wide. We try to make a reservoir evaluation using petrophysical analysis of well logs and core samples at Issaran Field, South Gharib Formation, West of the Gulf of Suez, southeast Egypt. This area was heavily influenced by the structural setting of the Gulf of Suez’s central province, which is characterized by major SW dipping faults with a regional stratigraphic dip toward the NE. The high structural blocks are located in the center of the research area, and the low structural region is located in the southwest. South Gharib Formation is primarily composed of carbonates with few sulfates that grade upwards into sulfate-rich beds in the upper part. Laminated dolomitic limestone, with evaporites grades, changes downward into laminated dolomitic limestone and marly limestone, in the lower part.

Previous studies have suggested that wheat cultivation likely became widespread prior to or during the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). Here, we tested this hypothesis by applying archeobotanical tools to plant remains found in five pottery model granaries (<jats:italic>cang</jats:italic>) entombed in a newly excavated late Western Han burial at the Longzaocun cemetery in the Guanzhong Basin. This analysis allowed us to explore the extent of wheat expansion and agricultural strategies in the heartland of early dynastic China. Macro- and micro-botanical evidence shows that the Longzaocun residents consumed two kinds of crops: foxtail and common millet. Combining these findings with previous studies, we argue that millet-based multi-crop farming dominated the regional agricultural system during the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 8) and analyze the political and cultural motivations for the Han people’s usage on millet crops from the burial concepts and fiscal systems. Echoing previous studies, we argue that millets remained the most valuable subsistence food for inhabitants of the Loess Basins in the Han core, and that wheat was not cultivated on a large scale in this area during the Western Han Dynasty.</jats:p>"

Leakage is a common problem in reservoir construction, and the leakage amount, which not only affects the economic benefits of the project, but also relates to the safety of the dam body, is difficult to estimate. According to Darcy’s law and stable seepage theory, an analytical method can be proposed to calculate the leakage of the clay core dam to gain the seepage flux in a short time. By making some reasonable assumptions, we propose formulae for seepage calculation in different conditions of the position of the groundwater levels, below or above the reservoir bottom. Both sets of formulae contain two parts of leakage calculation, i.e., leakage from the reservoir bottom and leakage from the dam body. By using the proposed analytical method, the leakage of clay core dams can be estimated considering the influence of the groundwater level. To prove the rationality of the analytical method, a simple numerical model can be established using Geo-studio 2020 to calculate the seepage flux of the clay core dam, where relative errors between numerical solutions and analytical solutions are less than 10%. To verify the feasibility in engineering applications, the proposed method was applied to calculate the seepage of a clay core dam in Sichuan, China, which was also calculated using numerical methods by establishing a three-dimensional model. The results show the rationality of the analytical method, which can strike a balance between precision and efficiency.</jats:p>"

Electron-phonon interactions induce the formation of a polaron, which is a charge carrier dressed with a phonon cloud. The details of polaron formation are crucial for carrier transport since polaron formation leads to a larger effective mass of a carrier. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding the physics of polaron formation in halide perovskites, but the details are still under active debate. While the Fröhlich interaction plays an essential role in ionic crystals, we also need to consider the strong phonon anharmonicity of halide perovskites that may lead to the formation of an unconventional polaron. In this review article, we discuss the uniqueness of perovskite semiconductors from the viewpoint of electron-phonon interactions. We review the experimental results and the proposed models concerning the effective carrier mass and carrier mobility. Finally, we briefly explain two physical phenomena related to strong electron-phonon interactions: strong anti-Stokes photoluminescence and slow hot-carrier cooling.</jats:p>",

The study aims to define the core promoter of CCKAR, and to identify variants associated with expression activity. A 21 kb region around the CCKAR was re-sequenced to detect sequence variants. A series of 5′-deleted promoter plasmids were constructed to define the core promoter of CCKAR. The effects of sequence variants located in promoter (PSNP) and conserved (CSNP) regions on promoter activity were analyzed by comparing luciferase activity between haplotypes. A total of 182 variants were found in the 21 kb region. There were no large structural variants around CCKAR. pNL−328/+183, the one with the shortest insertion, showed the highest activity among the six promoter constructs, implying that the key cis elements regulating CCKAR expression are mainly distributed 328 bp upstream. We detected significant activity differences between high- and low-growth associated haplotypes in four of the six promoter constructs. The high-growth haplotypes of constructs pNL−1646/+183, pNL−799/+183 and pNL−528/+183 showed lower activities than the low-growth haplotypes, which is consistent with decreased expression of CCKAR in high-growth chickens. Lower expression of the high-growth allele was also detected for the CSNP5-containing construct. The data suggest that the core promoter of CCKAR is located the 328 bp region upstream from the transcription start site. Lower expression activities shown by the high-growth haplotypes in the reporter assay suggest that CSNP5 and variants located between 328 bp and 1646 bp upstream form a promising molecular basis for decreased expression of CCKAR and increased growth in chickens.</jats:p>"

We aimed to determine if automated CT perfusion (CTP) is non-inferior to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in predicting the acute infarct core. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1960 to December 2020. Five outcome measures were examined: volumetric difference, volumetric correlation, sensitivity and specificity at the patient level, Dice coefficient, and sensitivity and specificity at the voxel level. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed for volumetric difference and correlation. Results: From 3,986 studies retrieved, 48 studies met our inclusion criteria with 46 studies on anterior circulation, one study on posterior circulation, and one study on lacunar infarct strokes. In anterior circulation stroke, there were no significant mean volumetric differences between CTP and acute DWI (cerebral blood flow [CBF] 0.52 mL, 95% CI [−0.07, 1.11], I2 0.0%; relative CBF [rCBF] 3.01 mL, 95% CI [−0.46, 6.48], I2 82.6%; relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV] −12.84 mL, 95% CI [−38.56, 12.88], I2 96.2%) and between CTP and delayed DWI or FLAIR (rCBF −1.29 mL, 95% CI [−6.49, 3.92], I2 91.8%; rCBV −5.80 mL, 95% CI [−16.20, 4.60], I2 84.2%). Mean correlation between CTP and acute DWI was 0.90 (95% CI [0.80, 0.95], I2 60.0%) for rCBF and 0.84 (95% CI [0.58, 0.94], I2 93.5%) for rCBV. Mean correlation between CTP and delayed DWI or FLAIR was 0.74 (95% CI [0.57, 0.85], I2 94.6%) for rCBF and 0.90 (95% CI [0.69, 0.97], I2 93.1%) for rCBV. Sensitivity and specificity at the patient level were reported by three studies and Dice coefficient by four studies. Statistical analysis could not be performed for sensitivity and specificity at the voxel level. Limited evidence was available for posterior circulation or lacunar infarct strokes. Conclusion: Due to significant heterogeneity and insufficient high-quality studies reporting each outcome, there is insufficient evidence to reliably determine the accuracy of CTP prediction of the infarct core compared to DWI or FLAIR. </jats:p>"

Line-flux ratios as a function of time were investigated with differences identified between the transient classes, in particular the Type II SNe were found to have distinct line-flux ratios compared to stripped-envelope (SE) SNe. No correlation was found between the [Ca ii]/[O i] flux ratios of SE-SNe and their ejecta masses and kinetic energies (as measured from light-curve modelling), suggesting that there may be a contribution from an additional power source in more luminous SE-SNe. We found that the mean characteristic width of the [Ca ii] emission line is less than the [O i] emission line for all SN types, indicating that the [Ca ii] emission typically originates from deeper in the ejecta than [O i]. This is in some tension with standard models for emission in Type II SNe. The emission line properties of Type II SNe were also compared to theoretical models and found to favour lower mass tracks (MZAMS&amp;lt; 15 M⊙), with no evidence found for significant mixing of 56Ni into the H envelope nor Ca mixed into the O shell. The flux ratios of some superluminous SNe were found to be similar to those of SE-SNe when scaling to account for their longer rise times was applied (although we caution the sample size is small).</jats:p>",

Resistance is often connected to the overexpression of the specific kinases that are involved in DNA damage response. Contrary, their inhibition could lead to augmented cancer cell sensitization to conventional approach. Among them, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), the major replication stress responder, is one of the most attractive target. Within this study our aim was to find novel chemosensitizing agents for the cancer treatment employment. Inspired by clinical candidates targeting ATR, we designed and prepared large library of 40 novel compounds utilizing 7-azaindoles, 2,7-diazaindoles, and 1H-pyrazoles as core structures. Initially, our presumption to have ATR inhibitors were confirmed by molecular dynamic study. All the compounds alone or in combination with cisplatin were screened against panel of nine cancer cell lines and one healthy cell line. The results were compared with well-known ATR inhibitor VE-821. Several compounds significantly inhibit the cell viability and some were able to potentiate cisplatin effect. From structure-activity relationship point of view, 7-azaindoles were the most cytotoxic compounds when substituted in position 3 and 5. Contrary, 2,7-diazaindoles expressed the most potent chemosensitizing capabilities. 1H-Pyrazoles were the least potent compounds within this screen. Interestingly, the status of tumor suppressor protein p53 (defect in G1) did not significantly influence chemosensitization or cytotoxic effect. Three highlighted compounds 3, 22, and 29 were selected for Broad oncology panel screening containing 104 kinases which could be potentially targeted. Only compound 29, the 2,7-diazaindole representative, showed ATR inhibitory efficacy with the IC50 around 10 µM. In contrast, the compound 22, 7-azaindole and the most cytotoxic one, expressed the multi-kinase activity with the substantial inhibitory capability against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 protein (VEGFR-3). VEGFR-3 is also very attractive anticancer target with several inhibitors already approved. Finally, several compounds showed chemosensitizing potencies for temozolomide against secondary astrocytoma cell line. In overall, we showed that both, 7-azaindoles, and 2,7-diazaindoles, could be effectively utilized as novel anticancer agents. Whereas 2,7-diazaindoles could become efficient ATR inhibitors, 7-azaindoles have potential as antiangiogenics, VEGFR-3 inhibitors. Besides, both structures could be used for a glioblastoma treatment as temozolomide sensitizers. More research is currently ongoing to fully exploit potential of these compounds.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Lukas Gorecki, Darina Muthna, Sara Merdita, Martin Andrs, Tomas Kucera, Tereza Kobrlova, Martina Rezacova, Jan Korabecny.

This principle enables us to measure, for instance, magnetic and electric fields, as well as local temperature with nanometer resolution in conjunction with a scanning probe microscope (SPM). However, the time resolution of conventional quantum sensing technologies has been limited to microseconds due to the limited luminescence lifetime. Here, we investigate ultrafast opto-magnetic effects in diamond crystals containing NV centers to improve the time resolution of quantum sensing to sub-picosecond time scales. The spin ensemble from diamond NV centers induces an inverse Cotton–Mouton effect (ICME) in the form of a sub-picosecond optical response in a femtosecond pump–probe measurement. The helicity and quadratic power dependence of the ICME can be interpreted as a second-order opto-magnetic effect in which ensembles of NV electron spins act as a source for the ICME. The results provide fundamental guidelines for enabling high-resolution spatial-time quantum sensing technologies when combined with SPM techniques.</jats:p>",

However, they usually contain defects following the pressing process, such as burrs. Therefore, additional trimming is usually required, despite the deformation challenges and difficulty in positioning. This paper proposes an ultrafast laser processing system for trimming complex ceramic structural parts. Opto-electromechanical cooperative control software is developed to control the laser processing system. The trimming problem of the ceramic cores used in aero engines is studied. The regional registration method is introduced based on the iterative closest point algorithm to register the path extracted from the computer-aided design model with the deformed ceramic core. A zonal and layering processing method for three-dimensional contours on complex surfaces is proposed to generate the working data of high-speed scanning galvanometer and the computer numerical control machine tool, respectively. The results show that the laser system and the method proposed in this paper are suitable for trimming complex non-datum parts such as ceramic cores. Compared with the results of manual trimming, the method proposed in this paper has higher accuracy, efficiency, and yield. The method mentioned above has been used in practical application with satisfactory results.</jats:p>",

Here, the intrinsic role of the peculiar structure is revealed by comparing representative A‐DA′D‐A acceptor Y6 with its A‐D‐A counterparts having different fusion modes. Owing to the more delocalized HOMO and deeper LUMO level, Y6 exhibits stronger and red‐shifted absorption relative to the linear and angular fused A‐D‐A acceptors, respectively. Moreover, the change from linear to angular fusion substantially reduces the electron‐vibration couplings, which is responsible for the faster exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport for Y6 than the linear fused A‐D‐A acceptor. Notably, the electron‐vibration coupling for exciton dissociation is further decreased by introducing the electron‐deficient core, thus contributing to the efficient charge generation under low driving forces in the Y6‐based devices.</jats:p>",

Cases presentation: Case 1: 66-year-old woman with a left breast mass who underwent a CNB without complications. Around eleven months later, she noticed a palpable and pulsatile mass in her left breast. She was diagnosed with a PA (1.6x1.3 cm) by means of a Doppler ultrasound (US) and a breast magnetic resonance imaging, which was surgically resected without any complication using local anesthesia. Case 2: 44-year-old woman with a left breast mass. After undergoing CNB, she developed ecchymosis and a palpable and pulsatile mass in her left breast. A Doppler US showed a 1.4x0.7 cm cystic lesion suggestive of a breast PA. The mass was surgically resected without complications using local anesthesia and sedation. Conclusion: Breast PA is an extremely rare complication of CNB, with only 17 cases reported in PubMed to date. However, breast PA must be highly suspected in the presence of warning signs such as bleeding, hematoma and a palpable and/or pulsatile breast mass after undergoing CNB.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, synthesized catalysts were determined and characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) procedures. The [Fe3O4@SiO2-L–Cu(II)] was used for the reduction of Cr(VI), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and organic dyes such as Congo Red (CR) and methylene blue (MB) in aqueous media. Catalytic performance studies showed that the [Fe3O4@SiO2–L–Cu(II)] has excellent activity toward reduction reactions under mild conditions. Remarkable attributes of this method are high efficiency, removal of a homogeneous catalyst, easy recovery from the reaction mixture, and uncomplicated route. The amount of activity in this catalytic system was almost constant after several stages of recovery and reuse. The results show that the catalyst was easily separated and retained 83% of its efficiency after five cycles without considerable loss of activity and stability.</jats:p>"

Occurrence of common core structure and genotype-specific signatures among the Vibrio of environmentally diverse vended crabs and shrimps from selected Lagos seafood markets, Nigeria. Biodiversitas 23: 3081-3090. This study investigated the occurrence of Vibrio species from the gastrointestinal tract of vended crabs and shrimps using Multiplex polymerase chain reactions (Multiplex PCR) method. Different primer pairs were used to detect the presence of hsp, sodB, SodB-R, ctx, toxR, and Vchol virulent genes in the samples. The phylogenetic relationships among the Vibrio species were determined and the polymorphic information content of selected Vibrio primer products was generated using Powermarker V3.25 Dendo-UPGMA program based on Jaccard’s coefficient. The detection of Vibrio virulence genes confirmed the presence of Vibrio species in the DNA extracts of 19 out of the 60 crustacean samples. Among the Vibrio species, Vibrio parahaemolyticus was the most frequently identified species (47.4%), followed by Vibrio cholerae (36.8%), and Vibrio mimicus (15.8%), while the presence of Vibrio vulnificus was not detected in the crab and shrimp samples. Phylogenetically, the Vp.tdh primer constituted the highest allele number, gene diversity and polymorphic information content of 18.00, 0.9444 and 0.9415, respectively, while the mean of the Vp.tdh and Vp.trh primer sequence combination was polymorphic (0.7153). Among the 19 positive Vibrio strains, different major clusters and subclusters were identified, indicating the relatedness between the identified species. The result of this study indicates that the innocuously vended crab and shrimp samples are indeed reservoirs of pathogenic Vibrio species whose consumption by humans might affect the health of the general populace.</jats:p>"

Specimens containing 5wt. % of microcapsules were fabricated to calculate the elastic modulus, and maximum tensile stress, and to validate numerical results. To consider the error, five tests were performed for all samples, and results were reported on average. The average errors between the numerical outcomes and experimental results were 4.74% and 5.35% for maximum tensile stress and elastic modulus, respectively. The coaxial electrospraying method was used for synthesizing microcapsules made of alginate (shell) and epoxy (core). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to calculate the diameter of the capsules. To develop an empirical model for the average microcapsule diameter (AMD) and carry out the optimization process, response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design was used. Also, analysis of variance was employed to validate the accuracy of the model. The effects of three parameters, including voltage, needle size, and the distance between the tip of the needle to the collector, on average microcapsule diameter, were investigated. The empirical model was validated by a confirmation run, and the determined error (1.93%) between the predicted and experimental results indicates the precision of the model. The numerical study indicated that microcapsule-based self-healing polymers containing smaller microcapsules tolerate higher stresses. However, the effect of the microcapsules’ size on the elastic modulus of a representative volume element was negligible. </jats:p>",

At the Newcrest Cadia East mine, systematic point load testing (PLT) was used to measure the strength of intact rock and individual defects (e.g., veins) at regular closely spaced intervals along several boreholes. The systematic PLT data collection covers only 1.3% of the 590 km of hole logged at Cadia East. A procedure was developed to homogenize the available geotechnical and geological logging data, infill missing values, and encode raw data into engineered features for use in a machine learning model. A random forest classifier was applied to predict point load index (Is50) from core logging data where tests were not performed. The random forest model predicts the rolling average Is50 value within 1 MPa 48% of the time. The model gives insights into which core logging quantities have the strongest controls on rock strength and provides the basis for developing more detailed geospatial models of intact and defected rock strength.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>1.

At the Newcrest Cadia East mine, there are 590 kilometers of logged core. Having measurements or estimates of point load index at every meter along each core enables the production of geospatial models of rock strength for use in predictive models. While point load testing is relatively quick and inexpensive, performing point load tests at a tight spacing along 590 km of core would be costly and impractical (see ASTM, 2016 and Franklin, 1985).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Systematic point load testing (PLT) was used to measure rock strength based on guidelines provided by Pierce Engineering (Pierce, 2019; Pierce, 2020). It offers a means to quantify the variability in both intact and structural tensile strength over the largest possible volume with a minimum of bias. It involves performing diametral point load tests at strict 1-2m intervals along core from multiple boreholes and taking care to recognize both structure (which requires careful alignment of the test platens in order to test the strength of the structure itself) and pre-disturbed sections of core (which should be registered as having zero tensile strength, unless marked as an induced break). Axial tests are also conducted periodically to check for anisotropy. The testing is carried out in accordance with ISRM standards (ISRM, 1989), with careful attention paid to the maintenance of the radius of curvature on testing points to ensure a high proportion of valid tests.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Magnetic nanoparticles with a core of magnetite of 13 nm diameter covered with a shell of dopamine (1.1 nm thickness) are studied through vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulations, and analytical equations. All parameters involved in the theoretical analysis are experimentally determined, namely, the magnetic moment, temperature, magnetic field, core diameter, shell thickness, magnetic anisotropy, and particle concentration. The dependence of the magnetization with the magnetic field obtained through VSM and MC shows a 1% discrepancy in the magnetic saturation and up to 40% in the initial magnetic susceptibility. However, the dependence of the magnetization with the temperature obtained by MC indicates that the MNPs obey the Curie law above a critical temperature of 100 K, and dipolar interactions play an important role in the interval 20 &lt; T &lt; 100 K. That critical temperature is very close to the blocking temperature measured following the zero-field-cooled and zero-cooled protocols, where the dipolar interactions between MNPs become significant.

The effects of wettability on capillary forces, fluid distribution, and oil mobilization are of great interest for understanding waterflooding and water-based EOR processes such as Smart Water injection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Two strongly water-wet and three reduced water-wet chalk cores containing Swi = 20% and 80 % non-wetting mineral oil were used in this study. Spontaneous imbibition (SI) experiments were used to assess the wettability of restored core material and forced imbibition (FI) tests were carried out to capture fluid flow behavior under a viscous force dominated environment. Oil recovery and pressure drop profiles, start and endpoint core saturations and pressure drops were collected in front of and during FI tests with formation water (FW) as injection fluid to avoid any chemical induced wettability alteration. The SI oil recovery results showed that the cores exposed to crude oil possessed reduced water wetness compared to the strongly water-wet reference cores. The FI oil recovery results showed only small differences in oil production profiles and ultimate recoveries. The oil recovery profiles displayed a piston-like displacement indicating that oil recovery was controlled by capillary forces at the injection rate used.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>SENDRA was used to simulate the effect of wettability on relative permeability and capillary pressure curves for the strongly to reduced water-wet cores from FI processes. On average, higher oil relative permeability end points and lower water relative permeability end points were measured for the strongly water-wet cores compared to the cores reduced in water-wetness. The core scale simulation with SENDRA indicates continuous production of water and oil taking infinite time to reach residual oil saturation, however, the end of production was reached at a finite time in the experiments. A history matching approach based only on single rate injection did not yield reliable results, partly, because the capillary and viscous forces cannot easily be separated in the history matching process. This affects estimates of residual oil saturation and water end points of relative permeability.</jats:p>",

Deep-UV SPR under aqueous medium was excited with Kretschmann configuration by using a sapphire prism. Deep-UV SPR is one of the promising techniques for high-sensitive autofluorescence imaging of living cells without staining. Label-free observation is significant for the structural analysis of living cells. We demonstrated the high-sensitive autofluorescence imaging of living yeast cells with deep-UV SPR. We applied a high refractive index prism, such as sapphire, which is suitable for the observation of specimens in aqueous medium, to excite deep-UV SPR. Although typical autofluorescence from living cells is buried in background noise, deep-UV SPR enhances the autofluorescence signal. The deep-UV SPR excitation of an aluminum thin film through a sapphire prism was investigated theoretically and experimentally. It showed that the fluorescence intensities are increased 2.8-fold. Deep-UV SPR enhanced the autofluorescence of cell structures, and yeast cells were found to be very sensitive. As a result, for water-immersed specimens, the sapphire-prism-based Kretschmann configuration excited SPR in deep-UV. Findings from this study suggest that deep-UV SPR can be considered an effective technique for attaining high-sensitivity observation of biological samples.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Psoriasis is an inflammatory autoimmune skin disease with various clinical manifestations. The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of East Asian herbal medicine (EAHM) for inflammatory skin lesions in psoriasis and to explore core herbal materials for drug discovery. A comprehensive search was conducted in 10 electronic databases for randomized controlled trials from their inception until 29 July 2021. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.1.2 and R studio. When heterogeneity in studies was detected, the cause was identified through sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis. Methodological quality was independently assessed using the revised tool for risk of bias in randomized trials. A total of 56 trials with 4966 psoriasis patients met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis favored EAHM monotherapy on Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 70 (RR: 1.2845; 95% CI: 1.906 to 1.3858, p &lt; 0.0001), PASI 60 (RR: 1.1923; 95% CI: 1.1134 to 1.2769, p &lt; 0.0001), continuous PASI score (MD: −2.3386, 95% CI: −3.3068 to −1.3704, p &lt; 0.0001), IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α, and Dermatology Life Quality Index. Patients treated with EAHM monotherapy had significantly reduced adverse events incidence rate. In addition, based on additional examination of the herb data included in this meta-analysis, 16 core materials were identified. They are utilized in close proximity to one another, and all have anti-inflammatory properties. The findings in this study support that oral EAHM monotherapy may be beneficial for inflammatory skin lesions in psoriasis. Meanwhile, the identified core materials are expected to be utilized as useful drug candidate hypotheses through follow-up studies on individual pharmacological activities and synergistic effects.</jats:p>"

Therefore, proper diagnosis is very essential for appropriate treatment. Biopsy and FNAC plays important role in diagnosing these cases. After 2004 with establishment of therapeutic implication of distinguishing histologic subtypes of lung carcinoma with immunohistochemistry, lung biopsy has become inevitable even for molecular analysis as well. We studied our institution’s experience with percutaneous CT guided biopsy of lung nodules to determine the impact of this procedure in diagnosis of disease.\nMethods: This is hospital based descriptive study, of two years’ duration (March 2019 to April 2021), carried out at Department of Pathology, B&amp;C Medical College Teaching Hospital and Research Centre Pvt. Ltd., Birtamode, Jhapa. Total 97 cases of CT guided biopsy were performed. Histopathologic analysis was performed and data were analyzed.\nResults: The most common malignancy diagnosed was Non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC), lung comprising 43.7% which required further immunohistochemistry testing for subcategorization. All infective cases were of Tuberculosis constituting 9.37% of all the cases. Benign cases were of mature cystic teratoma, thymoma and fibroma.\nConclusions: Nowadays biopsy of lung in suspicious lesion is mandatory to establish diagnosis for appropriate management, moreover in malignancy cases for which most of the cases require immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis.</jats:p>"

Here, the properties of photo‐excited InP/ZnSe QDs are investigated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. It is shown that the evolution of the band‐edge bleach with increasing exciton number can be interpreted as state filling of the conduction‐ and valence‐band edge states by delocalized electrons and holes. In line with this interpretation, net stimulated emission is observed once the average exciton number exceeds 1. The authors account for this lower‐than‐expected gain threshold and the spectral properties of the gain band by reckoning that the Stokes shift between band‐edge absorption and emission is the dominant spectral shift. The underlying exciton–phonon coupling leads to a stimulated emission mechanism, where also single excitons can lead to net optical gain. To fully profit from this advantageous stimulated emission scheme, it is argued that InP/ZnSe QDs with more narrow emission lines are needed and spurious trapping of electron–hole pairs at high exciton numbers must be suppressed, for example, by better controlling the composition of the core/shell interface.</jats:p>",

The radial neutron flux distribution and maximum to average flux ratio were studied. The lowest flux ratio was found in annular-2 models, whereas TRU models showed the highest value. The effect of enrichment, fuel burnup, moderator to fuel ratio, and soluble boron concentration on effective multiplication factor (keff) was investigated. Burnup analysis of fissionable materials and neutron poison was performed. Burnup-dependent fission rate of U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241 was also studied. The composition of spent fuel at end of the cycle (EOC) was investigated and lower minor actinides (MAs) production was observed for TRU models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses how an integrated data-driven analytics (DDA), mechanistic petrophysical and mineralogical modeling can enhance the characterization of reservoirs selected for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) projects. The approach makes use of exhaustive core datasets to generate synthetic mineralogical curves at wells, hence expanding the available log information. This allows a robust and complete quantitative analysis of storage and sealing intervals through a DDA-informed physics-based methodology.  The growth of interest around CCUS pushes towards in-depth analyses of reservoir layers, as well as of the sealing ones. In brown fields the available open-hole (OH) logs might not be enough for a detailed lithological and petrophysical characterization, which is mandatory to establish the storage capacity of the assets. Hence, the proposed methodology starts from X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) core data representative of the field under investigation for both reservoir and non-reservoir sections. Next, DDA is used to generate synthetic volumetric fractions of given minerals after an ensemble learning relating core mineralogy and selected logs. The DDA-based log mineralogy and the other available OH logs are then input for conventional mechanistic models to obtain final petrophysical and mineralogical properties.  The added value is demonstrated through a real case study, where a CCUS project is ongoing for a mature field. From the mineralogical standpoint, experimental studies performed for several cored wells show a wide composition variety with different coexisting phases including carbonates, silicates, feldspars, micas and clays. The main criticality is represented by the OH log datasets that are often incomplete and ineffective to provide a straightforward formation evaluation consistent with the complexity highlighted by core analyses. Therefore, after the calibration of the ensemble learner with hundreds of XRD data, high-frequency dielectric and reprocessed nuclear logs, the DDA steps have been successfully applied to about a hundred wells for obtaining synthetic mineralogical curves. These augment the information of the available measured logs and allow the definition of a physics-based interpretation model able to properly characterize both the reservoir and caprock layers. In addition, the most reactive facies to carbon dioxide are recognized and represent another significant step forward to evaluate the sealing efficiency and integrity over time at field scale.  The presented workflow is deemed able to provide a strong mineralogical and petrophysical characterization template in case of incomplete/not exhaustive wellbore dataset. The outcomes are fundamental for several aspects in CCUS projects, including reservoir modeling, geomechanics, geochemistry, monitoring phases and risk management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The influence of core–hole delocalization for x-ray photoelectron, x-ray absorption, and x-ray emission spectrum calculations is investigated in detail using approaches including response theory, transition-potential methods, and ground state schemes. The question of a localized/delocalized vacancy is relevant for systems with symmetrically equivalent atoms, as well as near-degeneracies that can distribute the core orbitals over several atoms. We show that the issues relating to core–hole delocalization are present for calculations considering explicit core–hole states, e.g., when using a core-excited or core-ionized reference state or for fractional occupation numbers. As electron correlation eventually alleviates the issues, but even when using coupled-cluster single-double and perturbative triple, there is a notable discrepancy between core-ionization energies obtained with localized and delocalized core–holes (0.5 eV for the carbon K-edge). Within density functional theory, the discrepancy correlates with the exchange interaction involving the core orbitals of the same spin symmetry as the delocalized core–hole. The use of a localized core–hole allows for a reasonably good inclusion of relaxation at a lower level of theory, whereas the proper symmetry solution involving a delocalized core–hole requires higher levels of theory to account for the correlation effects involved in orbital relaxation. For linear response methods, we further show that if x-ray absorption spectra are modeled by considering symmetry-unique sets of atoms, care has to be taken such that there are no delocalizations of the core orbitals, which would otherwise introduce shifts in absolute energies and relative features.</jats:p>",

We tightly integrate such static scheduling for stream processing applications with design space exploration of the best heterogeneous core combination, and solve the resulting combined optimization problem by an integer linear program (ILP).

Novel methodologies to close the knowledge gap in veterinary dentistry need to be identified. Typodonts (dental models) are commonly used in human dental schools to teach basic principles prior to practice on clinical patients and have been shown to be an effective teaching tool. The study aimed to determine if independent study and self-guided practice on a veterinary typodont prior to a structured, in-person cadaver laboratory with feedback increases students’ perceived dentistry clinical skills in performing periodontal techniques. We calculated the knowledge gap before and after the cadaver laboratory by comparing the students’ perceived and desired skill levels in performing periodontal charting, ultrasonic cleaning, hand scaling, and root planing. Ninety-six percent of students reported that practice with the dental typodont prior to the cadaver laboratory increased their comfort level in performing periodontal skills. However, practice did not result in a significant decrease in knowledge gap compared with participation in the cadaver laboratory alone. Although students perceived a benefit to practicing with the typodont, self-guided practice was not effective in decreasing the knowledge gap, most likely due to a lack of structured feedback with typodont use. Further investigation into the use of typodonts with direct feedback prior to structured laboratory or, alternatively, as an additional practice tool following a structured laboratory would further define if there is a benefit to typodont practice in veterinary dentistry. </jats:p>",

After the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal reaffirmed this contractarian position in Zhang Hong Li v DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd [2019] HKCFA 45, experts and scholars have recently revived efforts to narrow the scope of anti-Bartlett clauses for beneficiary protection. Their suggestions include the introduction of a non-derogable residual duty and/or an expanded core of trust duties to supervise the trust company’s affairs even in light of the anti-Bartlett clauses. This article submits that there is limited scope for these proposed developments, chiefly because the scope of these suggested duties are incompatible with other trust law concepts and defined without sufficient certainty.</jats:p>",

We show how to calculate photoionization spectra with these methods using the Sternheimer approach formulated in a non-orthogonal B-spline basis set with appropriate frequency-dependent boundary conditions. We illustrate these methods on the photoionization spectrum of the Be atom, focusing, in particular, on the core resonances. Both the TDRSH and TDLRSH photoionization spectra are found to constitute a large improvement over the TDLDA photoionization spectrum and a more modest improvement over the TDHF photoionization spectrum.</jats:p>",

Following the successful reproduction of the dip structure by numerical calculations in previous studies, we present in this paper the physical mechanism of how the dip is formed as a result of the interaction between the gravito-inertial waves in the radiative envelope and the pure inertial waves in the convective core. We analytically describe the wave solutions in both of the radiative envelope and the convective core, and match them at the interface to construct an eigenmode. We have found from the analysis the following points: the dip structure is mainly controlled by a parameter that has an inverse correlation with Brunt–Väisälä frequency at the interface; the depth and the width of the dip is shallower and larger, respectively, as the parameter gets large; the shape of the dip can be approximated by the Lorentzian function; the period at the central position of the dip is equal to or slightly smaller than that of the involved pure inertial mode in the convective core. We have also understood based on the evolutionary models of main-sequence stars that the parameter is inversely correlated with the chemical composition gradient at the convective-core boundary. The dip structure thus would provide information about the poorly-understood physical processes, such as diffusion, convective overshooting and rotational mixing, around the boundary between the convective core and the radiative envelope.</jats:p>",

The unified constitutive model is suitable to describe and predict both the creep and relaxation evolution characteristics of rocks. The generalized Kelvin model is the core element for traditional and improved component models to reflect both the nonlinear creep and relaxation. In this paper, an improved core damage model, which could both reflect the creep and stress relaxation in relation to the damage evolution, was established based on a comparison of the traditional and improved component models, and the responding constitutive equations (creep and stress relaxation equation) at constant stress/strain were deduced. Then, the core damage model was validated to the uniaxial compressive multistage creep and stress relaxation test results of coal, showing that the model curves had great accordance with the experimental data. Moreover, the model comparisons on accuracy, parameter meaning, and popularization among the core damage model, hardening-damage model, and the fractional derivative model were further discussed. The results showed that the parameters in the core damage model had clear and brief physical significances. The core damage model was also popularized to depict the time-dependent behaviors of other rocks, showing great accuracy.</jats:p>"

Due to the unique electrochemical property of AuNRs cores and ultra-porous architecture of ZIF-8 shell, the electrocatalyst would effectively accelerate the electron transfer and greatly improve the electrochemical response of 2-CP. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the oxidation peak current of 2-CP enhanced linearly with the increase of its concentration between 0.010 and 40 μM, and the limit of detection was 3.6 nM based on S/N = 3.

The vast majority of these adult generated cells express the calcium-binding protein Calretinin (CalR), and they migrate towards different OB layers. However, these cells have yet to be fully characterized and hence, to achieve this we injected retroviral particles expressing GFP into the OB core of adult animals and found that the CalR<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>neurons generated from NSCs mainly migrate to the granule cell layer (GCL) and glomerular layer (GL) in similar proportions. In addition, since morphology and function are closely related, we used three-dimensional imaging techniques to analyze the morphology of these adult born cells, describing new subtypes of CalR<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>interneurons based on their dendritic arborizations and projections, as well as their localization in the GCL or GL. We also show that the migration and morphology of these newly generated neurons can be altered by misexpressing the transcription factor Tbr1 in the OB core. Therefore, the morphology acquired by neurons located in a specific OB layer is the result of a combination of both extrinsic (e.g., layer allocation) and intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., transcription factors). Defining the cellular processes and molecular mechanisms that govern adult neurogenesis might help better understand brain circuit formation and plasticity, as well as eventually opening the way to develop strategies for brain repair.</jats:p>"

Key competencies in plastic surgery have been previously identified, however, within the domain of pediatrics, data suggest limited exposure throughout training for Canadian graduates. This study aims to identify the exposure and involvement of residents in core pediatric cases. Methods: We performed a retrospective, multicenter review of plastic surgery resident case logs (T-Res, POWER, New Innovations) across 10 Canadian, English-speaking training programs between 2004 and 2014. Case logs were coded according to the 8 core pediatric competencies previously identified by a modified Delphi technique. Results: A total of 3061 of 59 405 cases (5.2%) logged by 55 graduating residents were core pediatric procedures with an average of 55.6 ± 23.0 cases logged per resident. The top 3 most commonly logged procedures were cleft lip repair, cleft palate repair, and setback otoplasty. The number of cases per program varied widely with the most at 731 and least at 85 logged cases. Roles across procedures have wide variation and residents are most commonly identified as the assistant rather than surgeon or co-surgeon. Conclusion: These findings highlight variability both within and across residency programs with a paucity of exposure and involvement in pediatric plastic surgery cases. This may present a conflict between current recommendations for residency-specific procedural competencies and true clinical exposure. Further curriculum development and simulation may be of benefit. </jats:p>",

The induced or triggered earthquakes can accompany underground and open-pit mining, conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon extraction, geothermal energy production, underground liquid and gas storage including carbon sequestration, impoundment of surface reservoirs of liquids (like artificial lakes of dammed water for hydroelectric plants and ore-floatation waste repositories) and many other technological processes that perturb the boundary conditions in the affected rock (Lasocki and Orlecka-Sikora, 2020).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This study aims to measure a number of markers in the serum of patients with chronic HBV infection and to assess relationships between these markers and BCP/precore mutants with consideration of the stage of fibrosis. The serum levels of resistin, TGF-β1, MMP-1, TIMP-1, collagen IA1 and PDGF-BB, which are markers that are known to be involved in the process of hepatic fibrosis, were assayed. The serum levels of PDGF-BB and TIMP-1, and the mutation profile were independently associated with advanced fibrosis. A higher level of TIMP-1 was associated with advanced fibrosis regardless of the mutation status, and a higher level of PDGF-BB was associated with nonsevere fibrosis in patients infected with viruses harboring the A1762T/G1764A or A1762T/G1764A/G1899A mutations. Our results suggest an impact of the A1762T/G1764A mutant on the biological pathway related to TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB. In vitro studies are needed to understand the impact of these mutants on the serum secretion of markers involved in fibrosis severity.</jats:p>"

Moreover, while CAMKK2 is known to regulate systemic metabolism, whether CAMKK2’s effects on whole-body metabolism would impact prostate cancer progression and/or related comorbidities is not known. Here, we demonstrate that germline ablation of Camkk2 slows, but does not stop, primary prostate tumorigenesis in the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) genetic mouse model. Consistent with prior epidemiological reports supporting a link between obesity and prostate cancer aggressiveness, TRAMP mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited a pronounced increase in the colonization of lung metastases. We demonstrated that this effect on the metastatic spread was dependent on CAMKK2. Notably, diet-induced lung metastases exhibited a highly aggressive neuroendocrine phenotype. Concurrently, Camkk2 deletion improved insulin sensitivity in the same mice. Histological analyses revealed that cancer cells were smaller in the TRAMP;Camkk2−/− mice compared to TRAMP;Camkk2+/+ controls. Given the differences in circulating insulin levels, a known regulator of cell growth, we hypothesized that systemic CAMKK2 could promote prostate cancer cell growth and disease progression in part through cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Accordingly, host deletion of Camkk2 impaired the growth of syngeneic murine prostate tumors in vivo, confirming nonautonomous roles for CAMKK2 in prostate cancer. Cancer cell size and mTOR signaling was diminished in tumors propagated in Camkk2-null mice. Together, these data indicate that, in addition to cancer cell-intrinsic roles, CAMKK2 mediates prostate cancer progression via tumor-extrinsic mechanisms. Further, we propose that CAMKK2 inhibition may also help combat common metabolic comorbidities in men with advanced prostate cancer.</jats:p>"

Seventy six patients were guided by conventional ultrasound, of which 37 received FNA and 39 received CNB. 92 patients were guided by CEUS, of which 41 received FNA and 51 received CNB. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA and CNB guided by conventional ultrasound and CEUS was compared, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FNA and CNB in the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes guided by CEUS were further compared.&#x0D;\nResults: The diagnostic accuracy of FNA and CNB guided by CEUS were higher than that guided by conventional ultrasound, with a statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FNA and CNB in the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes were 95.0%, 95.2%, 95.0%, 95.2%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P&gt;0.05).&#x0D;\nConclusion: CEUS can guide puncture and improve diagnosis accuracy. No statistical difference can be seen in the diagnostic efficacy of CNB and FNA for metastatic lymph nodes, CNB can provide more diagnostic information, while FNA can replace CNB for metastatic lymph nodes adjacent to blood vessels and difficult to operate.&#x0D;\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.38.6.5471&#x0D;\nHow to cite this:Mu W, Li J, Liu Y, Liang H, Liu X.

In recent years, environmental degradation has accelerated soil alkalization, salinization, and water deficit, which have seriously threatened the soybean quality and yield. Chaperone DNAJ proteins play important roles in plant response to a number of abiotic and biotic stresses. Here, we investigated the function of a soybean DNAJ gene, GmDNAJC7, in plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. GmDNAJC7 gene expression was induced by alkaline-salt, salt, and drought treatments in soybean roots, suggesting its possible role in soybean response to these stresses. GmDNAJC7 overexpression improved the alkaline-salt tolerance of soybean composite plants, which showed a higher SPAD (Soil and Plant Analysis Development) value for chlorophyll content and leaf relative water content than the control plants after NaHCO3 treatment. Moreover, the GmDNAJC7 overexpressing Arabidopsis had a higher germination rate and average root length than the wild type and dnajc7 mutant, under NaHCO3, NaCl, and mannitol stresses, indicating that the ectopic expression of the GmDNAJC7 gene enhanced the alkaline-salt, salt, and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis. These findings suggest that GmDNAJC7 is involved in the alkaline-salt, salt, and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis and soybean. This study provides new insights into the role of DNAJ proteins in plant tolerance to abiotic stress.</jats:p>"

Most demonstrations only implement inference in photonics for offline-trained neural network models. On the other hand, artificial neural networks are one of the most deployed algorithms, while other machine learning algorithms such as supporting vector machine (SVM) remain unexplored in photonics. Here, inspired by SVM, we propose to implement projection-based classification principle by constructing nonlinear mapping functions in silicon photonic circuits and experimentally demonstrate on-chip bacterial foraging training for this principle to realize single Boolean logics, combinational Boolean logics, and Iris classification with ~96.7 − 98.3 per cent accuracy. This approach can offer comparable performances to artificial neural networks for various benchmarks even with smaller scales and without leveraging traditional activation functions, showing scalability advantage. Natural-intelligence-inspired bacterial foraging offers efficient and robust on-chip training, and this work paves a way for photonic circuits to perform nonlinear classification.</jats:p>"

Starting from the description of the positive and negative electrodes charge and mass transport dynamics, the positive electrode intercalation and deintercalation phenomena and associated phase transitions are described with the core–shell modeling paradigm. Assuming two phases are formed in the positive electrode, one rich and one poor in lithium, a core-shrinking problem is formulated and the phase transition is modeled through a shell phase that covers the core one. A careful discretization of the coupled partial differential equations is proposed and used to convert the model into a system of ordinary differential equations. To ensure robust and accurate numerical solutions of the governing equations, a sensitivity analysis of numerical solutions is performed and the best setting, in terms of solver tolerances, solid phase concentration discretization points, and input current sampling time, is determined in a newly developed probabilistic framework. Finally, unknown model parameters are identified at different C-rate scenarios and the model is verified against experimental data.</jats:p>",

ClinicalTrials.gov, as a public repository, provides access to a vast collection of clinical trials and their characteristics such as primary outcomes. With the growing number of COVID-19 clinical trials, identifying COSs from outcomes of such trials is crucial. This paper introduces a semi-automatic pipeline that can efficiently identify, aggregate and rank the COS from the primary outcomes of COVID-19 clinical trials. Using Natural language processing (NLP) techniques, our proposed pipeline successfully downloads and processes 5090 trials from all over the world and identifies COVID-19-specific outcomes that appeared in more than 1% of the trials. The top-of-the-list outcomes identified by the pipeline are mortality due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection rate and COVID-19 symptoms.</jats:p>",

A crossover temperature of 50 K was observed for both these states from the zero field cooled/field cooled magnetization curves taken at different fields. At crossover temperature, an interesting <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>H</jats:italic> loop splitting is observed which is attributed to the slow spin relaxation. This anomalous <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>H</jats:italic> loop splitting behaviour was found to be particle size dependent and suppressed for diameters above and below 14 nm which indicates a critical size for these competing magnetic states. Additional neutron diffraction experiments confirmed this observation. This experimental study provides a new insight for the understanding of intra-particle interactions in fine antiferromagnetic nanoparticles and obtained results are an important step towards deeper understanding of the competing/non-competing modes between superparamagnetic blocked and Néel transition states.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs at the anode in numerous electrochemical reactions and plays an important role due to the nature of proton-coupled electron transfer. However, the high voltage requirement and low stability of the OER dramatically limits the total energy converting efficiency. Recently, electrocatalysts based on multi-metal oxyhydroxides have been reported as excellent substitutes for commercial noble metal catalysts due to their outstanding OER activities. However, normal synthesis routes lead to either the encapsulation of excessively active sites or aggregation during the electrolysis. To this end, we design a novel core–shell structure integrating CoMoO4 as support frameworks covered with two-dimensional γ-FeOOH nanosheets on the surface. By involving CoMoO4, the electrochemically active surface area is significantly enhanced. Additionally, Co atoms immerge into the γ-FeOOH nanosheet, tuning its electronic structure and providing additional active sites. More importantly, the catalysts exhibit excellent OER catalytic performance, reducing overpotentials to merely 243.1 mV a versus 10 mA cm−2. The current strategy contributes to advancing the frontiers of new types of OER electrocatalysts by applying a proper support as a multi-functional platform.</jats:p>"

Hanya 28% siswa yang nilainya diatas KKM (70). Beberapa kemungkinan yang menyebabkan hal ini terjadi diantaranya yakni kurang pahamnya siswa terhadap materi yang disampaikan oleh guru, guru belum menggunakan strategi dan metode pembelajaran yang tepat sasaran. Hal ini secara tidak langsung membuat siswa jenuh dan kurang semangat dalam belajar dikelas. Khususnya pada mata pelajaran seni rupa dengan materi 3 dimensi hal ini menuntut untuk siswa terampil dalam mengaplikasikan ilmunya. Salah satu upata metode yang bisa dijadikan sebagai solusi untuk meningkatkan hasil prestasi belajar pada mata pelajaran seni rupa 3 dimensi yakni metode Connecting, Organizing, Reflecting dan Extending (CORE). Riset ini menggunakan penelitian tindakan kelas (PTK). Setelah diterapkan metode pembelajaran CORE pada seni rupa 3 dimensi ternyata dapat meningkatkan hasil prestasi belajar pada siklus I 68% dan pada siklus II sebanyak 88%.

A1644-S is the main cluster in a merging system, which is well known for X-ray hot gas sloshing in its core. The sharply peaked X-ray profile of A1644-S implies the presence of a strongly cooling gas core. In this study, we analyze  ALMA <jats:sup>12</jats:sup>CO (1–0) data, JVLA H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> data, and KaVA 22 GHz data for the central region of A1644-S to probe the potential origin of the cool gas and its role in (re)powering the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find CO clumps distributed in an arc shape along the X-ray gas sloshing, which is suggestive of a connection between the cold gas and the hot intracluster medium (ICM). H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> and CN are detected in absorption against the AGN continuum emission. The absorption dip is observed at the systemic velocity of the BCG with an extended, redshifted tail. Based on the spatial and spectral configurations of the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, CN, and CO gases, it is inferred that cool gas spirals into the core of the BCG, which is then fed to the central AGN. Indeed, our KaVA observation reveals a parsec-scale bipolar jet, implying that this AGN could have been (re)powered quite recently. Combining this, we suggest that some cold gas in A1644-S could have been formed from the cooling of the ICM, triggering the activity of the central AGN in the early development of a cool-core cluster.</jats:p>",

The simulation results show that with the different locations of layer short circuit fault points, the variation laws of electrical parameters of reactors are also different, in which the variation amplitude of power factor is obvious and the variation trend is consistent, which can provide important theoretical support for the online detection and protection of layer short circuit fault of dry-type air-core series reactors.</jats:p>",

These drugs need a significant material for the control of their loading and release phenomenon that can supply the drug at its target site. Magnetic nanoparticles have characteristics that enable them to be applied in biomedical fields and, more specifically, as a drug delivery system when they are incorporated with a biocompatible polymer. The coating with magnetic nanoparticles is performed to increase efficiency and reduce side effects. In this regard, attempts are made to search for suitable materials retaining biocompatibility and magnetic behavior. In the present study, silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were incorporated with core–shell particles made of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid)@butyl methacrylate to produce a magnetic composite material (MCM-PA@B) through the free radical polymerization method. The as-prepared composite materials were characterized through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), energy-dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and were further investigated for the loading and release of the drugs aprepitant and sofosbuvir. The maximum loading capacity of 305.76 mg/g for aprepitant and 307 mg/g for sofosbuvir was obtained at pH 4. Various adsorption kinetic models and isotherms were applied on the loading of both drugs. From all of the results obtained, it was found that MCM-PA@B can retain the drug for more than 24 h and release it slowly, due to which it can be applied for the controlled loading and targeted release of the drugs.</jats:p>"

Monoallelic TREX1 mutations were identified in patients showing early-onset cerebrovascular disease, ascribable to small vessel disease, and CADASIL-like neuroimaging. We report the clinical-neuroradiological features of two patients with AGS-like (Patient A) and CADASIL-like (Patient B) phenotypes carrying the heterozygous p.A136V and p.R174G TREX1 variants, respectively. Genetic findings, obtained by a customized panel including 183 genes associated with monogenic stroke, were combined with interferon signature testing and biochemical assays to determine the mutations&amp;rsquo; effects in vitro. Comprehensive studies revealed no pathological impact on TREX1 enzymatic function for the p.A136V variant. The p.R174G variant modestly altered exonuclease activity consistently with perturbation of substrate interaction rather than catalysis, which represents the first robust enzymological data for a TREX1 variant identified in a CADASIL-like patient. In conclusion, functional analysis allowed us to interpret the impact of TREX1 variants on patients&amp;rsquo; phenotypes. Whilst Patient A&amp;rsquo;s manifestations are not related to p.A136V variant, Patient B&amp;rsquo;s phenotype is likely related to the p.R174G variant. Further functional investigations of TREX1 variants found in CADASIL-like patients are warranted to establish a causal link and interrogate the molecular disease mechanism.</jats:p>"

(2021). Here, we re-evaluate the observational data for the diagnostic SN properties by employing the hydrodynamic explosion model of a 9 M⊙ red supergiant progenitor with an iron core and a pre-collapse mass of 8.75 M⊙. The explosion of the star was obtained by the neutrino-driven mechanism in a fully self-consistent simulation in three dimensions (3D). Multiband light curves and photospheric velocities for the plateau phase are computed with the one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics code STELLA, applied to the spherically averaged 3D explosion model as well as sphericized radial profiles in different directions of the 3D model. We find that the overall evolution of the bolometric light curve, duration of the plateau phase, and basic properties of the multiband emission can be well reproduced by our SN model with its explosion energy of only 0.7 × 1050 erg and an ejecta mass of 7.4 M⊙. These values are considerably lower than the previously reported numbers, but they are compatible with those needed to explain the fundamental observational properties of the prototype low-luminosity SN 2005cs. Because of the good compatibility of our photospheric velocities with line velocities determined for SN 2005cs, we conclude that the line velocities of SN 2020cxd are probably overestimated by up to a factor of about 3. The evolution of the line velocities of SN 2005cs compared to photospheric velocities in different explosion directions might point to intrinsic asymmetries in the SN ejecta.</jats:p>",

However, the gap between the computational accounts of cognition and evidence of behavioral studies remains large. In this study, we used a computational model of drawing based on the mechanisms of predictive coding to systematically investigate the effects of the precision of top-down and bottom-up information when performing a drawing completion task. The results indicated that sufficient precision of both signals was required for the successful completion of the stimuli and that a reduced precision in either sensory or prediction (i.e., prior) information led to different types of atypical drawing behavior. We compared the drawings produced by our model to a dataset of drawings created by children aged between 2 and 8 years old who drew on incomplete drawings. This comparison revealed that a gradual increase in children's precision of top-down and bottom-up information as they develop effectively explains the observed change of drawing style from scribbling toward representational drawing. Furthermore, individual differences that are prevalent in children's drawings, might arise from different developmental pathways regarding the precision of these two signals. Based on these findings we propose a theory of how both general and individual development of drawing could be explained in a unified manner within the framework of predictive coding.</jats:p>"

Here, the intrinsic role of the peculiar structure is revealed by comparing representative A‐DA′D‐A acceptor Y6 with its A‐D‐A counterparts having different fusion modes. Owing to the more delocalized HOMO and deeper LUMO level, Y6 exhibits stronger and red‐shifted absorption relative to the linear and angular fused A‐D‐A acceptors, respectively. Moreover, the change from linear to angular fusion substantially reduces the electron‐vibration couplings, which is responsible for the faster exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport for Y6 than the linear fused A‐D‐A acceptor. Notably, the electron‐vibration coupling for exciton dissociation is further decreased by introducing the electron‐deficient core, thus contributing to the efficient charge generation under low driving forces in the Y6‐based devices.</jats:p>",

In the absence of any other information, the nomogram method generally assumes that a person died with a core body temperature of approximately 37.2 °C. Nevertheless, several external and internal factors may alter the body temperature during agony. A retrospective medical record analysis was carried out on in-hospital death cases from two consecutive years of surgical intensive care units to determine the effects of factors influencing the core body temperature at the point of death. Data from 103 case files were included in the statistical data evaluation. The body temperature fluctuated between and within individuals over time. No clear correlation to certain death groups was observed. Even primary cardiac deaths showed broad intervals of temperatures at the point of death. Men seem to die with higher body temperatures than women. The presented data highlight potential biases for death time estimations when generally assuming a core body temperature of 37.2 °C. In conclusion, the estimation of the time of death should include various methods, including a non-temperature-dependent method. Any uncertainties regarding the body temperature at point of death need to be resolved (e.g. by identifying fever constellations) and elucidated if elimination is not possible.</jats:p>",

In general, managing the chromatic dispersion in the optical fiber is important for a wide range of applications. In this article, a highly dispersive germanium‐doped ring‐core fiber with dual selectable operating windows for OAM mode is proposed. The proposed fiber consists of three concentric high‐refractive‐index germanium‐doped rings with different mole fractions. The chromatic dispersion of the OAM<jats:sub>1,1</jats:sub> mode in the ring fiber can be as low as −129 964 ps/(nm·km) at 1644.4 nm as the light launches into the fiber from the innermost ring and −270 017 ps/(nm·km) at 1651 nm as the light enters from the outermost ring. Furthermore, the effect of the geometrical and material parameters on chromatic dispersion for OAM<jats:sub>1,1</jats:sub> mode is investigated. When the parameters of the innermost and outermost rings are varied separately, the corresponding operation windows are changed independently. An extremely negative dispersion for the OAM<jats:sub>1,1</jats:sub> mode of −817 576 ps/(nm·km) can be achieved.

The current study describes the implementation and preliminary evaluation of a novel physiotherapist-led paediatric fracture clinic, which was introduced to provide more timely care to children. The study evaluated 1) the length of time patients spent in the outpatient department per appointment, 2) did-not-attend rates and 3) unplanned re-presentations to the clinic for the same problem. Methods: The study was conducted at a large regional hospital in Victoria, Australia. A physiotherapist-led paediatric fracture clinic was introduced in 2013 to provide care to children with acute simple limb fractures. Descriptive data for all patients seen in the clinic between 1st January 2013 and 31st December 2018 were collected prospectively. The performance of the new service was evaluated by comparing it to the pre-existing orthopaedic surgeon-led fracture clinic for the six months prior to the introduction of the new service for 1) the total time patients spent in the outpatient department per appointment and 2) the number of patients that failed to attend an appointment. The pre-existing surgeon-led clinic was also compared to the surgeon-led clinic for the six months following the introduction of the physiotherapist-led clinic. Total time spent in the department per appointment was compared between groups using linear regression, controlling for age, diagnosis and appointment type (new or review). The proportion of patients who did not attend an appointment were compared between groups using the chi square test. The number of unplanned representations to either clinic was assessed between 01/01/2013 and 31/12/2018. Results: Between 2013 and 2018, there were 4337 attendances at the physiotherapist-led clinic. Total time in the department was significantly less (p&lt;.05) for patients seen in the physiotherapist-led clinic when compared to the pre-existing surgeon-led clinic (median difference 82 minutes). Total time in the surgeon-led clinic also reduced following the introduction of the new service (median difference 21 minutes). Did-not-attend rates (10.3%) and unplanned re-presentations (0.6%) were similar (p&gt;.05) between the groups.  Conclusions: The physiotherapist-led clinic improved the timeliness of care for paediatric patients without evidence of compromised patient safety.

Ice-core nitrate isotopes are suspected to be influenced by column ozone variability and δ15N(NO3-) has been sought to serve as a proxy of column ozone variability. In this study, we examined the ability of ice-core nitrate isotopes to reflect column ozone variability by measuring δ15N(NO3-) and Δ17O(NO3-) in a shallow ice core drilled at the South Pole. The ice core covers the period of 1944 to 2005, and during this period δ15N(NO3-) was of large annual variability ((59.2 ± 29.3) ‰), but with no apparent response to the Antarctic ozone hole. Utilizing a snow photochemical model, we estimated 6.9 ‰ additional enrichments in δ15N(NO3-) could be caused by the development of the ozone hole. But this enrichment is nevertheless small and masked by the effects of snow accumulation rate variability in addition to that of the slightly increased snow accumulation rate at the South Pole over the same period of the ozone hole. The Δ17O(NO3-) record displays a decreasing trend by ~ 3.4 ‰ since 1976. This magnitude of change can’t be caused by enhanced post-depositional processing owing to the ozone hole. Instead, the Δ17O(NO3-) decrease was more likely due to the proposed decreases in O3 / HOx ratio in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. Our results suggest ice-core δ15N(NO3-) is more sensitive to snow accumulation rate than to column ozone, but at sites with relatively constant snow accumulation rate, information of column ozone variability embedded in δ15N(NO3-) should be retrievable. In comparison with the South Pole, up to 21 ‰ additional δ15N(NO3-) enrichments can be caused by the ozone hole at Dome A and the signal would be possibly detected if where snow accumulation rate has stayed relatively constant.\n                        </jats:p>"

CCNE1-amplified tumors are homologous recombination (HR) proficient and resistant to standard therapies. Therapy resistance is associated with increased numbers of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCC). We sought to identify new therapeutic approaches for patients with CCNE1-amplified tumors. Using TCGA data, we find that the mTOR, HR, and DNA checkpoint pathways are enriched in CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancers. Furthermore, Interactome Mapping Analysis linked the mTOR activity with upregulation of HR and DNA checkpoint pathways. Indeed, we find that mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) downregulate HR/checkpoint genes in CCNE1-amplified tumors. As CCNE1-amplified tumors are dependent on the HR pathway for viability, mTORi proved selectively effective in CCNE1-amplified tumors. Similarly, via downregulation of HR genes, mTORi increased CCNE1-amplifed HGSOC response to PARPi. In contrast, overexpression of HR/checkpoint proteins (RAD51 or ATR), induced resistance to mTORi. In vivo, mTORi alone potently reduced CCNE1-amplified tumor growth and the combination of mTORi and PARPi increased response and tumor eradication. Tumors treated with mTORi demonstrated a significant reduction in ALDH+ PGCCs. Finally, as a proof of principle, we identified three patients with CCNE1 amplified tumors who were treated with an mTORi. All three obtained clinical benefits from the therapy. Our studies and clinical experience indicate mTORi are a potential therapeutic approach for patients with CCNE1-amplified tumors.</jats:p>",

However, which structural feature is responsible for the excellent photovoltaic performance is still under debate. In this study, two Y6‐like acceptors BDOTP‐1 and BDOTP‐2 were designed. Different from previous Y6‐type acceptors featuring an A–D–Aʹ–D–A structure, BDOTP‐1, and BDOTP‐2 have no electron‐deficient Aʹ fragment in the core unit. Instead, there is an electron‐rich dibenzodioxine fragment in the core. Although this modification leads to a marked change in the molecular dipole moment, electrostatic potential, frontier orbitals, and energy levels, BDOTP acceptors retain similar three‐dimensional packing capability as Y6‐type acceptors due to the similar banana‐shaped molecular configuration. BDOTP acceptors show good performance in OSCs. High PCEs of up to 18.51% (certified 17.9%) are achieved. This study suggests that the banana‐shaped configuration instead of the A–D–Aʹ–D–A structure is likely to be the determining factor in realizing high photovoltaic performance.</jats:p>",

Magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) is an interesting material for controlling and suppressing undesirable vibrations through the application of a magnetic field. The present study aims at analyzing the pre-structure of the magnetorheological viscoelastic core in the dynamic response of an MRE-sandwich structure. The forced vibration tests were performed under a non-homogenous magnetic field to evaluate the dynamic properties of the MRE-sandwich structure in a frequency bandwidth range of 0–250 Hz. Experimental results show that the proposed MRE-sandwich structures are capable of eliminating unwanted resonances due to induced magnetic field intensity in the activated region, especially at the fundamental mode. Moreover, results highlight that an oriented pre-structure in an MRE-sandwich has an attenuation effect on vibrations in the low frequency range. Additionally, the external magnetic field increased the structural vibrations damping capability by approximately 200%. In addition, the oriented pre-structures of the MRE core were also used to dissipate vibration. Consequently, they could potentially be used in vibration attenuation applications such as stop operations in dynamic structures.</jats:p>",

Melamine–formaldehyde (MF) resin was chosen to fabricate CL-20/HMX cocrystal-based core–shell composites (CH@MF composites) via a facile in situ polymerization method. The resulted CH@MF composites were comprehensively characterized, and a compact core–shell structure was confirmed. The effects of the shell content on the properties of the composites were explored as well. As a result, we found that, except for CH@MF–2 with a 1% shell content, the increase in shell content led to a rougher surface morphology and more close-packed structure. The thermal decomposition peak temperature improved by 5.3 °C for the cocrystal enabled in 1.0 wt% MF resin. Regarding the sensitivity, the CH@MF composites exhibited a significantly reduced impact and friction sensitivity with negligible energy loss compared with the raw cocrystal and physical mixtures due to the cushioning and insulation effects of the MF coating. The formation mechanism of the core–shell micro-composites was further clarified. Overall, this work provides a green, facile and industrially potential strategy for the desensitization of energetic cocrystals. The CH@MF composites with high thermal stability and low sensitivity are promising to be applied in propellants and polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) formulations.</jats:p>"

To this end, we evaluated 21 accessions of the U.S. peanut mini-core under water-limited conditions in 2018 and 2019 in Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. These accessions were identified as potentially exhibiting phenotypic extremes for ten drought stress traits, and therefore may be useful for identifying genetic markers associated with drought tolerance. Results indicated that plant wilting and paraheliotropism (leaf folding) were less affected by genotype by environment interactions than SCMR (SPAD chlorophyll meter readings), flower counts, yield, TSMK (total sound mature kernels), and seed weight. No differences among genotypes were observed with canopy temperature, canopy temperature depression, or NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Paraheliotropism was moderately correlated (|r| = 0.40 to 0.52, P &lt; 0.01) with SCMR and flower counts in the Southwest; SCMR was also correlated with yield and TSMK (r = 0.48, P &lt; 0.01). Despite environmental differences between subhumid Virginia and the semiarid Southwest, the locations shared genotypes at the extremes for most traits. This information may be useful for future studies by highlighting traits associated with drought tolerance that may be more stable in different production environments, as well as divergent genotypes for those traits.</jats:p>",

The robotic system incorporates the advantages of both freehand and probe-guided biopsy techniques. The proposed robotic system can be used as a slave robot in a teleoperation configuration or as an autonomous or semi-autonomous robot in the future. While the UR5 manipulator was controlled using a teleoperation scheme with force controller, a reinforcement learning based controller using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm was developed for the add-on robotic system. The dexterous workspace analysis of the add-on robotic system demonstrated that the system has a suitable workspace within the US image. Two sets of comprehensive experiments including four experiments were performed to evaluate the robotic system’s performance in terms of the biopsy instrument positioning, and the insertion of the needle inside the ultrasound plane.

Glaciers are constantly moving and melting because of internal and external pressure and gravity under its own weight. Although extensive glaciers systems lies on different mountain ranges of the landforms in the world i.e. more than seven thousand glaciers lies in Africa, Andes, Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Eurasia, European Alps, New Zeeland, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, South America and in North America Continent. In the mountain landforms, Pakistan has more glacial ice in the Himalayan Range, Karakorum Range and Koh-Hindu-Kush Range. Glaciers also exist in southern hemisphere in Antarctic Region, in Northern Hemisphere in Arctic Region, Greenland and remaining occurs in the landforms of mountain regions. Glaciers exhibit the different wave like motions that mostly occur internally thus resulting the glacier surge, and waves of velocity.  When the glaciers and ice sheet gains a large eroded material through the accumulation of snow above the equilibrium line, the glacier mass is lost through the ablation process and melting water runoff towards the down slope at lowest elevations below the equilibrium line that results the formation of accumulation area, alluvial fan stratification, alluvial plans, arête, askers, braided streams, cirques, crevasses, drumlins, fjords, fracture zones, glacial valleys, ice aprons, and ice bergs. Glaciers are among the oldest and coldest ecosystems on earth that together support the psychrophilic taxa and also impart a requisite water source to shape the downstream ecosystems. But due to global warming and rapid rise in the tropical climate change, melting of tropical glaciers, the fast ablation has contributed the shrinking of global glaciers thus causing the major biological, environmental and human consequences. Subsequently, mountain erosion results the transportation of debris, silt up, floods, and land sliding, raised the global environmental issues.

Recent investigations propose the transmission of α‐Syn protein fibrils, in a prion‐like manner, by entering proximal cells to seed further fibrillization in PD. Despite the recent advances, the mechanisms by which extracellular protein aggregates internalize into the cells remain poorly understood. Using a simple cell‐based model of human neuroblastoma‐derived differentiated neurons, we present the cellular internalization of α‐Syn PFF to check cellular uptake and recycling kinetics along with the standard endocytic markers Transferrin (Tf) marking clathrin‐mediated endocytosis (CME) and Galectin3 (Gal3) marking clathrin‐independent endocytosis (CIE). Specific inhibition of endocytic pathways using chemical inhibitors reveals no significant involvement of CME, CIE and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis (CvME). A substantial reduction in cellular uptake was observed after perturbation of actin polymerization and treatment with macropinosomes inhibitor. Our results show that α‐Syn PFF mainly internalizes into the SH‐SY5Y cells and differentiated neurons via the macropinocytosis pathway. The elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanism involved in the α‐Syn PFF internalization will help improve the understanding of α‐synucleinopathies including PD, and further design specific inhibitors for the same.</jats:p>",

However, laser induced graphene (LIG) on renewable precursors usually requires flame‐retardant pretreatment and multistep pulsed or defocused irradiation. Laser scribing of silicon carbide (SiC) from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is limited by its high transparency over a broad wavelength range. Here, a structural design strategy is adopted to solve these two dilemmas at the same time, that is, laser scribing of carbonized cloth/PDMS to prepare LIG/SiC composites. Natural cotton cloth is precarbonized and inserted in PDMS substrate to facilitate heat absorption for the in situ formation of SiC, while the soft PDMS attached to the carbonized cloth absorbs heat and isolates oxygen, enabling the conversion of amorphous carbon to LIG. Under these multifield coupling effects, a core–shell LIG/SiC electrode is formed on the carbonized cloth with tunable mass ratio, morphology, and graphene defects. Experimentally, the LIG/SiC pressure sensor exhibits a good sensitivity of 1.91 kPa<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the super‐wide sensing range of 0–226.7 kPa. By demonstrating different scenarios such as real‐time monitoring of large body movements, tiny pulses and heartbeats, the flexible pressure sensors hold great promise in wearable electronics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The long-term evolution of the mantle is simulated using 2D spherical annulus geometry to examine the effect of heterogeneous thermal conductivity on the stability of reservoirs of primordial material. In numerical models, mantle conductivity is often emulated using purely depth-dependent profiles (taking on values between 3 and 9 Wm-1 K-1). This approach is meant to synthesize the mean conductivities of mantle materials at their respective conditions in-situ. However, because conductivity depends also on temperature and composition, the effects of these dependencies in mantle conductivity is masked. This issue is significant because dynamically evolving temperature and composition introduce lateral variations in conductivity, especially in the deep-mantle. Minimum and maximum variations in conductivity are due to the temperatures of plumes and slabs, respectively, and depth-dependence directly controls the amplitude of the conductivity (and its variations) across the mantle depth. Our simulations allow assessing the consequences of these variations on mantle dynamics, in combination with the reduction of thermochemical pile conductivity with iron composition, which has so far not been well examined. We find that the temperature- and depth- variations combined characterize the mean conductivity ratio from top-to-bottom. For the mean conductivity profile to be comparable to the conductivity often assumed in numerical models, the depth- dependent ratio must be at least 9 times the surface conductivity. When the conductivity profile is underestimated, the imparted thermal buoyancy (from heat-producing element (HPE) enrichment) destabilizes the reservoirs and influences core-mantle boundary (CMB) coverage configuration and the onset of entrainment. The compositional correction for conductivity only plays a minor role that behaves similarly to conductivity reduction due to temperature. Nevertheless, this effect may be amplified when depth- dependence is increased. For the cases we examine, when the lowermost mantle's mean conductivity is greater than the surface conductivity, reservoirs can remain stable for periods exceeding the age of the solar system.\n                        </jats:p>"

The high current of the DC bus saturates the differential mode (DM) magnetic ring, while the leakage inductance of common mode (CM) inductor used as the DM inductance is usually very small, resulting in almost no suppression of DM EMI. A design method of broadband high‐current air‐core inductor passive filter is proposed. By using the air‐core inductor as DM inductor, the problem of easy saturation of the DM inductor core and the small leakage inductance of the CM inductor is solved, and improves the low frequency DM EMI suppression. Through the calculation and selection of the turning frequency point of the multi‐stage filter circuit, the effective frequency band can be improved. By analysing the influence of parasitic parameters, the problem of insufficient insertion loss of the filter at high frequency is solved. The experimental verification shows that the proposed air‐core inductor filter achieves 50 dB of CM and DM insertion loss in frequency range of 150 kHz–108 MHz, and meets the requirements of system conducted disturbance voltage specified in CISPR25‐2016Rd level 3.</jats:p>",

In the past several years, research in the fields of plant pathology and plant–microbe interactions has enabled tremendous progress in understanding how certain receptor‐based plant innate immune systems function to successfully prevent infections and diseases. In this review, we highlight and discuss some of these new ground‐breaking discoveries and point out strategies of how pathogens counteract the function of important core convergence hubs of the plant immune system.

Modern challenges of the education system in terms of achieving metasubject results by schoolchildren who ensure the formation of ULA for their self-development and self-improvement, determine new requirements for the quality of training of a future physical education teacher who is ready to solve professional tasks [Adolf, Stepanova, 2017].  The introduction of the core of pedagogical education is designed to provide training that meets modern challenges and requirements. The question of how to design the content of activities aimed at solving professional tasks when mastering the basic educational program of the core of pedagogical education of a future physical education teacher is relevant, since it is an innovation that has not been sufficiently studied in theory and practice [Adolf, Kondratyuk, 2021]. The issues of preparing a future teacher to work on the formation of the ULA of schoolchildren in physical education classes in conditions of maintaining a high motor density of lessons, ensuring motor activity and safety remain little studied to date.  The purpose of the article is to analyze the results of the study of the formation of universal learning activities (hereinafter referred to as ULA) among future physical education teachers in order to determine the content of their activities that need to be organized in the preparation process.  The methodology of the study consisted of the analysis of the characteristics of personal, communicative, regulatory and cognitive ULA of future PE teachers, as a necessary component of training, in the conditions of the introduction of the core of pedagogical education. The study involved 100 first-year students (enrollment 2020 and 2021). A survey with evaluation scales was used as a method of obtaining empirical data. Mathematical processing included descriptive statistics and correlation analysis using Spearman’s coefficient.  The survey of physical education teachers and trainers of Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Khakassia and Tuva, in May-September 2021, was conducted as part of the state task of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation No. 073-00090-32-02.  The results obtained during the surveys correspond to the laws of the normal Gaussian distribution. The coefficient of variation of the data is in the range from 10% to 30%. The risk measure is within the normal range, which indicates the reliability of the results obtained, and they can be used in other scientific studies.  The research results showed that the following scales are of maximum importance in the personal characteristics of future physical education teachers, who provide value-semantic, motivational orientation: responsible attitude to family creation; values of a healthy lifestyle. The scales of minimal importance are: civic identity, patriotism, respect for one’s people, readiness to serve the Fatherland, its protection; formation of the foundations of self-development and self-education.  Of minimum value is the following scale: the ability and willingness to reflect on the methods and conditions, the results of activities [Adolf, Zaitseva, Kondratyuk [et al.], 2021].  Conclusion. Diagnostics of future PE teachers made it possible to determine the characteristics that will allow designing the content of their activities, in the context of the introduction of the core of pedagogical education aimed at ensuring the readiness of future PE teachers to solve professional tasks.  The formation of the need for self-development and self-education, readiness for self-education of future PE teacher, is possible through involvement in the activities of professional educational platforms, organization of educational and cognitive activities, mentoring.  In the content component of the core of pedagogical education, the activity of a future physical education teacher is necessary and is aimed at mastering the skills of conflict-free communication, mediation, goal setting, self-control and correction, and reflection.</jats:p>",

The limited understanding of the chemical surface composition may impact the ability to determine suitable coupling chemistries used for surface decoration or assess surface‐related properties like biocompatibility. In this work, XPS is used to investigate the chemical composition of various ultra‐high‐molecular‐weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) surfaces. UHMWPE doped with α‐tocopherol or functionalised by active screen plasma nitriding (ASPN) was investigated as a model system. Subsequently, a more complex combined system obtained by ASPN treatment of α‐tocopherol doped UHMWPE was investigated. Through ab initio orbital calculations and by employing Koopmans' theorem, the core‐electron binding energies (CEBEs) were evaluated for a substantial number of possible chemical functionalities positioned on PE‐based model structures. The calculated ΔCEBEs showed to be in reasonable agreement with experimental reference data. The calculated ΔCEBEs were used to develop a material‐specific peak model suitable for the interpretation of merged high‐resolution C 1 s, N 1 s and O 1 s XPS spectra of PE‐based materials. In contrast to conventional peak fitting, the presented approach allowed the distinction of functionality positioning (i.e. centred or end‐chain) and evaluation of the long‐range effects of the chemical functionalities on the PE carbon backbone. Altogether, a more detailed interpretation of the modified UHMWPE surfaces was achieved whilst reducing the need for manual input and personal bias introduced by the spectral analyst.</jats:p>",

However, few studies have addressed the underlying molecular mechanisms. To evaluate plant responses to fluctuating environments using laboratory equipment, we developed SmartGC, a high‐performance growth chamber that reproduces the fluctuating irradiance, temperature and humidity of field environments. We analysed massive transcriptome data of rice plants grown under field and SmartGC conditions to clarify the differences in plant responses to field and controlled environments. Rice transcriptome dynamics in SmartGC mimicked those in the field, particularly during the morning and evening but those in conventional growth chamber conditions did not. Further analysis revealed that fluctuation of irradiance affects transcriptome dynamics in the morning and evening, while fluctuation of temperature affects transcriptome dynamics only in the morning. We found upregulation of genes related to biotic and abiotic stress, and their expression was affected by environmental factors that cannot be mimicked by SmartGC. Our results reveal fillable and unfillable gaps in the transcriptomes of rice grown in field and controlled environments and can accelerate the understanding of plant responses to field environments for both basic biology and agricultural applications.</jats:p>",

Matrix vesicles have been studied for 50 y since they were first observed using electron microscopy. However, research progress has been hampered by various technical barriers. Recently, there have been great advancements in our understanding of the intracellular biosynthesis of matrix vesicles. Mitochondria and lysosomes are now considered key players in matrix vesicle formation. The involvement of mitophagy, mitochondrial-derived vesicles, and mitochondria–lysosome interaction have been suggested as potential detailed mechanisms of the intracellular pathway of matrix vesicles. Their main secretion pathway may be exocytosis, in addition to the traditionally understood mechanism of budding from the outer plasma membrane. This basic knowledge of matrix vesicles should be strengthened by novel nano-level microscopic technologies, together with basic cell biologies, such as autophagy and interorganelle interactions. In the field of tissue regeneration, extracellular vesicles such as exosomes are gaining interest as promising tools in cell-free bone and periodontal regenerative therapy. Matrix vesicles, which are recognized as a special type of extracellular vesicles, could be another potential alternative. In this review, we outline the recent significant progress in the process of matrix vesicle–mediated mineralization and the potential clinical applications of matrix vesicles for tissue regeneration. </jats:p>",

The synthesis of well-defined core-shell architectures remains, however, highly challenging. Here, we demonstrate that atomically-thin and homogeneous platinum shells can be grown via a colloidal synthesis method on a variety of gold nanostructures ranging from spherical nanoparticles to nanorods and nanocubes. The synthesis is based on the exchange of low binding citrate ligands on gold, the reduction of platinum and the subsequent kinetically hindered growth by carbon monoxide as strong binding ligand. The prerequisites for homogeneous growth are low core-binding ligands with moderate fast ligand exchange in solution, a mild reducing agent to mitigate homonucleation and a strong affinity of a second ligand system that can bind to the shell’s surface. The simplicity of the described synthetic route can potentially be adapted to various other material libraries to obtain atomically smooth core-shell systems.</jats:p>"

An optimal gate is selected based on a pressure measurement error when calculating the pressure and the temperature simultaneously from measurement values of a PSP and a TSP. A shot noise of a PSP, a temperature error, and a fluctuation in an emission intensity ratio due to blurring were considered error factors of the PSP measurement. The pressure measurement error propagated from each error source was considered as an evaluation index in an optimization of a measurement condition. We evaluated 17 types of TSP characteristics and selected an optimal TSP and a measurement condition for the PSP measurement. Further, the optimized measurement condition was evaluated in a PSP/TSP simultaneous measurement using a coupon-based test. The optimal measurement condition obtained based on the proposed method and an empirical selection method were compared by a PSP/TSP simultaneous measurement using a coupon-based test. A small-pressure measurement error, i.e. high pressure-measurement accuracy, was realized by the proposed method in the simultaneous lifetime-based method of a PSP and a TSP. In addition to the analyses above, the blurring effects were found to be minor and briefly summarized in appendices.</jats:p>",

The molecular composition of the warm gas is similar to that of both hot cores and hot corinos, but the molecular abundances are closer to the values found towards hot corinos than to values found towards hot cores.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Locus coeruleus (LC) modulates various neuronal circuits throughout the brain. Its unique architectural organization encompasses a net of axonal innervation that spans the entire brain, while its somatic core is highly compact. Recent research revealed an unexpected cellular input specificity within the nucleus that can give rise to various network states that either broadcast norepinephrine signals throughout the brain or pointedly modulate specific brain areas. Such adaptive input–output functions likely surpass our existing network models that build upon a given synaptic wiring configuration between neurons. As the distances between noradrenergic neurons in the core of the LC are unusually small, neighboring neurons could theoretically impact each other via volume transmission of NE. We therefore set out to investigate if such interaction could be mediated through noradrenergic alpha2-receptors in a spiking neuron model of the LC. We validated our model of LC neurons through comparison with experimental patch-clamp data and identified key variables that impact alpha2-mediated inhibition of neighboring LC neurons. Our simulation confirmed a reliable autoinhibition of LC neurons after episodes of high neuronal activity that continue even after neuronal activity subsided. Additionally, dendro-somatic synapses inhibited spontaneous spiking in the somatic compartment of connected neurons in our model. We determined the exact position of hundreds of LC neurons in the mouse brain stem via a tissue clearing approach and, based on this, further determined that 25 percent of noradrenergic neurons have a neighboring LC neuron within less than a 25-micrometer radius. By modeling NE diffusion, we estimated that more than 15 percent of the alpha2-adrenergic receptors fraction can bind NE within such a diffusion radius. Our spiking neuron model of LC neurons predicts that repeated or long-lasting episodes of high neuronal activity induce partitioning of the gross LC network and reduce the spike rate in neighboring neurons at distances smaller than 25 μm. As these volume-mediating neighboring effects are challenging to test with the current methodology, our findings can guide future experimental approaches to test this phenomenon and its physiological consequences.</jats:p>"

Results show that compared with W and Gd2O3 mixed powder PU coating fabrics, the protection efficiency and lead equivalent of core–shell structure W/Gd2O3 powder PU coating fabrics against different energy rays are obviously improved. With the increase in incident energy, the protective efficiency of core–shell structure W/Gd2O3 powder PU coating fabric decreases more slowly than that of W/Gd2O3 mixed powder PU coating fabric. When the incident energy is 65–100 keV, the protective efficiency of the core–shell structure W/Gd2O3 powder PU coating fabric is above 60%, showing a good synergistic protective effect.

Compared with the electrospun HPMC–AAP nanocomposites from single-fluid electrospinning of the core fluid, the core–shell nanohybrids were able to promote the water absorbance and HMPC gelation formation processes, which, in turn, ensured a faster release of AAP for potential orodispersible drug delivery applications. The mechanisms of the drug released from these nanofibers were demonstrated to be a combination of erosion and diffusion mechanisms. The presented protocols pave a way to adjust the properties of electrospun, cellulose-based, fibrous gels for better functional applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objectives. Transition from cardiac hypertrophy to failure involves adverse metabolic reprogramming involving mitochondrial dysfunction. We have earlier shown that vitamin D deficiency induces heart failure, at least in part, through insulin resistance. However, whether activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) can attenuate heart failure and underlying metabolic phenotype requires investigation. Thus, we aimed to assess the cardioprotective potential of paricalcitol, a vitamin D receptor-activator, against cardiac hypertrophy and failure in high-fat high-fructose-fed rats. Methods. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed control (Con) or high-fat high-fructose (HFHFrD) diet for 20 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats from HFHFrD group were divided into the following: HFHFrD, HFHFrD+P (paricalcitol i.p. 0.08 μg/kg/day) and HFHFrD+E (enalapril maleate i.p. 10 mg/kg/day). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, blood pressure measurement, and 2D echocardiography were performed. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed by Masson’s trichrome staining of paraffin-embedded heart sections. Mitochondrial DNA and proteins, and citrate synthase activity were measured in rat hearts. VDR was silenced in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, and immunoblotting was performed. Results. Paricalcitol improved glucose tolerance, serum lipid profile, and blood pressure in high-fat high-fructose-fed rats. Paricalcitol reduced cardiac wall thickness and increased ejection fraction in high-fat high-fructose-fed rats but had no effect on perivascular fibrosis. PGC1-α was upregulated in the HFHFrD+P group compared to the HFHFrD group, but there was no significant difference in mitochondrial content. Citrate synthase activity was significantly higher in the HFHFrD+P group compared to the HFHFrD group. Rat hearts of the HFHFrD+P group had significantly higher expression of mitofusins. H9c2 cells with VDR knockdown showed significantly lower expression of Mfn2. Improvement in the HFHFrD+P group was comparable with that in the HFHFrD+E group. Conclusions. Paricalcitol reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with metabolic syndrome by enhancing mitochondrial fusion. We demonstrate repurposing potential of the drug currently used in end-stage kidney disease.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigate the similarity between the pronotum and wings in relation to growth. Our study reveals that the ontogenetic allometry of the pronotum is similar to that of wings in Membracidae, but not the outgroup. Using transcriptomics, we identify genes related to translation and protein synthesis, which are mutually upregulated. These genes are implicated in the eIF2, eIF4/p70S6K and mTOR pathways, and have known roles in regulating cell growth and proliferation. We find that species-specific differential growth patterning of the pronotum begins as early as the third instar, which suggests that expression of appendage patterning genes occurs long before the metamorphic molt. We propose that a network related to growth and size determination is the more likely mechanism shared with wings. However, regulators upstream of the shared genes in pronotum and wings need to be elucidated to substantiate whether co-option has occurred. Finally, we believe it will be helpful to distinguish the mechanisms leading to pronotal size from those regulating pronotal shape as we make sense of this spectacular evolutionary innovation.</jats:p>",

Dual-cured resin composites were prepared using dimethacrylate monomers with added Sr/F-BGNPs (5 or 10 wt%) and MCPM (3 or 6 wt%). The additives reduced the light-activated monomer conversion by ~10%, but their effect on the conversion upon self-curing was negligible. The conversions of light-curing or self-curing polymerization of the experimental materials were greater than that of the commercial material. The additives reduced biaxial flexural strength (191 to 155 MPa), modulus (4.4 to 3.3), and surface microhardness (53 to 45 VHN). These values were comparable to that of the commercial material or within the acceptable range of the standard. The changes in the experimental composites’ mass and volume (~1%) were similar to that of the commercial comparison. The color change of the commercial material (1.0) was lower than that of the experimental composites (1.5–5.8). The addition of Sr/F-BGNPs and MCPM negatively affected the physical/mechanical properties of the composites, but the results were satisfactory except for color stability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When 5G telecommunication becomes a standardized and widely used communication medium, it must be implemented in coherence with certain 5G network standards and requirements. One such requirement is a Subscription Concealed Identifier called SUCI. SUCI prevents the exposure of international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), which was a vulnerability in previous generation mobile telecommunication networks. Unlike IMSI, SUCI is encrypted and transmitted using a symmetric key cryptographic algorithm, to prevent the aforementioned vulnerabilities. However, for the first terminal to be encrypted, it is necessary to exchange a key with the home network, and this key exchange for SUCI encryption is performed through the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) key exchange algorithm, which is a public-key encryption scheme. However, ECIES uses more computing resources compared to a symmetric key cryptographic algorithm. Additionally, for 5G Subscriber Identity Deconcealing Function (SIDF) to satisfy the massive machine-type communication (mMTC) requirements of 5G, it is necessary to decrypt at least a million SUCIs within a short time. This puts a great burden on the 5G home network to provide the mMTC service for IoT. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of constructing 5G SIDF in an mMTC IoT environment. A key method of the proposed 5G SIDF configuration is the use of GPUs. This proposal was aimed at reducing the load in the mMTC environment by performing parallel processing of all cryptographic operations performed in the SIDF using a GPU. In particular, we focused on parallelization of public-key encryption algorithms. In addition, we also compared the method proposed in this paper through a survey of various 5G security products.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, there is lack of clarity regarding whether NAc core processes these separable events differently. We used the high temporal and spatial resolution of single unit recording with trial‐by‐trial video analysis to examine firing during three distinct categories termed cue, approach and consumption in a Pavlovian task. We had three goals. First, we sought to precisely define task‐related behaviour in terms of distinct phases, in order to compare neural activity between motorically matched behaviours. We found that cue‐evoked firing did not distinguish between trials on which animals initiated an approach versus ones on which they did not. Firing associated with consumption was greater than firing associated with motorically similar uncued head entry, indicating that previously reported decreases in NAc core firing during consumption relative to approach or baseline may reflect differences in motor behaviour. Secondly, we assessed changes in firing over the course of training. We found that NAc core neurons acquired a response to the tone cue within three sessions but did not change further across 10 total sessions. Thirdly, we correlated individual neuron firing during a given event with its firing during the same event on subsequent sessions. We found substantial variation in processing of cue and approach but not consumption, indicating that a given neuron may process certain events differently from session to session, while maintaining more stable processing of appetitive reward.</jats:p>",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of helium plasma treatment on the wettability of zirconia surface and on the shear bond strength between the dental zirconia core and feldspathic veneering ceramic. Methods. 128 zirconia specimens were prepared, polished, and then divided into four groups: control, Zr, FC, and Zr/FC. In Zr and Zr/FC groups, the zirconia blocks were treated by helium plasma for 60 s. In FC and Zr/FC, the feldspathic ceramic powder received 60 s of plasma treatment. Then, the feldspathic powder was applied on the zirconia blocks. Half of the specimens in each group were sintered in a tube furnace, and the contact angle between the zirconia core and feldspathic ceramic was measured at different time intervals. The other half were sintered in a ceramic furnace and then subjected to thermocycling. The shear bond strength was measured using a universal testing machine. The failure mode was assessed using a stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test, and the statistical significance was considered less than 0.05. Results. There was no significant difference in the mean contact angle and the shear bond strength values of the experimental groups (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <mi>P</mi>\n                        <mo>&gt;</mo>\n                        <mn>0.05</mn>\n                     </math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>).

We found that core and non-core genes have different roles in subgenome differentiation. Meanwhile, according to their expression profiles, these core genes can be classified into genes related to tissue development and stress responses, including 3376 genes highly expressed in both spikelets and at high temperatures. After associating with six histone marks and open chromatin, we found that these core genes can be divided into eight sub-clusters with distinct epigenomic features. Furthermore, we found that ca. 51% of the expressed transcription factors (TFs) were marked with both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, indicative of the bivalency feature, which can be involved in tissue development through the TF-centered regulatory network.

It is found that the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode dominates the core transport for both phases. Absent flow shear effects, the ITG critical gradient (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>L</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>Ti,crit</jats:sub>) is shown to be far smaller in the SH–HI phase than the SH phase. The lower <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>L</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>Ti,crit</jats:sub> in the SH–HI phase is shown to be mainly induced by the hollow carbon (impurity) density profile, which is strongly destabilizing relative to the nearly flat carbon density profile in the SH phase. Differences in the <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>i</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>e</jats:sub> ratio between these phases are found to have a minor impact. However, the significantly stronger flow shearing in the SH–HI phase relative to the SH phase enables the achievement of higher core <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>L</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>Ti</jats:sub> values and is therefore mainly responsible for the higher core <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>i</jats:sub> values observed in the early SH–HI phase. Predictive transport modeling shows that the confinement in the lower-rotation SH phase could be elevated significantly if a peaked impurity density profile can be achieved, and potential applications to the performance improvement of future reactors are discussed.</jats:p>",

This study followed a randomized parallel design in which 362 adolescents (age: 14.5 ± 1.07 years; body mass index: 19.82 ± 3.64) were allocated to a GS (n = 89), CST (n = 92), or GS + CST (n = 90) program or to a control group (n = 91). Participants were assessed two times (baseline and postintervention) for the following tests: (i) 50 m dash, (ii) grip strength, (iii) long jump, (iv) 1000 m running for boys and 800 m for girls, (v) core endurance, and (vi) exercise attitude. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05, η2p = 0.035−0.218) were found between the four groups of the six components of physical fitness and the three components of attitude toward exercise (target attitudes, behavioral habits, and sense of behavioral control). Between-group analysis revealed that the GS + CST had significant advantages (p &lt; 0.05) over the CON in terms of the 50 m dash (Cohen’s d = 0.06), grip strength (Cohen’s d = 0.19_left, 0.31_right), 800/1000 m running (Cohen’s d = 0.41), core endurance (Cohen’s d = 0.95), and sense of behavioral control (Cohen’s d = 0.35). Between-group analysis also revealed that the CST had significant advantages over the CON in terms of grip strength (Cohen’s d = 0.27_left, 0.39_right), 50 m (Cohen’s d = 0.04), long jump (Cohen’s d = 0.21), 800/1000 m (Cohen’s d = 0.09), and core stability (Cohen’s d = 0.63), which were significantly different from CON (p &lt; 0.05).

In this work, a new kind of single-polarization single-mode HC-NCF with nested U-type cladding elements is proposed. To achieve the single-polarization single-mode transmission, we use two different silica tubes in thickness, which satisfy the resonance and anti-resonance conditions on the U-type cladding elements and the cladding tubes, respectively. Besides, the elliptical elements are introduced to achieve good single-mode performance. By studying the influences of the structure parameters on the propagation characteristics, the optimized structure parameters are obtained. The simulation results show that when the wavelength is fixed at 1550 nm, the single-polarization single-mode transmission is achieved, with the polarization extinction ratio of 25749 and minimum high-order mode extinction ratio of 174.

Here, we report a core/shell catalyst consisting of intermetallic PdCd core and Pd shell (i‐PdCd@Pd) with promoted CO anti‐poison ability and thus FAOR performance. The optimal i‐PdCd@Pd catalyst exhibits a high mass activity and specific activity at peak potential, which are 24 and 4 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C catalyst, respectively. We understand by in‐situ surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRA) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that in i‐PdCd@Pd, the intermetallic PdCd under‐layers can induce the downshift of d‐band center of surface Pd atoms, which would improve the CO tolerance and thus promote the FAOR performance.<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/cjoc202200199-gra-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"image\" />\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper details a benchmarking and validation workflow using digital rock physics (DRP) to evaluate the effectiveness of various percussion sidewall core (PSWC) acquisition methods. The workflow consists of obtaining digital rock properties and images of reference material to compare with material obtained from laboratory percussion sidewall acquisition, including novel designs. This analysis allows insight into the acquisition processes and potential sources of damage in the PSWC technique, and potentially other rock sampling techniques, and offers an opportunity to evaluate its appropriateness as a subsurface rock sample acquisition method.  Six sandstones of known properties were used in the testing program to cover a wide range of particularly low and medium, unconfined compressive strengths (UCS). Reference plugs were cut from all samples. The sandstone samples were then used as the parent material in laboratory testing of various designs of PSWC bullets. The PSWC bullets, including novel designs, were shot in simulated downhole environments. Both reference plugs and test plugs were imaged with high-resolution X-ray micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) at resolutions between 2 and 11 microns, and digital rock analysis was conducted on all samples. Using pre- and post-test images, damage could be identified and petrophysical properties including porosity and permeability could be determined and directly compared.  Digital rock physics provide unique insight to evaluate and quantify changes (or lack of changes) to the sample  material subjected to the PSWC acquisition. Damage encountered in the test samples includes grain crushing and compaction that degrades storage and transport properties, and dilatant zones that locally enhance transport properties. The presence, frequency, and distribution of these zones are dependent on experimental parameters. In all cases, undisturbed rock fabric could be identified in each sample and intact texture was verified by comparison with reference material.  A novel and efficient method for acquiring and evaluating subsurface samples was developed and benchmarked. Lab results indicate this method may be equally applicable to low and mid-range UCS rocks. This approach enables a cost-effective reservoir characterization strategy. By optimizing PSWC bullet design and coupling this with a mature, image-based digital rock technology, this work demonstrated that the samples and results obtained by this method are representative, and that the controls on storage and transport properties are well understood.</jats:p>",

Accurate tumour delineation on HP-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-MRI is vital for quantitative assessment of the underlying tissue metabolism. However, there is no consensus on the optimum method for segmenting HP-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-MRI, and whole-mount pathology (WMP) as the histopathological gold-standard is only available for surgical patients. Although proton MRI can be used for tumour delineation, this approach significantly underestimates tumour volume, and metabolic tumour segmentation based on HP-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-MRI could provide an important functional metric of tumour volume. In this study, we quantified metabolism using HP-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-MRI and segmentation approaches based on WMP maps, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H-MRI-derived T<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-weighted imaging (T2WI), and HP-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-MRI-derived total carbon signal-to-noise ratio maps (TC-SNR) with an SNR threshold of 5.0. <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-labelled pyruvate SNR, lactate SNR, TC-SNR, and the pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate constant (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>PL</jats:sub>) were significantly higher when measured using the TC-SNR-guided approach, which also corresponded to a significantly higher tumour epithelial expression on RNAscope imaging of the enzyme catalysing pyruvate-to-lactate metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)). However, linear regression and Bland-Altman analyses demonstrated a strong linear relationship between all three segmentation approaches, which correlated significantly with RNA-scope-derived epithelial LDH expression. These results suggest that standard-of-care T2WI and TC-SNR maps could be used as clinical reference tools for segmenting localised PCa on HP-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-MRI in the absence of the WMP gold standard. The TC-SNR-guided approach could be used clinically to target biopsies towards highly glycolytic tumour areas and therefore to sample aggressive disease with higher precision.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Key Points</jats:title>\n                <jats:p><jats:italic>• T2WI- and TC-SNR-guided segmentations can be used in all PCa patients and do not explicitly require WMP maps.</jats:italic></jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:italic>• Agreement between the three segmentation approaches is biologically validated by their strong relationship with epithelial LDH mRNA expression.</jats:italic></jats:p>\n                <jats:p>• <jats:italic>The TC-SNR-guided approach can potentially be used to identify occult disease on</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>1</jats:italic></jats:sup><jats:italic>H-MRI and target the most glycolytically active regions.</jats:italic></jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

Despite the apparent core role that protozoal species exert, their major biological and metabolic contributions to rumen function remain largely undescribed<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. Here, we have leveraged (meta)genome-centric metaproteomes from rumen fluid samples originating from both cattle and goats fed diets with varying inclusion levels of lipids and starch, to detail the specific metabolic niches that protozoa occupy in the context of their microbial co-habitants. Initial proteome estimations via total protein counts and label-free quantification highlight that entodiniomorph species<jats:italic>Entodinium</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Epidinium</jats:italic>as well as the holotrichs<jats:italic>Dasytricha</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Isotricha</jats:italic>comprise an extensive fraction of the total rumen metaproteome.

Despite certain protozoal species having well-established reputations for digesting starch, they were unexpectedly less detectable in low methane emitting-animals fed high starch diets, which were instead dominated by propionate/succinate-producing bacterial populations suspected of being resistant to predation irrespective of host. Finally, we reaffirmed our abovementioned observations in geographically independent datasets, thus illuminating the substantial metabolic influence that under-explored eukaryotic populations have in the rumen, with greater implications for both digestion and methane metabolism.</jats:p>"

Evidence suggests that the microbial-gut-brain axis is an important pathway for the interaction between the gut microbiome and the development of schizophrenia. What is not clear is how changes in the gut microbiota composition and structure during antipsychotic treatment improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. In this study, 25 patients with schizophrenia were recruited. Their fecal samples were collected before and after hospital treatment for 14–19 days. The composition and structure of the intestinal microbiota were evaluated by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, and the results showed significant differences in fecal microbiota before and after treatment. <jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic> (relative abundances of 82.60 and 86.64%) and <jats:italic>Gemminger</jats:italic> (relative abundances of 14.17 and 13.57%) were the first dominant species at the phylum and genus levels, respectively. The random forest algorithm and co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that intestinal flora (especially the core species ASV57) could be used as biomarkers to distinguish different clinical states and match treatment regimens accordingly. In addition, after fecal microbiota transplantation, antibiotic-treated recipient mice showed multiple behavioral improvements. These included decreased psychomotor hyperactivity, increased social interaction, and memory. In conclusion, this study suggests that differences in the composition and structure of gut microbiota after treatment are associated with the development and severity of schizophrenia. Results may provide a potential target for the treatment of this disorder.</jats:p>"

Physical characterization verified that metal‐organic framework (MOFs)‐derived Co@NCNP nanocomposites present a nanotube structure on their mesoporous polyhedron surface. As a result, the as‐prepared Co@NCNP can be used as a sensitive electrochemical sensor for chloramphenicol detection, and the modified electrode is also studied by electrochemical methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). When compared with single ZIF‐67‐derived electrode, the Co@NCNP displays a higher electrocatalytic activity in the presence of chloramphenicol. Moreover, an excellent performance with a linear response range of 5–268.83 μM and a low detection limit of 0.5 μM (S/N=3) is observed for the Co@NCNP modified electrode. Finally, the fabricated chloramphenicol sensor achieves a good anti‐interference ability, stability, excellent repeatability, and remarkable reproducibility. The sensor also could be applied in human serum to determine of chloramphenicol with a satisfactory result.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children with no improvements in treatment options for RMS patients over the past four decades. Therefore, it is critical to understand the fundamental processes underlying RMS tumorigenesis. RMS is divided into two major histologic subtypes - alveolar and embryonal RMS. Nearly all alveolar RMS express oncogenic fusions of PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 whereas embryonal RMS are not driven by these fusion proteins. Instead, embryonal or fusion-negative (FN-RMS) are molecularly heterogeneous. Approximately one-third of fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) patients have copy number loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), and approximately 90% of tumors are hypermethylated at the PTEN promoter leading to decreased PTEN expression. This indicates a near universal role for PTEN loss in FN-RMS, but the functional role of PTEN is still unclear. To determine PTEN’s function in FN-RMS, we bred Ptenflox alleles into our aP2-Cre;SmoM2 (ASPWT) FN-RMS mouse model to obtain aP2-Cre;SmoM2;Ptenflox/flox mice (ASPcKO). Conditional Pten deletion accelerated tumorigenesis and produced a tumor with a less differentiated histological appearance, much like human FN-RMS. Interestingly, in PtenWT tumors, we found predominant PTEN immunoreactivity within the nucleus suggesting a role for nuclear PTEN in FN-RMS. Transcriptome analyses revealed robust gene expression changes between the ASPWT and ASPcKO tumors. The top overexpressed gene in ASPcKO tumors was Dbx1 (Developing brain homeobox 1), a homeobox transcription factor with no known cancer function but involved in innate behavioral processes such as breathing. We found FN-RMS patient-derived xenografts are dependent on DBX1 expression, and that DBX1 expression is controlled by PAX7 (Paired Box 7). PAX7 is a transcription factor expressed in satellite cells and maintains a de-differentiated state in FN-RMS. PAX7 expression is also increased in our ASPcKO tumors, and we show that human FN-RMS cells are dependent on PAX7 expression for proliferation. This suggests PTEN loss in FN-RMS engages a new transcriptional program necessary for FN-RMS survival. To determine if Pax7 loss can rescue the deleterious effects of Pten loss in our murine FN-RMS model, we deleted both Pten and Pax7 in our aP2-Cre;SmoM2 mice (ASPcKOP7cKO). ASPcKOP7cKO tumor onset kinetics resembled tumors with wild-type PTEN and were negative for skeletal muscle markers MYOD1 and MYOGENIN. However, these tumors were positive for leiomyosarcoma markers smooth muscle actin and CALDESMON. Together, our data suggests PTEN and PAX7 have a synthetic essential relationship in FN-RMS and that PAX7 is a proliferative driver and lineage dependency for FN-RMS tumors. This work also illustrates the power of murine models to unravel the genetic dependencies underlying both tumor maintenance and identity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Casey G.

The CCTC fiber has a small-core region (diameter of ∼20 µm) at both ends and a large-core region (diameter of ∼36 µm) in the middle. To prove the laser performance of the CCTC fiber, a detailed comparison experiment with conventional uniform fiber with the same effective core diameter is carried out in a multi-kW all-fiber MOPA configuration. The experimental results show that employing the CCTC fiber can effectively mitigate the thermally-induced transverse mode instability (TMI) in both co-pump and counter-pump schemes, and realize high slope efficiency and single-mode beam quality (M<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>∼1.30). Under the counter-pump scheme, the TMI threshold of the CCTC fiber is observed at ∼2.49 kW with a slope efficiency of 86.2%, while the uniform fiber amplifier exhibits a TMI threshold of ∼2.05 kW. The theoretical analysis based on a semi-analytical model indicates this CCTC fiber can effectively improve the TMI threshold owing to a stronger gain saturation. Our results verify the great potential of such an LMA CCTC fiber to mitigate thermal-induced TMI effect and achieve single-mode operation without sacrifice of laser efficiency in high power monolithic fiber lasers, and the further power scaling is expected by optimizing the fiber design.</jats:p>",

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent for a subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)—a cancer that is impacting a rapidly growing group of typically middle-aged non-smoking white males. While HPV is a ubiquitously present (with about 1% of the population having high-risk oral HPV infection at any one time), less than 1% of those infected with high-risk strains develop OPSCC—suggesting that additional cofactors or coinfections may be required. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a similarly ubiquitous virus that is strongly linked to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Both of these viruses cause cellular transformation and chronic inflammation. While dysbiosis of the human microbiome has been associated with similar chronic inflammation and the pathogenesis of mucosal diseases (including OPSCC and NPC), a significant knowledge gap remains in understanding the role of bacterial-viral interactions in the initiation, development, and progression of head and neck cancers. In this review, we utilize the known associations of HPV with OPSCC and EBV with NPC to investigate these interactions. We thoroughly review the literature and highlight how perturbations of the pharyngeal microbiome may impact host-microbiome-tumor-viral interactions—leading to tumor growth.</jats:p>"

By coupling DEP motion of two‐phase flow to phase‐field formulation, bulk‐coupled numerical simulations are conducted to characterize the spatial–temporal evolution of the surface charge wave and the resulting nonlinear electrical force induced at both the core/shell and medium/shell oil/water interfaces. The effect of interfacial charge relaxation and droplet geometry on inter‐core attractive dipolar interaction is investigated within a wide parametric space, and four distinct device operation modes, including normal inter‐core fusion, shell elongation, partial core leakage, and complete core release, are well distinguished from one another by flow regime argumentation. Our results herein reveal for the first time the hitherto unknown transient electrohydrodynamic fluid motion of DE droplet driven by Maxwell–Wagner structural polarization. The dynamic simulation method proposed in present study points out an effective outlet to predict the nonlinear electrokinetic behavior of multicore DE droplets for realizing a more controlled triggering of microscale reactions for a wide range of applications in drug discovery, skin care, and food industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Irrespective of the fact that the Niger Delta was known for its environmental pollution, neither organized environmental assessment nor human biomonitoring, including that of carbon monoxide (CO) had been performed in the region. The aim of the study therefore was to establish the severity of maternal impact on exposure to CO in the first trimester of pregnancy by quantifying the exhaled CO concentrations (ECOC) and to assess the effect of maternal age, body mass index (BMI) and parity on the severity of the impact.Methods: The study was of cross-sectional design carried out at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH) in Rivers State. 490 consecutive pregnant women in the first trimester were recruited from the antenatal clinic from January 2021 to January 2022. Gestational age was estimated with the aid of ultrasound scan. Demographic, social and obstetric characteristics were taken. Exhaled carbon monoxide concentration (ECOC) was measured with the aid of a smokerlyzer. Data was analyzed, using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 (Armonk, NY) software. Ethical approval was obtained from the RSUTH ethics committee.Results: The mean value of ECOC 3.25±2.51 ppm was more than that obtained in other studies. Out of the total 490 patients that were assessed, 335 (68.37%) had mild impact from CO exposure (ECOC=1-3 ppm), 129 (26.33%) – moderate impact (ECOC=4-6 ppm) and 26 (5.31%) had severe impact (ECOC=more than 6 ppm). Moderate and severe impacts were more prominent in women of age groups 25-39 years and the differences in various age groups were statistically significant [X2=20.671, p&lt;0.036, 95% CI (0.032, 0.040)]. Patients with higher BMI were more likely to have moderate and severe impact than those with lower BMI- 6 (33.33%) and 4 (22.22%) out of the 18 patients with class III obesity had moderate and severe impacts respectively. The differences in the impact at various BMI were statistically significant [X2=20.671, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI (0.001, 0.002)]. There was inverse relationship between parity and the severity of the impact and the differences in various parity groups were statistically significant [X2=10.580, p&lt;0.012, 95% CI (0.101, 0.113)]. There was also a paradoxical finding of 3 smokers having only mild impact.Conclusions: The mean value of ECOC 3.25±2.51 ppm was more than that obtained in other studies in non-pregnant women. Mild, moderate and severe impact from maternal CO exposure were established with the moderate and severe impact more prominent at maternal ages of 25-39 years, at higher BMI and at lower parity.</jats:p>"

We searched for indicators of embryo selection by comparing born/abort mouse embryos. We found that asynchronous embryos during the 4–8-cell stage were predisposed to be aborted. In asynchronous mouse embryos, the nuclear translocation of YAP1 in some blastomeres and compaction were delayed, and the number of ICMs was reduced. Hence, it is possible that asynchronous embryos have abnormal differentiation. When the synchrony of human embryos was observed, it was confirmed that embryos that did not reach clinical pregnancy had asynchrony as in mice. This could make synchrony a universal indicator common to all animal species.</jats:p>"

We conducted research cruises in the Arctic Ocean in the late summers of 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019, and used 18S ribosomal DNA metabarcoding to examine the dynamic changes in core phytoplankton. Environmental factors were divided into three Groups: “surface layers in low latitude”, “subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers in low latitude”, and “high latitude.” The phytoplankton community was divided into two Groups. One Group, “the phytoplankton community in lower latitudes affected by the Pacific Influx “, comprised Dinophyta (56.33%), Bacillariophyta (22.28%), and Chlorophyta (20.77%), while the other Group, “the phytoplankton community in higher latitudes affected by the Arctic Sea “, comprised Dinophyta (57.51%), Bacillariophyta (10.71%), and Chlorophyta (27.57%). The common phytoplankton taxa in Group of lower latitudes included 33 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (99.04%), while the other Group included nine OTUs (98.80%). In these groups, OTUs #005 (<jats:italic>Heterocapsa rotundata</jats:italic>), #001 (<jats:italic>Micromonas pusilla</jats:italic>), and #003 (<jats:italic>Chaetoceros gelidus</jats:italic>) were core OTUs (&amp;gt;5%). These core OTUs were significantly different between the two Groups; OTU #001 and #003 were distributed at high relative abundance and rapidly increased at higher latitudes. OTU #005 showed a relatively high abundance at lower latitudes. Analysis of the indicator species revealed that 34 OTUs in lower latitudes and only one OTU (#003) in higher latitudes were observed to have a strong value of &amp;gt;0.8.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the end of the Bronze Age, technical improvements have made possible the rise of the first generation of major sea powers around the Mediterranean realm, such as Etruria in Italy. The Etruscan coast was fringed by large lagoons, of which only one survives today: the lagoon of Orbetello. This peculiar lagoon is held between two sand spits that connect the former island of Argentario to the mainland. A third sand spit lies in the middle of the lagoon, and supports the Etruscan city of Orbetello. Archeological investigations suggest that the lagoon was connected to the sea through a natural outlet until the 9&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century BCE, when an integrated management plan of the lagoon was implemented to optimize fishing. Subsequent closure of the natural outlet implies that lagoon management heavily subsequently relied on man-made openings to maintain the lagoon connected to the sea and nearby rivers. Today, three canals connect the lagoon to the sea. Management plans were implemented in the late 20&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Century to fight a massive phase of eutrophication driven by excess release of fertilizers. Eutrophication as responsible for extensive fish kills, and to the release of mercury in the water column. Little is known about lagoon management and the evolution of the city before the 17&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century CE, but it is clear that the wealth of the city of Orbetello and the health of its lagoon have been strongly correlated over the past three millennia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; To track this coevolution, we conducted a coring campaign coupled to sub-bottom imaging in the very shallow (&amp;lt;1.5m) waters of this extensive (30 km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) lagoon. iXblue Echoes 10&amp;amp;#160;000 sub-bottom profiler reveals individual layers that can be traced across the lagoon, allowing stratigraphic correlations between cores, and highlighting the environmental significance of the sedimentary facies. Architecture of the deposits reveals a pronounced transgression of the lagoon over its shallowly inward-dipping margins since Antiquity. This led to the flooding of an array of regularly-spaced Roman farms along its southern shorelines, and to a more important flooding of Etruscan structures. Lagoon level rise was driven by a combination of regional sea level rise and fluctuations in the hydraulic balance of the lagoon, controlled by the opening and closure of canals.

Radiocarbon dating indicates that the cores capture up to five millennia of sedimentation. Ongoing analysis of mercury and phosphorus content, ostracods and pollen assemblages, and chromatic pigments in the organic fractions are expected to document the links between sediment facies, eutrophication and salinity crises, and the rise and demise of land and lagoon management through the past three millennia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; A sub-bottom profiling campaign in June 2022 is aimed at mapping the observed structure.

Herein, a novel aptamer sensor based on magnetic separation and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is proposed for the extremely sensitive and specific detection of trace BPA. Moreover, the capture unit was prepared by immobilizing thiolated (SH)-BPA aptamer complementary DNA on AuNP-coated magnetic halloysite nanotubes (MNTs@AuNPs), and SH-BPA aptamer-modified Au@4-MBA@Ag core–shell SERS nanotags acted as signal units. By the complementary pairing of the BPA aptamer and the corresponding DNA, MNTs@AuNPs and Au@4-MBA@AgCS were linked together through hybridization-ligation, which acted as the SERS substrate. In the absence of BPA, the constructed aptamer sensor generated electromagnetic enhancement and plasmon coupling to improve the sensitivity of SERS substrates. Owing to the high affinity between BPA and the aptamer, the aptamer probe bound to BPA was separated from the capture unit by an externally-induced magnetic field. Thus, the Raman intensity of the MNTs@AuNP-Ag@AuCS core–satellite assemblies was negatively correlated with the BPA concentration. High sensitivity measurements of BPA might be performed by determining the decline in SERS signal strength together with concentration variations. The proposed aptasensor is a promising biosensing platform for BPA detection.</jats:p>"

A one-pot hydrothermal approach has been employed to synthesize MoS2 nanostructures. MoS2 and MoO3 phases can be readily controlled by straightforward calcination in the (200–300) °C temperature range. An optimized temperature of 250 °C yields a phase-engineered MoO3@MoS2 hybrid, while 200 and 300 °C produce single MoS2 and MoO3 phases. When tested in LIBs anode, the optimized MoO3@MoS2 hybrid outperforms the pristine MoS2 and MoO3 counterparts. With above 99% Coulombic efficiency (CE), the hybrid anode retains its capacity of 564 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, and maintains a capacity of 278 mAh g−1 at 700 mA g−1 current density. These favorable characteristics are attributed to the formation of MoO3 passivation surface layer on MoS2 and reactive interfaces between the two phases, which facilitate the Li-ion insertion/extraction, successively improving MoO3@MoS2 anode performance.</jats:p>"

PpIX accumulates in cancer cells because of the low activity of ferrochelatase, an enzyme that metabolizes PpIX to heme. High expression of 5-ALA influx transporters, such as peptide transporters 1/2, in cancer cells also enhances PpIX production. Because PpIX radiates red fluorescence when excited with blue/violet light, 5-ALA has been used for the visualization of various tumors. 5-ALA photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) has been shown to improve the tumor removal rate in high-grade gliomas and non-muscular invasive bladder cancers. However, 5-ALA PDD remains a challenge as a diagnostic method because tissue autofluorescence interferes with PpIX signals in cases where tumors emit only weak signals, and non-tumorous lesions, such as inflammatory sites, tend to emit PpIX fluorescence. Here, we review the current outline of 5-ALA PDD and strategies for improving its diagnostic applicability for tumor detection, focusing on optical techniques and 5-ALA metabolic pathways in both viable and necrotic tumor tissues.</jats:p>"

This approach offers a new, to the best of our knowledge, option for implementation with high integration, and a multi-channel mode converter, which could find potential applications in FMF multi-wavelength laser systems, and wavelength/mode division multiplex communication systems.

This $18.3\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$ progenitor model is evolved from a slow merger of 14 and $9\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$ stars, and it satisfies most of the observational constraints such as red-to-blue evolution, lifetime, total mass, and position in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram at collapse, and chemical anomalies. Our simulation is initiated from a spherically symmetric collapse and mapped to the three-dimensional coordinates at 10 ms after bounce to follow the non-spherical hydrodynamics evolution. We obtain the neutrino-driven shock revival for this progenitor at ∼350 ms after bounce, leading to the formation of a newly born neutron star with average gravitational mass ${\\sim} 1.35\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$ and spin period ∼0.1 s. We also discuss the detectability of gravitational wave and neutrino signals for a Galactic event with the same characteristics as SN 1987A. At our final simulation time (∼660 ms post-bounce), the diagnostic explosion energy, though still growing, is smaller (0.14 foe) compared to the observed value (1.5 foe). The 56Ni mass obtained from the simulation ($0.01\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$) is also smaller than the reported mass from SN 1987A ($0.07\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$). Long-term simulation including several missing physical ingredients in our three-dimensional models such as rotation, magnetic fields, or more elaborate neutrino opacities should be done to bridge the gap between the theoretical predictions and the observed values.</jats:p>",

The operating conditions of these inductors play a major role in maximizing the performance and efficiency of the DC-DC converter.

Although several mechanisms to account for deleterious immune effects were proposed, molecular description for the underlying alveolar structural alterations for COPD is lacking. Here, silencing of α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8), the enzyme for core-fucosylation and highly expressed in lung stem cells, resulted in alveolar structural changes in lung organoids, recapitulating COPD. Site-specific mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which binds collagen, contains a core-fucosylation site in its VCSNDN<jats:sup>cf</jats:sup>K glycopeptide. Biacore assay showed markedly reduced collagen binding of SPARC lacking core fucosylation. Molecular dynamics analysis revealed that core fucosylation of SPARC-induced dynamic conformational changes in its N-glycan, allowing terminal galactose and N-acetylglucosamine to interact with K150, P261 and H264 residues, thereby promoting collagen binding. Site-specific mutagenesis of these residues also resulted in low affinity for collagen binding. Moreover, loss of collagen and decline of core fucosylation were observed in COPD lung tissues. These findings provide a new mechanistic insight into the role of core fucosylation of SPARC in cell–matrix communication and contribution to the abnormal alveolar structures in COPD.</jats:p>",

Inflammation can be involved in the pathogenicity of aortic defects and can thus be a therapeutic target for MFS. Previously, we showed that the formulation of methotrexate (MTX) associated with lipid nanoparticles (LDE) has potent anti-inflammatory effects without toxicity. To investigate whether LDEMTX treatment can prevent the development of aortic lesions in the MFS murine model. MgΔloxPneo MFS (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 40) and wild-type (WT, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 60) mice were allocated to 6 groups weekly injected with IP solutions of: (1) only LDE; (2) commercial MTX; (3) LDEMTX (dose = 1mg/kg) between 3rd and 6th months of life. After 12 weeks of treatments, animals were examined by echocardiography and euthanatized for morphometric and molecular studies. MFS mice treated with LDEMTX showed narrower lumens in the aortic arch, as well as in the ascending and descending aorta. LDEMTX reduced fibrosis and the number of dissections in MFS but not the number of elastic fiber disruptions. In MFS mice, LDEMTX treatment lowered protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors macrophages (CD68), T-lymphocytes (CD3), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), apoptotic factor cleaved-caspase 3, and type 1 collagen and lowered the protein expression of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), extracellular signal-regulated kinases ½ (ERK1/2), and SMAD3. Protein expression of CD68 and CD3 had a positive correlation with an area of aortic lumen (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.36; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.001), suggesting the importance of inflammation in the causative mechanisms of aortic dilation. Enhanced adenosine availability by LDEMTX was suggested by higher aortic expression of an anti-adenosine A2a receptor (A2a) and lower adenosine deaminase expression. Commercial MTX had negligible effects. LDEMTX prevented the development of MFS-associated aortic defects and can thus be a candidate for testing in clinical studies.</jats:p>"

Failure to eradicate C. pneumoniae can lead to chronic infection, which is why it is also considered responsible for chronic inflammatory disorders such as asthma, arthritis, etc. There is an urgent need to tackle the major concerns arising due to persistent infections caused by C. pneumoniae as no FDA-approved drug is available against this chronic infection. In the present study, an approach named subtractive proteomics was employed to the core proteomes of five strains of C. pneumonia using various bioinformatic tools, servers, and software. However, 958 non-redundant proteins were predicted from the 4754 core proteins of the core proteome. BLASTp was used to analyze the non-redundant genes against the proteome of humans, and the number of potential genes was reduced to 681. Furthermore, based on subcellular localization prediction, 313 proteins with cytoplasmic localization were selected for metabolic pathway analysis. Upon subsequent analysis, only three cytoplasmic proteins, namely 30S ribosomal protein S4, 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase subunit C, and oligopeptide binding protein, were identified, which have the potential to be novel drug target candidates. The Swiss Model server was used to predict the target proteins’ three-dimensional (3D) structure. The molecular docking technique was employed using MOE software for the virtual screening of a library of 15,000 phytochemicals against the interacting residues of the target proteins. Molecular docking experiments were also evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations and the widely used MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA binding free energy techniques. The findings revealed a promising candidate as a novel target against C. pneumonia infections.</jats:p>"

Taxanes are associated with peripheral neuropathy in some patients, which can impact appropriate dosing and quality of life. In this study, we investigated whether there is an association between the levels of heavy metals in serum or urine and the development of high-grade peripheral neuropathy, defined as grade ≥2 (utilizing CTCAE v.4.0) in a cohort of BC patients undergoing neo/adjuvant taxane chemotherapy. Methods: BC patients undergoing treatment with taxanes were identified in the clinic. Patient eligibility included: histologically confirmed invasive mammary carcinoma, Stage I-III BC, undergoing neo/adjuvant treatment with taxane chemotherapy. Patients previously treated with chemotherapy or who had pre-existing neuropathy were not eligible. Patients were consented and prior to study enrollment, study participants provided blood and urine samples to assess for heavy metals. Neurotoxicity was measured using the NCI CTCAE v.4 criteria throughout patient’s taxane treatment. Serum and urine samples collected at baseline were analyzed for heavy metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: 115 female patients were enrolled. 111 patients were included in the analysis; 4 patients were excluded due to withdrawal from study prior to receiving any taxane treatment. Participants were 78% White (6% of Hispanic origin), 19% Black and 3% Asian with an average age of 51 years (range 26-72). ICP-MS was used for the analysis of Aluminum (Al), Manganese (Mn), Cobalt (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg), Thallium (Tl), and Lead (Pb) levels in patients’ serum and urine. Patients with neurotoxicity grade &gt;=2 had significantly lower serum Arsenic levels (mean=0.37 [SD=1.08], n=89] than subjects with toxicity grades 0-1 [mean=1.21 (SD=2.33), n=22] (p=0.037; Wilcoxon test). Other than Arsenic no relationship of the other heavy metals and neurotoxicity was found in the serum. We did not observe significant associations between heavy metal levels in urine and neurotoxicity grade. Conclusions: Taxane treatment is an effective BC therapy but its utility is limited by its associated toxicity of peripheral neuropathy. The source of the higher arsenic levels is unclear. We conclude that there is no evidence that high levels of heavy metals were associated with taxane induced neurotoxicity in our study. </jats:p>",

Transcript levels of an additional feedback loop regulating BMAL1 showed varied expression, with reduced RORA (P ≤ 0.008) and increased NR1D1 (P ≤ 0.02) in PCOS patients in comparison with the control group. We also demonstrated the expression pattern of clock genes in PBMCs of PCOS women at three different time points. PCOS patients also exhibited increased mRNA levels of steroidogenic enzymes like StAR (P ≤ 0.0005), CYP17A1 (P ≤ 0.005), SRD5A1 (P ≤ 0.00006) and SRD5A2 (P ≤ 0.009). Knockdown of CLOCK/BMAL1 in PBMCs resulted in a significant reduction in estradiol production, by reducing CYP19A1 and a significant increase in dihydrotestosterone production, by upregulating SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 in PBMCs. Our data also showed that CYP17A1 as a direct CLOCK-BMAL1 target in PBMCs. Phenotypic classification of PCOS subgroups showed a higher variation in expression of clock genes and steroidogenesis genes with phenotype A of PCOS. In alignment with the above results, altered expression of ovarian core clock genes (Clock, Bmal1 and Per2) was found in DHEA-treated PCOS mice. The expression of peripheral blood core clock genes in DHEA-induced PCOS mice was less robust and showed a loss of periodicity in comparison with that of control mice.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>LARGE SCALE DATA</jats:title><jats:p>N/A.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION</jats:title><jats:p>We could not evaluate the circadian oscillation of clock genes and clock-controlled genes over a 24-h period in the peripheral blood of control versus PCOS subjects. Additionally, circadian genes in the ovaries of PCOS women could not be evaluated due to limitations in sample availability, hence we employed the androgen excess mouse model of PCOS for ovarian circadian assessment. Clock genes were assessed in the whole ovary of the androgen excess mouse model of PCOS rather than in granulosa cells, which is another limitation of the present work.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS</jats:title><jats:p>Our observations suggest that the biological clock is one of the contributing factors in androgen excess in PCOS, owing to its potential role in modulating peripheral androgen metabolism.

The yarns along with 500 D polyester (PET) fibers undergo weaving, thereby forming functional woven fabrics. The experiment is composed of two parts:yarns and fabrics. The yarns are twisted with TPI of 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and then tested for tensile strength and tensile elongation. The yarns possess mechanical properties that are dependent on the TPI—the higher the TPI, the better the mechanical properties. The maximal mechanical properties occur when the core-spun yarns are made of 12 TPI where the maximal tensile strength is 5.26 N and the lowest elongation is 43.2%. As for the functional woven fabrics, they are made of Ge/SS core-spun yarns as the weft yarns and 500 D PET yarns as the warp yarns. The tensile strength, tensile elongation, negative ion release, electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE), and air permeability tests are conducted, determining the optimal woven fabrics. The 12 TPI core-spun yarns provide the woven fabrics with the maximal tensile strength of 153.6 N and the optimal elongation at break of 10.08%. In addition, the woven fabrics made with 8 or 9 TPI core-spun yarns exhibit an optimal EMI SE of 41 dB, an optimal air permeability of 212 cm3/cm2/s, and an optimal release amount of negative ion of 550–600 ions/cc. The proposed woven fabrics have a broad range of applications, such as functional garments and bedding.</jats:p>"

As a result, it was confirmed that the distribution of tasks and the number of tasks among the five textbooks were relatively evenly arranged except for one textbook. It was also found that the selected tasks for each textbook included all four core competencies, but knowledge information processing competency was found to be very low in all textbooks compared to the other three competencies. As a result of the analysis of the distribution of sub-factors by core competency, it was found that all four competency task activities were concentrated on specific sub-factor activities, indicating that there was an imbalance between the sub-factors of competency.</jats:p>",

In MPNST, PRC2 loss results in a diverse set of transcriptomic and phenotypic consequences, including gain of acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac) accompanying the loss of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3), hyperactivated Ras signaling, and tumor escape from immune surveillance. Mechanistic understanding of how PRC2 loss results in these diverse consequences remains unresolved.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: To delineate the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by PRC2 loss, we engineered MPNST cell lines to dynamically reassemble a functional PRC2 and evaluated the transcriptomic and epigenetic consequences of PRC2 restoration. We further extended these finding using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) from human MPNST.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Through integrative analysis of RNAseq and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in PRC2-deficient MPNST cells, we identified 6134 H3K27me3 peaks gained when a functional PRC2 was restored. Of the 876 significantly altered genes, 699 genes were downregulated, and 177 genes were upregulated when a restored PRC2 caused genome-wide redistribution of H3K27me3 peaks. Detailed mechanistic dissection of these PRC2-regulated genes revealed a two-pronged oncogenic process mediated by PRC2 loss and they cooperatively contribute to the tumorigenesis of MPNST. First, PRC2 loss leads to the upregulation of a transcriptional circuit that remodels the enhancer landscape of MPNST cells and establishes an enhancer-driven transcription factor, FOXC1, as a master regulator and thus a core vulnerability of the cell. Second, PRC2 loss reduces type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antigen presentation as a downstream consequence of the upregulated Ras signaling. These data were further integrated with scRNAseq of human MPNST. Importantly, we discovered that the PRC2-deficient tumor cells have a corrupted transcriptional program characteristic of a mesenchymal precursor cell found during the trajectory of normal Schwann cell development. Interestingly, malignant cells expressing high levels of IFN and antigen presentation genes were missing in the metastatic MPNST, potentially allowing the tumor cell to escape the immune surveillance. The transcriptional circuit established by PRC2-regulated FOXC1 and its downstream targets sustains the malignant program in both primary and metastatic MPNST.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusion: In summary, we discovered the activation of a lineage specific oncogenic transcription program in PRC2-deficient MPNST, which is characteristic of a neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cell. Our findings provide mechanistic understanding of the inherent metastatic potential, chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance, and immune escape that are clinically characteristic of these tumors.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Xiyuan Zhang, Hannah E.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A magnetic field sensor based on a side-polished two-core fiber (SPTCF)-based Michelson interferometer (MI) has been developed and demonstrated. The magnetic field sensor is composed of a standard single mode fiber (SMF) and a section of tapered TCF. By side-polishing a segment of the TCF, the effective index of the exposed core can be made sensitive to the environmental refractive index (RI). To evaluate its performance, a magnetic fluid is used to cover the polished region with a magnetic field sensitive material, where the sensor then measures the magnetic field intensity by sensing the RI change of the magnetic fluid through the evanescent field in the polished core. The SPTCF MI device developed allows for vector magnetic field sensing because of its asymmetric structure, with its highest directional sensitivity being 55.2 pm/degree. Experimental results obtained show that when the magnetic field is parallel to the side-polished plane, a sensitivity of 1.262 nm/mT can be achieved, operating over the magnetic flux density region of 0-5 mT and over a temperature range of 20∼85 °C, where the device is minimally affected by temperature changes. The sensor is well suited to a variety of potential applications given its low cost, strong anti-interference ability, simple structure and high stability.</jats:p>",

The lattice sandwich panels are made of ALSi10 Mg alloy materials and manufactured using the selective laser melting technique. The comparative results show that DOD lattice sandwich panel not only has higher bearing capacity, but also shows stronger toughness in the post-buckling stage than BCC type panel, even they have the same characteristic size. The buckling mode depends on the topology of the unit cell. For BCC and DOD type panels, the main buckling modes are local buckling and global buckling respectively. The reasons of different buckling modes are discussed. Moreover, the buckling evolution and failure modes of the two types of panels in the post-buckling stage are investigated. </jats:p>",

A novel slow-release deicer with a core-shell structure was prepared to reduce the salts’ impacts, subsequently characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). The conductivity evaluation, moisture absorption, and the snow or ice melting performance of the deicer were also tested. The core-shell deicer with different replacement rates was used to prepare the deicing asphalt mixture based on the equivalent volume replacement method. In this study, the high- and low-temperature performance, moisture damage resistance, and snow or ice melting capacity of mixtures were evaluated in the laboratory. The results show that the low-temperature and moisture stability performances decreased, and high-temperature performance improved, as the content of the core-shell deicer was increased. It is confirmed that the replacement rate of the deicer filler should be lower than 75% to meet the specification requirements. The prepared deicing asphalt mixture has good snow and ice melting performance and can reduce the bonding strength between ice and pavement surface. Durability and cost–benefit analysis are expected in further investigations.</jats:p>"

The sandwich panels were manufactured by carbon/fiber epoxy composite face sheets and an M-shaped core using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding method. To enhance the mechanical strength of the matrix, especially impact resistance, the nanoparticles were added to the resin epoxy matrix as filler with the ratios of 1%, 2%, and 3% of the composite's total weight. A scanning electron microscope was utilized to observe the microscopic structure of the composites, and it revealed an exceptional homogeneous mixture of nano-SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> particles in the resin epoxy matrix. Afterward, high-velocity impact tests were carried out using a single-stage gas gun test machine. A spherical steel projectile with a diameter of 8.7 mm was used for the test with a speed of 235 m/s. The experimental results indicated that adding 1–3 wt% of nano-SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> into the matrix remarkably increased the impact resistance of the composite. Moreover, the results showed that when the projectile collides with the core of the sandwich panel, it remains in the sandwich panel and its output velocity becomes zero, while when the projectile does not collide with the core, its output velocity is not zero. In order to validate the results, the experimental data were compared to the finite element models, and good agreement was observed. </jats:p>",

These dynamics emerge concomitantly in tissues and even each cell; thus, the tight regulation of such bidirectional forces is important for proper cellular deformation. Here, we show that contractile dynamics can eventually disturb cell–cell junction contraction in the absence of p21-activated kinase 3 (Pak3). Upon Pak3 depletion, contractility induces the formation of abnormal actin protrusions at the shortening junctions, which causes decrease in E-cadherin levels at the adherens junctions and mislocalization of myosin II at the junctions before they enough shorten, compromising completion of junction shortening. Overexpressing E-cadherin restores myosin II distribution closely placed at the junctions and junction contraction. Our results suggest that contractility both induces and perturbs junction contraction and that the attenuation of such perturbations by Pak3 facilitates persistent junction shortening.</jats:p>"

Reinforcement learning is an important branch of machine learning, and photonic decision-making principles have been demonstrated with respect to the multi-armed bandit problems. However, reinforcement learning could involve a massive number of states, unlike previously demonstrated bandit problems where the number of states is only one. Q-learning is a well-known approach in reinforcement learning that can deal with many states. The architecture of Q-learning, however, does not fit well photonic implementations due to its separation of update rule and the action selection. In this study, we organize a new architecture for multi-state reinforcement learning as a parallel array of bandit problems in order to benefit from photonic decision-makers, which we call parallel bandit architecture for reinforcement learning or PBRL in short. Taking a cart-pole balancing problem as an instance, we demonstrate that PBRL adapts to the environment in fewer time steps than Q-learning. Furthermore, PBRL yields faster adaptation when operated with a chaotic laser time series than the case with uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers where the autocorrelation inherent in the laser chaos provides a positive effect. We also find that the variety of states that the system undergoes during the learning phase exhibits completely different properties between PBRL and Q-learning. The insights obtained through the present study are also beneficial for existing computing platforms, not just photonic realizations, in accelerating performances by the PBRL algorithms and correlated random sequences.</jats:p>",

Recently, a peptide drug, a protein–protein interaction inhibitor (PPI), that disrupts the β-catenin/Bcl9 interaction in the tumoral Wnt/β-catenin pathway has become a promising candidate drug for immune enhancement and tumor growth inhibition. However, the peptide usually suffers from poor cell membrane permeability and proteolytic degradation, limiting its adequate accumulation in tumors and ultimately leading to side effects. Herein, a gadolinium–gold-based core/shell nanostructure drug delivery system was established, where Bcl9 was incorporated into a gadolinium–gold core–shell nanostructure and formed GdOFBAu via mercaptogenic self-assembly. After construction, GdOFBAu, when combined with anti-PD1 antibodies, could effectively inhibit tumor growth and enhance the response to immune therapy in MC38 tumor-bearing mice; it not only induced the apoptosis of cancer cells, but also promoted the tumor infiltration of Teff cells (CD8+) and decreased Treg cells (CD25+). More importantly, GdOFBAu maintained good biosafety and biocompatibility during treatment. Taken together, this study may offer a promising opportunity for sensitizing cancer immunotherapy via metal–peptide self-assembling nanostructured material with high effectiveness and safety.</jats:p>"

Alfalfa stands of different ages were subjected to screening for viruses using high-throughput sequencing and RT-PCR. The two most common viruses found were alfalfa mosaic virus and bean leafroll virus, along with Medicago sativa amalgavirus, two alphapartitiviruses, and one deltapartitivirus. Additionally, a new flavi-like virus with an unusual genome organization was discovered, dubbed Snake River alfalfa virus (SRAV). The 11,745 nt, positive-sense (+) RNA genome of SRAV encodes a single 3835 aa polyprotein with only two identifiable conserved domains, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and a predicted serine protease. Notably, unlike all +RNA virus genomes in the similar size range, the SRAV polyprotein contained no predicted helicase domain. In the RdRP phylogeny, SRAV was placed inside the flavi-like lineage as a sister clade to a branch consisting of hepaci-, and pegiviruses. To the best of our knowledge, SRAV is the first flavi-like virus identified in a plant host. Although commonly detected in alfalfa crops in southern Idaho, SRAV sequences were also amplified from thrips feeding in alfalfa stands in the area, suggesting a possible role of Frankliniella occidentalis in virus transmission.</jats:p>"

NiV is considered endemic in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia. There are no licensed vaccines against NiV. This study aimed at predicting a dual-antigen multi-epitope subunit chimeric vaccine against surface-glycoproteins G and F of NiV. Targeted proteins were subjected to immunoinformatics analyses to predict antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes. The proposed vaccine designs were implemented based on the conservancy, population coverage, molecular docking, immune simulations, codon adaptation, secondary mRNA structure, and in-silico cloning. Total 40 T and B-cell epitopes were found to be conserved, antigenic (vaxijen-value &gt; 0.4), non-toxic, non-allergenic, and human non-homologous. Of 12 hypothetical vaccines, two (NiV_BGD_V1 and NiV_BGD_V2) were strongly immunogenic, non-allergenic, and structurally stable. The proposed vaccine candidates show a negative Z-score (− 6.32 and − 6.67) and 83.6% and 89.3% of most rama-favored regions. The molecular docking confirmed the highest affinity of NiV_BGD_V1 and NiV_BGD_V2 with TLR-4 (ΔG = − 30.7) and TLR8 (ΔG = − 20.6), respectively. The vaccine constructs demonstrated increased levels of immunoglobulins and cytokines in humans and could be expressed properly using an adenoviral-based pAdTrack-CMV expression vector. However, more experimental investigations and clinical trials are needed to validate its efficacy and safety.</jats:p>",

In this study, bisphenol A epoxy resin was modified by blending with alicyclic epoxy resin (2021P). Three different proportions of 2021P/DGEBA blend resins (0% 2021P/DGEBA, 10% 2021P/DGEBA and 20% 2021P/DGEBA) were prepared, and the high salt medium corrosion test was carried out. The physicochemical (FTIR, DMA, TGA) and electrical properties (dielectric loss, leakage current and breakdown field strength) of the blend resin before and after aging were tested and analyzed, and the optimal blend proportion was determined. The results showed that after salt aging, the Tg of 0% 2021P/DGEBA decreased to 122.99 °C, while the Tg of 10% 2021P/DGEBA reached 134.89 °C; The leakage current of 0% 2021P/DGEBA increased to 48.994 μA, while that of 10% 2021P/DGEBA only increased to 44.549 μA; The breakdown field strength of 0% 2021P/DGEBA dropped to 40.36 kv/mm, while that of 10% 2021P/DGEBA only dropped to 43.63 kv/mm. The introduction of 2021P enhanced the salt corrosion resistance of the blend resin, which could hinder the penetration, diffusion and erosion of external media (such as Na+, Cl−, H2O, etc.) to the matrix resin. The comprehensive properties of 10% 2021P/DGEBA blend system reached the best, which was better than other blending resins, showing great application potential.</jats:p>"

However, the applications could be seriously limited due to the trade‐off between phase stability and intrinsic magnetic properties. In this work, an effective solution is demonstrated by constructing the core–shell structure (Sm‐rich shell and Y‐rich core) via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process. The anisotropy field for the (Sm<jats:sub>0.75</jats:sub>Y<jats:sub>0.25</jats:sub>)(Fe<jats:sub>0.8</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>11.25</jats:sub>Ti<jats:sub>0.75</jats:sub> alloy is mostly optimized to be 9.24 T at room temperature. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the pinning process of domain walls by the magnetic‐hardening Sm‐rich shell, which is directly observed by in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and reconstructed by micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, the phase stability and saturation magnetization are simultaneously increased, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of Y, Co, and Ti substitutions. More importantly, the high μ<jats:sub>0</jats:sub><jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub> value of 1.52 T is comparable to the reported (Sm,Zr)Fe<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>‐based bulk alloys that contain a larger amount of soft α‐Fe phases, indicating that this strategy is more promising toward bulk magnets. The present study provides a significant concept for the development of advanced permanent magnets and also has implications for understanding the structural origin of intrinsic magnetic configurations.</jats:p>",

The vibrations of the structure are described by fifteen unknowns. Each layer of the structure is described by five unknowns: three projections of the displacements of the layer middle surface and two rotation angles of the middle surface normal. Displacement continuity conditions at the layer interfaces are used. The higher-order shear theory is used to describe the stress-strain state of the structure. The case of conical sandwich shell ? supersonic gas flow interaction is considered. Due to this interaction, self-vibrations of the shell structure are set up. In their analysis, the geometrical nonlinearity of the structure is accounted for. Motion equations of the structure are derived using the assumed-mode method, which uses the kinetic and the potential energy of the structure. The self-vibrations are represented as eigenmode expansions, which contain a set of generalized coordinates. A system of nonlinear autonomous ordinary differential equations in the generalized coordinates is derived. The self-vibrations are studied using a combination of the shooting technique and the parameter continuation method. Multipliers are calculated to analyze the stability of periodic vibrations and their bifurcations. The dynamic instability of the structure’s trivial equilibrium is studied by numerical simulation. For clamped-clamped and cantilever shells, the properties of their periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motions are analyzed in detail.</jats:p>",

Starch chain-length distributions of double and triple mutants indicated greater levels of amylose than sibling controls (33.8% of starch in triple mutants, and 29.3% in double mutants vs. 25.5% in sibling controls) and fewer long amylopectin chains. Wholemeal flour of triple mutants had more resistant starch (6.0% vs. 2.9% in sibling controls) and greater levels of non-starch polysaccharides; the grains appeared shrunken and weighed ~ 11% less than the sibling control which was partially explained by loss in starch content.

This framework guides the standardisation of protocols in the EV field. To date, the focus has been on EVs of human origin. As comparative medicine progresses, there has been a drive to study similarities between diseases in humans and animals. To successfully research EVs in felines, we must validate the application of the MISEV guidelines in this group. EVs were isolated from the plasma of healthy humans and felines. EV characterisation was carried out according to the MISEV guidelines. Human and feline plasma showed a similar concentration of EVs, comparable expression of known EV markers and analogous particle to protein ratios. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that the proteomic signature of EVs from humans and felines were similar. Asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation, showed two distinct subpopulations of EVs isolated from human plasma, whereas only one subpopulation was isolated from feline plasma. Metabolomic profiling showed similar profiles for humans and felines. In conclusion, isolation, and characterisation of EVs from humans and felines show that MISEV2018 guidelines may also be applied to felines. Potential comparative medicine studies of EVs may provide a model for studying naturally occurring diseases in both humans and felines.</jats:p>"

In this paper, continuous basalt-fiber-reinforced epoxy matrix composites were used to fabricate the core rods and composite cross arms. The results verified that basalt fiber composite cross arms can meet the strict requirements of transmission lines in terms of quality and reliability. In addition to high electrical insulation performance, the flexural modulus and the flexural strength of basalt fiber core rods are 1.8 and 1.06 times those of glass fiber core rods, respectively. Basalt fiber core rods were found to be much better load-bearing components compared to glass fiber core rods. However, the leakage current and the result of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis reveal that the interface bonding strength between basalt fibers and the matrix resin is weak. A 3D reconstruction of micro-CT indicates that the volume of pores inside basalt fiber core rods accounts for 0.0048% of the total volume, which is greater than the 0.0042% of glass fiber rods. Therefore, improving the interface bond between basalt fibers and the resin can further improve the properties of basalt fiber core rods.</jats:p>"

Here we used a proteomics approach to screen for biologically and immunologically relevant proteins acting at the tick‐host interface during tick feeding and, as proof of principle, measured host antibody responses to some of the discovered candidates. We used a label‐free quantitative proteomic workflow to study salivary proteomes of (i) wild <jats:italic>Ixodes ricinus</jats:italic> ticks fed on different hosts, (ii) wild or laboratory ticks fed on the same host, and (iii) adult ticks cofed with nymphs. Our results reveal high and stable expression of several protease inhibitors and other tick‐specific proteins under different feeding conditions. Most pathways functionally enriched in sialoproteomes were related to proteolysis, endopeptidase, and amine‐binding activities. The generated catalogue of tick salivary proteins enabled the selection of six candidate secreted immunogenic peptides for rabbit immunizations, three of which induced strong and durable antigen‐specific antibody responses in rabbits. Furthermore, rabbits exposed to ticks mounted immune responses against the candidate peptides/proteins, confirming their expression at the tick‐vertebrate interface. Our approach provides insights into tick adaptation strategies to different feeding conditions and promising candidates for developing antitick vaccines or markers of exposure of vertebrate hosts to tick bites.</jats:p>",

The compact sources are connected by a “bridge” of lower-surface-brightness dust emission and lie within more extended emission that may correspond to a circumbinary disk.

The only line detected is <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>CO <jats:italic>J</jats:italic> = 2–1, in absorption against the 1.3 mm continuum, which likely traces a layer of cooler molecular material surrounding the protostars. We also report the discovery of a highly asymmetric bipolar molecular outflow that appears to be driven by MM2E and/or MM2W in new deep, ∼0.″5 resolution (1685 au) ALMA 0.82 mm observations. This outflow, traced by low-excitation CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>OH emission, indicates ongoing accretion onto the protobinary system. Overall, the super-Alfvénic models of Mignon-Risse et al. agree well with the observed properties of the MM2E/MM2W protobinary, suggesting that this system may be forming in an environment with a weak magnetic field.</jats:p>",

Sampling was performed for eight locations of Danube Delta branches and Bechet area during three consecutive years (2019–2021). Molecular identification of sixteen gastropods and twelve crustacean individuals was confirmed to the species level, providing the first molecular identification of gastropods from the Lower Danube sector. Phylogenetic analysis showed that species of gastropods and crustaceans clustered in monophyletic groups. Among gastropods, Microcolpia daudebartii acicularis, Viviparus viviparus, Bithynia tentaculata, Physa fontinalis, Ampullaceana lagotis and Planorbarius corneus were identified in Chilia and Sulina branches; and the Bechet area was populated by Holandriana holandrii, Theodoxus transversalis and Gyraulus parvus. The amphipods and mysids were present along the three main Danube branches. The calculated density of these species revealed an abundant community of crustacean Chelicorophium robustum on Sulina branch, and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and D. villosus in extended areas of the Danube Delta. The presence of these invertebrates along Danube River was reported in relation to the sediment type and water depth.</jats:p>"

Here, we report quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements on two samples differing in water content at five temperatures below 280 K. The QENS spectra show water undergoing two different types of diffusive motion near the CuO surfaces: a “slow” translational diffusion occurring on a nanosecond time scale and a faster rotational motion. Further from the surfaces, there is “fast” translational diffusion comparable in rate to that of bulk supercooled water and the rotational motion occurring in the interfacial water. Analysis of the QENS spectra supports wetting of water to the CuO blades as seen in electron microscopy images. In addition, we observe an anomalous temperature dependence of the QENS spectra on cooling from 270 to 230 K with features consistent with a liquid–liquid phase transition. We suggest that the solvent-like properties of the coexisting bulk-like water in our CuO samples are a significant factor in determining the temperature dependence of the interfacial water’s dynamics. Our results are compared with those obtained from two well-studied substrate classes: (1) silicas that contain ordered cylindrical nanopores but have weaker hydrophilicity and (2) nanoparticles of other transition-metal oxides, such as TiO2, which share the strong hydrophilicity of our samples but lack their porosity.</jats:p>",

Although previous studies have pointed out these two types of disgust can affect behavior and spatial dimensions of moral judgment, less is known about how moral and core disgust affect the temporal neural processing of moral judgment. In addition, whether moral and core disgust are only related to purity-based moral judgment or all kinds of moral judgment is still controversial. This study aimed to explore how core and moral disgust affect the neural processing of purity-based moral judgment by using affective priming and moral judgment tasks. The behavioral results showed that the severity of moral violation of non-purity ones is higher than purity ones. The event-related potentials (ERP) results mainly revealed that earlier P2 and N2 components, which represent the automatic moral processes, can differentiate neutral and two types of disgust rather than differentiating moral domain, while the later N450, frontal, and parietal LPP components, which represent the conflict detection and, later, cognitive processing can differentiate the purity and non-purity ones rather than differentiating priming type. Moreover, core and moral disgust priming mainly differed in the purity-based moral processing indexed by parietal LPP. Our findings confirmed that the disgusting effect on moral judgments can be explained within the framework of dual-process and social intuitionist models, suggesting that emotions, including core and moral disgust, played an essential role in the automatic intuition process. The later parietal LPP results strongly supported that core disgust only affected the purity-based moral judgment, fitting the primary purity hypothesis well. We show how these theories can provide novel insights into the temporal mechanisms of moral judgment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to use environmental cues to flexibly guide responses is crucial for adaptive behavior and is thought to be controlled within a series of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. Previous evidence has indicated that different prefrontal cortical regions control dissociable aspects of behavioral flexibility, with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) necessary for the ability to shift attention to a novel strategy (set-shifting) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) necessary for shifting attention between learned stimulus-outcome associations (reversal learning). The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a major downstream target of both the mPFC and the OFC; however, its role in controlling reversal learning and set-shifting abilities is still unclear. Here we investigated the contribution of the two major NAc neuronal populations, medium spiny neurons expressing either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors (D1-/D2-MSNs), in guiding reversal learning and set-shifting in an attentional set-shifting task (ASST). Persistent inhibition of neurotransmitter release from NAc D2-MSNs, but not D1-MSNs, resulted in an impaired ability for reversal learning, but not set-shifting in male mice. These findings suggest that NAc D2-MSNs play a critical role in suppressing responding toward specific learned cues that are now associated with unfavorable outcomes (i.e., in reversal stages), but not in the suppression of more general learned strategies (i.e., in set-shifting). This study provides further evidence for the anatomical separation of reversal learning and set-shifting abilities within cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops.</jats:p>"

Prediction of the overflow in advance can effectively avoid the occurrence of this kind of accident. However, the drilling history has unbalanced distribution, and labeling data is a time-consuming and laborious job. To address this issue, an overflow-prediction algorithm based on semi-supervised learning is designed in this paper, which can accurately predict overflow 10 min in advance when the labeled data are limited. Firstly, a three-step feature-selection algorithm is conducted to extract 22 features, and the time series samples are constructed through a 500-width sliding window with step size 1. Then, the Mean Teacher model with Jitter noise is employed to train the labeled and unlabeled data at the same time, in which a fused CNN-LSTM network is built for time-series prediction. Compared with supervised learning and other semi-supervised learning frameworks, the results show that the proposed model based on only 200 labeled samples is able to achieve the same effect as supervised learning method using 1000 labeled samples, and the prediction accuracy can reach 87.43% 10 min in advance. With the increase in the proportion of unlabeled samples, the performance of the model can sustain a rise within a certain range.</jats:p>"

This AI‐on‐a‐chip technology combines fluorescence microscopy, AI‐based image processing, sort‐timing prediction, and cell sorting. Sort‐timing prediction is particularly essential due to the latency on the order of milliseconds between image acquisition and sort actuation, during which image processing is performed. The long latency amplifies the effects of the fluctuations in the flow speed of cells, leading to fluctuation and uncertainty in the arrival time of cells at the sort point on the microfluidic chip. To compensate for this fluctuation, iIACS measures the flow speed of each cell upstream, predicts the arrival timing of the cell at the sort point, and activates the actuation of the cell sorter appropriately. Here, we propose and demonstrate a machine learning technique to increase the accuracy of the sort‐timing prediction that would allow for the improvement of sort event rate, yield, and purity. Specifically, we trained an algorithm to predict the sort timing for morphologically heterogeneous budding yeast cells. The algorithm we developed used cell morphology, position, and flow speed as inputs for prediction and achieved 41.5% lower prediction error compared to the previously employed method based solely on flow speed. As a result, our technique would allow for an increase in the sort event rate of iIACS by a factor of ~2.</jats:p>",

Uncovering genetic mechanism of ShB resistance and strong resistant varieties in rice are the premise for ShB resistance improvement. A rice ShB genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using approximately five million SNPs within Ting’s core collection. “Early pradifice”, one typical japonica, was determined to be the most resistant variety in both 2016 and 2017. A total of 34 and four significant (p ≤ 1.93 × 10−8) SNPs were observed in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Moreover, 23 of 34 and two of four gene-based SNPs not reported in previous studies in 2016 and 2017, respectively, were identified as significantly associated with rice ShB resistance. Furthermore, we performed GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses for the genes located at a region within 10 kb of the significant SNPs. Both in 2016 and 2017, we observed that genes were uniquely enriched in the regulation of transcription and RNA processing in the category of “biological process”, plasma membrane, nucleus, integral component of membrane and cell wall in the category of “cellular component”, and ATP binding in the category of “molecular function”. The results of the present study may establish a foundation for further research investigating these elite genes and utilizing the resistant varieties in Ting’s core collection to improve rice ShB resistance.</jats:p>"

The expression of GmPUB21, which possesses E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, was found to be significantly up-regulated by drought, salinity, and ABA treatments. The fusion protein GmPUB21-GFP was localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and plasma membrane. Transgenic lines of the Nicotiana benthamiana over-expressing GmPUB21 showed more sensitive to osmotic, salinity stress and ABA in seed germination and inhibited mannitol/NaCl-mediated stomatal closure. Moreover, higher reactive oxygen species accumulation was observed in GmPUB21 overexpressing plants after drought and salinity treatment than in wild-type (WT) plants. Contrarily, silencing of GmPUB21 in soybean plants significantly enhanced the tolerance to drought and salinity stresses. Collectively, our results revealed that GmPUB21 negatively regulates the drought and salinity tolerance by increasing the stomatal density and aperture via the ABA signaling pathway. These findings improved our understanding of the role of GmPUB21 under drought and salinity stresses in soybean.</jats:p>"

The ONC is sensitive to axial strain and works as the core transducing element to monitor the deformation of the diaphragm driven by acoustic waves. We first theoretically studied the sensing property of the ONC to axial strain and the deformation of the diaphragm. The results reveal that ONC working at the dispersion turning point (DTP) shows improved ultra-sensitivity towards axial strain, and the largest deformation of the circular diaphragm occurs at the center. Guided by the theoretical results, we fabricated an ONC with a DPT at 1550 nm, and we fixed one end of the ONC to the center of the diaphragm and the other end to the edge to construct the acoustic sensor. Finally, the experimental results show that the sensor can achieve accurate measurement in the broadband acoustic wave range of 30~20,000 Hz with good linearity. Specifically, when the input acoustic wave frequency is 120 Hz, the sensitivity reaches 1923 mV/Pa, the signal-to-noise ratio is 42.45 dB, and the minimum detectable sound pressure is 330 μPa/Hz1/2. The sensor has the merits of simple structure, low cost, and high performance, and it provides a new method for acoustic wave detection.</jats:p>"

At 10 ± 2 d of age (study day 0), group-housed (six·pen−1) heifer calves (Holstein-Friesian × Jersey) were allocated to low (4 L whole milk·calf−1·d−1; n = 7 pens) or high (8 L whole milk·calf−1·d−1; n = 7 pens) MA for the next 63 d. Calves were gradually weaned between days 63 ± 2 and 73 ± 2. Calves in each pen had ad-libitum access to clean water, pelleted calf starter, and chopped grass hay from day 1 to 91 ± 2 d. At 92 ± 2 d, all calves were transferred to pasture, grazed in a mob, and their growth and selected blood metabolites were measured until day 209. All animals were weighed weekly during the indoor period (to day 91) and then at days 105, 112, 128, 162, 184, and 209. Skeletal growth measurements and blood samples to analyze selected metabolites were collected at the start of the experiment, weaning, and then postweaning on day 91, and day 201. Specific antibodies against Leptospira and Clostridia were quantified in weeks 7, 13, and 27. Mammary glands were scanned using ultrasonography at the start of the experiment, weaning, and day 201. Feeding high vs. low amounts of MA increased the preweaning growth in heifer calves (P = 0.02) without negatively affecting postweaning average daily gain (ADG) (P = 0.74). Compared with heifers fed with low MA, high MA fed heifers had a greater increase in antibodies against Leptospira and Clostridia by 13 wk of age (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.06, respectively). By 27 wk of age, the antibody response was the same in heifers offered low or high MA. There was no effect of MA on the total size of the mammary gland, measured by ultrasonography, at weaning and 7 mo of age. However, the greater MA was associated with more mammary parenchyma (P = 0.01) and less mammary fat pad (P = 0.03) in back glands at 7 mo of age compared with heifers fed lower MA. In conclusion, feeding a high vs. a low amount of unpasteurized whole milk increased the preweaning growth of New Zealand replacement heifers without negatively affecting their ADG during postweaning under grazing conditions. Feeding more (8 vs. 4 L·d−1) unpasteurized whole milk positively affected antibody responses early in life and mammary gland composition by 7 mo of age in dairy heifers reared for pasture-based dairy systems.</jats:p>",

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a cause of glaucoma. However, glaucoma often develops with normal IOP and is known as normal‐tension glaucoma (NTG). Glutamate neurotoxicity is considered as one of the significant causes of NTG, resulting in excessive stimulation of retinal neurons via the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The present study examined the phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein‐2 (CRMP2), a protein that is abundantly expressed in neurons and involved in their development. In two mouse models, NMDA‐injection and glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) mutant, CRMP2 phosphorylation at the cyclin‐dependent kinase‐5 (Cdk5) site was elevated in RGCs. We confirmed that the decrease in the number of RGCs and thickness of the inner retinal layer (IRL) could be suppressed after NMDA administration in CRMP2KI/KI mice with genetically inhibited CRMP2 phosphorylation. Next, we investigated GLAST heterozygotes (GLAST+/−) with CRMP2KI/KI (GLAST+/−;CRMP2KI/KI) and GLAST knockout (GLAST−/−) mice with CRMP2KI/KI (GLAST−/−;CRMP2KI/KI) mice and compared them with GLAST+/− and GLAST−/− mice. pCRMP2 (S522) inhibition significantly reduced RGC loss and IRL thinning. These results suggest that the inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation could be a novel strategy for treating NTG.</jats:p>",

It is widely used as a supplement that regulates brain function through stress-reducing and sleep-enhancing effects. However, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, as it is reportedly unable to cross the blood–brain barrier. Here, we explored whether a single peroral administration of GABA affects feeding behavior as an evaluation of brain function and the involvement of vagal afferent nerves. Peroral GABA at 20 and 200 mg/kg immediately before refeeding suppressed short-term food intake without aversive behaviors in mice. However, GABA administration 30 min before refeeding demonstrated no effects. A rise in circulating GABA concentrations by the peroral administration of 200 mg/kg GABA was similar to that by the intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg GABA, which did not alter feeding. The feeding suppression by peroral GABA was blunted by the denervation of vagal afferents. Unexpectedly, peroral GABA alone did not alter vagal afferent activities histologically. The coadministration of a liquid diet and GABA potentiated the postprandial activation of vagal afferents, thereby enhancing postprandial satiation. In conclusion, dietary GABA activates vagal afferents in collaboration with meals or meal-evoked factors and regulates brain function including feeding behavior.</jats:p>"

This paper first starts from the market and government perspective and sorts out the formation mechanism of an innovation network. Subsequently, based on the development practice of the innovation network in the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt, we applied the grounded theory to reveal the development constraints of the innovation network in the core area and explore the corresponding network governance mechanism. Subsequently, we applied a survey study to test our conceptual model. We empirically found the innovation network structure governance and innovation relation governance impacting mechanism in a market-led and government guidance context. The study found that: first, the market-led environment and government guidance jointly impact the formation of an innovation network. Second, the network structure governance and network relation governance of the innovation network can address the development constraints faced by the current innovation network to a certain extent, thereby improving the firm’s innovation performance. Finally, it is found that both the market-led environment and government guidance play a positive role in regulating the impact of network structure governance and network relation governance on the firm’s innovation performance. The above conclusions expand the application scenarios of innovation network governance theory in underdeveloped areas and, at the same time, provide new theoretical knowledge increments for the formation mechanism of innovation networks and also provide corresponding theoretical guidance for the improvement of the firm’s innovation performance in the core area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A WO3 photoanode is a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting due to its earth-abundance, highly tunable composition, excellent stability, and electrical conductivity. However, its actual PEC performances are inferior to theoretical values, which are challenged by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and sluggish water oxidation kinetics. Here, a flame method that has the advantages of being simplistic, controllable, and ultra-efficient is reported to generate a rich oxygen vacancy (OV) in WO3 nanosheet arrays to enhance the PEC performance. The morphology, crystallinity, and PEC performance of the WO3 nanosheet arrays were significantly sensitive to the process parameters. By optimizing the process, rich surface OVs were introduced in the WO3 photoanode within 30 s, while the overall morphology, crystallinity, and conductive substrate were well preserved. The optimum deficient WO3 photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 2.40 mA cm−2, which is 3.33 times as high as that of the untreated counterpart. The OVs significantly improved the PEC performance of the WO3 photoanode by enhanced carrier transports and stronger activation for OH− ions. Moreover, the proposed flame method exhibits great versatility in prevalent metal oxides for introducing OVs.</jats:p>",

In recent years, PCMs have been embedded into polymer fibers for thermal regulating purposes. The PCM‐containing polymer fibers, however, usually suffer the leakage problem because PCMs are not covered well by polymers in fibers. To solve this problem, in this study, we develop a facile strategy to fabricate PCM‐containing polymer fibers without the leakage problem. The PCM/polystyrene (PS) core‐shell microspheres are first prepared by suspension polymerization, in which <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>‐hexadecane is used as the PCM. By blending the PCM/PS microspheres into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) solutions, The PMMA fibers blended with core‐shell PCM/PS microspheres can be prepared via electrospinning. Acetic acid is chosen as the solvent, which can selectively dissolve PMMA and cannot dissolve PS. Therefore, the morphologies of the core‐shell PCM/PS microspheres can be maintained during the electrospinning processes. The microspheres and fibers are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermal imaging results demonstrate that the PCM‐containing fibers can effectively regulate temperatures and fibers with higher contents of PCM exhibit better thermal regulating behaviors. Repeated thermal regulating experiments are also conducted for up to 4 cycles.</jats:p>",

Rehd. et W (SC) and Alangium chinense (Lour.) Harms (AC), the core drug pair (CDP) in the formula of JGL, is used at high frequencies in many Miao medicine prescriptions for rheumatic diseases. However, previous research lacks the pharmacokinetic study of JGL, and study on the compatibility of its CDP with other medicinal herbs in the formula is needed. This study aims to establish a simple, rapid, and sensitive Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of four main bioactive components of JGL in rat plasma, including Salidroside (Sal), Anabasine (Ana), Chlorogenic Acid (CA), and Protocatechuic Acid (PCA), and compare the pharmacokinetic properties of two groups of rats after being orally administrated with JGL and its CDP extracts, respectively. The results showed that area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), mean retention time (MRT), and clearance rate (CL), of Sal, Ana, CA and PCA in the two groups of rats were changed in different degrees. The CDP combined with other drugs could significantly increase the absorption of Sal and Ana, prolong its retention time in vivo, and may accelerate the absorption rate of CA and PCA. This indicated that the combination of CDP and other herbs may affect the pharmacokinetics process of active components in vivo, increase the exposure and bioavailability of compounds in the JGL group, and prolong the retention time, which may be the reason why JGL has a better inhibitory effect on inflammatory cytokines, providing a viable orientation for the compatibility investigation of herb medicines.</jats:p>"

The disease currently circulates in Africa, Europe, Asia and on the island of Hispaniola. The ongoing epizootics in Europe and Asia have produced millions of animal deaths and severe economic losses. No effective vaccine is available for ASF, making rapid and accurate detection of ASFV essential for disease mitigation strategies. Currently available diagnostics for ASFV possess significant limitations related to assay performance, deployability, and/or turn-around time; therefore there is an unmet need for pen-side diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. A chromatographic lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was developed for the detection of ASFV antigen in EDTA-treated whole blood using monoclonal antibodies targeting the viral p30 protein. The assay requires only water to perform and provides results in 25 min, making it well-suited for field use. The LFIA was capable of detecting genotype I and genotype II strains of ASFV in EDTA blood from experimentally infected pigs at varying time-points after infection, though it was unable to detect a genotype X ASFV strain. Diagnostic sensitivity correlated with clinical disease severity, body temperature, and viral DNA levels, and was over 90% in animals showing moderate to severe ASF-related symptoms after challenge with virulent genotype II virus. The LFIA also showed a robust diagnostic specificity of over 98%, which is essential to field testing for a high consequence to foregin animal disease. The LFIA targeting the viral p30 protein can reliably detect ASFV in whole blood from animals showing moderate to severe clinical signs of infection with virulent genotype I and II isolates, making it a promising candidate for use as a field-deployable antigen detection assay. Additional evaluation using field samples and different virus strains is required to further assess the utility of this rapid diagnostic test.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Aim Sciatica is one of the most common diseases of the peripheral nervous system and may be caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve. Due to the fact that piriformis muscle located near the sciatic nerve, piriformis muscle spasm may put pressure on the nerve and cause sciatica and consequently piriformis syndrome. The present study aims to investigate the effect of core stability exercises on pain and inflammation of patients with piriformis syndrome. Methods &amp; Materials This is a randomized clinical trial. The study population consists of all patients with piriformis syndrome referred to medical centers in Arak, Iran from. Of these, 20 were purposefully selected and randomly divided into two groups of control (n=10) and exercise (n=10). The exercise group performed core stability exercises for 6 weeks, while the control group continued their normal life during this period. To examine the differences between the study groups, t-test, Chi-Square test, and McNemar’s test were used. The significance level was set at 0.05. Ethical Considerations This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Arak University of Medical Sciences (Code: IR.ARAKMU.REC.1400.157) and was registered by Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (ID: IRCT20211003052662N1). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Results The Mean pain score in the control group decreased from 95.2 to 90.7 after the exercise, which was not statistically significant (P=0.562). In the exercise group, the mean pain score decreased from 91.7 to 33.4, and this decrease was statistically significant (P=0.0); Therefore, at 95% confidence interval, we can say that core stability exercises had a significant effect on the pain of patients with piriformis syndrome (P&lt;0.05). The number of patients with inflamed nerve in the control group decreased from 10 in the pre-test phase to 8 in the post-test phase, but this decrease was not statistically significant (P=0.5). In the exercise group, it was reduced from 10 to 2, and this decrease was statistically significant (P=0.008); Therefore, we can say that core stability exercises had a significant effect on the inflammation of patients with piriformis syndrome (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion Core stability exercises can reduce pain and inflammation in patients with piriformis syndrome. These exercises can be used in the treatment of these patients.</jats:p>"

UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles with a narrow size and shape distribution were used to form a series of core–shell MOF@SiO2 structures. The duration of silanization was varied to change the thickness of the SiO2 shell, revealing a nonlinear dependence that was attributed to silicon penetration into the porous MOF structure. Doxorubicin encapsulation showed a similar final loading of 5.6 wt % for both uncoated and silica-coated particles, demonstrating the potential of the nanocomposite’s application in small molecule delivery. Silica coating improved the colloidal stability of the composites in a number of model physiological media, enabled grafting of target molecules to the surface, and prevented an uncontrolled release of their cargo, with the drawback of decreased overall porosity. Further modification of the particles with the conjugate of pluronic and folic acid was performed to improve the biocompatibility, prolong the blood circulation time, and target the encapsulated drug to the folate-expressing cancer cells. The final DOX-loaded UiO-66@SiO2/F127-FA nanoparticles were subjected to properties characterization and in vitro evaluation, including studies of internalization into cells and antitumor activity.

Coordinated membrane biogenesis of different organelles necessitates lipid transport from their site of synthesis to their destination. Several factors have been proposed to participate in lipid distribution, but despite its basic importance, in vivo evidence linking the absence of putative transport pathways to specific transport defects remains scarce. A reason for this scarcity is the near absence of in vivo lipid trafficking assays. Here we introduce a versatile method named METALIC (Mass tagging-Enabled TrAcking of Lipids In Cells) to track interorganelle lipid flux inside cells. In this strategy, two enzymes, one directed to a ‘donor’ and the other to an ‘acceptor’ organelle, add two distinct mass tags to lipids. Mass-spectrometry-based detection of lipids bearing the two mass tags is then used to quantify exchange between the two organelles. By applying this approach, we show that the ERMES and Vps13–Mcp1 complexes have transport activity in vivo, and unravel their relative contributions to endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria lipid exchange.</jats:p>",

Emerging studies suggest ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) contribute to chemotherapy resistance and tumor relapse. Recent studies demonstrated estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) exerts tumor suppressor functions in OCa. However, the status of ERβ expression in OCSCs and the therapeutic utility of the ERβ agonist LY500307 for targeting OCSCs remain unknown. OCSCs were enriched from ES2, OV90, SKOV3, OVSAHO, and A2780 cells using ALDEFLUOR kit. RT-qPCR results showed ERβ, particularly ERβ isoform 1, is highly expressed in OCSCs and that ERβ agonist LY500307 significantly reduced the viability of OCSCs. Treatment of OCSCs with LY500307 significantly reduced sphere formation, self-renewal, and invasion, while also promoting apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic studies using RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that LY500307 treatment resulted in modulation of pathways related to cell cycle and apoptosis. Western blot and RT-qPCR assays demonstrated the upregulation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest genes such as FDXR, p21/CDKN1A, cleaved PARP, and caspase 3, and the downregulation of stemness markers SOX2, Oct4, and Nanog. Importantly, treatment of LY500307 significantly attenuated the tumor-initiating capacity of OCSCs in orthotopic OCa murine xenograft models. Our results demonstrate that ERβ agonist LY500307 is highly efficacious in reducing the stemness and promoting apoptosis of OCSCs and shows significant promise as a novel therapeutic agent in treating OCa.</jats:p>"

One way of making such structures is encapsulating them inside single‐walled carbon nanotubes. Despite the versatility of Raman spectroscopy to resolve strong spectral signals of these systems, discerning the response of long nanoribbons from that of any residual precursor remaining outside after synthesis has been so far elusive. Here, the terrylene dye is used as precursor to make long and ultra‐narrow armchair‐edged GNR inside nanotubes. The alignment and characteristic length of terrylene encapsulated parallel to the tube's axis facilitates the ribbon formation via polymerization, with high stability up to 750 °C when the hybrid system is kept in high vacuum. A high temperature annealing is used to remove the terrylene external molecules and a subtraction model based on the determination of a scaling factor related to the G‐band response of the system is developed. This not only represents a critical step forward toward the analysis of the nanoribbon‐nanotube system, but it is a study that enables unraveling the Raman signatures of the individual CH‐modes (the signature of edge passivation) for GNR for the first time with unprecedented detail.</jats:p>",

Recent studies have shown that peptides derived from human APOE display anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Here, we applied in vitro assays and fluorescent microscopy to investigate the anti-bacterial effects of full-length APOE. The interaction of APOE with endotoxins from Escherichia coli was explored using surface plasmon resonance, binding assays, transmission electron microscopy and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We also studied the immunomodulatory activity of APOE using in vitro cell assays and an in vivo mouse model in combination with advanced imaging techniques. We observed that APOE exhibits anti-bacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacterial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In addition, we showed that APOE exhibits a significant binding affinity for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipid A as well as heparin. MD simulations identified the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) binding region in helix 4 of APOE as a primary binding site for these molecules via electrostatic interactions. Together, our data suggest that APOE may have an important role in controlling inflammation during Gram-negative bacterial infection.</jats:p>"

This method has shown great promise in various fields, including drug development. The availability of public structure databases prompted the researchers to use generative artificial intelligence models to narrow down their search of the chemical space, a novel approach to chemogenomics and de novo drug development. In this study, we developed a strategy that combined an accelerated LSTM_Chem (long short-term memory for de novo compounds generation), dense fully convolutional neural network (DFCNN), and docking to generate a large number of de novo small molecular chemical compounds for given targets. To demonstrate its efficacy and applicability, six important targets that account for various human disorders were used as test examples. Moreover, using the M protease as a proof-of-concept example, we find that iteratively training with previously selected candidates can significantly increase the chance of obtaining novel compounds with higher and higher predicted binding affinities. In addition, we also check the potential benefit of obtaining reliable final de novo compounds with the help of MD simulation and metadynamics simulation. The generation of de novo compounds and the discovery of binders against various targets proposed here would be a practical and effective approach. Assessing the efficacy of these top de novo compounds with biochemical studies is promising to promote related drug development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The signal propagation delay through an optical fiber changes with environmental temperature, imposing a fundamental limit on performances in many fiber-optic applications. It has been shown that the thermal coefficient of delay (TCD) in hollow core fibers (HCFs) can be 20 times lower than in standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs). To further reduce TCD over a broad wavelength range at room temperature, so that to enrich fiber-optic applications in time- synchronization scenarios, the thermal expansion effect of silica glass must be compensated for. Exploiting the thermo-optic effect of air inside an anti-resonant hollow core fiber (ARF) can be a feasible solution. Nevertheless, an accurate description of the air flow in the course of temperature variation is highly needed to predict the influence of this effect. This work develops an analytical model for quantitatively calculating this temperature-induced air-flowing effect. Across a range of parameters of core diameter, fiber length, and temperature change rate, the experimentally measured propagation delay changes agree well with our model. The resultant low thermal sensitivity is also validated in non-steady conditions and in a practically usable SSMF-ARF-SSMF chain. Our model indicates that a &gt;40-fold TCD reduction relative to SSMFs can be realized in a 60-m-long, 50-µm-diameter ARF, and further TCD reduction should be possible by properly engineering the gas type and the ambient pressure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Diseases caused by flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV), are a serious threat to public health. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins by the viral and cellular proteases. Non-structural (NS) protein 3 is a multifunctional protein that has N-terminal protease and C-terminal helicase domains. The NS3 protease requires co-factor NS2B for enzymatic activity and folding. Due to its essential role in viral replication, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs. Despite the availability of crystal structures, dynamic interactions of the N- and C-termini of NS2B co-factor have been elusive due to their flexible fold. In this study, we employ integrative structural approaches combined with biochemical assays to elucidate the dynamic interactions of the flexible DENV4 NS2B and NS3 N- and C-termini. We captured the crystal structure of self-cleaved DENV4 NS2B47NS3 protease in post cleavage state. The intermediate conformation adopted in the reported structure can be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. Comparison of our new findings from DENV4 against previously studied ZIKV NS2B-NS3 proteins reveals differences in NS2B-NS3 function between the two viruses. No inhibition of protease activity was observed for unlinked DENV NS2B-NS3 in presence of the cleavage site while ZIKV NS2B-NS3 cleavage inhibits protease activity. Another difference is that binding of the NS2B C-terminus to DENV4 eNS2B47NS3Pro active site is mediated via interactions with P4-P6 residues while for ZIKV, the binding of NS2B C-terminus to active site is mediated by P1-P3 residues. The mapping of NS2B N- and C-termini with NS3 indicates that these intermolecular interactions occur mainly on the beta-barrel 2 of the NS3 protease domain. Our integrative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the folding and dynamic interactions of DENV NS3 protease and its cofactor NS2B.</jats:p>"

We present updated results from the Radiosurgery Dose Reduction for Brain Metastases on Immunotherapy (RADREMI) trial following completion of an a priori interim analysis, aimed to identify reduced-dose SRS that is safe and efficacious for this patient population. Methods: RADREMI (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04047602) is a prospective multicenter single arm Phase I trial involving patients age &gt; 18 receiving ICI with SRS for 1-10 brain metastases on MRI. Patients had biopsy-confirmed primary malignancy with disease-specific graded prognostic assessment estimated median survival of at least 6 months and no previous whole brain radiation therapy. Six-month symptomatic radiation necrosis (radiographic radiation necrosis + clinical symptoms requiring steroid administration and/or operative intervention) was the primary endpoint, based on an expected rate of 5% and a historical rate of 16%. Secondary endpoints included 6-month local control and radiographic radiation necrosis. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria defined local control; findings were compared to historical 6-month local control of 87-91% with RTOG 90-05 SRS dosing. A pre-determined interim futility analysis (based on the null hypothesis of no fewer than 15 of the first 20 patients reaching the primary endpoint achieving 6-month local control for RADREMI dosing) was performed using the Fisher’s exact test. Results: Between December 18, 2019 and September 10, 2021, 43 lesions were treated in 16 patients receiving ICI delivered within 30 days before SRS who were enrolled on trial and met the primary endpoint (median follow-up = 9.1 months). All patients received RADREMI SRS dosing (18 Gy for lesions 0-2 cm, 14 Gy for lesions 2.1-3 cm, and 12 Gy for lesions 3.1-4 cm). The most common ICI used was single-agent pembrolizumab (51% of lesions, 56% of patients), followed by single-agent nivolumab (28% of lesions, 13% of patients). The six-month rates of symptomatic and radiographic radiation necrosis were zero; the six-month local control rate was 98% per treated lesion (42/43), and 94% per treated patient (15/16), comparable to historical controls (p &gt; 0.05) and sufficient to not reject the interim futility analysis null hypothesis. Conclusions: Interim analysis reveals that the safety and efficacy of RADREMI dosing for reducing SRS dose in brain metastasis patients receiving concomitant ICI persists with excellent local control and no morbidity in a multi-institutional collaborative trial. Further results following completion of trial enrollment will provide additional evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of RADREMI SRS dosing. Clinical trial information: NCT04047602. </jats:p>",

The simulation results have revealed the trade-off relation between maximal tolerable intensity and low cavity loss, which means that there is an optimal MFD corresponding to optimal heating time and heating temperature. The proposed mode-locker has been applied in an integrated fiber laser, which has emitted ultrafast soliton with 3 times intensity larger than that of conventional sandwiched-type saturable absorber.

Unfortunately, PA is rarely diagnosed, or adequately treated, mainly because of a lack of awareness and education. Most clinicians still possess an outdated understanding of PA; from primary care physicians to hypertension specialists, there is an urgent need to redefine and reintroduce PA to clinicians with a modern and practical approach. In this state-of-the-art review, we provide readers with the most updated knowledge on the pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of PA.

The results indicated that more B. adolescentis strains appeared to be superior in alleviating T2D symptoms than B. bifidum strains. This effect was closely related to the ability of B. adolescentis to restore the homeostasis of the gut microbiota, increase the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing flora, and alleviate inflammation in mice with T2D. In addition, compared with B. bifidum, B. adolescentis had a higher number of core genes, and these genes were more evolutionarily stable, including unique environmental tolerance, carbon and nitrogen utilization genes, and a blood sugar regulation gene, glgP. This may be one of the reasons why B. adolescentis is more likely to colonize in the adult gut and show a superior ability to relieve T2D.

Monoallelic TREX1 mutations were identified in patients showing early-onset cerebrovascular disease, ascribable to small vessel disease, and CADASIL-like neuroimaging. We report the clinical-neuroradiological features of two patients with AGS-like (Patient A) and CADASIL-like (Patient B) phenotypes carrying the heterozygous p.A136V and p.R174G TREX1 variants, respectively. Genetic findings, obtained by a customized panel including 183 genes associated with monogenic stroke, were combined with interferon signature testing and biochemical assays to determine the mutations’ effects in vitro. Our results for the p.A136V variant are inconsistent with prior biochemistry-pathology correlates for dominant AGS-causing TREX1 mutants. The p.R174G variant modestly altered exonuclease activity in a manner consistent with perturbation of substrate interaction rather than catalysis, which represents the first robust enzymological data for a TREX1 variant identified in a CADASIL-like patient. In conclusion, functional analysis allowed us to interpret the impact of TREX1 variants on patients’ phenotypes. While the p.A136V variant is unlikely to be causative for AGS in Patient A, Patient B’s phenotype is potentially related to the p.R174G variant. Therefore, further functional investigations of TREX1 variants found in CADASIL-like patients are warranted to determine any causal link and interrogate the molecular disease mechanism(s).</jats:p>"

In addition to routine histopathological and molecular analyses, LOGGIC Core determines the driver alteration as precisely as possible to support treatment decisions and participation in interventional trials.

First analysis of all patients age 0 to 18, which were included in Germany as part of the German HIT-LOGGIC-program between April 2019 and February 2021, and for whom FF tissue was available.

RNA sequencing was performed on 125 samples. In this prospective, population based cohort, we confirmed KIAA1549:BRAF-fusion (57%), BRAFV600E-mutation (9%) and FGFR1-changes (10%) as most frequent alterations. 12% of cases presented rare gene fusions (e.g. TPM3:NTRK1, EWSR1:VGLL1, GOPC:ROS1, SH3PXD2A:HTRA1, PDGFB:LRP1).

By demonstrating improvement of diagnostic accuracy and making precision oncology studies (MEKi/RAFi/ERKi/NTRKi/FGFRi/ROSi) more accessible, the added value for pLGG patients becomes apparent. LOGGIC Core is currently being rolled out internationally and aims to define the new state of the art standard molecular diagnostics.

To elucidate the intra-serovar genomic structure of S.

Bovismorbificans strains from foodborne infections. Data mining of a digital DNA tiling array of legacy SARA and SARB strains was conducted to identify near-neighbors of S. Bovismorbificans. The core genome analysis and the k-mer-binning methods identified two polyphyletic clusters, each with emerging evolutionary properties. Four STs (2640, 142, 1499, and 377), which constituted the majority of the publicly available WGS datasets from &gt;260 strains analyzed by k-mer-binning based strategy, contained a conserved core genome backbone with a different evolutionary lineage as compared to strains comprising the other cluster (ST150). In addition, the assortment of genotypic features contributing to pathogenesis and persistence, such as antimicrobial resistance, prophage, plasmid, and virulence factor genes, were assessed to understand the emerging characteristics of this serovar that are relevant clinically and for food safety concerns. The phylogenomic profiling of polyphyletic S. Bovismorbificans in this study corresponds to intra-serovar variations observed in S. Napoli and S. Newport serovars using similar high-resolution genomic profiling approaches and contributes to the understanding of the evolution and sequence divergence of foodborne Salmonellae. These intra-serovar differences may have to be thoroughly understood for the accurate classification of foodborne Salmonella strains needed for the uniform development of future food safety mitigation strategies.</jats:p>"

Both experimental and numerical studies were conducted using a 7.62 mm hard steel core projectile. The numerical simulation used a 7.62 mm Ogival nose shaped projectile with a target thickness ranging from 20 to 26 mm. High velocity impact experiments on T651 and solution treated targets, with rolled plate thicknesses ranging from 21 to 25 mm were carried out to validate the numerical findings. The microhardness of the targets was measured using Vicker's microhardness tester and fractographs were examined using a scanning electron microscope. The projectile penetrated regions were analyzed using light microscopy. A good correlation between the numerical and experimental ballistic behaviour of aluminium alloy 7075 targets was observed and an optimum target thickness of 21 and 24 mm was observed for the T651 and solution treated targets to prevent the projectile's penetration. It was also noted that, after the projectile's impact, solution treated targets had higher microhardness compared to T651 condition targets. This is due to higher work hardening of solution treated targets near the penetration channel. Even though T651 targets have a lower depth of penetration compared to solution treated targets, ‘splintering’ failure of the T651 targets is observed. In contrast, ‘petalling’ and ‘plugging’ kinds of failures were noticed on the solution treated targets. Thus, solution treatment of ballistic targets may enhance the ballistic limit of armoured vehicles. </jats:p>",

The natural antibacterial product, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) has shown efficacy against community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), although its interactions against planktonic and biofilm modes of growth remain poorly understood. This investigation utilized biochemical and metabolic approaches to further elucidate the effects of GRA on MRSA. Prolonged exposure of planktonic MRSA cell cultures to GRA resulted in increased production of staphyloxanthin, a pigment known to exhibit antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing functions. Then, 1D 1H NMR analyses of intracellular metabolite extracts from MRSA treated with GRA revealed significant changes in intracellular polar metabolite profiles, including increased levels of succinate and citrate, and significant reductions in several amino acids, including branch chain amino acids. These changes reflect the MRSA response to GRA exposure, including potentially altering its membrane composition, which consumes branched chain amino acids and leads to significant energy expenditure. Although GRA itself had no significant effect of biofilm viability, it seems to be an effective biofilm disruptor. This may be related to interference with cell–cell aggregation, as treatment of planktonic MRSA cultures with GRA leads to a significant reduction in micro-aggregation. The dispersive nature of GRA on MRSA biofilms may prove valuable for treatment of such infections and could be used to increase susceptibility to complementary antibiotic therapeutics.</jats:p>"

Methods: A clinical blood assay based on 8 markers - Checkpoint Inhibitor Response Test (CiRT) - has been developed to predict response to PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibition from over 30 million data points, with validations on several independent cancer patient cohorts. The predictive 8 biomarker set is based on an observational clinical trial and several retrospective cohorts, representing all together 229 treatments with Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, in over 15 diverse oncological indications, i.e. melanoma, lung, urethral, hepatocellular, bladder, prostate, head and neck, colon, breast, bone, brain, lymphoma, larynx. Results: CiRT has demonstrated high accuracy up to 85%, sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 82%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a 3D genomic approach could be successfully utilized for development of a non-invasive predictive clinical assay for response to PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibition in cancer patients. CiRT can assist in treatment decisions, help improve patient selection for optimized treatment, utilize alternative effective treatments, minimize unnecessary toxicity, and efficiently manage the costs. </jats:p>",

However, an understanding of the genomic change driving the transition between different modes of reproduction is limited. Several ricefishes (Adrianichthyidae) on the island of Sulawesi have a unique mode of reproduction called “pelvic‐fin brooding,” wherein females carry externally fertilized eggs until hatching using their pelvic fins. Phylogenomic analysis demonstrated pelvic‐fin brooders to have evolved at least twice in two distant clades of the Adrianichthyidae. We investigated the genetic architecture of the evolution of this unique mode of reproduction. Morphological analyses and laboratory observations revealed that females of pelvic‐fin brooders have longer pelvic fins and a deeper abdominal concavity, and that they can carry an egg clutch for longer than nonbrooding adrianichthyids, suggesting that these traits play important roles in this reproductive mode. Quantitative trait locus mapping using a cross between a pelvic‐fin brooder <jats:italic>Oryzias eversi</jats:italic> and a nonbrooding <jats:italic>O. dopingdopingensis</jats:italic> reveals different traits involved in pelvic‐fin brooding to be controlled by different loci on different chromosomes. Genomic analyses of admixture detected no signatures of introgression between two lineages with pelvic‐fin brooders, indicating that introgression is unlikely to be responsible for repeated evolution of pelvic‐fin brooding. These findings suggest that multiple independent mutations may have contributed to the convergent evolution of this novel mode of reproduction.</jats:p>",

A recent study observed a depressed survival and growth rate of farmed Japanese eels when they were reared with wild eels, which indicated that wild eels might interfere with the survival and growth of farmed‐and‐stocked eels through intraspecific competition. To contribute to improving eel stocking efficiency, the growth of farmed‐and‐stocked Japanese eels was compared among four rivers with different wild eel densities using mark‐and‐recapture studies. Based on the 2‐year recapture survey after stocking, it was found that the density of the farmed‐and‐stocked eels was not significantly different among rivers. The daily growth rates of farmed‐and‐stocked eels in the rivers with lower wild eel density were significantly higher than those of the eels stocked into the rivers with higher wild eel density. The farmed‐and‐stocked eels moved significantly greater distances downstream than wild eels that showed sedentary behaviour. This and previous studies indicate that significant questions remain about the effectiveness of stocking farmed eels into water bodies where naturally recruited wild eels are present.</jats:p>",

There is a need for additional toolsets to assist the current clinical paradigm of care for patients with UTUC. As a non-invasive tool for the discovery of cancer-related biomarkers, the liquid biopsy has the potential to represent the complex process of tumorigenesis and metastasis. Herein, we show the efficacy of the liquid biopsy as a source of biomarkers for detecting UTUC. Using the third-generation high-definition single-cell assay (HDSCA3.0) workflow, we investigate liquid biopsy samples collected from patients with UTUC and normal donors (NDs) to provide critical information regarding the molecular and morphological characteristics of circulating rare events. We document several important findings from the liquid biopsy analysis of patients diagnosed with UTUC prior to surgery: (1) Large extracellular vesicles (LEVs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are detectable in the peripheral blood. (2) The rare-event profile is highly heterogeneous. (3) Clinical data elements correlate with liquid biopsy analytes. Overall, this study provides evidence for the efficacy of the liquid biopsy in understanding the biology of UTUC with the future intent of informing clinical decision making, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</jats:p>"

We aimed to identify and develop a set of core outcome domains and associated measurement instruments to include in all research in critically ill patients.Methods: An updated systematic review informed a two-stage modified Delphi consensus process (domains followed by instruments). Measurement instruments for domains considered “essential” were taken through the second stage of the Delphi and a subsequent consensus meeting.Results: 213 participants (41 patients/caregivers, 50 clinical researchers, 122 healthcare professionals) from 24 countries contributed. Consensus was reached on time points (30 and 90 days post randomisation). Three domains were considered “essential” at 30 days (Survival, Physical function and Infection) and five at 90 days (Survival, Physical function, Activities of daily living, Nutritional status and Muscle/nerve function). Core “essential” measurement instruments reached consensus for Survival and Activities of daily living, and “recommended” measurement instruments for Physical function, Nutritional status, and Muscle/nerve function. No consensus was reached for a measurement instrument for Infection. Four further domains met criteria for “recommended”, but not “essential”, to measure at 30 days post randomisation (Organ dysfunction, Muscle/nerve function, Nutritional status, and Wound healing) and three at 90 days (Frailty, Body composition and Organ dysfunction).   Conclusion: The CONCISE core outcome set is an internationally agreed minimum set of outcomes for use at 30 and 90 days post randomisation, in nutritional and metabolic clinical research in critically ill adults.</jats:p>"

Network-based approaches are tools of systems biology, that can represent valuable methods for visualizing and analysing drug-protein and protein–protein interactions. In this study, a KNIME workflow is presented which connects drugs to causal target proteins and target proteins to their causal protein interactors. With the collected data, networks can be constructed for visualizing and interpreting the connections. The last part of the workflow provides a topological enrichment test for identifying relevant pathways and processes connected to the submitted data. The workflow is based on openly available databases and their web services. As a case study, compounds of DILIRank were analysed. DILIRank is the benchmark dataset for Drug-Induced Liver Injury by the FDA, where compounds are categorized by their likeliness of causing DILI. The study includes the drugs that are most likely to cause DILI (“mostDILI”) and the ones that are not likely to cause DILI (“noDILI”). After selecting the compounds of interest, down- and upregulated proteins connected to the mostDILI group were identified; furthermore, a liver-specific subset of those was created. The downregulated sub-list had considerably more entries, therefore, network and causal interactome were constructed and topological pathway enrichment analysis was performed with this list. The workflow identified proteins such as Prostaglandin G7H synthase 1 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 as key participants in the potential toxic events disclosing the possible mode of action. The topological network analysis resulted in pathways such as recycling of bile acids and salts and glucuronidation, indicating their involvement in DILI. The KNIME pipeline was built to support target and network-based approaches to analyse any sets of drug data and identify their target proteins, mode of actions and processes they are involved in. The fragments of the pipeline can be used separately or can be combined as required.</jats:p>",

Because of the fragility and limited intracellular access of mRNA, the development of delivery technologies is essential for promoting the applicability of mRNA-based treatments. Among effective nanocarriers, polymeric micelles loading mRNA by polyion complex (PIC) formation with block catiomers have the potential to meet the delivery needs. Since PICs are relatively unstable in in vivo settings, herein, we constructed mRNA-loaded micelles having pH-responsive cross-linked cores by complexing mRNA with cis-aconitic anhydride-modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(l-lysine) (PEG-pLL(CAA)) block copolymers. The micelles were stable at physiological pH (pH 7.4) but achieved the complete release of the mRNA at endosomal pH (pH 5.5–4.5). The cross-linking also enhanced the stability of the micelles against disassembly from polyanions and protected the loaded mRNA from degradation by nucleases. Thus, the cross-linked micelles increased the delivery of mRNA to cancer cells, promoting protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight the potential of PEG-pLL(CAA)-based micelles for mRNA delivery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Malaria elimination urgently needs novel antimalarial therapies that transcend resistance, toxicity, and high costs. Our multicentric international collaborative team focuses on developing multistage antimalarials that exhibit novel mechanisms of action. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a novel multistage antimalarial compound, ‘Calxinin’. A compound that consists of hydroxyethylamine (HEA) and trifluoromethyl-benzyl-piperazine. Calxinin exhibits potent inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range against the asexual blood stages of drug-sensitive (3D7), multidrug-resistant (Dd2), artemisinin-resistant (IPC4912), and fresh Kenyan field isolated Plasmodium falciparum strains. Calxinin treatment resulted in diminished maturation of parasite sexual precursor cells (gametocytes) accompanied by distorted parasite morphology. Further, in vitro liver-stage testing with a mouse model showed reduced parasite load at an IC50 of 79 nM. A single dose (10 mg/kg) of Calxinin resulted in a 30% reduction in parasitemia in mice infected with a chloroquine-resistant strain of the rodent parasite P. berghei. The ex vivo ookinete inhibitory concentration within mosquito gut IC50 was 150 nM. Cellular in vitro toxicity assays in the primary and immortalized human cell lines did not show cytotoxicity. A computational protein target identification pipeline identified a putative P. falciparum membrane protein (Pf3D7_1313500) involved in parasite calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis as a potential Calxinin target. This highly conserved protein is related to the family of transient receptor potential cation channels (TRP-ML). Target validation experiments showed that exposure of parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) to Calxinin induces a rapid release of intracellular Ca2+ from pRBCs; leaving de-calcinated parasites trapped in RBCs. Overall, we demonstrated that Calxinin is a promising antimalarial lead compound with a novel mechanism of action and with potential therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission-blocking properties against parasites resistant to current antimalarials.</jats:p>"

We use GC-tagged Illustris simulations to demonstrate an accretion scenario where more massive satellites (with more metal- and <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>-rich GCs) sink further into the central galaxy than less massive ones, and where the gradient flattening occurs because of the low GC occupation fraction of low-mass dwarfs disrupted at larger distances. The dense environment around M87 may also cause the steep [<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>/Fe] gradient of the blue GCs, mirroring what is seen in the dwarf galaxy population. The progenitors of red GCs have a narrower mass range than those of blue GCs, which makes their gradients shallower. We also explore spatial inhomogeneity in GC abundances, finding that the red GCs to the northwest of M87 are slightly more metal-rich. Future observations of GC stellar population gradients will be useful diagnostics of halo merger histories.</jats:p>",

In Rounds 1 and 2, participants completed an online survey evaluating a set of potential open science practices that could be important and meaningful to monitor in an automated institutional open science dashboard. Participants voted on the inclusion of each item and provided a rationale for their choice. We defined consensus as 80% agreement. Between rounds, participants received aggregated voting scores for each item and anonymized comments from all participants, and were asked to re-vote on items that did not reach consensus.

Using user-centered design, participating institutions will be involved in creating a dashboard prototype, which can then be implemented to monitor rates of open science practices at biomedical institutions. Our methods and approach may also transfer to other research settings–other disciplines could consider using our consensus list as a starting point for agreement upon a discipline-specific set of open science practices to monitor.

Here we demonstrate that recurrent HER2 mutations have differential effects on endocrine therapy responsiveness, metastasis, and pan-HER TKI therapeutic sensitivity. The prevalence and prognostic significance may also depend on whether the HER2 mutant has arisen in the context of lobular versus ductal histology. The most highly recurrent HER2 mutant, L755S, was particularly resistant to neratinib but sensitive to the pan-HER TKI poziotinib, alone or in combination with fulvestrant. Poziotinib reduced tumor growth, diminished multiorgan metastasis, and inhibited mTOR activation more effectively than neratinib. Similar therapeutic effects of poziotinib were observed in both an engineered HER2L755S MCF7 model and a patient-derived xenograft harboring a HER2G778_P780dup mutation. Overall, these findings support the need for clinical evaluation of poziotinib for the treatment of HER2-mutant metastatic breast cancer.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Evaluation of the functional impact of HER2 mutations on therapy-induced resistance and metastasis identifies robust antitumor activity of poziotinib and supports the clinical evaluation of poziotinib in ER+ HER2 mutant breast cancer.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A modulation format recognition (MFR) scheme based on multi-core fiber (MCF) is proposed for the next generation of elastic optical networks (EONs). In this scheme, multiple Stokes sectional planes images are used as signal features which are typed into a transfer learning (TL) assisted convolutional neural network (CNN) to realize MFR. Compared with the traditional Jones matrix, the Stokes space mapping method is insensitive to polarization mixing, carrier frequency skew and phase offset, therefore, it has better feature representation ability. TL is introduced to transfer the model used in standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) to MCF transmission, reducing the required training data and complexity. In addition, multiple Stokes sectional planes images are input simultaneously, which improves the accuracy of the neural network. Experimental verifications were performed for a polarization division multiplexing (PDM)-EONs system at a symbol rate of 12.5GBaud by 5 km MCF. Nine modulation formats, including three standard modulation formats (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK), three uniformly shaped (US) modulation formats (US-8QAM, US-16QAM, US-32QAM) and three probabilistically shaped (PS) modulation formats (PS-8QAM, PS-16QAM, PS-32QAM), were recognized by our scheme. The experimental results show that the scheme achieves high recognition accuracy even at low optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). Moreover, the required number of training samples is less 40% compared to the traditional CNN. The proposed scheme has a high tolerance to the crosstalk damage of MCF itself and can realize the short training time of large-capacity space division multiplexing (SDM)-EONs. Our findings have the potential to be used in the next generation of a SDM fiber transmission system.</jats:p>",

Each population was evaluated at three to eight field nurseries and genotyped with either the DArTseq technology or the wheat 90K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, of which a subset of 1,058- 23,795 polymorphic markers were used for the analyses. In the CV1 scenario, the mean prediction accuracies of the M1, M2, and M3 models across the six populations varied from −0.11 to −0.07, from 0.22 to 0.49, and from 0.19 to 0.48, respectively. Mean accuracies obtained using the M3 model in the CV1 scenario were significantly greater than the M2 model in two populations, the same in three populations, and smaller in one population. In both the CV2 and CV0 scenarios, the mean prediction accuracies of the three models varied from 0.53 to 0.84 and were not significantly different in all populations, except the Attila/CDC Go in the CV2, where the M3 model gave greater accuracy than both the M1 and M2 models. Overall, the M3 model increased prediction accuracies in some populations by up to 12.4% and decreased accuracy in others by up to 17.4%, demonstrating inconsistent results among genetic backgrounds that require considering each population separately.

The diagnosis provides a mass-dependent ion energy spectrum based on time-of-flight and pulse-height analysis of single particle events detected through repetitive experiments. With a novel arrangement of multiple scintillators with different ions stopping powers, PCA offers potential advantages over commonly used diagnostic instruments (CR-39, radiochromic films, Thomson parabola, etc.) in terms of coverage solid angle, detection efficiency for GeV-ions, and real-time analysis during the experiment. The basic detector unit was tested using 230-MeV proton beam from a synchrotron facility, where we demonstrated its potential ability to discriminate major ion species accelerated in laser–plasma experiments (i.e., protons, deuterons, carbon, and oxygen ions) with excellent energy and mass resolution. The proposed diagnostic concept would be essential for a better understanding of laser-driven particle acceleration, which paves the way toward all-optical compact accelerators for a range of applications.</jats:p>",

We present measurements of the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol droplets (∼5 to 10 µm equilibrated radius) over timescales spanning 5 s to 20 min using an instrument to probe survival in a small population of droplets (typically 5 to 10) containing ∼1 virus/droplet. Measurements of airborne infectivity change are coupled with a detailed physicochemical analysis of the airborne droplets containing the virus. A decrease in infectivity to ∼10% of the starting value was observable for SARS-CoV-2 over 20 min, with a large proportion of the loss occurring within the first 5 min after aerosolization. The initial rate of infectivity loss was found to correlate with physical transformation of the equilibrating droplet; salts within the droplets crystallize at relative humidities (RHs) below 50%, leading to a near-instant loss of infectivity in 50 to 60% of the virus. However, at 90% RH, the droplet remains homogenous and aqueous, and the viral stability is sustained for the first 2 min, beyond which it decays to only 10% remaining infectious after 10 min. The loss of infectivity at high RH is consistent with an elevation in the pH of the droplets, caused by volatilization of CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            from bicarbonate buffer within the droplet.

In response to pathological stress (transaortic constriction, TAC), cTrkB KO mice showed an exacerbated heart failure progression. The downregulation of PGC-1α in cTrkB KO mice exposed to exercise or TAC resulted in decreased cardiac energetics.

We investigated the recruited cells within the juvenile OT during regeneration in a Pdgfrβ-Gal4:UAS-EGFP line in which pericytes, vascular, circulating, and meningeal cells are labeled, together with neurons and progenitors. We first performed high-resolution confocal microscopy and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on EGFP-positive cells. We then tested three types of injury with very different outcomes (needle (mean depth in the OT of 200 µm); deep-laser (depth: 100 to 200 µm depth); surface-laser (depth: 0 to 100 µm)). Laser had the additional advantage of better mimicking of ischemic cerebral accidents. No massive recruitment of EGFP-positive cells was observed following laser injury deep in the OT. This type of injury does not perturb the meninx/brain–blood barrier (BBB). We also performed laser injuries at the surface of the OT, which in contrast create a breach in the meninges. Surprisingly, one day after such injury, we observed the migration to the injury site of various EGFP-positive cell types at the surface of the OT. The migrating cells included midline roof cells, which activated the PI3K-AKT pathway; fibroblast-like cells expressing numerous collagen genes and most prominently in 3D imaging; and a large number of arachnoid cells that probably migrate to the injury site through the activation of cilia motility genes, most likely being direct targets of the FOXJ1a gene. This study, combining high-content imaging and scRNAseq in physiological and pathological conditions, sheds light on meninges repair mechanisms in zebrafish that probably also operate in mammalian meninges.</jats:p>"

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering classified nonviral HCCs into three molecular classes (Class I, II, III), which stratified patient prognosis. Class I, with the poorest prognosis, was associated with TP53 mutations, whereas class III, with the best prognosis, was associated with cadherin‐associated protein beta 1 (CTNNB1) mutations. Thirty‐eight percent of nonviral HCC was defined as an immune class characterized by a high frequency of intratumoral steatosis and a low frequency of CTNNB1 mutations. Steatotic HCC, which accounts for 23% of nonviral HCC cases, presented an immune‐enriched but immune‐exhausted TIME characterized by T cell exhaustion, M2 macrophage and cancer‐associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration, high PD‐L1 expression, and TGF‐β signaling activation. Spatial transcriptome analysis suggested that M2 macrophages and CAFs may be in close proximity to exhausted CD8+ T cells in steatotic HCC. An in vitro study showed that palmitic acid‐induced lipid accumulation in HCC cells upregulated PD‐L1 expression and promoted immunosuppressive phenotypes of cocultured macrophages and fibroblasts.

We present 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array toward 43 protostellar cores in the Orion molecular cloud complex (<jats:italic>λ</jats:italic> Orionis, Orion B, and Orion A) with an angular resolution of ∼0.″35 (∼140 au). In total, we detect 13 binary/multiple systems. We derive an overall multiplicity frequency (MF) of 28% ± 4% and a companion star fraction (CSF) of 51% ± 6%, over a separation range of 300–8900 au. The median separation of companions is about 2100 au. The occurrence of stellar multiplicity may depend on the physical characteristics of the dense cores. Notably, those containing binary/multiple systems tend to show a higher gas density and Mach number than cores forming single stars. The integral-shaped filament of the Orion A giant molecular cloud (GMC), which has the highest gas density and hosts high-mass star formation in its central region (the Orion Nebula cluster), shows the highest MF and CSF among the Orion GMCs. In contrast, the <jats:italic>λ</jats:italic> Orionis GMC has a lower MF and CSF than the Orion B and Orion A GMCs, indicating that feedback from H <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> regions may suppress the formation of multiple systems. We also find that the protostars comprising a binary/multiple system are usually at different evolutionary stages.</jats:p>",

TRIM25 has been shown to play a role in the retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) pathway, which triggers expression of type 1 interferons upon viral infection. We and others have shown that TRIM25 is an RNA-binding protein; however, the role of TRIM25 RNA-binding in the innate immune response to RNA viruses is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV A/PR/8/34_NS1(R38A/K41A)) infection is inhibited by TRIM25. Surprisingly, previously identified RNA-binding deficient mutant TRIM25ΔRBD and E3 ubiquitin ligase mutant TRIM25ΔRING, which lack E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, still inhibited IAV replication. Furthermore, we show that in human-derived cultured cells, activation of the RIG-I/interferon type 1 pathway mediated by either an IAV-derived 5′-triphosphate RNA or by IAV itself does not require TRIM25 activity. Additionally, we present new evidence that instead of TRIM25 directly inhibiting IAV transcription it binds and destabilizes IAV mRNAs. Finally, we show that direct tethering of TRIM25 to RNA is sufficient to downregulate the targeted RNA. In summary, our results uncover a potential mechanism that TRIM25 uses to inhibit IAV infection and regulate RNA metabolism.</jats:p>",

The cosmopolitan plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) provokes vascular wilts in more than a hundred different crops. Isolates of this fungus exhibit host-specific pathogenicity, which is conferred by lineage-specific Secreted In Xylem (SIX) effectors encoded on accessory genomic regions. However, such isolates also can colonize the roots of other plants asymptomatically as endophytes or even protect them against pathogenic strains. The molecular determinants of endophytic multihost compatibility are largely unknown. Here, we characterized a set of Fo candidate effectors from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) root apoplastic fluid; these early root colonization (ERC) effectors are secreted during early biotrophic growth on main and alternative plant hosts. In contrast to SIX effectors, ERCs have homologs across the entire Fo species complex as well as in other plant-interacting fungi, suggesting a conserved role in fungus–plant associations. Targeted deletion of ERC genes in a pathogenic Fo isolate resulted in reduced virulence and rapid activation of plant immune responses, while ERC deletion in a nonpathogenic isolate led to impaired root colonization and biocontrol ability. Strikingly, some ERCs contribute to Fo infection on the nonvascular land plant Marchantia polymorpha, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for multihost colonization by root infecting fungi.</jats:p>",

Here, we used simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting to define the transcriptional and translational dynamics of ZIKV and DENV infection in human neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). The gene expression data showed induction of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) and the translation activating PIM1 kinase, indicating an increase in RNA translation capacity. The data also reveal activation of different cell stress responses, with ZIKV triggering a BACH1/2 redox program, and DENV activating the ATF/CHOP endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress program. The RNA translation data highlight activation of polyamine metabolism through changes in key enzymes and their regulators. This pathway is needed for eIF5A hypusination and has been implicated in viral translation and replication. Concerning the viral RNA genomes, ribosome occupancy readily identified highly translated open reading frames and a novel upstream ORF (uORF) in the DENV genome. Together, our data highlight both the cellular stress response and the activation of RNA translation and polyamine metabolism during DENV and ZIKV infection.</jats:p>"

We report data from a cross-sectional analysis from the coronary artery calcification in type 1 diabetes (CACTI) study (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <a:mi>n</a:mi>\n                        <a:mo>=</a:mo>\n                        <a:mn>1257</a:mn>\n                     </a:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>; T1D: <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\">\n                        <c:mi>n</c:mi>\n                        <c:mo>=</c:mo>\n                        <c:mn>568</c:mn>\n                     </c:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>; nondiabetic controls: <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\">\n                        <e:mi>n</e:mi>\n                        <e:mo>=</e:mo>\n                        <e:mn>689</e:mn>\n                     </e:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>) collected between the years 2000 and 2002. Participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire, a physical examination, and biochemical analyses. Linear regression was used to examine the associations of dietary antioxidant micronutrients with HbA1c and estimated insulin sensitivity (eIS) in models adjusted for relevant covariates and stratified by diabetes status. In adults with T1D, we observed higher dietary manganese intake associated with higher eIS in the model adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, and total calories. In nondiabetic controls, higher intake of manganese associated with lower HbA1c and higher eIS values that persisted in models adjusted for all relevant covariates. On the other hand, dietary copper revealed a positive association with HbA1c in models adjusted for all covariates, except BMI and plasma lipids. No associations were noted for vitamins C and E and dietary carotenoids in either group. These findings reveal dietary antioxidant micronutrients, especially trace elements such as copper and manganese deserve special attention in glycemic control in adults with T1D as well as in nondiabetic controls.This trial is register with NCT00005754.</jats:p>",

We identified 53/c loci affecting hearing loss risk, including common coding variants in <jats:italic>COL9A3</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>TMPRSS3</jats:italic>. Through exome sequencing of 108,415 cases and 329,581 controls, we observed rare coding associations with 11 Mendelian hearing loss genes, including additive effects in known hearing loss genes <jats:italic>GJB2</jats:italic> (Gly12fs; odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 4.2 × 10<jats:sup>−11</jats:sup>) and <jats:italic>SLC26A5</jats:italic> (gene burden; OR = 1.96, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 2.8 × 10<jats:sup>−17</jats:sup>). We also identified hearing loss associations with rare coding variants in <jats:italic>FSCN2</jats:italic> (OR = 1.14, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 1.9 × 10<jats:sup>−15</jats:sup>) and <jats:italic>KLHDC7B</jats:italic> (OR = 2.14, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 5.2 × 10<jats:sup>−30</jats:sup>). Our results suggest a shared etiology between Mendelian and common hearing loss in adults. This work illustrates the potential of large-scale exome sequencing to elucidate the genetic architecture of common disorders where both common and rare variation contribute to risk.</jats:p>"
