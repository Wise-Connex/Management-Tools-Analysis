After establishing Swi by each initialization technique, the cross sections were scanned using a micro-CT scanner. The image data was processed to estimate the cross sectional fluid distribution in XY-direction. Furthermore, each areal average Swi was calculated to investigate Swi distribution in Z-direction (direction of injection). Based on the comparison of interpreted fluid distribution, pros/cons of each technique was discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The Earth’s core formed by multiple collisions with differentiated protoplanets. The Hf-W (hafnium-tungsten) isotopic system reveals that these collisions took place over a timescale of tens of megayears (Myr), in agreement with accretion simulations. The degree to which the iron and silicates re-equilibrated during each collision is uncertain and affects the apparent core age derived from tungsten isotopic measurements. Seismological data reveal that the core contains light elements in addition to Fe-Ni, and the outer core is more enriched in such elements than the inner core. Because O is excluded efficiently from solid iron, O is almost certainly an important constituent of the outer core. The identity of other elements is less certain, despite intensive measurements of their effects on seismic velocities, densities, and partitioning behavior at appropriate pressures and temperatures. Si and O are very likely present, with perhaps some S; C and H are less likely. Si and Mg may have exsolved over time, potentially helping to drive the geodynamo and producing a low-density layer at the top of the core. Radioactive elements (U, Th, K) are unlikely to be present in important concentrations. The cooling of the core is controlled by the mantle’s ability to extract heat. The geodynamo has existed for at least 3.5 gigayears (Gyr), placing a lower bound on the heat flow out of the core. Because the thermal conductivity of the core is uncertain by a factor of ~3, the lower bound on this heat flow is similarly uncertain. Once the inner core started to crystallize, additional sources of energy were available to power the geodynamo. Inner core crystallization likely started in the time range 0.5 to 2.0 Gyr Before Present (BP); paleomagnetic arguments have been advanced for inner core growth starting at several different epochs within this time range.</p>"

Considering that silicon can be another major light element in planetary cores, here we performed melting experiments on the Fe-Si-H system at ~50 GPa and obtained the ternary liquidus phase relations and the solid/liquid partition coefficient, D of Si and H based on in-situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements and ex-situ chemical and textural characterizations on recovered samples. Liquid crystallized hexagonal close-packed (hcp) (Fe0.93Si0.07)H0.25, which explains the observed density and velocities of the Earth’s solid inner core. The relatively high DSi = 0.94(4) and DH = 0.70(12) suggest that in addition to Si and H, the liquid outer core includes other light elements such as O, which is least partitioned into solid Fe and can thus explain the density difference between the outer and inner core. H and O, as well as Si, are likely to be major core light elements, supporting the sequestration of a large amount of water in the Earth’s core.</jats:p>"

However, the availability and price of Balsa wood are quite expensive, so it needs alternatives from other types of wood such as Sengon wood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of Sengon wood as a core of composite sandwich panels. Three variations of the Sengon wood layout had been prepared as the core of the sandwich panels with a skin made of aluminum. All specimens, including the control specimens made of whole Sengon wood, were prepared with a size of 550 x 50 x 24 mm for length, width, and depth, respectively. Each variation and also the control specimens were made of 3 pieces. Tests were carried out based on the ASTM C 393-94 standard under the three-point bending test scheme. The results showed that the sandwich panel with plain Sengon wood core has the highest capacity to carry a flexural load, which is approximately 177.391 MPa, followed by a sandwich panel with long and end grain Sengon board that possess flexural strength of 153.913 MPa and 79.101 MPa, respectively. The flexural strength of these sandwich panels is superior to solid Sengon wood. The sandwich panels showed a typical ductile material indicated by a non-linear curve without a distinct yielded point before reach the maximum failure load. Three sandwich panels with various Sengon wood cores collapsed under three types of failure mechanisms; face wrinkling, shearing of the core, and delamination between the interface of skin and core. In conclusion, Sengon wood has a great potential to be used as the core material for a composite sandwich panel.</jats:p>"

The question of a localized/delocalized vacancy is relevant for systems with symmetrically equivalent atoms, as well as near-degeneracies which can distribute the core-orbitals over several atoms. We show that issues relating to core-hole delocalization are present for calculations considering explicit core-hole states, e.g. when using a core-excited or core-ionized reference state, or for fractional occupation numbers. Including electron correlation eventually alleviates the issues, but even using CCSD(T) there is a noticable discrepancy between core-ionization energies obtained with a localized and delocalized core-hole (0.5 eV for the carbon K-edge). Within density functional theory, the discrepancy is associated with the exchange interaction involving the core orbitals of the same spin symmetry as the delocalized core-hole, and the size of the error is thus directly related to the amount of HF exchange included in the functional. For linear response methods, we further show that if X-ray absorption spectra are modelled by considering symmetry-unique sets of atoms, care has to be taken such that there are no delocalizations of the core orbitals, which would otherwise introduce shifts in absolute energies and relative features.</jats:p>"

Finally, the authors investigated how the Covid-19 pandemic affected sharing activity; (2) Methods: During empirical research, the authors revised the list of 37 variables. The study uses data for each of the 27 EU countries from 2011 to 2020. The authors investigated correlation between macroeconomics variables to determine key variables for the regression model; (3) Results: The authors constructed a dynamic regression model that can be applied to predict the number of participants visiting sharing platforms in the European Union (EU); (4) Conclusions: The study shows that seeking to forecast the number of visits to sharing platforms it is necessary to use values of main macroeconomic variables such as consumer price index, productivity index, total unemployment rate, the number of users and households connected to the Internet, etc.</jats:p>"

They have the same core size, CdS shell thickness ranging from 1 to 5 monolayer (ML) and ZnS shell thickness of 2 ML. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the purified core, core/shell, and core/double shell samples were comparatively investigated over a temperature range of 79 - 460 K. The LTAQ phenomenon was observed for the core/shell and core/double shell nanostructures and is reversible. The fluorescence recovery magnitude and the temperature range in which the LTAQ process occurs depends on the thickness and composition of the shell surrounding the core. Analysis of the temperature-dependent spectral characteristics shows an increase in compression strain in the CdSe core when increasing the shell thickness. The cause of the LTAQ phenomenon is attributed to the rearrangement of the atoms at the core/shell and shell/shell interfaces in the investigated nanostructures due to thermal expansions of the core and shell crystalline lattices. The linear dependence of integrated emission intensities of CdSe/CdS (1 ML) and CdSe/CdS (3 ML) samples on temperature in the ranges of 220 - 360 K and 270 - 340 K, respectively, opens up the prospect of creating temperature sensors for biomedical applications.</jats:p>"

Infants Up to 12 months of age were included. Any patient with the following comorbidities were excluded: (1) Haematological malignancy (2) immunocompromised (3) hyperthyroidism (4) recent administration of antipyretics medications and (5) congenital anal or rectal malformation. Demographic characteristics such as age and gender, weight, mean axillary and rectal temperatures were documented. Fever is defined as rectal temperature &gt; 38 C as opposed to &gt; 37.4 in the axillary method. Pearson’s correlation between axillary and rectal temperatures was determined.\nResults\n The mean age was 6.1 ± 3.5 months. The study had 111 (55.2%) males and 90 (44.8%) females. The mean weight was 7.4 Kg ± 2.1 Kg. The mean (SD) rectal-axillary temperature difference was 0.8°C ± 0.7°C which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of the axillary method for fever &gt; 37.4 were 79.34% (95% CI [73-84.9]), 14.3% (95% CI [0.36–57.9]), 96.2% (95% CI [95-97.2]) and 2.4% (95% CI [0.4–13.5]), respectively. On the other hand, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of the rectal temperature method for fever &gt; 38 were 99.5% (95% CI [97.1–99.9]), 100% (95% CI [54–100]), 100% and 85.7% (95% CI [45.9–97.6]), respectively.\nConclusion\n  <jats:italic>the axillary temperature measurement method is not as accurate as the rectal temperature method for the detection of fever in infants with a recent history of fever. The rectal method remains highly important for accurate and prompt diagnosis.</jats:italic></jats:p>"

It has been shown that the diameter of the active fiber winding significantly affects the power distribution between the cores, since it affects both the pump power distribution and the cross-coupling between the cores. In particular, with an active fiber winding diameter of 21 cm, the cores behave independently, and the power is distributed almost evenly over all cores. With a winding diameter of 6.5 cm, the lasing is achieved almost exclusively from one core, and a mechanism of that radiation concentration based on bending induced stress in an active multicore fiber is proposed which explains the experimental data. By analyzing the optical and radio-frequency spectra of the output laser radiation, additional details of the 4-core fiber lasing are revealed. In particular, a narrowband (several longitudinal modes) lasing with periodic linear sweeping of central wavelength in time is observed and characterized in the multicore fiber laser, for the first time to our knowledge. It is shown that crosstalk of longitudinal modes arising from different cores is greatly enhanced in the case of a strongly bent fiber.</jats:p>",

States use several strategies to support community college’s transfer function, including a transferrable core curriculum, a block of pre-major coursework universally accepted at public postsecondary institutions. In this study, we used statewide administrative data from Texas—a state with a transferable core—to examine pre-transfer credit accumulation and how pre-transfer core credits predict bachelor’s degree attainment and time to degree for community college transfer students. Our results illuminate high variation in pre-transfer core credit accumulation among community college transfer students. Each additional pre-transfer core credit improves students’ probability of earning a bachelor’s degree, but only up to core completion status. Soon after students are core complete—at which point universities are no longer required to transfer in additional core credits, students experience a negative relationship between core credits and bachelor’s degree attainment. </jats:p>",

Alternative food sources with high nutritive values that can substitute livestock demands are urgently required. Recently, edible crickets have been promoted by the FAO to ameliorate the food crisis. In this review, the distribution, nutritive values, health-promoting properties (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity), safety, allergenicity as well as the potential hazards and risks for human consumption are summarized. Cricket farming may help to realize the United Nations sustainable development goal No. 2 Zero Hunger. The sustainability of cricket farming is also discussed in comparison with other livestock. The findings imply that edible crickets are safe for daily intake as a healthy alternative diet due to their high protein content and health-promoting properties. Appropriate use of edible crickets in the food and nutraceutical industries represents a global business potential. However, people who are allergic to shellfish should pay attention on cricket allergy. Thus, the objective of this review was to present in-depth and up-to-date information on edible crickets to advocate and enhance public perception of cricket-based food.</jats:p>"

However, the localisation of impurities inside the microstructure is still under debate and little is known about the mineralogy of solid inclusions. In particular, the general mineralogical diversity throughout an ice core and the specific distribution inside the microstructure is poorly investigated; the impact of the mineralogy on the localisation of inclusions and other processes is thus hardly known. We use dust particle concentration, optical microscopy, and cryo-Raman spectroscopy to systematically locate and analyse the mineralogy of micro-inclusions in situ inside 11 solid ice samples from the upper 1340 m of the East Greenland Ice Core Project ice core. Micro-inclusions are more variable in mineralogy than previously observed and are mainly composed of mineral dust (quartz, mica, and feldspar) and sulfates (mainly gypsum). Inclusions of the same composition tend to cluster, but clustering frequency and mineralogy changes with depth. A variety of sulfates dominate the upper 900 m, while gypsum is the only sulfate in deeper samples, which however contain more mineral dust, nitrates, and dolomite. The analysed part of the core can thus be divided into two depth regimes of different mineralogy, and to a lesser degree of spatial distribution, which could originate from different chemical reactions in the ice or large-scale changes in ice cover in northeast Greenland during the mid-Holocene. The complexity of impurity mineralogy on the metre scale and centimetre scale in polar ice is still underestimated, and new methodological approaches are necessary to establish a comprehensive understanding of the role of impurities. Our results show that applying new methods to the mineralogy in ice cores and recognising its complexity, as well as the importance for localisation studies, open new avenues for understanding the role of impurities in ice cores.\n                    </jats:p>"

Here, we investigated whether the robustness of brain networks, queried via the delineation of the brain’s core network structure, supports superior cognitive performance in healthy aging individuals (n=320, ages 60-90). First, we decomposed each subject’s functional brain networks using k-shell decomposition, finding that cognitive function is associated with more robust connectivity of core nodes, primarily within the frontoparietal control network (FPCN). Next, we find that the resilience of core brain network nodes, within the FPCN in particular, relates to cognition. Finally, we show that the degree of segregation in functional networks mediates relationships between network resilience and cognition. Together, these findings suggest that brain networks balance between robust core connectivity and segregation to facilitate high cognitive performance in aging.</jats:p>"

This last challenge, comes into account because of the lack of a specific frame regarding this topic in the scholar national curriculum. The present article, presents the main challenges that can come with the implementation of outdoor education and its activities in the frame of the formal educational system, at the level of core procurement cycle.  In the study, there is an analysis on the main elements of outdoor education that are present in the scholar curriculum at this level. Also, it presents the results of a brief research on the beliefs of primary school teachers from Arad County, on the most important challenges that they face when implementing outdoor learning activities in schools. The research was made using the survey method, with the use of the instrument: questionnaire, in the school year 2020-2021, on a number of 77 teachers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The 20S proteasome Core Particle (CP) is a molecular machine that is a key component of cellular protein degradation pathways. Like other molecular machines, it is not synthesized in an active form, but rather as a set of subunits that assemble into a functional complex. The CP is conserved across all domains of life and is composed of 28 subunits, 14 α and 14 β, arranged in four stacked 7-member rings (α<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>β<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>β<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>α<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>). While details of CP assembly vary across species, the final step in the assembly process is universally conserved: two half proteasomes (HP: α<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>β<jats:sub>7</jats:sub>) dimerize to form the CP. In the bacterium <jats:italic>Rhodococcus erythropolis</jats:italic>, experiments have shown that the formation of the HP is completed within minutes, while the dimerization process takes hours. The N-terminal propeptide of the β subunit, which is autocatalytically cleaved off after CP formation, plays a key role in regulating this separation of time scales. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of how the propeptide achieves this regulation is unclear. In this work, we used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize HP conformations and found that the HP exists in two states: one where the propeptide interacts with key residues in the HP dimerization interface and likely blocks dimerization, and one where this interface is free. We found that a propeptide mutant that dimerizes extremely slowly is essentially always in the non-dimerizable state, while the WT rapidly transitions between the two. Based on these simulations, we designed a propeptide mutant that favored the dimerizable state in MD simulations. <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic> assembly experiments confirmed that this mutant dimerizes significantly faster than WT. Our work thus provides unprecedented insight into how this critical step in CP assembly is regulated, with implications both for efforts to inhibit proteasome assembly and for the evolution of hierarchical assembly pathways.</jats:p>"

In this setting, the notion of supply chain resilience emerges at a critical juncture in history. With the development of environmental uncertainty, supply chain flexibility is becoming increasingly vital for the practical relevance of the organization. Big data, artificial intelligence, and other technologies have had a significant influence on supply chain management in recent years, thanks to the ongoing appearance of new technology.

However, we still do not know much about the impact of rotation on the planetary internal structure as well as on their formation. The centrifugal force induced by the rotation deforms the planetary shape and partially counteracts the gravitational force. Thus, rotation will affect the critical core mass of the exoplanet. Once the atmospheric mass becomes comparable to the critical core mass, the planet will enter the runaway accretion phase and become a gas giant. We have confirmed that the critical core masses of rotating planets depend on the stiffness of the polytrope, the outer boundary conditions, and the thickness of the isothermal layer. The critical core mass with the Bondi boundary condition is determined by the surface properties. The critical core mass of a rotating planet will increase with the core gravity (i.e., the innermost density). For the Hill boundary condition, the soft polytrope shares the same properties as planets with the Bondi boundary condition. Because the total mass for planets with the Hill boundary condition increases with the decrease of the polytropic index, a higher core gravity is required for rotating planets. As a result, the critical core mass in the stiff Hill model sharply increases. The rotational effects become more important when the radiative and convective regions coexist. Further, the critical core mass of planets with the Hill (Bondi) boundary increases noticeably as the radiative layer becomes thinner (thicker).</jats:p>",

A relational approach to law provides both a clearer analysis of what is at stake in disputes over law and policy and a framework for assessing proposals for change. The basic claims are that relationships make possible the lived reality of values like security or autonomy, and law is one of the primary means of shaping relationships. Relational feminism reconceptualizes core concepts, like autonomy; links them to underlying conceptions of the self; and explains their role in law. The examples show the benefit of a relational approach to self, autonomy, and rights (and law more broadly). From questions of hierarchy and racism to environmental harm to mental health and a reconceptualization of property, the chapter works through the application of a relational approach.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A Paralisia Cerebral é uma condição de saúde comum da infância, em que trata-se de lesões neurológicas que acarretam atrasos no desenvolvimento neurosensoriomotor, cognitivo e, muitas vezes, provoca déficits no desempenho funcional e equilíbrio postural. Um novo recurso de tratamento para essas crianças são os protocolos intensivos com o uso ou não de vestimentas terapêuticas. Nestes protocolos, as vestimentas funcionam como uma órtese corporal que permite a execução de movimentos e exercícios para os mais diversos objetivos, em conjunto com a aplicação de treinos intensos e específicos. O objetivo do presente estudo foi analisar a diferença de ativação muscular, função motora grossa e oscilação do centro de gravidade de crianças com Paralisia Cerebral após um protocolo intensivo de exercícios terapêuticos. Trata-se de um estudo de 8 casos, sendo que os critérios de inclusão foram ter idade entre 2 e 13 anos, diagnóstico de Paralisia Cerebral e classificação Gross Motor Function Classification System entre os níveis I e IV. A Gross Motor Function Measure foi realizada por um profissional capacitado antes do primeiro e após o último protocolo. A Eletromiografia de Superfície foi utilizada para analisar a ativação muscular dos músculos Reto Abdominal, Oblíquos e Multífidos dos dois hemicorpos enquanto a criança permanecia sentada mantendo a postura durante 30 segundos pré e pós protocolo. Além disso, a Plataforma Estabilométrica foi utilizada para avaliar a oscilação postural com a criança sentada mantendo a posição por 30 segundos com os olhos abertos e 30 segundos com os olhos fechados, também antes do início do intensivo e após o último. No geral, as crianças apresentaram aumento em média na função motora grossa de 3,73% entre antes e após o treinamento; 25% dos pacientes apresentaram aumento de todas ou da maioria das musculaturas; 50% obtiverem uma maior aproximação das médias de Root Mean Square associados a uma redução de ativação em alguns dos 6 músculos avaliados. Em relação ao centro de gravidade, 37,5% dos pacientes reduziram a distância de oscilação com olhos abertos e 62,5% reduziram com os olhos fechados; 25% apresentaram aumento da distância com olhos abertos e com olhos fechados 37,5% e outros 25% não apresentaram resultados relevantes nas distâncias com olhos abertos. Quanto às oscilações látero laterais e ântero posteriores, 25% reduziram e 12,5% aumentaram as oscilações látero laterais com os olhos abertos, 12,5% aumentaram e 37,5% reduziram oscilações ântero posteriores. Já com olhos fechados, 37,5% reduziram oscilações látero laterais e 25% reduziram oscilações ântero posteriores. Novas pesquisas de caráter longitudinal, com número e características entre os participantes mais homogêneas, além da utilização de outras ferramentas podem colaborar para aprofundar as análises obtidas. Conclui-se com o presente estudo que a realização de um protocolo intensivo de exercícios terapêuticos associados ou não ao uso de vestimentas terapêuticas favorece a melhora da função motora grossa, parece ser promissor na ativação mais equilibrada entre as musculaturas do core avaliadas e na diminuição da oscilação do tronco quando de olhos fechados.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to accelerate the execution of streaming applications on multi-core systems, this article studies the scheduling problem of synchronous data flow graphs (SDFG) on homogeneous multi-core systems. To describe the data flow computation process, we propose the SDAG (Super DAG) computation model based on the DAG model combined with data-driven thoughts. Further, we analyze the current common SDFG scheduling algorithms and propose an improved SDFG scheduling algorithm, LSEFT (level-shortest-first-earliest-finish time). The LSEFT algorithm uses an inverse traversal algorithm to calculate the priority of tasks in the task-selection phase; the shortest-job-priority earliest-finish-time policy is used in the processor selection phase to replace the original long job priority policy. In the experimental part, we designed an SDFG random generator and generated 958 SDFGs with the help of the random generator as test cases to verify the scheduling algorithm. The experimental results show that our improved algorithm performs well for different numbers of processor cores, especially for 8 cores, where the speedup of our improved algorithm improves by 10.17% on average.</jats:p>"

While the core mechanisms of circadian clocks have been well described, the molecular mechanisms of temperature compensation are poorly understood especially in animals. A major gap is the lack of temperature compensation mutants that do not themselves unambiguously affect the temperature dependence of the encoded protein. Here we show that null alleles of two genes encoding components of a complex important for translation of the core clock component <jats:italic>period</jats:italic> in circadian pacemaker neurons robustly alter the temperature dependence of circadian behavioral period length. These changes are accompanied by parallel temperature dependent changes in oscillations of the PER protein and are consistent with the model that these translation factors mediate the temperature-dependence of PER translation.

A short-term prospective study was conducted with 257 South Korean university students. Participants completed measures of CSE and HC, and then reported their experiences with interpersonal conflict and SWB in an online survey about two weeks later. We found that, among low HC participants, after controlling for the importance of conflict issues, individual differences in CSE predicted emotional reactivity to interpersonal conflict, and emotional reactivity was in turn negatively associated with SWB. By contrast, among high-HC participants, emotional reactivity to interpersonal conflict did not differ as a function of CSE, and the indirect effects of CSE on SWB were not significant. These findings highlight the importance of high CSE and HC values in fostering emerging adults’ resilience against the detrimental effects of interpersonal conflict in sustaining individuals’ SWB. Implications for conflict management interventions are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the calculation of core-ionization energies (IE), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), a commonly applied approach is to use non-Aufbau reference states with a core-hole as either final (IE and XPS) or initial (XES) state. However, such reference states can introduce numerical instabilities for post-HF methods, relating to the denominator of the energy corrections involved. This may become arbitrarily close to zero if a negative virtual MO is present, e.g. a core-hole, leading to near-singularities. The resulting instabilities lead to severe convergence issues of the calculation schemes and, in addition, can strongly affect both energies and intensities, with oscillator strengths seen to reach values up to 4 × 10^7. For the K-edge we propose freezing the highest-energy virtuals which contribute to any denominator below a threshold of 0.1 Hartree. Stable and reliable spectra are then produced, with minimal influence due to freezing energetically high-lying virtuals (typically removing &lt;5% of the total number of MOs). The developed protocol is here tested for Møller–Plesset perturbation theory and for the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator, but it is also relevant for coupled cluster theory and other related methods.</jats:p>"

A preoperative core needle biopsy (CNB) is used to confirm the diagnosis and invasiveness of a breast lesion and forms the basis for characterizing the tumor in the case of neoadjuvant primary treatment, emphasizing the importance of obtaining reliable biomarker assessment from a diagnostic CNB. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the similarity between biomarker status assessed on a CNB compared to a medically untreated surgical specimen. Methods: Paired CNB and surgical specimens from 267 patients that were part of the prospective Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network- Breast (SCAN-B) cohort were studied. The concordance for the five biomarkers: ER, PgR, Ki67, HER2 and molecular subtype, between paired CNB and surgical specimen were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression-based analytical methods (GEX). IHC data were collected from patient medical records and gene expression was measured by RNA sequencing. Cohen’s kappa and Mcnemar’s test were used to compare the concordance of biomarkers.Results: Moderate to very good levels of concordance were observed between the biomarker status obtained on a CNB compared with the paired surgical specimen for IHC (κappa range 0.474-0.917) and GEX (κappa range 0.528-0.776), respectively. However, a significant drift from low to high Ki67 status and from negative to positive HER2 status between the CNB and surgical specimen was observed when using IHC and GEX, respectively (McNemar p &amp;lt; 0.05 for both comparisons). Moderate to good concordance levels of biomarker status were generally obtained when comparing GEX and IHC status measured from the same type of sample (κappa range 0.484-0.649) except for Ki67 which consistently displayed poor concordance levels between IHC and GEX for both CNB and surgical specimen comparisons (κappa range 0.158-0.198). Notably, a significant shift from positive to negative ER status and high to low Ki67 status was observed when comparing IHC with GEX classification (McNemar p &amp;lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Conclusion: The tissue sampling and the method of biomarker analysis may affect the results of biomarker status and ultimately affect treatment decisions. The implications of using a preoperative CNB to determine biomarker status, prognosis, and treatment choice should be taken into consideration in neoadjuvant treatment settings.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Hani Saghir, Srinivas Veerla, Martin Malmberg, Lisa Rydén, Anna Ehinger, Lao Saal, Johan Vallon-Christersson, Åke Borg, Cecilia Hegardt, Ingrid Hedenfalk, Susanne Dieroff-Hay, Christer Larsson, Niklas Loman, Siker Kimbung.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Balance and core stabilization exercises have often been associated with improved athlete performance and/or decreased incidence of injuries. While these exercises seem to be efficient in the prevention of injuries, there is insufficient evidence regarding their role in sport-specific performance and related functional movements. The aim of this scoping review is (1) to map the literature that investigates whether currently available variables of postural and core stability are functionally related to athlete performance in sports with high demands on body balance and spinal posture and (2) to identify gaps in the literature and suggest further research on this topic. The literature search conducted on MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases was completed by Google Scholar, SpringerLink, and Elsevier. Altogether 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings revealed that postural stability plays an important role in performance in archery, biathlon, gymnastics, shooting, and team sports (e.g., basketball, hockey, soccer, tennis). Also core stability and strength represent an integral part of athlete performance in sports based on lifting tasks and trunk rotations. Variables of these abilities are associated with performance-related skills in cricket, cycling, running, and team sports (e.g., baseball, football, hockey, netball, soccer, tennis). Better neuromuscular control of postural and core stability contribute to more efficient functional movements specific to particular sports. Training programs incorporating general and sport-specific exercises that involve the use of postural and core muscles showed an improvement of body balance, back muscle strength, and endurance. However, there is controversy about whether the improvement in these abilities is translated into athletic performance. There is still a lack of research investigating the relationship of body balance and stability of the core with sport-specific performance. In particular, corresponding variables should be better specified in relation to functional movements in sports with high demands on postural and core stability. Identifying the relationship of passive, active, and neural mechanisms underlying balance control and spinal posture with athlete performance would provide a basis for a multifaced approach in designing training and testing tools addressing postural and core stability in athletes under sport-specific conditions.</jats:p>"

This challenge often needs to be combined with the need to deliver engineering solutions that are able to lower the environmental impact of transportation, by reducing fuel consumption. Consequentially, these topics have attracted considerable research efforts. The present work aims to address the previously cited challenges by maximizing the energy absorption capabilities of hybrid aluminum/composite shock absorbers with minimal thickness and mass. This engineering solution makes it possible to lighten vehicles and reduce fuel consumption, without compromising safety, in terms of crashworthiness capabilities. A numerical sensitivity study is presented, where the absorbed energy/mass (AE/m) and the absorbed energy/total panel thickness (AE/Htot) ratios, as a consequence of low-velocity impact simulations performed on six different shock absorbers, are compared. These hybrid shock absorbers have been numerically designed by modifying the core thickness of two basic absorbers’ configurations, characterized, respectively, by a metallic lattice core, intended to be produced through additive manufacturing, and a standard metallic honeycomb core. This work provides interesting information for the development of shock absorbers, which should be further developed with an experimental approach. Indeed, it demonstrates that, by integrating composite skins with a very light core producible, by means of additive manufacturing capabilities, it is possible to design shock absorbers with excellent performance, even for very thin configurations with 6 mm thickness, and to provide a significant increase in AE/m ratios when compared to the respective equal volume standard honeycomb core configurations. This difference between the AE/m ratios of configurations with different core designs increases with the growth in volume. In detail, for configurations with a total thickness of 6 mm, the AE/m increases in additive manufacturing configurations by approximately 93%; for those with a total thickness of 10 mm, the increase is 175%, and, finally, for those with a total thickness of 14 mm, the increase is 220%.</jats:p>"

Although the existing instruments are used worldwide to assess school burnout risk, they show several flaws and mainly focus on the emotional facets of the syndrome. No previous studies have developed a multi-component tool to reveal students’ burnout by simultaneously analyzing cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems. The central core of the current study is to adapt the Burnout Assessment Tool-Core symptoms (BAT-C; Schaufeli et al., 2020), comprising four subscales, exhaustion, mental distance, cognitive impairment, and emotional impairment, for a sample of Italian students. The factor structure, the reliability, and the validity of the scale are investigated. The participants are 745 middle school students (male, 52.2%; aged 9–13, M = 11.84, and SD = 1.21). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the best fit of the second-order model (four first-order factors and one second-order factor). Specifically, four factors were loaded onto a main high-order factor, which constitutes the BAT-C. Our findings support the Italian adaptation of the BAT-C for students’ samples as a valid instrument for measuring the core symptoms of school burnout.</jats:p>"

Similarly, the success or failure of EOR implementations are always affected by those problems which causes displacing fluids fingering and early breakthrough. Factors of this type, unless properly identified and understood before the start of EOR process, will likely cause a project failure. Core flooding as the model of small scale of fluids movements in reservoir undergoes similar circumstances. Approximately one foot long of four 3.5 inches stacked native and synthetic cores are normally used in core flooding experiment. Tracer test was performed to characterize the core in addition of CT scan analysis. On this experiment, lithium solution was selected as tracer solution to be then injected into core at constant rate, 4 ft/day. Afterwards, the effluents were collected by Gilson sample collector in each tube for further determinination its concentration using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). Response curves of lithium tracer were able to determine core heterogeneities and this should be done to avoid misleading interpretation of core flooding results. Besides, lithium concentration reported in some extent and subsequently analyzed by employing method of temporal moments. This method provides numerical calculation to estimate effective core pore volume (PV) and fluid saturation. Weighing method was also used to compare the PV with aforementioned method and the results were comparable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim: This study was carried out to examine the core strength of athletes and sedentary people between the ages of 13-18. Methods: 200 male athletes from Samsun and 51 sedentary men who did not do any sports participated in this study. The Plank Fitness Test was applied to measure core strength and the time they could stand without disturbing the plank position was recorded. IBM SPSS Statistics 21 package program was used in the analysis of the data. Before the analysis of the data, Shapiro-Wilk normality test was applied and it was determined that the data did not show normal distribution (p&lt;0.05). The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the averages of core duration between the groups.  Results: According to the findings obtained in the study, a significant difference was found when the durations of the groups in the core test were examined [X2(2) =92,158, p&lt;.05]. This finding shows that the core strength between the groups is different according to the branch. When the averages of the groups are examined, it is determined that the branch with the highest core duration is judo (190.53 sec.), followed by taekwondo (158.18 sec.), football (158.01 sec.), sedentary (107.73 sec.) and basketball (69.55 sec.) groups, respectively. In addition, it is seen that the results obtained in core times and the results of training age and body mass index values are similar. Conclusion: According to the results of our study, it is noteworthy that those who do individual sports have higher core scores than those who do team sports and sedentary. We think that this difference is due to the fact that the concentration is constantly high in individual sports and the techniques performed accordingly require more core strength. In addition, we can say that the fact that sedentary people get more core points than basketball players is due to the fact that the training age of the participants and the body mass index values of the basketball players are higher than the other participants. In the light of these results, we think that more core training should be included, especially in sports that require high technical skills and strength.

An automated measurement system for magnetic core-loss characterization is described in this paper. An accurate phase-detection block with programmable attenuators is developed to measure the phase difference between voltage and current waveforms.

Here, we explore the effects of a luminous planetary core on the solids that it ultimately accretes. We find that a critical transition occurs where very hot (rapidly accreting) cores drive off volatiles prior to accretion, while cool cores (slowly accreting) are able to inherit volatile rich solids.

When deploying services in a MEC environment, it is necessary to consider a service structure that can flexibly switch service behaviors to meet various user requests and that can change service behaviors according to the real-world environment at a low implementation cost. In this paper, we introduce a core/periphery structure for service components, which is known as a model for flexible behavior in biological systems, and design and implement a network-oriented mixed reality service based on this structure. We investigate what kinds of functions should be developed to accommodate user requests in conjunction with various types of devices and real-world environments in which users and devices are located. To utilize the flexibility of a core/periphery structure, we regard core functions as those whose behaviors remain unchanged even when there are changes in user requests or the environment. In contrast, peripheral functions are those whose behaviors can change under such circumstances. Experiments reveal that implementation costs are reduced while retaining increases in service response time to less than 31 ms. These results show that taking advantage of a core/periphery structure allows appropriate division of service functions and placement of functions in a MEC environment, with only small penalties on latency and at a low implementation cost.</jats:p>"

Folate (Fol) functionalization of this nanosystem for targeting therapy purposes led to the construction of the final Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@Au-CS-CU-Fol nanoformulation. The SPION@Au was achieved using Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL) procedure by the 530 nm wavelength with various laser fluence (1.8, 2.3, and 2.6) J/cm2. The polymeric coating, drug encapsulation, and Fol functionalization processes were performed due to reverse microemulsion methods. This nanosystem was characterized by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), UV-Visible spectrophotometer, and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). A new type of CU-loaded nanocarrier was synthesized, and its anti-tumor properties were evaluated against breast cancer cell lines in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The obtained mean size of Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@Au nanoparticles (NPs) was 52.37, 60.24, and 72.45 nm at 1.8, 2.3, and 2.6 J/cm2, respectively. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay of drug-loaded NPs on the MDA-MB-231 cell line proved that the CU cytotoxicity effect could enhance when encapsulated in Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@Au-CS-Fol nanocarrier compared with void CU. On the other hand, the flow cytometry charts presented that this nanoformulation can enhance the remedial properties of CU due to apoptosis stimulation in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed the activation of apoptosis in the cells treated with the Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@Au-CS-CU-Fol. The in vivo evaluation of the Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@Au-CS-CU-Fol nanosystem proved that the tumor volume reduces in a certain time. Close inspection of results confirmed that Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@Au-CS-CU-Fol exerts a significant chemo-preventive effect on breast cancer through cell viability index, apoptosis stimulation, and anti-tumor activity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Objectives: Joint immobilization after shoulder surgery can cause an imbalance in the periscapular muscles and affect the kinetic chain throughout the body. There is a difference in core muscle stability because of the asymmetry of the lower extremity muscles. However, the difference due to the asymmetry of the upper-extremity muscles has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of joint immobilization on the symmetry of the core muscles involved in proximal stability for distal mobility. Materials and Methods: Fifty-five patients who underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery participated in this study. Core muscle asymmetry (CMA) was measured using a body tilt device. The evaluation variables were analyzed according to the surgical site based on the direction of the core muscle ratio and core muscle state ratio. Results: No differences in CMA were found based on the surgical site (p &gt; 0.05). As a result of the additional subanalysis, significant differences in sex and postoperative day were established (p &lt; 0.05). CMA was low during the intensive postoperative rehabilitation period. However, sex-related differences were greater in males than in females. Conclusions: The clinical results suggest that core muscle training is necessary to reduce CMA during rehabilitation after the immobilization period has elapsed.</jats:p>"

According to the World Health Organization (2020), an estimated 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer, while 685,000 died worldwide. Therefore, an early diagnosis of cancer is crucial for survival. This study analyses the methylation status of the promoter regions of core component genes of the hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is a tumor suppressor pathway as this pathway hinders cell growth and cell proliferation and motivates cell death.\nMaterial and Methods: Methylation-sensitive PCR method was used to examine the altered methylation patterns of SAV1, LAST1/2, and MST1/2 in different breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, HCC1937, and BT-20).\nResults: Interestingly, we have found that the promoter regions of the genes being studied are all hemimethylated in all cell lines used in this investigation, apart from the LAST1 gene promoter, which was hypomethylated in T47D and HCC1937 cell lines.\nConclusion: This indicates the importance of hemimethylation, as it is considered an aberrant methylation pattern. Thus, its effect on gene expression must be further considered.</jats:p>"

Hybrid meat is a next generation meat analogue prepared by the co-processing of both plant and animal protein ingredients at different ratios and is considered to be nutritionally superior to the currently available plant-only meat analogues. Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is becoming increasingly popular in food processing. Three-dimensional food printing involves the modification of food structures, which leads to the creation of soft food. Currently, there is no available research on 3D printing of meat analogues. This study was carried out to create plant and animal protein-based formulations for 3D printing of hybrid meat analogues with soft textures. Pea protein isolate (PPI) and chicken mince were selected as the main plant protein and meat sources, respectively, for 3D printing tests. Then, rheology and forward extrusion tests were carried out on these selected samples to obtain a basic understanding of their potential printability. Afterwards, extrusion-based 3D printing was conducted to print a 3D chicken nugget shape. The addition of 20% chicken mince paste to PPI based paste achieved better printability and fibre structure.</jats:p>"

This study was conducted among a pre-selected group of local small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The intended audience consisted of business employees and general managers. Staff and general managers were chosen based on their knowledge and expertise in the roles of technology in the attainment of business goals in their respective regions. The study's sample size was 92 respondents from the target population. This is due to the nature of the data to be created, which involves the employment of numerous methodologies to gain a better knowledge of the study issue under consideration. According to Amin, the method is also well-known for enhancing validity and reliability while decreasing biases (2012). Sloven's algorithm was used to estimate the sample size of genuine respondents.

Its unique architectural organization encompasses a net of axonal innervation that spans the entire brain; while its somatic core is highly compact. Recent research revealed an unexpected cellular input specificity within the nucleus that can give rise to various network states that either broadcast norepinephrine signals throughout the brain or pointedly modulate specific brain areas. Such adaptive input-output functions likely surpass our existing network models that build upon a given synaptic wiring configuration between neurons. As the distances between noradrenergic neurons in the core of the LC are unusually small, neighboring neurons could theoretically impact each other via volume transmission of NE. We therefore set out to investigate if such interaction could be mediated through noradrenergic alpha2-receptors in a spiking neuron model of the LC. We validate our model of LC neurons through comparison with experimental patch-clamp data and identify key variables that impact alpha2-mediated inhibition of neighboring LC neurons. Our simulation confirms a reliable autoinhibition of LC neurons after episodes of high neuronal activity that continue even after neuronal activity subsided. Also, dendro-somatic synapses inhibit spontaneous spiking in the somatic compartment of connected neurons in our model. We determined the exact position of hundreds of LC neurons in the mouse brain stem via a tissue clearing approach and, based on this, further determined that 25 percent of noradrenergic neurons have a neighboring LC neuron within less than a 25-micrometer radius. By modeling NE diffusion, we estimate that more than 15 percent of alpha2-adrenergic receptors fraction can bind NE within such diffusion radius. Our spiking neuron model of LC neurons predicts that repeated or long-lasting episodes of high neuronal activity induce partitioning of the gross LC network, and reduces the spike rate in neighboring neurons at distances smaller than 25 micrometers.</jats:p><jats:p>As these volume-mediate neighboring effects are challenging to test with the current methodology, our findings can guide future experimental approaches to test this phenomenon and its physiological consequences.</jats:p>"

To propose an effective cooling system, real-time challenges need to be taken into examination. One of the challenges is the non-uniform heat load emitted by the device. In this paper, a multicore processor has mimicked for the heat load and examined with U configured parallel microchannel cooling system (PMCS) for its capacity to cool the processor effectively. A detailed numerical examination has been conceded out by mimicking the AMD Ryzen-7 octa-core processor for its size, shape and heat load. To make it convenient for applying non-uniform heat load, the shape of the PMCS is divided into 4*4 array of a total of 16 heaters. The present has witnessed that, there is an uneven distribution of fluid flow across the channels. The initial channels do get more quantity of fluid whereas the end channels do get a very less quantity of fluid. Why because of the flow maldistribution, it formed the hot spots (high-temperature zones), which will be further intensified due to the non-uniform heat load emitted by the processor. It perceived from the present numerical analysis, there is a formation of hotspots not only due to the random location of active cores but also due to the flow maldistribution across the channels. The flow arrangement of U configuration having worse flow distribution among other existing configuration. The present work conclusively demonstrates that high maldistribution leads towards dropping the uniformity of cooling. But the existing maldistribution can be effectively exploited to tackle the non-uniform heat load released by the processor when the active core location falls in the place of initial channels.</jats:p>",

In the long run, oil prices—that appear to be transitory—have no substantial positive effect on headline or core inflation, while both inflation indices are affected by the GDP growth, interest rate, and the import prices for the core inflation model. The study suggests that policymakers should be concerned about targeting core inflation movements when implementing monetary policies.</jats:p>",

The Framework is based on two concepts. The first uses the involvement construct to predict the motivation of individuals to comply. The second separates the influence of the policy measure from the influence of the policy outcome on the motivation of individuals to comply. In short, the Framework differentiates between the strength of individuals’ motivation and their beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of policy outcomes and policy measures.

At the same time, the Raman spectroscopy signal light collection efficiency is significantly improved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new, innovative approach in the search for an effective and cheap carbon dioxide sorbent, in line with the circular economy and sustainable development principles, directs the attention of researchers to various types of waste ashes generated as a result of biomass combustion. In addition to the use of environmentally safe materials that have been experimentally identified, and that, in some way, have adjustable sorption capacity, it is also possible to rationally develop a widely applicable, simple, and inexpensive technology based on large amounts of this type of post-industrial waste, which is also an equally important issue for the natural environment (reducing the need for ash storage and accumulation). Even the lower sorption capacity can be successfully compensated for by their common availability and very low cost. Thus, the CO2 adsorption capability of the ashes from the combustion of straw biomass was experimentally investigated with the use of a high-pressure adsorption stand. The presented original technological concept has been positively verified on a laboratory scale, thus a functionalization-based approach to the combustion of substrate mixtures with nano-structural additives (raw, dried, calcined halloysite, kaolinite), introduced to improve the performance of straw biomass combustion and bottom ash formation in power boilers, clearly increased the CO2 adsorption capacity of the modified ashes. This allows for an advantageous synergy effect in the extra side-production of useful adsorbents in the closed-loop “cascade” scheme of the CE process. The addition of 4 wt.% kaolinite to straw biomass caused an over 2.5-fold increase in the CO2 adsorption capacity in relation to ash from the combustion of pure straw biomass (with a CO2 adsorption capacity of 0.132 mmol/g). In the case of addition of 4 wt.% nano-structured species to the straw combustion process, the best effects (ash adsorption capacity) were obtained in the following order: kaolinite (0.321 mmol/g), raw halloysite (0.310 mmol/g), calcined halloysite (0.298 mmol/g), and dried halloysite (0.288 mmol/g). Increasing the dose (in relation to all four tested substances) of the straw biomass additive from 2 to 4 wt.%, not only increase the adsorption capacity of the obtained ash, thus enriched with nano-structural additives, but also a showed a significant reduction in the differences between the maximum adsorption capacity of each ash is observed. The experimental results were analyzed using five models of adsorption isotherms: Freundlich, Langmuir, Jovanović, Temkin, and Hill. Moreover, selected samples of each ash were subjected to porosimetry tests and identification of the surface morphology (SEM). The obtained results can be used in the design of PSA processes or as permanent CO2 adsorbents, based on the environmentally beneficial option of using ashes from biomass combustion with appropriately selected additives.</jats:p>"

Methods: 15 male football players who play football regularly participated in the study. A core strength training program was applied to the research group using BOSU (Theraband, USA) elastic band (Theraband, USA). Before and after the study, the participants were analyzed with Tanita BC418 and their Body Mass Indexes (BMI) were taken. The height of the participants was measured with a stadiometer with a sensitivity of 0.01 cm. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 22 package program. Paired T Test was used for pre-test and post-test comparison between the two groups as the data showed normal distribution.  Results: A high level of significant difference was found in the RAST and BMI values of the participants before and after the training when the averages were compared (p&lt;0.05). A high level of significant difference was found in the Maximal Power and Fatigue Index values of the study participants when the pre- and post-training averages were compared (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: As a result, 8-week core exercises with Bosu and Tera tape improved the ability of repetitive sprinting, which is one of the important features of football players. As a result of the study, it can be said that the BMI level of the football players increases with the muscle mass developed as a result of core training.

One such approach is the discovery of critical points in cancer cells, i.e., where specific enzymes that are potential therapeutic targets are generated. Triazine is a six-membered heterocyclic ring compound with three nitrogen replacing carbon-hydrogen units in the benzene ring structure. The subject of this review is the symmetrical 1,3,5-triazine, known as s-triazine. 1,3,5-triazine is one of the oldest heterocyclic compounds available. Because of its low cost and high availability, it has attracted researcher attention for novel synthesis. s-Triazine has a weak base, it has much weaker resonance energy than benzene, therefore, nucleophilic substitution is preferred to electrophilic substitution. Heterocyclic bearing a symmetrical s-triazine core represents an interesting class of compounds possessing a wide spectrum of biological properties such as anti-cancer, antiviral, fungicidal, insecticidal, bactericidal, herbicidal and antimicrobial, antimalarial agents. They also have applications as dyes, lubricants, and analytical reagents. Hence, the group of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives has developed over the years. Triazine is not only the core amongst them, but is also a factor increasing the kinetic potential of the entire derivatives. Modifying the structure and introducing new substituents makes it possible to obtain compounds with broad inhibitory activity on processes such as proliferation. In some cases, s-triazine derivatives induce cell apoptosis. In this review we will present currently investigated 1,3,5-triazine derivatives with anti-cancer activities, with particular emphasis on their inhibition of enzymes involved in the process of tumorigenesis.</jats:p>"

The air reverse circulation is caused by the combination of the ejector and the flushing nozzles in the drill bit. In this paper, CFD software was used to simulate the influence of the structure of the swirler on the effect of air reverse circulation in the swirling drill bit, and a testing stand was established for the testing of air reverse circulation. The results show that for drill bits without flushing nozzles, the smaller the helical angle is, the larger the entrainment ratio will be, meanwhile the smaller the area ratio is, the larger the entrainment ratio will be. In contrast, for drill bits designed with flushing nozzles, the larger the helical angle is, the larger the entrainment ratio will be, and the larger the area ratio is, the larger the entrainment ratio will be. In addition, the presence of the ice core sharply reduces the effect of air reverse circulation. When the ice core’s height exceeds that of the outlet of the swirler, the reverse circulation effect is slightly improved.</jats:p>"

Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate changes in heart rate (HR) and core temperature (CT) values in college-aged males and females while exercising at different water immersion depths using an UTM. Twenty participants (age = 21.50 ± 2.19 years; height = 169.04 ± 10.85cm; weight = 75.56 ± 22.28kg) walked at water depths of 10cm below the xiphoid process and at the level of the superior iliac crest (I.C.). Each UTM session lasted 15 minutes, consisting of 5-minute bouts at 1, 2, and 3 mph. Polar HR monitors and ingestible thermoregulatory pills were used to measure HR and CT. Results indicated that HR at 1 (p = .305) and 2 mph (p = .864) were not significantly different between water depths. Heart rate was significantly higher at 3 mph (p = .003) at the I.C. water level. No significant differences were found in CT at 1 (p = .919), 2 (p = .392), or 3 mph (p = .310) during either immersion depth. As a result, higher immersion depths resulted in a lower average HR during higher intensity exercise due to the increased buoyancy effects and the reduced gravity environment of the water. Thus, exercising in higher immersion depths allows participants to exercise at a higher intensity with less overall stress placed on the lower extremities.</jats:p>"

The microstructure of the copolymer was observed by scanning electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. They were found to have a self-forming hole phenomenon, which is more favorable for potential PC/ASA applications. Furthermore, ACE addition effectively enhances the copolymer toughness and wear properties but slightly reduces their hardness, tensile strength, and melt flow rate, improving their suitability for use in applications such as aircraft windshields. After 80 cycles of aging, the PC/ASA/ACE also outperformed the impact strength of the unaged PC/ASA. ACE addition to PC/ASA can create materials with better impact and aging resistance.</jats:p>"

This study aims to compare and determine the effectiveness of two core stability exercises on Swiss ball and floor exercises on cardiovascular parameters in hypertensive individuals.\nMethod: A total of 30 hypertensive individuals participated in the study. They were divided in 2 groups: Group-A and Group-B. Baseline measurement of cardiovascular parameters i.e. systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) was recorded using sphygmomanometer and heart rate(HR) using pulse oximeter. Both group A and B performed 4 types of core stability exercises i.e. curl-ups, bridging, side planks and front planks on Swiss ball and Floor mat respectively. Each exercise was done for 10 repetitions with 10 seconds hold of 3 sets for 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate was measured again at end of 6 weeks.\nResult: Paired t-test suggested significant improvement on cardiovascular responses in both groups. Unpaired t-test showed significant improvement in cardiovascular parameters of group A when compared to group B after core stability exercises (p&lt;0.05).\nConclusion: The study concludes that core stability exercises have significant improvement on cardiovascular responses in both groups.

These data are then used to populate the standard core-size Darcy models used to simulate the rock dissolution at different injection rates. At the final step of the workflow, the obtained correlation of rock dissolution versus injection rate are used in advanced numerical simulators for well-scale modeling, in order to optimize the matrix-acidizing (MA) and acid-fracturing treatments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, the concept was demonstrated by dissolving the limestone core in hydrochloric acid.

Based on X-ray microtomography (microCT) scans of just two core samples and three laboratory filtration tests (one trial and two for the reference), by means of extensive cloud-based simulations, the authors were able to build two full-range pore-volume-to-breakthrough (PVBT) curves that are commonly used for treatment design. The second phase of the workflow involves reservoir-scale modeling and optimization of the acid treatment in an advanced digital simulator. A sensitivity study for the second-phase conceptual workflow was performed under typical well conditions in Middle Eastern basins to calculate volume and injection rates for optimum wormholing.

The experimental results from the alternative dynamic technique agreed well with the numerical simulation. In the GFRP sandwich beam with corrugated HC and CBIM's core, numerical free vibration analysis was performed. The CBIM core has a higher natural frequency than the HC core, according to the numerical data. Further, numerical analysis has been performed on the bioinspired cores by varying the side length and edge radius.

Generation of unentangled photon pairs in gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fibers specifically remains an attractive architecture for integration into quantum-optical fiber networks. The dispersion design offered by selection of fiber microstructures and gas pressure allows considerable control over the group-velocity profile which dictates the wavelengths of photon pairs that can be generated without spectral entanglement. Here, we expand on this design flexibility, which has previously been implemented for four-wave mixing, by modeling the use of a static, periodically poled electric field to achieve an effective quasi-phase-matched three-wave mixing nonlinearity that creates spontaneous parametric downconversion. Electric-field-induced quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric downconversion enables control of phase matching conditions that is independent of the group velocity, allowing phase matching at arbitrary wavelengths without affecting the entanglement of photons at those wavelengths. This decoupling of entanglement engineering and phase matching facilitates spectrally pure photon pair generation with efficiency and wavelength-tunability that is otherwise unprecedented.</jats:p>",

The Chinese government has made great efforts to protect this charming species and has made remarkable achievements, such as population growth and habitat expansion. However, habitat fragmentation has not been reversed. Protecting giant pandas in a large spatial extent needs to identify core habitat patches and corridors connecting them. This study used an equal‐sampling multiscale random forest habitat model to predict a habitat suitability map for the giant panda. Then, we applied the resistant kernel method and factorial least‐cost path analysis to identify core habitats connected by panda dispersal and corridors among panda occurrences, respectively. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of current protected areas in representing core habitats and corridors. Our results showed high scale dependence of giant panda habitat selection. Giant pandas strongly respond to bamboo percentage and elevation at a relatively fine scale (1 km), whereas they respond to anthropogenic factors at a coarse scale (≥2 km). Dispersal ability has significant effects on core habitats extent and population fragmentation evaluation. Under medium and high dispersal ability scenarios (12,000 and 20,000 cost units), most giant panda habitats in the Qionglai mountain are predicted to be well connected by dispersal. The proportion of core habitats covered by protected areas varied between 38% and 43% under different dispersal ability scenarios, highlighting significant gaps in the protected area network. Similarly, only 43% of corridors that connect giant panda occurrences were protected. Our results can provide crucial information for conservation managers to develop wise strategies to safeguard the long‐term viability of the giant panda population.</jats:p>",

These simulations over a wide-range of input pulse energies as well as filling gas pressures reveal a remarkable scaling of the self-compression process and dynamics. As a function of soliton order <jats:italic>N,</jats:italic> we identify the relation between the propagation distance after which self-compression in the HCF begins and the subsequent propagation length up to which the pulse remains maximally compressed; both these length scales decrease with an increase in <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>, the soliton order. Although previous investigations revealed pulse compression scaling laws which provide a good approximation for input pulse-widths ∼100 fs down to the limit where soliton fission begins to dominate the dynamics, these are not sufficiently accurate to describe the entire scaling dynamics. Instead, we identify a more generalized set of scaling laws by taking both third-order dispersion and the saturation of the compression factor due to soliton fission into account. These conclusions about scaling are robust: our simulations were carried out over a wide range of realistic input pulse energies and gas pressures as implemented in laboratories taking into account higher-order dispersive properties of the gaseous propagating medium. Therefore, given that these numerical investigations consider conditions typically applied in practice in laboratories, this work provides elegant design principles and guideposts relevant to realizing systems capable of achieving self-compression at substantially high pulse energies down to the few-cycle limit; they are of paramount importance in generating single as well as trains of attosecond pulses and acceleration strategies for electrons and ions in intense laser pulses.</jats:p>",

The tablets were designed and prepared with the commercial verapamil hydrochloride tablets as core inside and the fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D-printed shell outside. Filaments composed of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and polyethylenglycol (PEG) 400 were prepared by hot melt extrusion (HME) and used for fabrication of the shell. Seven types of printed shells were designed for the tablets by adjusting the filament composition, geometric structure and thickness of the shell. A series of evaluations were then performed on the 3D-printed core–shell tablets, including the morphology, weight, hardness, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), in vitro drug release and CT imaging. The results showed that the tablets prepared by FDM 3D printing appeared intact without any defects. All the excipients of the tablet shells were thermally stable during the extruding and printing process. The weight, hardness and in vitro drug release of the tablets were affected by the filament composition, geometric structure and thickness of the shell. The pulsatile tablets achieved personalized lag time ranging from 4 h to 8 h in the drug release test in phosphate-buffered solution (pH 6.8). Therefore, the 3D-printed core–shell pulsatile tablets in this study presented good potential in personalized administration, thereby improving the therapeutic effects of the drug for circadian rhythm disease.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are primary candidates in tissue engineering and stem cell therapies due to their intriguing regenerative and immunomodulatory potential. Their ability to self-assemble into three-dimensional (3D) aggregates further improves some of their therapeutic properties, e.g., differentiation potential, secretion of cytokines, and homing capacity after administration. However, high hydrodynamic shear forces and the resulting mechanical stresses within commercially available dynamic cultivation systems can decrease their regenerative properties. Cells embedded within a polymer matrix, however, lack cell-to-cell interactions found in their physiological environment. Here, we present a “semi scaffold-free” approach to protect the cells from high shear forces by a physical barrier, but still allow formation of a 3D structure with in vivo-like cell-to-cell contacts. We highlight a relatively simple method to create core–shell capsules by inverse gelation. The capsules consist of an outer barrier made from sodium alginate, which allows for nutrient and waste diffusion and an inner compartment for direct cell-cell interactions. Next to capsule characterization, a harvesting procedure was established and viability and proliferation of human adipose-derived MSCs were investigated. In the future, this encapsulation and cultivation technique might be used for MSC-expansion in scalable dynamic bioreactor systems, facilitating downstream procedures, such as cell harvest and differentiation into mature tissue grafts.</jats:p>"

Obtaining the molecular profile at the time of initial core needle biopsy is ideal because it could provide information that could significantly alter preoperative decision-making and avoid unnecessary treatments. In January 2020, the breast center began a 3 month pilot program that would reflexively send core biopsy material on all newly diagnosed patients for genomic testing using the MammaPrint (MPT) and BluePrint (BPT) assays regardless of receptor status. The goals were to determine feasibility and examine the impact to patient care. Methods: Breast core biopsy tissue was triaged by an attending pathologist as soon as slides were available. If invasive carcinoma with at least 3 mm in linear extent of tumor with 20% cellularity was identified, materials were immediately sent to Agendia for MPT/BPT testing even before ER/PR/HER2 testing was available to the pathologist. Clinicopathologic information, turn-around time (TAT) and adequacy data were tracked. The impact was discussed regularly at breast tumor board to determine if the results led to altered decision-making that could reduce unnecessary interventions and time to initial treatment. Results: 445 core biopsy specimens were sent for genomic testing. Of those 442, (97%) yielded genomic results with an average TAT from biopsy to genomic result of 11 calendar days. MPT identified 233 (53%) cases that were low risk and 209 (47%) cases that were high risk. BPT showed that 60 (14%) cases were Basal, 18 (4%) cases were HER2, and 364 (82%) cases were Luminal. Further analysis of the Luminal subgroup demonstrated that 154 (42%) were Luminal A low risk, 78 (21%) were Luminal A Ultralow risk and 132 (36%) were Luminal B High Risk. Analysis by race demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of high risk tumors in African-American women including a higher percentage of basal cancers (26%) as compared to Caucasian women (10%). Of note, 51 patients in the pilot study had additional OncotypeDX (ODX) testing on subsequent surgical resection. There was fair correlation between the assays with the majority of the low risk MPT having low risk ODX scores (&amp;lt;=25) and the high risk MPT having high risk ODX scores (&amp;gt;25), though MPT identified more patients as being high risk. The COVID-19 pandemic altered plans to assess time to treat and treatment interventions as initially intended. However, the knowledge of genomic result enhanced the ability to triage patients, allowing those patients with low risk tumors to begin endocrine therapy and delay surgery. Use of preoperative hormone therapy was considered more often in place of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with low genomic risk ER+/HER2- patients. Because of the continued feedback indicating positive impact, the pilot ultimately was extended to 11 months to allow time for formal implementation. Conclusions: Genomic testing using the MPT/BPT assay on core biopsy samples with at least 3 mm yields results 97% of the time with an average TAT of 11 days from biopsy date to result. The genomic information at the time of initial diagnosis impacted patient care most notably in the ER+ setting. The results led to the immediate implementation of direct reflex testing of all newly diagnosed ER+ and HER2- or IHC 2+ cancers by pathology after the initial pilot phase.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Hannah Gilmore, Philip Bomeisl, Alberto Montero.

This integrated approach has specifically shown its use in the cases of complex reservoirs such ones characterized as low-permeability sandstone reservoirs. It is in this spirit that this paper demonstrates how this virtually cost efficient analysis provides preliminary recommendations for the exploitation of such reservoirs. As case study, two types of producing reservoirs (Bekasap, Bangko, Pematang, and Tanjung Formations) have been taken in 2009. The first type is strongly controlled by depositional environment. It is found in the upper part of Bekasap and Bangko formations (1900 - 2300 ft-ss), deposited in estuarine system, and made of very fine to fine grained sand with low to moderate bioturbation. This mostly feldspathic and lithic greywackes have permeability of up to 200 mD. The second type is strongly dominated by diagenesis process and is mainly found in the Upper Pematang and Tanjung Formations (6200 - 7400 ft-ss). This reservoir type is characterized by its coarse-grained and conglomeratic sandstones resulted from fan- elta and braided channel depositional system. Diagenetic events such as compaction, recrystallization of matrix into microcrystalline clay minerals, precipitation of authigenic minerals in pore system are also well identified from the performed petrographic analysis. This is dominated by sublitharenite and litharenite sandstones exhibit horizontal permeability of up to several dozens mD. The two producing reservoir types have undergone carefully planned exploitation and stimulation operations, and the horizontal drilling and fracturing</jats:p>"

In this study, we identified the Core Unique Peptides (CrUPs) that reside exclusively in the Omicron variant of Spike protein and are absent from the human proteome, creating a new dataset of peptides named as SARS-CoV-2 CrUPs against the human proteome (C/H-CrUPs), and we analyzed their locations in comparison to the Alpha and Delta variants. In Omicron, 115 C/H-CrUPs were generated and 119 C/H-CrUPs were lost, almost four times as many compared to the other two variants. At the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM), 8 mutations were detected, resulting in the construction of 28 novel C/H-CrUPs. Most importantly, in the Omicron variant, new C/H-CrUPs carrying two or three mutant amino acids were produced, as a consequence of the accumulation of multiple mutations in the RBM. These C/H-CrUPs could not be recognized in any other viral Spike variant. Our findings indicated that the virus binding to the ACE2 receptor is facilitated by the herein identified C/H-CrUPs in contact point mutations and Spike cleavage sites, while the immunoregulatory NF9 peptide is not detectably affected. Thus, the Omicron variant could escape immune-system attack, while the strong viral binding to the ACE2 receptor leads to the highly efficient fusion of the virus to the target cell. However, the intact NF9 peptide suggests that Omicron exhibits reduced pathogenicity compared to the Delta variant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plant microbiomes and immune responses have coevolved through history, and this applies just as much to the phyllosphere microbiome and defense phytohormone signaling. When in homeostasis, the phyllosphere microbiome confers benefits to its host. However, the phyllosphere is also dynamic and subject to stochastic events that can modulate community assembly. Investigations into the impact of defense phytohormone signaling on the microbiome have so far been limited to culture-dependent studies; or focused on the rhizosphere. In this study, the impact of the foliar phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) on the structure and composition of the phyllosphere microbiome was investigated. 16S rRNA amplicons were sequenced from aerial tissues of two <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic> mutants that exhibit elevated SA signaling through different mechanisms. SA signaling was shown to increase community diversity and to result in the colonization of rare, satellite taxa in the phyllosphere. However, a stable core community remained in high abundance. Therefore, we propose that SA signaling acts as a source of intermediate disturbance in the phyllosphere. Predictive metagenomics revealed that the SA-mediated microbiome was enriched for antibiotic biosynthesis and the degradation of a diverse range of xenobiotics. Core taxa were predicted to be more motile, biofilm-forming and were enriched for traits associated with microbe-microbe communication; offering potential mechanistic explanation of their success despite SA-mediated phyllospheric disturbance.</jats:p>"

In addition to the large computational power required, the hardware needs to be compact and energy efficient. One promising approach to fulfill those requirements is phase-change material based photonic neuromorphic computing that enables in-memory computation and a high degree of parallelization. In the following, we present an optimized layout of a photonic tensor core (PTC) which is designed to perform real valued matrix vector multiplications and operates at telecommunication wavelengths. We deploy the well-studied phase-change material Ge<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Sb<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> (GST) as an optical attenuator to perform single positive valued multiplications. In order to generalize the multiplication to arbitrary real factors, we develop a novel symmetric multiplication unit which directly includes a reference-computation branch. The variable GST attenuator enables a modulation depth of 5 dB over a wavelength range of 100 nm with a wavelength dependency below 0.8 dB. The passive photonic circuit itself ensures equal coupling to the main-computation and reference-computation branch over the complete wavelength range. For the first time, we integrate wavelength multiplexers (MUX) together with a photonic crossbar array on-chip, paving the way towards fully integrated systems. The MUX are crucial for the PTC since they enable multiple computational channels in a single photonic crossbar array. We minimize the crosstalk between the channels by designing Bragg scattering based MUX. By cascading, we achieve an extinction ratio larger than 61 dB while the insertion loss is below 1 dB.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the elastic buckling development of the flange under monotonic compression is theoretically discussed based on the elastic buckling theory of plate and the principle of virtual displacement. The numerical model for the buckling restrained brace with H-section steel core is then established based on Abaqus, and the elastic buckling development of the flange is validated. Finally, further numerical studies are conducted to reveal the elasto-plastic buckling development of the flange and web under cyclic loading. It is found that the local buckling development of the flange and web of the H-section steel core are different from that of the flat plate core of buckling restrained brace. Under cyclic loading, the shortest buckling wave of the flange and web are induced by the buckling of plates on the two sides of the contact point near the ends. It is confirmed that there is no need to consider the lateral support from the restraining members to evaluate the minimum half-wavelength of high-order local buckling for section steel core of buckling-restrained brace.</jats:p>"

The optimum performance of the studied nanofluid as a coolant in MTR core was determined by the determination of the conditions under which the total entropy generation due to both heat transfer and fluid flow had a minimum value. The results showed that this condition was at Re = 4.8 × 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup>.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The fluid flow dynamics of the matrix and fractures are significantly different from each other. Fractures are high-permeability flow channels that serve as the main flow units. On the other hand, the Matrix takes up the majority of the reservoir volume and is generally regarded as the main storage unit. The primary goal of this research is to investigate numerically the effects of fractures and polymer gel treatment on oil recovery during waterflooding of artificially fractured core plugs. In this study, the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) was used for the numerical solution. Different numerical models were developed using MRST to describe three main cases: non-fractured core plug, fractured core plug, and polymer gel treated core plug. Following the creation of the physical models, 2 PV water was introduced into all core plugs. Oil recovery and water saturation profiles vs. time plots were obtained. The standard Buckley-Leveret solution is utilized to evaluate the numerical model, and the fractures are modeled using the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM). The results of the simulations were compared with the results of the experiments. In the experiments, results were recorded after 2 PV water injections. For the polymer gel treated core plugs, 2 PV more water was injected after the polymer gel operation. same injection volumes as used in the MRST model. For an artificially fractured core sample, initial oil recovery was measured as 28.57% experimentally and 28.87% with MRST. Then polymer gel was applied to the core plug, increasing the oil recovery to 42.85% experimentally and to 40.83% with MRST. Similarly, before and after polymer gel operation, mean water saturation was measured as 58.34% and 66.5%, respectively. MRST results showed mean water saturation of 58.38% and 65.45%. It is clear from both numerical and experimental models that the existence of fractures decreases the overall hydrocarbon recovery. Polymer gel treatment decreases fracture permeability, resulting in a more uniform sweep and increased overall recovery. Additional oil recovery was observed after polymer gel treatment. Besides, polymer gel treatment of the matrix is also efficient for increasing the recovery and leads to the same results. Moreover, the effects of the fracture aperture and fracture permeability on the recovery were also investigated. Fracture aperture directly impacts the recovery of the low aperture values when the permeability is constant. Similarly, permeability directly affects recovery for high values when the aperture is constant. Finally, the results showed that experimental and numerical findings are significantly close to each other for all non-fractured, fractured, and polymer gel-treated cases.</jats:p>",

But exactly how the mutations in the Omicron variant enhance viral escape from immunological protection remains to be understood. The S-RBD remains the principal target for neutralizing antibodies and therapeutics, thus new structural insights into the Omicron S-RBD and characterization of the post-translational glycosylation changes can inform rational design of vaccines and therapeutics. Here we report the molecular variations and O-glycoform changes of the Omicron S-RBD variant as compared to wild-type (WA1/2020) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants using high-resolution top-down mass spectrometry (MS). A novel O-glycosite (Thr376) unique to the Omicron variant is identified. Moreover, we have directly quantified the Core 1 and Core 2 O-glycan structures and characterized the O-glycoform structural heterogeneity of the three variants. Our findings reveal high resolution detail of Omicron O-glycoforms and their utilization to provide direct molecular evidence of proteoform alterations in the Omicron variant which could shed light on how this variant escapes immunological protection.</jats:p>"

The presence of a thiol group (-SH) in the chemical structure of GSH can bind to the Au@Pt nanozyme surface to hamper the activation of O2 and reducing its oxidase-like activity as a function of the concentration of GSH. Herein, we exploit the loss of activity to develop an analytical methodology able to detect and quantify GSH up to µM levels. The system composed by Au@Pt and TMB demonstrates a good linear range between 0.1–1.0 µM to detect GSH levels with a limit of detection (LoD) of 34 nM.</jats:p>"

Feeding was strongly seasonal in bryozoans, gorgonians, polychaetes, and dendrochirote holothurians. The winter non‐feeding period was longest in the holothurians and shortest in bryozoans. Bryozoans started feeding in late winter at very low chlorophyll concentrations, often when surface fast‐ice was still present. In hydroids and actinians, feeding tentacles were deployed continuously throughout the year, though hydroid feeding intensity declined slightly in late winter. Water column phytoplankton biomass was strongly seasonal with marked interannual variability in the timing and intensity of the bloom, driven principally by ice dynamics. Correlation across years between the start of feeding and the development of the bloom was poor, and in seasons when a dense spring bloom of benthic filamentous microalgae developed, the start of feeding in many benthic species was delayed. This study indicates that feeding in benthic marine suspension feeders in Antarctica is influenced by factors additional to the seasonal availability of food in the water column.</jats:p>",

The log region remains intact for all cases. The so-called quiescent core of the turbulent channel flow is also investigated. In addition to increased core discontinuity, the increased fluctuations of the streamwise velocity give rise to new core states, which differ from the conventional ones in their characteristic velocity. They are associated with a bulk of low- or high-momentum fluid passing through the measurement domain, and their occurrence increases with turbulence intensity. Tracking the core boundaries indicates an overall tendency of the core to move closer to the wall for increased inlet turbulence intensities, resulting in an increased core thickness. Moreover, it is found that the low-momentum cores generally reside closer to the wall compared with the ordinary cores and appear to be thicker than them, whereas the opposite, i.e. residing farther from the wall and being thinner, is true for the high-momentum cores.</jats:p>",

This work is focused on the design of a new high-performance Carbon FRP core as alternative to traditional periodic prismatic ones. The innovative core is designed as a 2D close-packing pattern of circular cells and manufactured by connecting pre-preg corrugated laminates in specific locations. The corrugated laminates are layered following an asymmetric sequence in order to generate residual thermal stresses within the core to enhance energy absorption and compressive properties. The distribution of the residual thermal stress within the core was numerically studied with a finite element model of the unit cell, in order to prove the positive contribution of the asymmetric layup on the mechanical properties and study the failure mechanisms of the unit-cell. Composite core samples were manufactured, and their mechanical properties were experimentally evaluated through compression, both out-of-plane and in-plane, and beam flexure tests. Results were compared in terms of specific properties with traditional aluminium honeycomb core, showing large increments of specific compressive strength (+84.6%), in-plane compressive modulus (over +500%), Specific Energy Absorption (+145%) and shear (&gt;20%). The FEM model was validated against experimental compressive results, showing an error below 10%. The results show that the core is suitable for applications in novel high-performance sandwich structures, leading to numerous advantages in comparison to traditional cores, such as higher specific properties, manufacturability of complex sandwich structures and higher adhesion and compatibility with CFRP skins. </jats:p>",

The x-ray diffraction patterns revealed that samples have a cubic structure with Fm3̄m space group and no change in the crystallite structure was observed with doping Gd3+ ions. The crystallite size (Dc) decreases from 2.70 to 1.27 nm when Gd is doped into Ni/NiO MNPs. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the Ni/NiO MNPs with Gd(5%) concentration are formed as spherical multicore-like shape core/shell MNPs with a protective PVP layer. The magnetic hysteresis measurements taken at 10 and 300 K show that the saturation magnetization (Ms) decreases with increasing Gd3+ ions in the structure. The highest effective magnetic moment (μeff) was obtained as 10.34 μB in the NG-2 sample. We ascribe that the high μeff value in this sample is due to the increase in d–f exchange interaction between Ni(3d7) and Gd(4f7) and the contribution of the dipole moment of PVP molecules. The electrochemical measurements showed that the current density values were 0.294 and 0.319 mA/cm2 at-1.3 V in the absence of Gd (NG-0) and Gd(5%) doped (NG-2) samples, respectively. βc was 159 and 132 mV/dec for NG-0 and NG-2 samples, respectively.

External driving factors are the main category of institutional pressure composed of regulatory pressure, normative pressure, and cognitive pressure. Internal driving factors are divided into the main category of behavioral awareness and the behavioral capability of the core enterprises. The behavioral awareness is composed of responsibility sense, problem cognition and behavioral effect perception. The behavioral capability is composed of safety management strength and safety coordination capability. Institutional pressure, behavioral awareness, and behavioral capability all influence the work safety management behavior of core enterprise in supply chain significantly, but with different ways and paths. On this basis, the driving mechanism model of the above three main categories on the work safety management behavior in core enterprise supply chain is explored. The research can provide targeted policy ideas and implementation paths for the government to formulate effective guiding policies to promote the work safety management behavior of core enterprise.</jats:p>"

Many rare earth elements and yttrium (REY)-rich sediments were recently discovered in the sea area of Minamitorishima Island, Northwest Pacific. To understand the material source and REY enrichments of sediments in this area, here, we performed clay minerals and Sr-Nd isotopes analyses on gravity core GC1601 gained in the Southeast Sea area of Minamitorishima Island. The clay mineral composition of the core is very similar to that of terrigenous materials, and its montmorillonite/illite (M/I) ratio ranges from 0.09 to 0.20 with an average of 0.15, indicating that the sediments in the study area should be mainly dominated by terrestrial sources, consistent with the results of Sr-Nd isotope study. Considering that the study area is far away from the mainland and in the downwind direction of the East Asian monsoon, we propose that the terrigenous material of the sediments in the study area is likely East Asian dust. The εNd values of GC1601 show a positive correlation with P2O5, Co, Ni, and Cu, and have an increasing trend with increasing depth, approaching that of the seawater, indicating that the sedimentary environment in the area is relatively stable. Although the total REY content (ΣREY) of the core increases with depth, due to the large supply of terrigenous materials for the sediments, it is difficult for the study area to form high-grade REY-rich muds.</jats:p>"

In the first few years since its emergence, researchers have been exploring ways to use Twitter data in various decision making scenarios, and have shown promising results. In this review, we examine 28 newer papers published in last five years (since 2016) that continued to advance Twitter-aided decision making. The application scenarios we cover include product sales prediction, stock selection, crime prevention, epidemic tracking, and traffic monitoring. We first discuss the findings presented in these papers, that is how much decision making performance has been improved with the help of Twitter data. Then we offer a methodological analysis that considers four aspects of methods used in these papers, including problem formulation, solution, Twitter feature, and information transformation. This methodological analysis aims to enable researchers and decision makers to see the applicability of Twitter-aided methods in different application domains or platforms.</jats:p>",

All participants performed the exercise for 60 min per day, 3 times a week, for 7 weeks. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed at a significance level of 0.05. Tensiomyography (TMG) of the erector spinae revealed no significant post-exercise change in the contraction time; however, there was a significant post-exercise increase in the maximum radial displacement and mean velocity until 90% of the TMG was displaced. Additionally, the isokinetic muscular functional test of the trunk revealed a significant post-exercise increase in almost all variables. Our findings demonstrated that the core stabilization exercise reduced stiffness in the erector spinae, increased the velocity of erector spinae contraction, and effectively improved the isokinetic muscular function of the trunk.</jats:p>"

DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable. Here, a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well predictable mechanical behaviors is demonstrated by using a pair of star‐polymer–DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two‐state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress‐relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over 4 orders of magnitude from 0.1–2000 s. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis‐less and self‐healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star‐polymer–DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress‐response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.</jats:p>",

This phenomenon is the analog of the classical hydrodynamic Magnus effect. In this analysis, the instantaneous rest-frame theory and the modal series expansion method in cylindrical coordinates are utilized to formulate the EM/optical scattering from a cylindrical shell with arbitrary thickness, and to compute the optical radiation force and torque vector components. Particular emphases are given on the size parameter of the cylindrical shell, the layer thickness, the angular rotation of the inner absorptive core, and the polarization (TM or TE) of the incident plane waves. Numerical computations illustrate the analysis and explicate the behaviors of the longitudinal, transverse, and axial radiation force and torque components. Related applications for the optical Magnus effect in radiation force and torque investigations can benefit from the results of the present analysis in spin-optics, rotational Doppler shift for optical waves, optical tweezers, optical manipulation of elongated spinning objects, and particle rotation.</jats:p>",

However, observational data suggests that the SNe may be not spherically symmetric. Modern multidimensional simulations of SNe demonstrate development of hydrodynamical instabilities during the explosion phase. But the configuration of a star and inhomogeneities prior to explosion could strongly affect how the SN develops. A number of papers on numerical modeling of pair-instability SNe explosion considered the case when thermonuclear energy in the central region of a massive star is introduced by a series of several hot spots. It leads to the appearance of many fragments of hot matter behind the divergence shock wave. An observable manifestation of this may be the presence of peaks on light curves of gamma-ray bursts associated with explosions of massive stars. The physical nature of such inhomogeneities is not evident and the number and size of spots is conjecture. In this work, we study the possibility of formation of these inhomogeneities at the stage of core collapse (CC) in a massive star. To check this assumption, we chose an analytic self-similar model of CC and investigated the stability of solutions obtained from it with respect to small multidimensional perturbations. It shows there are no conditions where the collapse of a very massive star may remain stable, although, for a less massive star, it is possible. Using the relations obtained, we found characteristic features of developing instability, thereby making it possible to estimate the amount and characteristic size of the inhomogeneities.</jats:p>",

The use of new high-density fuels is very much needed in the RSG-GAS core so that it is necessary to calculate its safety. When using high density fuel there will be a “bottle neck” effect where there is a problem with the fuel and cladding interaction. According to previous researchers this can be overcome by adding metal elements Si, Ni or Ti to fuel. However, with the addition of metal elements Si, Ni or Ti to the fuel, it needs to be analyzed in the RSG-GAS core. The analysis was carried out calculations using a computer program by simulating the Si metal used 1%, 2%, 3% 4% and 5% in the fuel. The calculation of the additional metal element in the high-density fuel effect on the reactivity of the RSG-GAS core was carried out with the WIMSD-5B and Batan-FUEL programs. The WIMSD-5B program is a computer program consisting of several modules including the transport module which is used for the calculation of the generation of macroscopic constants for the 19.75% enriched uranium silicide fuel and the density of 4.8 gU/cc as a function of degree of burn. Core calculations were performed using a neutron diffusion program, namely Batan-FUEL. By calculating the core criticality at operating temperature, the core neutronic parameter values are obtained. The results of the analysis show that the amount of Si 5% in the high density fuel matrix can solve the bottle neck problem and the neutronic parameters are still within the safety limit. This value will determine how much the value of the fuel burn up and control rods are in accordance with the acceptance criteria so that the safety analysis can be carried out on the RSG-GAS core using high density. From the analysis, it was found that the addition of the element Si in the high-density fuel matrix did not find any significant changes in core reactivity and neutronic parameter.</jats:p>",

The hypothetical proton sponge effect and degradability in response to a stimulus (i. e., mildly acidic pH in the endosome) are two prevailing, although contested, principles in designing effective carriers for intracellular gene delivery via endosomal escape. Utilizing the highly flexible chemical‐tuning of the polymeric shell via surface‐initiated photo‐polymerization of the various monomers at different molecular ratios, the effects of proton buffering capacity, acid‐degradability, and endosomal membrane‐lysis property on intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA by CSNPs were investigated. This study demonstrated the equivalently critical roles of proton buffering and acid‐degradability in achieving efficient intracellular gene delivery, independent of cellular uptake. Extended proton buffering resulted in further improved transfection as long as the core structure was not compromised. The results of the study present a promising synthetic strategy to the development of an efficient, chemically‐tunable gene delivery carrier.</jats:p>",

We argue that Minsky can be read as offering a post-foundational perspective on political economy that recognizes the speculative dimension of all economic activity. This post-foundational reading allows for an understanding of neoliberal policymaking in terms of the provision of liquidity to too-big-to-fail constituencies. The article discusses how some segments of Western societies have been able to participate in the inflationary logic of this too-big-to-fail dynamic, whereas others are locked out and face increasingly tight liquidity constraints. This differential access to liquidity is an increasingly central aspect of the stratifying rationality of contemporary capitalism. By connecting Minsky’s insights into the temporal logic of capital to key issues in social theory, the article presents a new theorization of (il)liquid life that advances on extant accounts. </jats:p>",

In this study, we propose a new image captioning framework based on DenseCap that aims to promote the understanding of movies in particular. In addition, we design and implement a module for identifying characters so that the character information can be used in caption detection and caption improvement in core areas. We also propose a core area caption detection algorithm that considers the variables affecting the area caption importance.

Our aim was to explore (1) spatial and temporal variation in population densities, home range size and individual detection probability during breeding season between populations and years, and (2) the influence of water temperature and flow on activity of newts. Estimates of population density range from 3044 to 4641 individuals/km of stream across the three years of the study. Linear home range along the stream was estimated to be 13.31 m from the home range centre on average over the three years. All detection probability estimates were similar, both between years and between sites, with a mean probability of 0.09, except in Fougax in 2020 where detection probability was 0.03. Activity of the Pyrenean brook newt was influenced by water temperature and flow, but these factors acted at different time scales. Overall, population densities are locally high in both populations but home range of the Pyrenean brook newt during breeding season is very small indicating a strong site attachment. The importance of water temperature and flow on activity emphasizes the sensitivity of the species to these factors that are forecasted to change in coming decades.</jats:p>",

The tetracyclic and pentacyclic ring systems containing either an oxo or a hydroxy functional group are suitable for introducing various side chains, including potential pharmacophores. For this latter transformation, examples are demonstrated by conversion of the hydroxy group into a chloro moiety and subsequent reaction with amines or with primary alcohols bearing a tertiary amino side chain. Two fused-ring derivatives exhibiting the side-chain characteristics of tianeptine have also been synthesized. Altogether 40 compounds are described in the present manuscript, eight of them are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.</jats:p>",

The selection process is divided into two stages. In the portfolio stage, applicants submit a score based on a published self-assessment guidance. Only candidates whose scores remain higher than the cut-off after verification will proceed to the interview stage. Finally, jobs are allocated according to the overall performance of both stages. Despite the rising number of applicants, the number of job vacancies remains largely similar. Hence, the intensity of competition has increased over the past few years. The competitive ratio increased from 2.8:1 in 2019 to 4.6:1 in 2021. Hence, several changes have been implemented in the CST application process, with the aim to combat this trend. The recurring changes in the CST application process have sparked considerable discussions among applicants. The effect of the changes on the current and prospective applicants is yet to be explored. This letter aims to highlight the changes and discuss the potential impacts. The CST application from 2020 to 2022 has been compared to identify the changes implemented throughout the years. Specific changes have been highlighted. The impact of changes in the CST application process on applicants has been divided into ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ sections. Recently, many specialties have shifted from portfolio-based assessment to Multiple Specialty Recruitment Assessments. In contrast, CST application preserves its emphasis on holistic assessment and academic excellence. However, the application process could be further refined for more impartial recruitment. This would ultimately help alleviate the challenging situation of staff shortage, increase the number of specialist doctors, reduce waiting time for elective surgeries and most importantly, provide better care for our patients in the NHS.</jats:p>",

This leads to deterioration in daily function, repeated hospital admissions and poor quality of life. The prevalence and mortality related to bronchiectasis is increasing worldwide with growing economic burden on healthcare systems. Physiotherapy for bronchiectasis aims to decrease accumulation of sputum, dyspnoea, and improve exercise capacity and daily function. A robust evidence base to support physiotherapy in bronchiectasis is currently lacking. This is partly because of inconsistency and poor reporting of outcomes in available studies.</jats:p><jats:p>A core outcome set is the minimum acceptable group of outcomes that should be used in clinical trials for a specific condition.

We used sol–gel technology to prepare silica nanospheres embedded with fluorescent and magnetic Eu3+(1 mol%)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals. The X-ray diffraction pattern analysis and transmission electron microscopy investigations showed CeO2:Eu3+(1 mol%) nanocrystals of about 9 nm size and Ce3+ ions substitution by the Eu3+ ions; the nanocrystals dispersed inside the nanosized silica spheres of about 400 nm diameters. The photoluminescence spectra recorded under UV-light excitation showed Eu3+ ions luminescence peaks (5D0-7FJ, J = 0–4) accompanied by a weaker 425 nm luminescence due to the silica matrix; the quantum yield was 0.14. The weak hysteresis loop and magnetization curves recorded up to 20,000 Oe showed dominantly paramagnetic behavior associated with the silica matrix; a slight opening of the hysteresis loop to a very small magnetic field (about 0.005 Oe) was due to the presence of the two rare earth ions. The photonic crystal properties of SiO2-CeO2:Eu3+(1 mol%) silica nanospheres deposited as films on quartz plates were revealed by the two weak attenuation peaks at 420 and 500 nm and were associated with the reflection from different planes. The SiO2-CeO2:Eu3+(1 mol%) nanospheres are attractive potential candidates for photonics-related applications or for multifunctional bio-labels by combining the luminescence and magnetic properties of the nanocrystals.</jats:p>"

In this work, we have attempted to predict the hydrophobic core of cyclophilin (LdCyp) from <jats:italic>Leishmania donovani</jats:italic>, utilizing a surface complementarity function, which selects for high goodness of fit between hydrophobic side‐chain surfaces, rather in the manner of assembling a three‐dimensional jigsaw puzzle. The computational core prediction method implemented here has been tried on two distinct scenarios, on the LdCyp polypeptide chain with native non‐core residues and all core residues initially set to alanine, on a poly‐glycine polypeptide chain. Molecular dynamics simulations appeared to indicate partial destabilization of the two designed sequences. However, experimental characterization of the designed sequences by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and denaturant (GdmCl) induced unfolding, demonstrated disordered proteins. Stepwise reconstruction of the designed cores by cumulative sequential mutations identified the specific mutation (M122L) as primarily responsible for fold collapse and all design objectives were achieved upon rectifying this mutation. In summary, the study demonstrates regions of the core to contain highly specific (jigsaw puzzle‐like) interactions sensitive to any perturbations and a predictive algorithm to identify such regions. A mutation within the core has been identified which exercises an inordinate influence on the global fold, reminiscent of metamorphic proteins. In addition, the computational procedure could predict substantial regions of the core (given main‐chain coordinates) without any reference to non‐core residues.</jats:p>",

The effects of reaction time on the material properties of the CdTe/CdSe NPs are reported. It was realized that the reaction time has significant impact on the CdSe shell growth on the CdTe core. Various techniques were used to characterize the as-prepared CdTe/CdSe NPs. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the crystal structure and the possible growth of the CdSe shell on the CdTe core. The results obtained indicated the formation of zinc blende crystal structure which was transformed from a polycrystalline to single crystalline structure. The XRD pattern displayed features that are intermediate between the CdTe and CdSe, a sign of shell formation and not two separate compounds formed. This was also supported by high resolution transmission electron microscope images obtained. The crystallite sizes estimated using Scherrer formula were all less than 3 nm showing that the NPs are in quantum confinement regime. Scanning electron microscope was used to determine the surface topography while the energy x-ray dispersive spectrometer displayed the elemental composition of the as-prepared NPs. SEM and HRTEM images showed uniformly distributed spherical NPs with some agglomerations observed at longer duration of synthesis. The optical properties (photoluminescence (PL) and absorbance) investigated at different reaction times (20, 40, 60 and 80 min) presented novel features which show the formation of a thin CdSe shell on the CdTe core NPs. The PL emission wavelength was dramatically red shifted upon the growth of the CdSe shell on the CdTe core (from 541–615 nm). Other unique features of the as-grown CdTe/CdSe NPs are discussed in detail. The obtained results displayed good material properties of the CdTe/CdSe NPs suitable for use in biomaging applications.</jats:p>",

Cluster density profiles at core collapse show a broken-power-law structure, suggesting that central cusps are a genuine feature of collapsed cores.

Recent experimental and modeling investigations reported contradicting results concerning the effect of coating on the photoacoustic response of gold nanostructures. Enhanced photoacoustic response is generally attributed to facilitated heat transfer at the gold/silica/water system. Here, we examine the photoacoustic response of gold core–silica shell nanoparticles immersed in water using a combination of the two temperature model and hydrodynamic phase field simulations. Here, of particular interest is the role of the interfacial coupling between the gold electrons and silica shell phonons. We demonstrate that as compared to uncoated nanoparticles, photoacoustic response is enhanced for very thin silica shells (5 nm) and short laser pulses, but for thicker coatings, the photoacoustic performance are generally deteriorated. We extend the study to the regime of nanocavitation and show that the generation of nanobubbles may also play a role in the enhanced acoustic response of core–shell nanoparticles. Our modeling effort may serve as guides for the optimization of the photoacoustic response of heterogeneous metal–dielectric nanoparticles.</jats:p>",

Four fiber segments with slight length differences in between are core-offset fused together to achieve U-shape spring-like microstructure fiber for large transverse bending radius. The reflected high-order modes at three silica/air interfaces interfere to give a broad spectrum due to unequal segment length, which enables continuous strain detection over 35 mɛ. The air and glass hybrid structure of the device enables the large bending, and hence compression and tension measurement can be achieved simultaneously. The strain sensitivity is up to 20.75 pm/µɛ with the strain accuracy of 0.5 µɛ. This novel, to the best of our knowledge, core-offset fiber has high strain sensitivity and large strain range for compression and tension strain measurement. Furthermore, the proposed strain sensor can be fabricated easily for practical applications where large strain with high strain accuracy is needed.</jats:p>",

Unlike the standard perturbative approach, in which dynamical friction arises from the LBK torque due to pure resonances, this alternative, complementary view nicely illustrates how a massive perturber significantly changes the energies and angular momenta of field particles on near-resonant orbits, with friction arising from an imbalance between particles that gain energy and those that lose energy. We treat dynamical friction in a spherical host system as a restricted three-body problem. This treatment is applicable in the “slow” regime, in which the perturber sinks slowly and the standard perturbative framework fails due to the onset of nonlinearities. Hence, it is especially suited to investigate the origin of core-stalling: the cessation of dynamical friction in central constant-density cores. We identify three different families of near-corotation-resonant orbits that dominate the contribution to dynamical friction. Their relative contribution is governed by the Lagrange points (fixed points in the corotating frame). In particular, one of the three families, which we call Pac-Man orbits because of their appearance in the corotating frame, is unique to cored density distributions. When the perturber reaches a central core, a bifurcation of the Lagrange points drastically changes the orbital makeup, with Pac-Man orbits becoming dominant. In addition, due to relatively small gradients in the distribution function inside a core, the net torque from these Pac-Man orbits becomes positive (enhancing), thereby effectuating a dynamical buoyancy. We argue that core-stalling occurs where this buoyancy is balanced by friction.</jats:p>",

Here we combine dSTORM imaging and single-domain insulin antibody, to dissect the <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> structure of insulin granule cores (IGCs) at nano level. We demonstrate that the size and shape of the IGCs can be regulated by the juxta-granular molecules Nucleobindin-2 and Enolase-1, that further contribute to the stimulated insulin secretion. IGCs located at the plasma membrane are larger than those in the cytosol. The IGCs size is decreased by ∼20% after glucose stimulation due to the release of the peripheral part of IGCs through incomplete granule fusion. Importantly, the reduction of the IGCs size is also observed in non-stimulatory pancreatic β-cells from diabetic <jats:italic>db/db</jats:italic> mice, Akita (<jats:italic>Ins2<jats:sup>+/-</jats:sup></jats:italic>) mice and human Type-2 diabetic donors, in accordance with impaired secretion.

At present, the research of composite insulator’s decay-like fracture is still in the initial stage at home and abroad, and there is no clear conclusion on the causes of its fracture, influencing factors and other important scientific and technical issues, and there is no unified understanding of the mechanism of decay-like fracture. In view of the above problems, this paper carries out acid corrosion test on core rod samples to explore the corrosion law of nitric acid on core rod and its influence on properties. The results show that acid corrosion is one of the factors causing the degradation of epoxy resin. With the increase of nitric acid concentration and soaking time, the degradation rate of epoxy resin accelerates, and the core rod sample gradually changes from emerald green to yellowish brown, then to light yellow, and finally to white hair like glass fibre. The effect of the sample under the long-time action of low concentration nitric acid is the same as that under the short-time action of high concentration nitric acid. Nitric acid will continuously erode into the core rod, resulting in the decrease of hardness and performance on the core rod surface.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 283 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: The widely-used National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk criteria for prostate cancer are impactful for patient and clinicians, particularly when assessing suitability for initial active surveillance. However, in the era of MRI-guided biopsy, fewer patients may meet stringent “very-low risk” criteria due to improved sampling, which may lead to over-treatment of non-lethal cancers. We evaluated the distribution of prostate cancer risk classification obtained using MRI-ultrasound fusion versus systematic 12 core biopsy. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent prostate MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy at a single institution from January 2017 to July 2021. The primary study objective was to characterize the proportion of patients meeting NCCN “very-low risk” designation within a contemporary biopsy cohort. We calculated NCCN risk classifications (very low, low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, high, and very high) based on constituent components (PSA, PSA density, number of biopsy cores positive, greatest extent of core positivity). We conducted comparisons within patients based on findings obtained through MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy versus systematic biopsy only. Results: We identified 1,132 patients, including 1,014 (89.5%) and 118 (10.5%) who underwent first-time biopsy and surveillance biopsies. The median PSA was 7.15 (interquartile range: 5.2-10.8). Using data obtained through systematic biopsy alone, 123 (10.9%) and 242 (21.4%) were classified as very-low and low NCCN risk, respectively. Incorporating data from MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy, 86 (7.6%) and 255 (22.5%) were classified as very-low and low NCCN risk, respectively. Among patients initially electing active surveillance as management, 7.4%, 60.2%, 26.9% met very-low, low, and favorable-intermediate risk criteria, respectively. Conclusions: A small proportion of patients undergoing MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy will be classified as ‘very-low risk’ by the NCCN definition, and the majority of patients managed initially with active surveillance fall outside of this criteria. These findings imply a need to broaden support for active surveillance outside of “very-low risk” criteria to promote greater uptake.[Table: see text] </jats:p>",

In search of a paradigm shift, this grounded theory paper investigates the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of a Rukai Indigenous community in Taiwan to unearth its core values and core practices related to sustainability, as its people have been living near the headwaters in the mountain area for generations. Six Elders from the community were interviewed, and the findings show that the Rukai TEK of water is guided by taboos, a social mechanism keeping the human-nature balance, which are ingrained in four core values (prevention of water contamination, group sharing, conservation of the sources of life, and adherence to the laws of nature). These core values are reflected in the five core practices of water use, including calakebe (spring), drakerale (streams), drapulu (ivy fishing), wakaruru (water diversion), and wadrele (water monitoring). These core values and practices contribute to the sustainable environment and livelihood of the Rukai community. This study proposes that positioning Indigenous TEK as the subjectivity of sustainability provides important implications for the sustainable management of natural resources, as well as Indigenous education for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

However, the diagnostic adequacy of FPCT needs to be corroborated prior to eliminating MDCT from stroke care pathways. CT perfusion (CTP) maps played an important role in assessing infarcted vs. hypoperfused cerebral tissue in the 6-24 hour time window in the DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FPCTP to identify infarcted vs. hypoperfused tissue using MDCTP as a reference.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold>\n            Between Oct. 19 and Nov. 21, 16 AIS patients at a tertiary urban hospital underwent FPCT and FPCTP. IRB approval and informed written consent was obtained. Ten patients underwent CTP in the ED. FPCTP was obtained using a Siemens Artis Q Biplane system. Data was post-processed on a separate prototype workstation, allowing visualization of ten 3D volumes in different phases of contrast enhancement (colored), and perfusion maps (CBF, CBV, MTT, TTP, T\n            <jats:sub>max</jats:sub>\n            , and TTD) (Figure 1).

The infarcted and hypoperfused regions identified on FPCTP qualitatively agree with the regions identified on MDCTP. The time between CTP and FPCTP scans was a mean of 1h 2min (± 34min, 40- 2h30min).

Based on the propagation principle of Gaussian beams and the coupling requirements, the coupling mechanism of the fiber coupler and the coupling mismatch between the coupler is analytically modeled. The model and the optical path are optimized, then the ray tracing is used to calculate the coupling efficiency of inter-coupler signals for different SMF. The coupling efficiency is evaluated through experiments in terms of coupling efficiency and the radial, axial, and angular mismatches between the couplers. The results showed that with a large Mode Field Diameter (MFD), better coupling efficiency can be obtained, i.e., a large MFD of 28 μm is tested with its maximal efficiency of 95.16%. Moreover, the angular mismatch has the most significant impact on the coupling efficiency, while the axial mismatch has the least. The use of large MFD can alleviate the angular mismatch and thus improve the optical coupling efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Temperature is the primary factor affecting the law of coal gas desorption. When the core method is used to measure the coal seam gas content (CSGS), the temperature of the coal core sample (CCS) will increase. The heat generated by the core bit cutting and rubbing the coal during coring is transferred to the CCS through the core tube, resulting in the temperature rising of the CCS. Because the CCS entering the core tube during coring is a dynamic process, the temperature of CCS is difficult to measure. To solve this problem, the temperatures of the core tube wall during coring in the Jiulishan coal mine (JLS), Guhanshan coal mine (GHS) and Zhaogu coal mine (ZG) at the core depth of 20 m were measured by the self-designed temperature measuring device. The thermodynamic models of the core bit and the core tube during coring were established. The reliability of the model was verified by comparing the numerical simulation results with the field measurement results. The verified model was used to predict the temperature changes of the core tube wall during coring in different strength coal seams and different core depths. The results show that the temperature change of the core tube wall was divided into a slowly temperature rising stage Ⅰ, a fast temperature rising stage Ⅱ and a slowly temperature rising and slowly temperature falling stage Ⅲ, which correspond to the process of pushing the core tube, drilling the CCS and early stage and later stage of withdrawing the core tube, respectively. The maximum temperature of the core tube wall appears in the first 3 min of withdrawing the core tube, and increases with the core depth increasing. The temperature of the measuring point at the end of drilling the CCS and the maximum temperature during coring linearly increase with the core depth. The temperature heating rate of the core tube is negatively linear, with the coal seam strength during pushing the core tube wall process. However, the temperature heating rate of the core tube wall is positively linear with the coal seam strength during drilling the CCS process. This study can provide a basis for further research on the dynamic distribution characteristics of temperature in the CCS during coring, which is of profound significance to calculate the gas loss amount and CSGC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of nanoparticles has been investigated as a new cancer treatment. These can induce specific cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In particular, Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) have unique characteristics. The maximum absorption spectrum of AuNPs can be adjusted to modify their size or shape to absorb near-infrared light that can penetrate into tissue without photodamage. Thus, the combination of AuNPs and near-infrared light can be used to treat cancer in deep-seated organs. To obtain effective cancer-specific accumulation of AuNPs, we focused on porphyrin and synthesized a porphyrin-attached Au compound: Au-HpD. In this study, we investigated whether Au-HpD possesses cancer-specific accumulation and cytotoxicity. Intracellular Au-HpD accumulation was higher in cancer cells than in normal cells. In order to analyze the cytotoxicity induced by Au-HpD, cancer cells and normal cells were co-cultured in the presence of Au-HpD; then, they were subjected to 870 nm laser irradiation. We observed that, after laser irradiation, cancer cells showed significant morphological changes, such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation indicative of cell apoptosis. This strong effect was not observed when normal cells were irradiated. Moreover, cancer cells underwent cell apoptosis with combination therapy.</jats:p>"

In general, Debt‐to‐GDP ratio rose in all countries in the latter period. But the effects of total or primary fiscal deficits, inflation and real growth on the respective Debt‐to‐GDP ratio changes were different across countries in both periods. In the European Core, Ireland and the Anglo‐Saxon countries, successful countercyclical fiscal policies, tended to lower Debt‐to‐GDP ratio. However, in the other European Periphery countries and Japan, unsuccessful countercyclical policies, had the opposite effect. Since in the Euro Area (EA), monetary policy is common and fiscal policies were restricted by rules, this development suggests that differences in shock propagation mechanisms were important drivers of the observed differences in the behaviour of Debt‐to‐GDP ratio between the European Core and the EA Periphery, except Ireland. An implication of this result is that the recently announced EU transfers to the EA Periphery tied up to incentives to improve economic efficiency, seem to be the right policies to ameliorate the effects of the recession brought about by the various social distancing measures to fight the COVID‐19 pandemic, without increasing the Debt‐to‐GDP ratios of these countries.</jats:p>",

The mean fast anisotropy directions are mostly in ∼E–W and a few in the ∼NE–SW directions. The mean delay time decreases progressively from ∼1.0 s beneath the Sub Himalaya to ∼0.5 s at the Higher Himalaya. The observed seismic anisotropy suggests that the ongoing deformation beneath the Kumaun–Garhwal Himalaya has a large contribution by the relative rotation of the asthenospheric flow by the compression along the Indian Plate motion direction in this collision zone. Also, the southward transportation of the mid-crustal flow is probably responsible for the reduction in the delay times in the Main Central Thrust zone and further north than in the Sub-to-Lower Himalaya. The splitting parameters indicate a complex pattern of deformation beneath the Kumaun–Garhwal Himalaya with contribution from crust, lithospheric mantle and asthenospheric mantle.</jats:p>",

Um novorecurso de tratamento para essas crianças são os protocolos intensivos com o uso ou não devestimentas terapêuticas. Nestes protocolos, as vestimentas funcionam como uma órtesecorporal que permite a execução de movimentos e exercícios para os mais diversos objetivos,em conjunto com a aplicação de treinos intensos e específicos. O objetivo do presenteestudo foi analisar a diferença de ativação muscular, função motora grossa e oscilação docentro de gravidade de crianças com Paralisia Cerebral após um protocolo intensivo deexercícios terapêuticos. Trata-se de um estudo de 8 casos, sendo que os critérios de inclusãoforam ter idade entre 2 e 13 anos, diagnóstico de Paralisia Cerebral e classificação GrossMotor Function Classification System entre os níveis I e IV. A Gross Motor Function Measurefoi realizada por um profissional capacitado antes do primeiro e após o último protocolo. AEletromiografia de Superfície foi utilizada para analisar a ativação muscular dos músculosReto Abdominal, Oblíquos e Multífidos dos dois hemicorpos enquanto a criança permaneciasentada mantendo a postura durante 30 segundos pré e pós protocolo. Além disso, aPlataforma Estabilométrica foi utilizada para avaliar a oscilação postural com a criançasentada mantendo a posição por 30 segundos com os olhos abertos e 30 segundos com osolhos fechados, também antes do início do intensivo e após o último. No geral, as criançasapresentaram aumento em média na função motora grossa de 3,73% entre antes e após otreinamento; 25% dos pacientes apresentaram aumento de todas ou da maioria dasmusculaturas; 50% obtiverem uma maior aproximação das médias de Root Mean Squareassociados a uma redução de ativação em alguns dos 6 músculos avaliados. Em relação aocentro de gravidade, 37,5% dos pacientes reduziram a distância de oscilação com olhosabertos e 62,5% reduziram com os olhos fechados; 25% apresentaram aumento da distânciacom olhos abertos e com olhos fechados 37,5% e outros 25% não apresentaram resultadosrelevantes nas distâncias com olhos abertos. Quanto às oscilações látero laterais e ânteroposteriores, 25% reduziram e 12,5% aumentaram as oscilações látero laterais com os olhosabertos, 12,5% aumentaram e 37,5% reduziram oscilações ântero posteriores. Já com olhosfechados, 37,5% reduziram oscilações látero laterais e 25% reduziram oscilações ânteroposteriores. Novas pesquisas de caráter longitudinal, com número e características entre osparticipantes mais homogêneas, além da utilização de outras ferramentas podem colaborarpara aprofundar as análises obtidas. Conclui-se com o presente estudo que a realização deum protocolo intensivo de exercícios terapêuticos associados ou não ao uso de vestimentasterapêuticas favorece a melhora da função motora grossa, parece ser promissor na ativaçãomais equilibrada entre as musculaturas do core avaliadas e na diminuição da oscilação dotronco quando de olhos fechados.</jats:p>"

In this report, a conventional arrangement composed of a gas aggregation source (GAS) is employed to generate the core NPs, which are subsequently coated by the shell materials in a secondary planar magnetron sputtering. The important difference to the usual system is the application of the two opposing planar magnetrons in a closed field configuration. The prepared core Ag NPs by a GAS are coated/treated by the two magnetrons with Ti targets. Our findings clearly show that the shell thickness can be controlled by tuning the power delivered to the secondary magnetron plasma. Characterizations of the prepared films, by x-ray diffraction technique, disclose multi-crystalline cores covered by amorphous shells. Based on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements, different chemistry on the NPs surfaces and volume of the NPs can be achieved by tuning the operation conditions. Furthermore, the thermal annealing process leads to the growth of the crystallite size which results in emerging some microparticles caused by accelerating Ag surface mobility. The employed technique promises a reliable route to synthesize different heterogeneous NPs with stoichiometry tunable in a wide range for multi-functional devices.</jats:p>",

We show that the viability of the explosion is quite EOS dependent and that it best correlates with the early-time interior entropy density of the proto–neutron star. We check that this result is not progenitor dependent, although the lowest-mass progenitors show different explosion properties, due to the different pre-collapse nuclear composition. Larger central entropies also induce more vigorous proto–neutron star convection in our one-dimensional turbulence model, as well as a wider convective layer.</jats:p>",

Such effects are largely investigated by a nonlocal hydrodynamic model with additional boundary conditions, describing the collective motion of the free electron gas in metals. The study of a fluorophore in the presence of the nano core–shell topology is performed, by employing the following models: the hard‐wall hydrodynamic model and the generalized nonlocal optical response. The analysis is conducted by investigating the fluorescence rates of the system, while considering the fluorophore located inside and outside the nanoparticle. It is demonstrated that the rates generated by the above models may considerably differ from the ones obtained via the classical approach. The optimal fluorescence enhancements for different size and material parameters are found both inside and outside the studied topology.</jats:p>",

Shear properties of the FlexyFoam M-55, a closed-cell, lightweight PVC foam with an apparent density of 60 kg/m3, have been investigated according to the ASTM C273 standard, using the tensile and compressive loading of metal supporting plates glued to the PVC foam sample.

Displacement was measured using the testing machine sensors and compared to the measurements from the DIC technique. Specimen manufacturing details, surface preparation, and the gluing sequence were described, and measuring equipment and experiment settings were presented. Stress-strain curves have been presented and shear modulus and ultimate shear strength of the foam were compared for each test approach.

Within the glioma microenvironment an amoeboid microglial morphology has been observed, however the underlying causes and the related impact on microglia functions and their tumor promoting activities is unclear. Using the advantages of the larval zebrafish model, we identified the underlying mechanism and show that microglial morphology and functions are already impaired during glioma initiation stages. The presence of pre‐neoplastic HRasV12 expressing cells induces an amoeboid morphology of microglia, increases microglial numbers and decreases their motility and phagocytic activity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed lower expression levels of the actin nucleation promoting factor <jats:italic>wasla</jats:italic> in microglia. Importantly, a microglia specific rescue of <jats:italic>wasla</jats:italic> expression restores microglial morphology and functions. This results in increased phagocytosis of pre‐neoplastic cells and slows down tumor progression. In conclusion, we identified a mechanism that de‐activates core microglial functions within the emerging glioma microenvironment. Restoration of this mechanism might provide a way to impair glioma growth.</jats:p>",

The mode of action of Cry1 proteins is not completely understood but the existence of an activation step prior to specific binding is widely accepted. In this study, we attempted to characterize and determine the importance of the activation process in the mode of action of Cry1I, as Cry1Ia protoxin or its partially processed form showed significantly higher toxicity to <jats:italic>Ostrinia nubilalis</jats:italic> than the fully processed protein either activated with trypsin or with <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>nubilalis</jats:italic> midgut juice.

While no oligomerization of fully activated proteins after incubation with BBMV was detected.

Accordingly, the in vivo binding competition assays show a decrease in toxicity following the addition of an excess of 50 kDa activated protein. Consequently, as full activation of Cry1I protein diminishes its toxicity against lepidopterans, preventing or decelerating proteolysis might increase the efficacy of this protein in Bt-based products.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Key points</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>• <jats:italic>Processing Cry1I to a 50 kDa stable core impairs its full toxicity to O. nubilalis</jats:italic></jats:p>\n                <jats:p>• <jats:italic>Partially processed Cry1Ia protoxin retains the toxicity of protoxin vs O. nubilalis</jats:italic></jats:p>\n                <jats:p>• <jats:italic>Protoxin and its final processed forms compete for the same functional binding sites</jats:italic></jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

The ICFM of a PWR reactor consists on defining the best charging or recharging pattern of fuel assemblies inside a reactor for an operational cycle. This means, finding a suitable arrangement of fuel assemblies that optimizes the performance of the reactor, which complies with all safety criteria. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to select the arrangements that interact with the reactor physics simulation code, holding the neutron characteristics of each fuel assembly. Therefore, a reliable and fast code was developed accordingly. The consolidated technique of coarse mesh node code that numerically solves the multigroup diffusion equation for two groups of energy, fast and thermal neutrons, in two dimensions was selected. In this type of code, it is essential that each fuel assembly is homogenized and characterized by its macroscopic cross sections, for each reactor’s burnup condition. The cross sections are generated with the support of SCALE 6.0, computational platform developed by the Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division (RNSD), from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The completeness of the qualification and validation of the results obtained from the homogenization of the fuel assembly by the SCALE was performed comparing the results with actual data of a benchmark reactor. The fully documented Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-TECDOC-815, has been used as benchmark with successful results.</jats:p>"

This collapse happens quickly, on the dynamical time of the protoneutron star, ≲0.5 ms. During this collapse, barring any excessive rotation, the entire protoneutron star is accreted into the newly formed black hole. The main source of neutrinos is now removed and the signal abruptly shuts off over this formation timescale. However, while the source of neutrinos is turned off, the arrival times at an Earth-based detector will depend on the neutrino path. We show here that a modest amount of neutrinos, emitted just prior to the black hole forming, scatter on the infalling material into our line of sight and arrive after the formation of the black hole, up to 15 ms in our model. This neutrino echo, which we characterize with Monte Carlo simulations and analytic models, has a significantly higher average energy (upwards of ∼50 MeV) compared to the main neutrino signal, and for the canonical failed supernova explored here, is likely detectable in <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math>\n\n</jats:tex-math>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:mi mathvariant=\"italic\"></mml:mi>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"apjac4420ieqn1.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>(10 kT) supernova neutrino detectors for Galactic failed supernovae.

To utilize a squeezed vacuum, it is important to lock the phase of the local oscillator (LO) to the squeezed light. The coherent control sideband (CCSB) scheme has been established for the precise phase locking, while the previous CCSB scheme was designed for the squeezed vacuum generated with an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). Thus the previous CCSB scheme is not applicable to squeezing by a single-pass optical parametric amplifier (OPA), which is attractive for generating broadband squeezed vacuum states. In this study, we propose a variant of CCSB scheme, which is applicable to the squeezing by single-pass OPA. In this scheme, we inject pump light and frequency-shifted signal light into an OPA crystal in the same way as the previous CCSB scheme. The parametric process in the OPA crystal generates a squeezed vacuum, amplifies the signal light, generates an idler light, and causes the pump depletion reflecting the interference of the amplified signal light and the idler light. Through the lock-in detection of the pump depletion, we can phase-lock the injected signal light to the pump light. Then, after the heterodyne detection of the signal and the idler light, we get the error signal of LO and realize the precise phase locking of LO to the squeezed quadrature. We show the feasibility of the proposed scheme by deriving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the modulated pump signal. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed scheme on pulsed squeezing by a single-pass OPA.</jats:p>",

Acidizing of high temperature (HT) dolomitic reservoirs (290 °F/143 °C) in the maritime fields represents the primary stimulation option due to existing well parameters restricting treatment designs to matrix rate conditions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acidizing treatments are typically based on HCl and organic acids and for the first time a multifunctional, low viscosity, retarded HCl acid is also available. Laboratory wormhole tests were conducted for matrix injection but also in a pseudo-acid fracture condition (split-core) in order to establish feasibility for future stimulation designs. Three acid blends were used, a blend of organic acids (OA), a mixture of HCl and organic acid (HA), and a polymer free retarded HCl acid (HRMA).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The cores tested correspond to a particular well and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms it is &amp;gt;98% dolomite. CT imaging corroborates the heterogeneous permeability due to primary and secondary porosity systems (5% – 10% and 10% – 15%). The pore volume breakthrough of each acid blend was determined for two cores of similar porosity under same constant injection rate. Results indicate the organic acids blend (OA) can have better injectivity when flow rate is much higher than the HCl/Organic acid (HA) blend. A core with 10X lower permeability (0.1 – 0.5 mD) was tested with new Retarded HCl acid (HRMA) using same injection rate as the other acid blends. Results indicate that Retarded HCl (HRMA) does not cause core facial dissolution under unoptimized injection rate. The wormhole patterns generated for the HCl/Organic acid (HA) blend show good distribution and for Retarded HCl (HRMA) show enhance acid containment (less ramification). Both HCl acid blends (HA and HRMA) are suitable for dolomitic acidizing under different injection rates, while the purely organic acid blend is more adequate for high rate injection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Notably acidizing of dolomitic reservoirs can be highly efficient under optimized conditions and future work with non-retarded and retarded acids can systematically drive pumping engineering designs.

The role of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as reinforcing nanoparticles dispersed in the polymer matrix was thoroughly investigated. Quasi-static nanoindentation analysis was enriched by performance of accelerated property mapping and nanodynamic mechanical testing in order to fully describe the nanoscale surface homogeneity and stress relaxation behavior of the nanocomposite specimens. That novelty of the research approach had a well-marked contribution over the detection of the new samples’ nanomechanical features as a function of the type of carbon nanofiller.

Religiosity is often confounded with ethnicity, but it varies even within ethnicities and religious denominations. It is also seldom observed in administrative data. This paper exploits a setting that avoids these limitations. We analyse grading decisions in national matriculation exams in Israel, exploiting unique features that reveal student religiosity to the graders, and grader religiosity to the researcher. We find evidence of in-group bias between religious and non-religious groups, but in our setting this effect is very small. There seem to be two main reasons. First, religious in-group bias is limited to male graders only. Moreover, patterns of bunching in the grade distribution suggest the bias is primarily due to the religious—rather than secular—men. This is a small fraction of the grader population. A second potential reason is that many graders live in integrated communities. Our evidence suggests that living and working in close proximity to people with different levels of religiosity attenuates discrimination.</jats:p>",

The structural and physicochemical properties of Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDAX, TEM, FTIR and TGA. From the TEM analysis, the morphology of Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 was found as 100–300 nm. In TGA, the first weight loss was noticed between 373 and 573 K, the second was between 673 and 773 K and the final weight loss took place above 773 K. Batch experimental tests, such as pH, dosage of Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2, Cd(II) ion concentration, temperature as well as interaction time, were conducted and evaluated. Experimental study data were used for the non-linear forms exhibited by isotherms and kinetics of the sorption procedure. The equilibrium adsorption observations were adequately combined with pseudo-first-order kinetics as well as Freundlich isotherm. Monolayer maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 40.02 mg/g, recorded at pH 6 with an interaction time of 30 min, temperature of 303 K and sorbent dose of 2.0 g/L. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption process was an exothermic, spontaneous reaction (−∆oo = −15.46–7.81 (kJ/mol)). The as-synthesized sorbent had excellent recyclability, and its adsorption efficiency was maintained after five cycles of reuse. The findings of the study exhibited the magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-nanoparticle as an alternative effective adsorbent in eradicating Cd(II) ions from aqueous solution.</jats:p>"

Current treatment guidelines recommend that pleomorphic LCIS should be treated as a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This is because of the high upgrade rate to DCIS or invasive carcinoma. Classic LCIS, on the contrary, has a low upgrade rate. Active surveillance, such as an annual mammogram, is sufficient. Widely divergent upgrade rates have been published for both classic and pleomorphic LCIS, probably due to selection bias and the limited number of patients included in each study. We report a population based study in patients with a biopsy-based diagnosis of LCIS. Methods In this retrospective nationwide cohort study, patients with a primary diagnosis of LCIS in the period from 2011 to 2020 were identified. Patients with a concurrent high-risk lesion or with a history of a high-risk lesion in the same breast were excluded. Data were received from the Dutch Pathology Registry. In addition to classic LCIS and pleomorphic LCIS, there was a residual group of non-classical LCIS. Results 1185 biopsies from 1183 patients were included in the study. All patients were female. In two patients, the LCIS was bilateral. 1024 biopsies contained classic LCIS, 130 pleomorphic LCIS, and 31 non-classic LCIS. The mean age was 54.7 years for classic LCIS, 60.8 for pleomorphic LCIS, and 60.6 for non-classic LCIS. Of the classic LCIS patients 18.4% underwent surgery. This was 83.1% for pleomorphic LCIS and 83,9% for non-classic LCIS. Of the classic LCIS , 34.0 % had an upgrade to invasive carcinoma or DCIS. This was 31.5 % for pleomorphic LCIS and 30.8 % for non-classic LCIS. A high incidence of invasive lobular cancer (ILC) was found with the invasive cancers being predominantly ER positive and HER2 negative (table). Conclusions Between 2011 and 2020, the incidence of biopsies with LCIS was 119 per year (For comparison, the annual incidence of DCIS biopsies is approximately 2500 per year). Of all biopsies, approximately 11 % were pleomorphic LCIS. Approximately 2.5 % of all biopsies were non-classic LCIS. The upgrade rate for classic LCIS, pleomorphic LCIS, and non-classic LCIS was comparable, however the operation rates were not comparable. In contrast to pleomorphic and non-classic LCIS, only selected cases of classic LCIS were followed up with surgical operation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Surgical outcomeClassic LCISPleomorphic LCISNon-classic LCISTotalP-valueN=188N=108N=26N=322Mean Age (SD)54.4 (9.3)60.6 (8.6)60.4 (6.8)57.0 (9.3)Type surgery N (%)0.269Lumpectomy158 (84.0)83 (76.9)23 (88.5)264 (82.0)Ablation30 (16.0)25 (23.1)3 (11.5)58 (18.0)Upgraded N (%)0.915Yes64 (34.0)34 (31.5)8 (30.8)106 (32.9)No124 (66.0)74 (68.5)18 (69.2)216 (67.1)Type upgrade N0.815DCIS187126classic ILC3623564Pleomorphic ILC0101Invasive carcinoma NST82212Tubular carcinoma1101Papillary carcinoma1001</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Pieter J Westenend, Crystal Kerkhoven, Claudia JC Meurs, Sabine Siesling.

The viscosity experiments showed that gum Arabic had the lowest viscosity at 15% wt. Xanthan gum and guar gum had significantly higher viscosities than gum Arabic at corresponding weight percentages. At the same weight of 0.5%, xanthan, guar, and Arabic gums recorded a 63%, 53%, and 46% oil recovery, respectively. Due to the limitations surrounding core flooding experiments such as human error, equipment failure, and measurement of oil recoveries, it is necessary to validate the results obtained with other methods such as reservoir simulation. A reservoir model is built (using Eclipse) and incorporated with polymer and viscosity functions measured in the lab to validate results from the core flooding experiments. Peak oil recovery of 9.96%, 9.95%, and 9.90% was recorded for xanthan, guar, and Arabic gum, respectively, at a weight percentage of 0.5% weight. Also, increasing the wt% of injected polymers increases oil recovery. Results also indicate that the trend of oil recoveries during core flooding follows that observed during reservoir simulation and oil production increased as percentage weight increased for all the polymer cases considered.</jats:p>",

This effect was partially mediated by activation of apoptosis along with activation of caspases regulated chiefly by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Knockdown of the ClpP protease or ectopic expression of a ClpP D190A mutant substantially rescued from the inhibition of oxidative energy metabolism as well as from the reduction of cellular viability by ClpP activators and the combination treatment, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of core geometry constraints of hydrogenase H-cluster analogues on reduction chemistry have been explored by a combination of structural, electrochemical and IR spectroelectrochemical (IR-SEC) studies. A series of phosphido-bridged diiron hexacarbonyl complexes, Fe2(µ2-PPh2(CH2)xPPh2)(CO)6, x = 2 (2P) and 4 (4P) and previously reported with x = 3 (3P) and the unlinked bis-diphenylphosphido (DP) analogues were investigated. The X-ray structures of the neutral complexes demonstrate the effect of the linking group on the Fe2P2 core geometry with P–Fe–Fe–P torsion angles of 95 (2P), 101 (3P), 108 (4P) and 109° (DP) and a twisting of the Fe(CO)3 fragments from an eclipsed geometry (2P, 3P and DP) for 4P. For all four compounds the primary reduction process involves two close-spaced one-electron reactions (E1 and E2) with a systematic trend to more negative reduction potentials with a shorter link between the bridging phosphorus atoms. This reflects the greater constraint that the bridging group places on the adoption of a planar 2Fe2P geometry. The sensitivity of the core geometry is greater for E2 than E1 and this impacts the stability of the monoanion with respect to disproportion (Kdisp(298 K) = 0.02 (2P), 2.4 (3P) and 3540 (4P and DP)). 4P has a stable dianion and gives reversible cyclic voltammetry at 298 K and is quasi-reversible at 253 K, whereas the response of 2P is irreversible at 298 K, with two distinct daughter products, but becomes quasi-reversible at 253 K. IR-SEC measurements enabled elucidation of the spectra and time evolution of the reduction products. These results are consistent with a bimolecular reaction giving a distinct reduced product modelled as a dimeric, 4Fe species. The sensitivity of the reduction chemistry of the bridged diiron compounds underpins their utility as catalytic proton reduction catalysts and the systematic trends delineated in this investigation provide the framework for charting the path of their redox-coupled chemical reactions.</jats:p>"

However, because of their isotropic deformability, they often require complex molding equipment for shaping. A polymeric origami structure that follows predetermined deformed and non‐deformed patterns at specific temperatures without molding is demonstrated. It is constructed with a heterogeneous (dynamic and static) network topology via light‐induced programming. The corresponding spatio‐selective thermal plasticity creates varied deformability within a single polymer. The kinematics of site‐specific deformation allows guided origami deployment in response to external forces. Moreover, the self‐locking origami can fix its geometry in specific states without pressurization. These features enable the development of shape‐reconfigurable structures that undergo on‐demand geometry changes without requiring bulky or heavy equipment. The concept enriches polymer origamis, and could be applied with other polymers having similar chemistries. Overall, it is a versatile material for artificial muscles, origami robotics, and non‐volatile mechanical memory devices.</jats:p>",

However, few roles of lncRNA in the reproductive process of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) have been defined, especially in the regulatory mechanism of sterile triploids gametogenesis. To uncover the potential role of lncRNA, the gonads of diploids, sterile triploids, and partially sterile triploids underwent RNA sequencing. A total of 9618 reliable lncRNAs were identified. The target relationship between lncRNA and mRNA was predicted based on cis, trans, and antisense regulation with bioinformatic software. We chose differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs when sterile triploids were compared to partially sterile triploids and diploids for subsequent functional enrichment analysis. Findings revealed that trans-regulatory lncRNAs might play a significant role in the gametogenesis of C. gigas. Combining pathway results, we constructed core networks of lncRNAs–mRNAs for triploid sterile females and hermaphrodites. Fifty-four genes related to cell division, germline-cell maintenance, and glycogen metabolism were found to be associated with sterility. A total of 28 candidate lncRNAs were predicted to trans-regulate these genes. We speculated that MSTRG.79882.3 and MSTRG.79882.4 for triploid sterile females and MSTRG.33704.1, MSTRG.63844.1, and MSTRG.5675.1 for hermaphrodites were highly important as they were predicted to regulate more sterility-specific genes than others.

Gc is a prominent threat to human health by causing severe and lifelong clinical sequelae, including infertility and chronic pelvic pain, which is amplified by the emergence of “superbug” strains that are resistant to all current antibiotics. Gc is highly adapted to colonize human mucosal surfaces, where it survives despite initiating a robust inflammatory response and influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) that typically clear bacteria. Here, dual-species RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to define Gc and PMN transcriptional profiles alone and after infection. Three strains of Gc and three human donors’ transcriptional responses were assessed to characterize core host and bacterial responses. Comparative analysis of Gc transcripts revealed major overlap between the Gc response to PMNs, iron, and hydrogen peroxide; specifically, the TonB system and TonB dependent transporters (TDT) were upregulated in response to PMNs. We experimentally confirmed that induction of the iron-dependent TDT TbpB is responsive to the presence of PMNs and that<jats:italic>tonB</jats:italic>is required for Gc survival from PMNs. Pathway analysis of PMN transcripts induced by Gc infection revealed differential expression of genes driving pathways involved in cell adhesion and migration, inflammatory responses, and inflammation resolution. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B and IL8, the adhesion factor ICAM1, and the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin PGE2 was confirmed to be induced in PMNs in response to Gc. Together, this study represents a comprehensive and experimentally validated dual-species transcriptomic analysis of three isolates of Gc and primary human PMNs that gives insight into how this bacterium survives innate immune onslaught to cause disease in humans.</jats:p>"

Triple Negative Breast Cancers(TNBCs) typically have high rates of CIN, and this contributes to disease aggressiveness andpoor patient outcomes. While basal levels of CIN contribute to cancer progression, CIN can beelevated to intolerable levels to induce mitotic catastrophe or cell death that occurs during, orimmediately following, mitosis. Discovering proteins necessary for cells to maintain basal levelsof CIN that can then be leveraged to induce mitotic catastrophe should reveal vulnerabilities thatare therapeutically targetable. In this regard, we have identified Structural Maintenance ofChromosomes 2 (SMC2) as a modulator of CIN in TNBC. SMC2 is a core member of condensin,a complex which is largely known for its role in maintaining chromosome architecture. SMC2 hasalso recently been implicated in the regulation of transcription, suggesting that this enzyme maylie at the interface of transcription and chromatin configuration. We hypothesize that TNBC cellsrely on SMC2 to control CIN through two routes: chromatin organization and transcription ofoncogenes and cell identity genes. To begin to test this hypothesis, we assessed the impact ofSMC2 silencing on TNBC cell growth in multiple cell lines. While reducing SMC2 levels initiallyincreases proliferation, SMC2 is required for long term TNBC cell viability and proper progressionthrough the cell cycle. Shortly following SMC2 suppression, TNBC cells display an increase inCIN phenotypes including multinucleation, micronucleation, and dysmorphic nucleation, as wellas DNA double strand breaks. These defects accumulate to an excessive level that ultimatelyinduces cell death. Notably, SMC2 is overexpressed in a subset of TNBC patient tumors and thisoverexpression is associated with an increased number of mutations, copy number alterations,and aneuploidy, as well as worse patient outcomes. Together, these results indicate that SMC2regulates CIN in TNBC. Given its function as an ATPase, we conclude that SMC2 is a potentialtarget for therapeutic development for the treatment of TNBC, a disease with limited therapeuticoptions. Current studies are focused on discovering the mechanisms by which SMC2 regulatesCIN in TNBC.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Jessica Ventura, Bryan Webb, Ruth Keri.

Using I-SceI, we previously developed a transgenic Xenopus tropicalis line expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by the neural crest-specific snai2 promoter/enhancer, which is a powerful tool for studying neural crest development and craniofacial morphogenesis. Here, we carried out whole-genome shotgun sequencing for the snai2:eGFP embryos to identify the transgene integration sites. With a 19x sequencing coverage, we estimated that 6 copies of the transgene were inserted into the Xenopus tropicalis genome in the hemizygous transgenic embryos. Two transgene integration loci adjacent to each other were identified in a noncoding region on chromosome 1, possibly as a result of duplication after a single transgene insertion. Interestingly, genomic DNA at the boundaries of the transgene integration loci contains short sequences homologous to the I-SceI recognition site, suggesting that the integration was not random but probably mediated by sequence homology. To our knowledge, our work represents the first genome-wide sequencing study on a transgenic organism generated with I-SceI, which is useful for evaluating the potential genetic effects of I-SceI-mediated transgenesis and further understanding the mechanisms underlying this transgenic method.</jats:p>",

This paper introduces the process of the deepened rigidity in WS Co. Company, which occurs due to the wrong cognition of Dr. S and his teams who managed or failed to respond to the rigidity encountered by the company during different periods. The rigidity of its capacity is believed to be caused by the cognitive errors of the entrepreneur and his team facing every period of potential rigidity, which makes them fail to deal with it (or choose the wrong methods), thus leading to complete rigidity. This paper intends to explain how rigidity takes shape from the cognitive aspect of senior managers, which may serve as illuminations for the similar enterprises led by entrepreneurs.</jats:p>"

The three cores are all intermediate-depth cores, in the 133–141 m depth range. Non-sea-salt sulfate ([nssSO42−]) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) display marked seasonal variability suitable for annual-layer counting. The Palmer ice core covers 390 years, 1621–2011 C.E., and is one of the oldest AP cores. Rendezvous and Jurassic are lower elevation high-snow accumulation sites and therefore cover shorter intervals, 1843–2011 C.E. and 1874–2011 C.E., respectively. The age scales show good agreement with known volcanic age horizons. The three chronologies’ start and end dates of volcanic events are compared to the volcanic events in the published WAIS Divide core. The age difference for the Palmer age scale is ±6 months, Rendezvous ±9 months, and Jurassic ±7 months. Our results demonstrate the advantage of dating several cores from the same region at the same time. Additional confidence can be gained in the age scales by evaluating and finding synchronicity of [nssSO42−] peaks amongst the sites.</jats:p>"

We sought to investigate associations between home visitor well‐being indicated by professional quality of life (i.e., burnout, secondary traumatic stress, compassion satisfaction) and a workplace policy providing RS, consistent experience of core components of a reflective supervisory relationship, and engagement in endorsement. We also examined differences in consistently experiencing core components of the reflective supervisory relationship in home visitors who reported having a workplace policy for providing RS and those who did not, and for home visitors engaged or not engaged in the endorsement process. A Workplace Supports Survey was designed to investigate these associations; we report findings from a sample of home visitor respondents (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 139).  A policy to provide RS was not associated with professional quality of life. However, analyses suggest an association between a policy to provide RS and consistently experiencing core components of a reflective supervisory relationship.

A nonuniform RM (RM‐MS) is proposed with the dual nonuniform distributions of mass and subsystem stiffness corresponding to those of the nonuniform FSM (FSM‐MS). The dynamic properties of the RM‐MS are semianalytically solved with the general solution for the free vibration of the nonuniform flexural beam and the rotational stiffness matrix of outriggers. The relation between the FSM‐MS and RM‐MS is established based on the first two vibration periods and nonlinear fitting and extended to present a subsystem stiffness estimation strategy with target maximum interstory drift ratios (<jats:italic>IDR</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) and overturning moment distribution ratios (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>M,B</jats:sub>). The feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy are fully demonstrated by three cases with different target<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>M,B</jats:sub>.

With the target<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>M,B</jats:sub>beyond the feasible range, it is necessary to adjust the first two vibration periods estimated by FSM‐MS.

This paper introduces the Multi-core Resource Stress and Sensitivity (MRSS) task model that characterizes how much stress each task places on resources and how much it is sensitive to such resource stress. This model facilitates a separation of concerns, thus retaining the advantages of the traditional two-step approach to timing verification (i.e. timing analysis followed by schedulability analysis). Response time analysis is derived for the MRSS task model, providing efficient context-dependent and context independent schedulability tests for both fixed priority preemptive and fixed priority non-preemptive scheduling. Dominance relations are derived between the tests, along with complexity results, and proofs of optimal priority assignment policies. The MRSS task model is underpinned by a proof-of-concept industrial case study. The problem of task allocation is considered in the context of the MRSS task model, with Simulated Annealing shown to provide an effective solution.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to compare the effects of pain neuroscience education (PNE) followed by motor control exercises (MCEs) with core stability training (CST) on pain, disability, and balance in women with CLBP. Methods: Thirty-seven women with CLBP were randomly divided into two groups of PNE/MCE (n = 18, 55.2 ± 2.6 years) or CST (n = 19, 54.6 ± 2.4 years). Eight weeks of PNE/MCE or CST were prescribed for each group, independently. Pain intensity (VAS scale), disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), unipodal static balance, and dynamic balance (time up and go test) were measured at the beginning and 8 weeks after the intervention. Two-way mixed ANOVA was used to analyze the results with alpha of 5%. Results: After 8 weeks, there was a significant difference in VAS scale between groups (p = 0.024), with both PNE/MCE and CST showing 58% and 42% reductions, respectively. There were no differences for all other variables between groups. Regarding pre- to post-comparisons, both groups showed improvements in all dependent variables (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The treatment with PNE/MCE was more effective in improving pain disability and unipodal static and dynamic balance than treatment with CST. Even so, both treatments were shown to be valid and safe in improving all dependent variables analyzed in women with CLBP.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Background: All initial therapeutic decisions in early breast cancer are commonly based on the expression profiles of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptors. However, breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, and receptor changes were manifold reported during progression. Only little data is known about receptor changes after upfront therapy. Here, we compared receptor expression profiles between core needle biopsy (CNB) tissue and primary tumor tissue after different treatment regimes. Methods: In a German single center study, we retrospectively analyzed 248 breast cancer patients during primary treatment regime between 2014 and 2020. Patients had either neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or no upfront therapy. Tumor material was obtained by core needle biopsy (CNB) at primary diagnosis and during primary oncological surgery of the axilla and breast. Analysis of histological subtype, grading, Ki67 index and expression profiling of ER, PR, HER2, was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Immunohistochemical examination was performed according to the ASCO/CAP guidelines using the Ventana-platform. Tumors were grouped into different intrinsic subtypes according to the international St. Gallen classification in either Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched or triple negative. 35 patients were excluded because the intrinsic subtype was not specified in the CNB and final postoperative specimen, therefore 213 patients were included in the primary analysis. Results: In the primary analysis (n=213), median age was 53 years (IQR 43 - 64). Based on the initial CNB receptor profile 105 (49%) patients had a Luminal A carcinoma, 46 (22%) patients had a Luminal B HER2 negative carcinoma, 22 (10%) patients had a Luminal B HER2 positive carcinoma, 6 (3%) patients had a HER2 enriched carcinoma and 33 (16%) patients had a triple negative carcinoma. In the primary analysis 84 (39%) patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 48 (23%) patients had neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and 81 (38%) patients had no upfront therapy. Overall, 77 (36%) patients had an intrinsic subtype change between CNB and definitive surgical treatment, 139 (64 %) patients had no subtype change. There were 44 (52%) changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 17 (35%) changes after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and 16 (20%) subtype changes after no upfront therapy (p&amp;lt;0.0001 for the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy). ER receptor status changed in 5 (6%) patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 6 (13%) changes were observed after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and 2 (2%) ER changes occurred after no upfront therapy. Concerning the PR receptor there were 23 (27%) receptor changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 17 (35%) changes after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and 9 (11%) changes after no upfront therapy (p&amp;lt;0.0001 for the effect of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy). Regarding the HER2 receptor, there were 18 (21%) receptor status changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 2 (4%) changes after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and 2 (2%) subtype changes after no upfront therapy (p=0.0001 for the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy).Neoadjuvant chemotherapy led significantly more often to a decrease of HER2 expression, compared to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or no upfront therapy. Conclusions: Our results imply the high frequency of intrinsic subtype changes after neoadjuvant therapy. Subtype changes should be taken into account for an optimal and individual treatment. Further research needs to be conducted to investigate whether an individual treatment decision based on the receptor profile after primary treatment might improve clinical outcome of breast cancer patients.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Laura Weydandt, Anne Kreklau, Ivonne Nel, Lars-Christian Horn, Bahriye Aktas.

Tracking outbreaks of disease and analysing the movement of the virus often involves sequencing part or all of the genome and comparing the sequence obtained with sequences from other outbreaks, obtained from the public databases. However, there are a very large number (&gt;1800) of PPRV sequences in the databases, a large majority of them relatively short, and not always well-documented. There is also a strong bias in the composition of the dataset, with countries with good sequencing capabilities (e.g. China, India, Turkey) being overrepresented, and most sequences coming from isolates in the last 20 years. In order to facilitate future analyses, we have prepared sets of PPRV sequences, sets which have been filtered for sequencing errors and unnecessary duplicates, and for which date and location information has been obtained, either from the database entry or from other published sources. These sequence datasets are freely available for download, and include smaller datasets which maximise phylogenetic information from the minimum number of sequences, and which will be useful for simple lineage identification. Their utility is illustrated by uploading the data to the MicroReact platform to allow simultaneous viewing of lineage date and geographic information on all the viruses for which we have information. While preparing these datasets, we identified a significant number of public database entries which contain clear errors, and propose guidelines on checking new sequences and completing metadata before submission.</jats:p>"

Thiolated polyethylenimine (PEI-SH) is complexed with DNA through electrostatic interactions to form the core, and glycol chitosan-modified with succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (GCS-PDP) is grafted on the surface through a thiolate-disulfide interchange reaction to form the shell. The resulting nanoparticles, GCS-PDP/PEI-SH/DNA nanoparticles (GNPs), exhibit high colloid stability in a simulated physiological environment and redox-responsive DNA release. GNPs not only show a high and redox-responsive cellular uptake, high transfection efficiency, and low cytotoxicity in vitro, but also exhibit selective tumor targeting, with minimal toxicity, in vivo, upon systemic administration. Such a performance positions GNPs as viable candidates for molecular-genetic imaging and theranostic applications.</jats:p>"

Global SARS-CoV-2 variant outbreaks have highlighted the need for a test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants with high sensitivity and a low limit of detection. This study aimed to develop and evaluate, both analytically and clinically, an antigen rapid diagnostic test (the KestrelTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test) for professional use. A lateral flow immunoassay-based diagnostic test kit was developed, and various aspects of its analytical performance were evaluated. This test kit was clinically evaluated by two independent laboratories and showed closely related results of 96.49% and 98.33% of sensitivity, 100% and 100% of specificity, and 99.01% and 99.44% of accuracy, respectively. A limit of detection was observed at values as low as 0.156 ng/mL for recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Moreover, the test kit successfully detected the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) of wild-type, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Epsilon-, Kappa-, and Omicron-variants as positive results. Therefore, the KestrelTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test may have potential use for effective COVID-19 screening, surveillance, and infection control in a variety of global SARS-CoV-2 variant outbreaks.</jats:p>"

We find that deletion of the bulk of the N-terminal tail, up to residue 98, yields amyloid fibrils with native-like huPrP23-144 core structure. Interestingly, deletion of additional flexible residues in the stretch 99–106 located outside of the amyloid core yields shorter heterogenous fibrils with fingerprint NMR spectra that are clearly distinct from those for full-length huPrP23-144, suggestive of the onset of perturbations to the native structure and degree of molecular ordering for the core residues. For the deletion variant missing residues 99–106 we show that native huPrP23-144 core structure can be “restored” by seeding the fibril growth with preformed full-length huPrP23-144 fibrils.</jats:p>"

By analyzing mutants lacking both CENP-T-Mis12C and CENP-C-Mis12C interactions, we demonstrated that Knl1C and Mis12C (KM) play critical roles in the cohesion of sister chromatids or the recruitment of spindle checkpoint proteins onto kinetochores. Two copies of Ndc80C (N-N) exist on CENP-T via Mis12C or direct binding. Analyses of cells specifically lacking the Mis12C-Ndc80C interaction revealed that N-N is needed for proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions. However, using artificial engineering to directly bind the two copies of Ndc80C to CENP-T, we demonstrated that N-N functions without direct Mis12C binding to Ndc80C in native kinetochores. This study demonstrated the mechanisms by which complicated networks play roles in native kinetochores.</jats:p>"

The coupled hygro-elastic and thermo-elastic relations for the SLCS shells/panels are formulated using first-order shear deformation theory. The nonmechanical stiffness matrices are represented by the initial stress stiffness matrix developed using nonlinear strain–displacement relations. The temperature and moisture-dependent material properties are considered to analyze the laminated composite sandwich spherical, hyperbolic, ellipsoid, cylindrical Shells, and flat plates. Several numerical examples are comprehensively studied to establish the influence of temperature, moisture, the volume fraction of carbon nanotubes in the core material, functional gradation types, skew angle, and edge constraints on the vibration responses of SLCS shells. Further exploration is devoted to studying the combined effect of moisture, temperature, and the geometrical parameters such as length to width ratio, length to thickness ratio, radius-to-length ratio, and the core thickness to face sheet thickness ratios on the natural frequency of the skew laminated composite sandwich panels. </jats:p>",

The abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) technique has been found mainly to activate deep trunk muscles. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether 5 weeks of training of deep trunk muscles using the ADIM technique could improve stature recovery, delay trunk muscle fatigue, and decrease pain intensity during prolonged sitting. Thirty participants with chronic low back pain (CLBP) conducted a core stabilization exercise (CSE) with the ADIM technique for 5 weeks. Participants were required to sit for 41 min before and after the exercise intervention. Stature change was measured using a seated stadiometer with a resolution of ±0.006 mm. During sitting, the stature change, pain intensity, and trunk muscle fatigue were recorded. A comparison between measurements at baseline and after 5 weeks of training demonstrated: (i) stature recovery and pain intensity significantly improved throughout the 41 min sitting condition; (ii) the bilaterally trunk muscle showed significantly decreased fatigue. The CSE with the ADIM technique was shown to provide a protective effect on detrimental reductions in stature change and trunk muscle fatigue during prolonged sitting in young participants under controlled conditions in a laboratory. This information may help to prevent the risk of LBP from prolonged sitting activities in real life situations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) involves model‐based estimation of metabolic reaction rates (i.e., fluxes) and, in some cases, metabolite content (i.e., pool sizes) from experimental measurements. Applying MFA to biological data helps determine the fate of substrates and the activity of specific pathways within metabolic networks. However, reliably estimating fluxes by using simplified “core” models to predict the dynamics of larger metabolic networks remains a challenge. One point of uncertainty relates to the advantages and potential pitfalls of including pool size measurements as experimental inputs for isotopically nonstationary MFA (INST‐MFA). Here, we directly assessed the role of pool sizes using various core models and simulated datasets. To investigate the effects of pool size measurements on INST‐MFA, we assessed the accuracy and precision of flux estimates obtained using different subsets of data (e.g., with or without pool size measurements) and simple network models that either matched or differed from the true network. The inclusion of pool size measurements provided incremental improvements to the precision of the flux estimates. However, adding pool size measurements increased the sensitivity of the flux solution to unmodeled reactions outside the core network. These results were confirmed using a large <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> model that is representative of realistic metabolic networks examined in MFA studies. Our findings indicate that accurate flux estimates can be obtained in the absence of pool size measurements, even when using core models that lack full network coverage. Addition of pool size measurements to INST‐MFA datasets may reveal the activity of non‐core reactions that influence the labeling dynamics and therefore necessitate network expansion in order to reconcile all available data to the model. Our findings also emphasize the key role that goodness‐of‐fit testing plays in assessing the quality of model fits obtained with INST‐MFA.</jats:p>",

Phenotyping of the SBP was carried out over two seasons based on 14 quantitative pod dimension traits along with three qualitative traits: pod color, seed coat color, and growth habit. Phenotypes were grouped into 54 classes using a hierarchical method, and a Core-SBP with one line per phenotype class was established. A further field-based evaluation of the Core-SBP revealed higher diversity index values than those obtained for the SBP. The Core-SBP was also genotyped using 24 breeder-friendly DNA markers tagging 21 genomic regions previously associated with pod trait control. Significant marker-trait associations were found for 11 of the 21 analyzed regions as well as the locus fin. The established Core-SBP was a first attempt to classify snap bean cultivars based on pod morphology and constituted a valuable source of characteristics for future breeding programs and genetic analysis.</jats:p>"

Polymerization of HDDA and NOA 81 started after exposure to UVA light for 5 s and was completed within a minute, as confirmed by continuous FT‐IR. Corrosive aqueous solutions of tetraethylenepentamine and diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid were encapsulated with 100% efficiency into poly(HDDA) and cured NOA81 shells without any leakage during prolonged storage. Poly(HDDA) shells were mechanically more stable than cured NOA81 and PDMS shells and resistant to drying‐induced shell buckling. NOA81 and PDMS capsules underwent morphological changes during freeze drying leading to the formation of dimpled and crescent‐moon‐shaped particles, respectively. The storage stability in a hypotonic solution and buckling resistance of PDMS shells were significantly improved by embedding carbon‐based nanomaterials into PDMS matrix. The incorporation of 0.5 wt% multi‐walled carbon nanotubes into PDMS matrix led to an increase in a Shore A hardness from 1.6 to 2.3.

The classical non-adhesive elastic contact theory and Hunter's relationship were used to determine the normal contact pressure distribution in terms of time and distance of the contact location. Moreover, Hamilton's principle and Maxwell's static equation were used to obtain the nineteen equations of motion. The numerical code was written to solve these nonlinear equations and the stress components in each layer were calculated in terms of time. In addition, it was assumed that the out-of-shell displacement of the sector at each layer is a quadratic polynomial function of the radial component in addition to a function of the coordinate components within the shell. Due to this assumption, the normal out-of-shell strain is not only zero, or not even a constant, but it changes in the form of a linear function along with the thickness of each layer. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Whereas the COVID-19 disease pathophysiology is under investigation, it is important to identify the pathways of viral transmission and inflammation from the pre-illness to the disease-onset stages. We analyzed five lung lobes from a patient with COVID-19 who finally died after prolonged lung protective ventilation. Pathological examination revealed moderate inflammation in upper lung lobes and uneven yet severe inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage in lower lung lobes. SARS-CoV-2 was detected at higher levels not in severely, but rather moderately inflamed middle lung lobes, and immunohistochemistry and bulk RNA-sequencing results showed that immune cells were detected at higher levels in lower lung lobes. The mRNA expression of cytokine families varied. We found an increase in keratin 5- or aquaporin 3-expressing basal cells in the severely inflamed lower lung lobes, and the alveolar stromal tissues were filled with them. Thus, this analysis of lung samples from a patient helps to determine the COVID-19 pathophysiology at a specific time point, and the virus localization and inflammatory responses at each site of the lungs provide various important indications.</jats:p>"

Electronic databases were searched for qualitative studies delivering strength-based technology-driven interventions to youth on the spectrum. Ten of the 874 studies identified met the criteria. Qualitative analysis revealed three core elements of strength-based technology programs for this population: mutual respect, demonstrating skills, and interests. The findings underpin the design of future strength-based technology programs for youth with ASD.</jats:p>",

An in-house mode-matched AR-HCF was fusion-spliced to a commercial multimode LMA-YDF, ensuring efficient fundamental mode coupling. The AR-HCF inflicts a high propagation loss selectively on higher-order modes, facilitating fundamental mode operation. Thus, the AR-HCF works as an efficient spatial mode filter embedded in the multimode fiber laser cavity and reinforces preferential amplification of the fundamental mode. Beam quality factor enhancement was achieved from M<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 2.09 to 1.39 at an output power of 57.7 W (pump-power limited). The beam quality can be further improved by refining the AR-HCF fabrication. The proposed technique has a great potential to be exploited in other multimode fiber laser cavities involving erbium- or thulium-doped fibers and obviates the need for complicated specialty active fiber designs. Compared with the commonly used fiber bending technique, our method can achieve an efficient higher-order mode suppression without inducing mode-field deterioration.</jats:p>",

The FNA and CNB slides were interpreted according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology and updated practice guidelines for thyroid CNB, respectively.Results: Compared to FNA, CNB showed lower rates of inconclusive results: categories I (2.8% vs. 11.2%) and III (1.2% vs. 6.2%), and higher rates of categories II (60.9% vs. 50.4%) and IV (17.5% vs. 2.0%). The upper and lower bounds of the risk of malignancy (ROM) for category IV of CNB were 43.2% and 26.6%, respectively. The CNB subcategory IVb with nuclear atypia had a higher ROM than the subcategory without nuclear atypia (40%–62% vs. 23%–36%). In histologically confirmed cases, there was no significant difference in the diagnostic performance between CNB and FNA for malignancy. However, neoplastic diseases were more frequently detected by CNB than by FNA (88.8% vs. 77.6%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.046). In category IV, there was no difference in unnecessary surgery rate between CNB and FNA (4.7% vs. 6.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.6361).Conclusion: Thyroid CNB decreased the rate of inconclusive results and showed a higher category IV diagnostic rate than FNA. The revised guidelines for thyroid CNB proved to be an excellent reporting system for assessing thyroid nodules.</jats:p>",

Commercial coconut shell activated carbon (CAC) and commercial mixed gas of 5000 ppm H2S balanced N2 were used. With different preparation techniques, the CAC was modified by core shell impregnation with zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and zinc acetate (ZnAC2). The core structure was prepared with CAC impregnated by single chemical and double chemical labelled with ZnAC2-CAC (single chemical), ZnAC2/KOH-CAC, ZnAC2/ZnO-CAC, and ZnAC2/TiO2-CAC. Then, the prepared core was layered either with KOH, TiO2, NH3, or TEOS for the shell. The synthesized adsorbents were characterized in physical and chemical characterization through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzers. Operation of the adsorber column takes place at ambient temperature, with absolute pressure at 1.5 bar. The H2S gas was fed into the column at 5.5 L/min and the loaded adsorbents were 150 g. The performance of synthesized adsorbent was analyzed through the adsorbent’s capability in capturing H2S gas. Based on the results, ZnAc2/ZnO/CAC_WOS shows a better adsorption capacity with 1.17 mg H2S/g and a 53% increment compared to raw CAC. However, the degradation of the adsorbents was higher compared to ZnAc2/ZnO/CAC_OS and to ZnAc2/ZnO/CAC_WS ZnAc2/ZnO/CAC_OS. The presence of silica as a shell has potentially increased the adsorbent’s stability in several cycles of adsorption-desorption.</jats:p>"

Ten subjects (3 females) wore a liquid-perfused suit and were cooled (9 °C perfusate, 90 min) and rewarmed (41 °C perfusate, 30 min).

Most polar blue carbon research to date has focussed on deep water, yet the highest productivity is in the shallows. This study measured the functional biodiversity and carbon standing stock accumulated by shallow-water (&lt;25 m) benthic assemblages on both hard and soft substrata on the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP, 67° S). Soft substrata benthic assemblages (391 ± 499 t C km−2) contained 60% less carbon than hard substrata benthic assemblages (648 ± 909). In situ observations of substrata by SCUBA divers provided estimates of 59% hard (4700 km) and 12% soft (960 km) substrata on seasonally ice-free shores of the Antarctic Peninsula, giving an estimate of 253,000 t C at 20 m depth, with a sequestration potential of ~4500 t C year−1. Currently, 54% of the shoreline is permanently ice covered and so climate-mediated ice loss along the Peninsula is predicted to more than double this carbon sink. The steep fjordic shorelines make these assemblages a globally important pathway to sequestration, acting as one of the few negative (mitigating) feedbacks to climate change. The proposed WAP marine protected area could safeguard this ecosystem service, helping to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises.</jats:p>"

In this study, we successfully fabricated nanowire solar cells by utilizing high-quality hetero p-n junctions formed by growing n-type III-V nanowires on p-silicon substrates. The n-InAs0.75P0.25 nanowire array was grown by the Volmer–Weber mechanism, a three-dimensional island growth mode arising from a lattice mismatch between III-V and silicon. For the surface passivation of n-InAs0.75P0.25 core nanowires, a wide bandgap InP shell was formed. The nanowire solar cell was fabricated by benzocyclobutene (BCB) filling, exposure of nanowire tips by reactive-ion etching, electron-beam deposition of ITO window layer, and finally metal grid electrode process. In particular, the ITO window layer plays a key role in reducing light reflection as well as electrically connecting nanowires that are electrically separated from each other. The deposition angle was adjusted for conformal coating of ITO on the nanowire surface, and as a result, the lowest light reflectance and excellent electrical connectivity between the nanowires were confirmed at an oblique deposition angle of 40°. The solar cell based on the heterojunction between the n-InAs0.75P0.25/InP core-shell nanowire and p-Si exhibited a very high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.19% with a current density of 27.10 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 484 mV, and a fill factor of 70.1%.</jats:p>"

In the past couple of years, dielectric waveguides have become commonplace for THz systems to mitigate issues in efficiency, size, and cost of integration and packaging using metal-based waveguides. Therefore, THz systems have progressively evolved from cumbersome collections of discreet components to THz-wave integrated circuits. This gradual transition of THz systems from numerous components to compact integrated circuits has been facilitated at each step by incredible advances in all-Si waveguides allowing low-loss, low dispersion, and single-mode waveguiding operation. As such, all-Si waveguides position themselves as highly efficient interconnects to realize THz integrated circuits and further large-scale integration in the THz range.

By determining how elements partition between metal and silicate at high pressures and temperatures, measurements of the mantle composition and geophysical observations of the core can be used to understand the mechanisms by which Earth formed. Here we present the results of metal‐silicate partitioning experiments for a range of nominally lithophile elements (Al, Ca, K, Mg, O, Si, Th, and U) and S to 85 GPa and up to 5400 K. With our results and a compilation of literature data, we developed a parameterization for partitioning that accounts for compositional dependencies in both the metal and silicate phases. Using this parameterization in a range of planetary growth models, we find that, in general, lithophile element partitioning into the metallic phase is enhanced at high temperatures. The relative abundances of FeO, SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and MgO in the mantle vary significantly between planetary growth models, and the mantle abundances of these elements can be used to provide important constraints on Earth's accretion. To match Earth's core mass and mantle composition, Earth's building blocks must have been enriched in Fe and depleted in Si compared with CI chondrites. Finally, too little Mg, Si, and O are partitioned into the core for precipitation of oxides to be a major source of energy for the geodynamo. In contrast, several ppb of U can be partitioned into the core at high temperatures, and this energy source must be accounted for in thermal evolution models.</jats:p>",

Here, we describe a methodology based on laser ablation from Fe target in the presence of preliminarily ablated water-dispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs) to synthesize ultrapure bare (ligand-free) core-satellite nanostructures, consisting of large (several tens of nm) Fe-based core decorated by small (mean size 7.5 nm) Au NPs. The presence of the Fe-based core conditions a relatively strong magnetic response of the nanostructures (magnetization of &gt;12.6 emu/g), while the Au NPs-based satellite shell provides a broad extinction peak centered at 550 nm with a long tale in the near-infrared to overlap with the region of relative tissue transparency (650–950 nm). We also discuss possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of the magnetic-plasmonic nanocomposites. We finally demonstrate a protocol to enhance colloidal stability of the core-satellites in biological environment by their coating with different polymers. Exempt of toxic impurities and combining strong magnetic and plasmonic responses, the formed core-satellite nanocomposites can be used in biomedical applications, including photo- and magneto-induced therapies, magnetic resonance imaging or photoacoustic imaging.</jats:p>"

In this study, analysis of a newly acquired high‐resolution 3‐D seismic reflection volume reveals for the first time a well‐imaged MCC in the proximal northern South China Sea (SCS) rifted margin, the Kaiping MCC (KP MCC). These data provide a 3‐D view of the KP MCC and the associated KP detachment fault. The KP MCC is characterized by ascend of ductile midcrustal materials, and it is partially exhumed in the KP9 High. The KP detachment fault displays a domed low‐angle geometry, and is characterized by pronounced NS‐plunging corrugations, among which two megacorrugations of tens of kilometers are revealed. Evidence show that the KP MCC developed according to the classical rolling‐hinge model. A group of secondary normal faults and fractures, which are parallel to the axis of the KP MCC and offset the KP detachment surface at the crest of the MCC, developed in response to inelastic bending during progressive warping of the footwall. The migration of the domal seismic reflection layers provides a visual evidence for the kinematic process of the rolling‐hinge activity, during which the brittle‐ductile transition and the rolling hinge gradually migrate as the detachment fault slips. The origin of the KP MCC in the northern SCS margin is suggested to have been favored by the existence of a pre‐existing midcrustal ductile layer and basement structures within the upper brittle crust.</jats:p>",

Third, the center of gravity of the kidney region in the patch is aligned to the center of the patch in sagittal and coronal direction. Fourth, we apply data augmentation with scaling and rotation around the center, which preserves the basic slice structure of kidneys. Finally, these patches are fed to a 3D U-Net for training.

Reinforcement learning (RL) theory and recent brain slice studies explain the delayed reward action such that synaptic activities triggered by sensorimotor events leave a synaptic eligibility trace for 1 s. The trace produces a sensitive period for reward-related dopamine to induce synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the contribution of the synaptic eligibility trace to behaviour remains unclear. Here we examined a reward-sensitive period to brief pure tones with an accurate measurement of an effective timing of water reward in head-fixed Pavlovian conditioning, which depended on the plasticity-related signaling in the NAc. We found that the reward-sensitive period was within 1 s after the pure tone presentation and optogenetically-induced presynaptic activities at the NAc, showing that the short reward-sensitive period was in conformity with the synaptic eligibility trace in the NAc. These findings support the application of the synaptic eligibility trace to construct biologically plausible RL models.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance of simulated immature teeth restored with different intraradicular posts and assess their stress distribution pattern using 3D Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Methods. Fracture strength testing using universal testing machine was carried out in simulated immature teeth restored with different intraradicular posts grouped as follows: Group A: teeth not restored with posts served as control group; Group B: Cast metal post (CMP); Group C: Customized Composite Post (CCP); Group D: Fiber post (FP). Four 3D FEA models of the above groups were created using CATIATM software and analyzed for stress distribution using ANSYSTM. The results of fracture strength testing and FEA were correlated. Multiple group comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post hoc test. Results. The CMP exhibited highest fracture resistance (336.43 N) but resulted in root fractures. The CCP exhibited lower fracture resistance (240.90 N) and favorable stress distribution as compared to CMP. The FP and control group exhibited lower fracture resistance values of 182.69 N and 130.46 N, respectively. The results of 3D FEA demonstrated higher stress concentration in model comprising metallic post and core. Conclusions. Teeth restored with cast metal posts and cores exhibited maximum fracture resistance followed by the customized composite posts, the fiber posts, and the control group. The cast metal posts indicated higher von Mises stresses concentrated in the radicular region; however, the customized composite posts, the fiber posts, and the control group demonstrated stress concentration in the coronal region.</jats:p>",

However, most of the reported conductors have disadvantages of single function, high energy consumption, which seriously limit their application in wearable electronics. Here, a kind of stretchable (up to 373%), highly conductive (the same order of magnitude as commercial metal wire), and multifunctional sheath‐core fibers based on liquid metal that can be continuously fabricated in large quantity through a coaxial wet‐spinning process are reported. The simple preparation method of the fibers can realize continuous and mass production (1 m min<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> in the laboratory). When the fibers are used as an electric heater, the temperature can reach 58 °C at 0.6 V and the heating rate is obviously faster than the ambient temperature under infrared light. When the fibers are used as a wearable sensor, the tiny force of 0.001 cN can be detected and objects at less than 40 cm can be detected without contact. The stretchable fibers with high electric conductivity may provide strong supports for the commercialization of wearable electronics and pave the way toward full‐fledged multifunctional wearable sensors.</jats:p>",

These data are combined with proper motions measured using HST ACS/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2, creating a sample of 135 sources with all three velocity components. The velocities measured are consistent with a normal distribution in all three components. We measure intrinsic velocity dispersions of (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math>\n\n</jats:tex-math>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mi>σ</mml:mi>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:msub>\n                                 <mml:mrow>\n                                    <mml:mi>v</mml:mi>\n                                 </mml:mrow>\n                                 <mml:mrow>\n                                    <mml:mi>α</mml:mi>\n                                 </mml:mrow>\n                              </mml:msub>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"apjac3252ieqn1.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math>\n\n</jats:tex-math>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mi>σ</mml:mi>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:msub>\n                                 <mml:mrow>\n                                    <mml:mi>v</mml:mi>\n                                 </mml:mrow>\n                                 <mml:mrow>\n                                    <mml:mi>δ</mml:mi>\n                                 </mml:mrow>\n                              </mml:msub>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"apjac3252ieqn2.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math>\n\n</jats:tex-math>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mi>σ</mml:mi>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:msub>\n                                 <mml:mrow>\n                                    <mml:mi>v</mml:mi>\n                                 </mml:mrow>\n                                 <mml:mrow>\n                                    <mml:mi>r</mml:mi>\n                                 </mml:mrow>\n                              </mml:msub>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"apjac3252ieqn3.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>) = (1.64 ± 0.12, 2.03 ± 0.13, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math>\n\n</jats:tex-math>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msubsup>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mn>2.56</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>−</mml:mo>\n                              <mml:mn>0.17</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>+</mml:mo>\n                              <mml:mn>0.16</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msubsup>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"apjac3252ieqn4.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>) km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Our computed intrinsic velocity dispersion profiles are consistent with the dynamical equilibrium models from Da Rio et al. (2014) in the tangential direction but not in the line-of-sight direction, possibly indicating that the core of the ONC is not yet virialized, and may require a nonspherical potential to explain the observed velocity dispersion profiles. We also observe a slight elongation along the north–south direction following the filament, which has been well studied in previous literature, and an elongation in the line-of-sight to tangential velocity direction. These 3D kinematics will help in the development of realistic models of the formation and early evolution of massive clusters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Repeated injections of psychomotor stimulants like amphetamine (AMPH) to rodents can induce behavioral sensitization, which represents a long‐lasting craving that is usually observed in human addicts. Behavioral sensitization is characteristically maintained for a long duration, accompanied by structural plasticity in some brain areas involved in reward circuitry. For example, it increased dendritic spine densities in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which is considered to reflect neurophysiological changes at this site, leading to addictive behaviors. The ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins regulate spine maturity by modifying their phosphorylation at the C‐terminal region. We previously showed that ERM phosphorylation is reduced by AMPH in the NAcc core, suggesting that ERM‐mediated spine changes at this site might be associated with AMPH sensitization. To test this hypothesis, we administered AMPH to rats according to a sensitization development schedule, with lentivirus encoding a phosphomimetic pseudo‐active mutant of radixin (Rdx T564D) in the NAcc core, and examined dendritic spines at this site. We found that compared to acute AMPH, AMPH sensitization increased thin spine density with a similar ratio of filopodia‐like to mature thin spines. However, with Rdx T564D, the density of thin spines increased, with augmented filopodia‐like thin spines, resulting in no AMPH sensitization. These results indicate that Rdx T564D forces thin spines to immaturity and thereby inhibits AMPH sensitization, for which an increase in mature thin spines is normally necessary. These findings provide significant clues to our understanding of the role of dendritic spines in mediating the development of psychomotor stimulant addiction.<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jnc15582-fig-0008-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Delaware Basin of the greater Permian Basin system has been the focus of continually increased attention in the exploration, appraisal, and development phases of unconventional oil and gas potential over the past decade. While the industry continues to drill horizontal wells for the exploitation of producible hydrocarbon, subsurface disciplines continue to investigate the rock and fluid properties of the stratigraphy through the application of various technological tools. In this study, we focus on five wells spatially covering Loving, Ward, and Reeves Counties in West Texas, where whole core samples were acquired and investigated to compare variations in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp Formations across varying geological contexts. Samples taken from the whole conventional core were investigated in the laboratory setting, and a series of measurements were acquired on each sample. The laboratory measurements distinguished trends and changes in the rock property volumes (i.e., porosity, saturation, total organic carbon) over stratigraphic intervals. The utilization of nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as acquired geochemical data, allows an innovative approach and application of a correction factor to be applied to the saturation quantification. Integration of geological context with measured laboratory data constraints and petrophysical wireline-log-based interpretation links predictive trends from the defined rock and fluid property distributions and may aid in predicting hydrocarbon vs. water production.</jats:p>",

The globally growing demand for chickpea suggests superior/climate-resilient varieties, which in turn necessitatesthe germplasm characterization to unravel underlying genetic variation. Methodology and Results: A chickpea core collection comprising of diverse 192 accessions which include cultivated Cicer arietinum, and wild C. reticulatum, C. echinospermum, and C. microphyllum specieswere investigated to analyze their genetic diversity and relationship, by assaying 33 unlinked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The results amplifieda total of 323 alleles, ranging from 2 to 8withan average of4.25 alleles per locus. Expected heterozygosity (He) differed from 0.46 to 0.86 with an average of 0.68. Polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.73 to 0.98 with an average of 0.89. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that most of the variation was among individuals (87%). Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of four distinct clusters. Cluster I represented all cultivated and clusters II, III, and IV comprised a heterogeneous group of cultivated and wild chickpea accessions. Conclusion: We report considerable diversity and greater resolving power of SSR markers for assessingvariability and interrelationship among the chickpea accessions. The chickpea core is expected to be an efficient resource for breeders for broadening its genetic base and provides useful insight for selective breeding of desirable traits and in the identification of target genes for genomics-assisted breeding.

However, basic and applied studies on the Thomson effect, another fundamental thermoelectric effect in conductors, are limited despite the fact that the Thomson effect allows electronic cooling through the application of a temperature gradient bias rather than the construction of junction structures. In this article, we report the observation of a giant Thomson effect that appears owing to magnetic phase transitions. The Thomson coefficient of FeRh-based alloys reaches large values approaching –1000 μV K−1 around room temperature because of the steep temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient associated with the antiferromagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition. The Thomson coefficient is several orders of magnitude larger than the Seebeck coefficient of the alloys. Using the active thermography technique, we demonstrate that the Thomson cooling can be much larger than Joule heating in the same material even in a nearly steady state. The operation temperature of the giant Thomson effect in the FeRh-based alloys can be tuned over a wide range by applying an external magnetic field or by slightly changing the composition. Our findings provide a new direction in the materials science of thermoelectrics and pave the way for thermal management applications using the Thomson effect.</jats:p>",

In the process of membrane fusion, envelope protein exposes fusion peptide, followed by an insertion into the cell membrane or endosomal membrane. Further conformational changes ensue in which the type 1 envelope protein forms a typical six-helix bundle structure, shortening the distance between viral and cell membranes so that fusion can occur. Entry inhibitors targeting viral envelope proteins, or host factors, are effective antiviral agents and have been widely studied. Some have been used clinically, such as T20 and Mara-viroc for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) or Myrcludex B for hepatitis D virus (HDV). This review focuses on entry inhibitors that target the six-helical bundle core against highly pathogenic en-veloped viruses with class I fusion proteins, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, influenza A viruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

However, it was still a challenge to report an accurate and sensitive method for the detection of miRNA during cancer development, especially in the presence of its analogs that produce intense background noise. Herein, we developed a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)–based lateral flow assay (LFA) biosensor, assisted with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification strategy, for the dynamic monitoring of miR-106b and miR-196b, associated with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In the presence of target miRNAs, two hairpin DNAs could self-assemble into double-stranded DNA, exposing the biotin molecules modified on the surface of palladium (Pd)–gold (Au) core–shell nanorods (Pd-AuNRs). Then, the biotin molecules could be captured by the streptavidin (SA), which was fixed on the test lines (T1 line and T2 line) beforehand. The core–shell spatial structures and aggregation Pd-AuNRs generated abundant active “hot spots” on the T line, significantly amplifying the SERS signals. Using this strategy, the limits of detections were low to aM level, and the selectivity, reproducibility, and uniformity of the proposed SERS-LFA biosensor were satisfactory. Finally, this rapid analysis strategy was successfully applied to quantitatively detect the target miRNAs in clinical serum obtained from healthy subjects and patients with LSCC at different stages. The results were consistent with the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Thus, the CHA-assisted SERS-LFA biosensor would become a promising alternative tool for miRNAs detection, which showed a tremendous clinical application prospect in diagnosing LSCC.</jats:p>"

The average polymorphsim information content (PIC) values for the three inferred groups clustered by structure analysis and the six classified color groups were 0.2445 and 0.2628, respectively, indicating a low to medium informative degree of genetic diversity. Moreover, a core collection containing 29.4% (35) out of the 119 X. sorbifolium germplasms was established. Our results revealed the genetic diversity and structure of X. sorbifolium germplasms, and the development of a core collection will be useful for the efficient improvement of breeding programs and genome-wide association studies.</jats:p>"

However, the fabrication of the terahertz hollow-core metal rectangular waveguide cavity with high working frequency has not made recent breakthroughs, especially when the working frequency is 1-THz and above. In this paper, a combined process of electrochemical deposition and selective chemical dissolution is proposed first to manufacture the terahertz hollow-core metal rectangular waveguide cavity with high working frequency. Taking the fabrication of a 1.7-THz hollow-core metal rectangular waveguide as an example, the manufacturing methods and experiments of each step are described systematically. A terahertz hollow-core metal rectangular waveguide cavity with an end face size of 81.9 × 162.7 µm2, the edge radius less than 10 µm, the internal bottom surface roughness less than 0.08 µm, and the internal side surface roughness less than 0.3 µm is obtained. These experimental results are matched with the processing requirements of a 1.7-THz hollow-core metal rectangular waveguide. This flexible and controllable combined process makes it possible to manufacture more types of terahertz hollow-core metal rectangular cavity structures with high working frequency.</jats:p>",

The SL and SV interfacial tensions γSL − γS0 and γSV − γS0 relative to that for bare solid surface γS0, respectively, were obtained by simple force balance relations on fluid-containing control volumes set around the bottom and top ends of the solid cylinder, which are subject to the fluid stress and the force from the solid. The theoretical contact angle calculated by Young’s equation using these interfacial tensions agreed well with the apparent contact angle estimated by the analytical solution to fit the meniscus shape, showing that Young’s equation holds even for the menisci around solids with nanoscale curvature. We have also found that the curvature effect on the contact angle was surprisingly small while it was indeed large on the local forces exerted on the solid cylinder near the contact line. In addition, the present results showed that the curvature dependence of the SL and SV interfacial free energies, which are the interfacial tensions, is different from that of the corresponding interfacial potential energies.</jats:p>",

In previous work, the formation of a clear open-ring/closed-ring boundary was observed on the surface of photochromic diarylethene thin-film crystals by simultaneously irradiating visible and ultraviolet light. To examine dynamic processes of the boundary formation, we developed a multi-probe atomic force microscope allowing simultaneous and continuous observations at different spatial positions. In this study, we developed atomic force microscopy containing two independent probe tips that allow simultaneous observation at spatially different positions. We used a unique method to control two probes in close proximity to achieve measurements at arbitrary positions. We have correlated the structural changes on the surface of photochromic thin films with the movement of the phase boundary at the crystal surface caused by photoisomerization under simultaneous broad visible and ultraviolet light irradiation. We also measured inhomogeneous expansion of nanometer-scale photoisomerizations due to local photoexcitation. This study paves the way for the elucidation of phenomena in the dynamic optical processes of crystals and for understanding versatile spatiotemporal dynamics in two- and three-dimensional optoelectronic structures within a nanometer scale.</jats:p>",

It targeted a sample of 52 students who were divided into control (N=26) and experimental (N=26) group. The Student Team Achievement Division was employed on the experimental group for 8 weeks to achieve the purpose of the study. Quantitative data was gathered using questionnaires and tests. Paired sample t-test was run to compare the effect of the intervention on achievement scores of the experimental group. The results showed that there was a significant difference between scores of the experimental group before and after intervention (p=.000). The results concluded that cooperative learning strategy had a positive effect on academic achievement and interest of students in Core Mathematics at the Senior High School level irrespective of students’ achievement level and has no negative effect on high achievers. The STAD Cooperative Learning strategy is recommended over the conventional technique which could be attributed to the fact that it makes students develop more positive attitudes towards themselves, peers, adults, and learning in general. Cooperative Learning should be highly encouraged in schools that have the majority of their students being day students. In situations in which it is not suitable to implement Cooperative Learning in class, teachers can assign these tasks as group projects or take-home assignments for the students and this must be regular. Time is essential particularly in the early stages where students are now being introduced to the strategy, for this reason, teachers are therefore encouraged to sensitize the students before and during the intervention process.</jats:p>"

New guidelines were implemented, including postponing non-essential surgical procedures to conserve resources. In response, the COVID19 Pandemic Breast Cancer Consortium expert opinion suggested the use of core biopsies for genomic testing to help triage patients for surgical vs. systemic treatment. To better understand how expedited genomic results could impact peri-operative care, we performed a pre-operative quality project to assess testing Mammaprint (MP), a 70-gene risk of recurrence assay, and Blueprint (BP), an 80-gene molecular subtyping assay, on core biopsies. Here we report our experience with MP and BP testing on core biopsies, and the correlation between test results and response to neoadjuvant therapy.Design: From April to December 2020, all core biopsies with a breast carcinoma diagnosis from our clinic (300 patients) were routinely sent for MP and BP testing as part of a rapid result program that was initiated to see whether test results could be obtained in time and whether they would lead to more informed pre-operative treatment decisions. Unstained slides were sent for genomic and receptor testing concurrently. When genomic results differed from IHC/FISH results or suggested a different treatment plan vs. clinical factors alone, we referred to this as “reclassification.” For those patients who completed their neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we grouped them by their genomic results and by their conventional IHC/FISH/Clinical classification, and compared the outcome.Results: MP and BP results from core biopsy were available for 96.6% of patients (n=290/300). The average time from biopsy to test results was 10 days, and the average lab turnaround time was 5 days. Results were available for tumor conference discussions 100% of the time. MP and BP re-classified 84 of 300 patients (28%) from conventional IHC/FISH subtyping, and reclassified 42 of 195 patients (22%) of patients from their risk category based on traditional clinical factors (Table-1). Of the 38 patients with available post-neoadjuvant therapy outcome, 13 patients (34%) achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). 16 patients were classified as Her-2 enriched by IHC/FISH of which 9 (56%) achieved pCR. MP/BP aligned with the IHC/FISH Her-2 enriched classification in 11/16 patients, while 5 patients were reclassified to Luminal B by MP/BP. Of the 11 patients with concordant IHC/FISH and MP/BP results, 8 achieved pCR (73%), while one of the 5 cases reclassified to Luminal B achieved pCR (20%). Of the patients who were classified Luminal by IHC (9 patients), one patient achieved pCR (11%), and of the patients classified luminal (A or B) by MP/BP (12 patients) two achieved pCR (16%). Of the IHC-triple negative patients and genomic basal patients, three patients achieved pCR in each group (23% and 20%, respectively).Conclusion: Performing MP/BP tests on core needle biopsies hold a high success rate. Incorporating test results into peri-operative discussions may result in better-informed decisions about treatment planning and timing of surgery versus systemic therapy. A higher rate of pCR was seen in the MP/BP Her-2 enriched group compared to the IHC/FISH Her-2 enriched group. Although this workflow was designed to triage patients during the COVID pandemic, this approach has great potential beyond the pandemic.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Table-1: Reclassification Rate vs. path IHC/FISH or Clinical FactorsIHC/FISH/Clinical ◊ Genomic# of reclassified patients/total patients in the corresponding traditional category% of patientsLuminal A ◊ Luminal B25/16116%Luminal A ◊ Her-21/1610.6%Luminal B ◊ Luminal A35/7249%Luminal B ◊ Basal4/726%Her-2 ◊ Luminal A1/313%Her-2 ◊ Luminal B10/3132%Her-2 ◊ Basal1/313%Triple negative ◊ Luminal A4/3611%Triple negative ◊ Luminal B3/368%Clinical high risk ◊ Genomic low risk21/8425%Clinical low risk ◊ Genomic high risk21/11119%</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Hani Katerji, Huina Zhang, Xi Wang, Linda Schiffhauer, Ajay Dhakal, Alissa Huston, Carla Falkson, David Hicks, Bradley Turner.

Since the security of a cryptographic core implementation and the security of the cryptographic algorithm itself from the mathematical perspective are two different problems, cryptographic cores may contain hidden security vulnerabilities such as design flaws and side channels. Security analysis methods based on functional verification rely heavily on the quality of test vectors and usually have low test coverage, which is difficult to meet the security verification requirements of security-critical components like cryptographic cores. This work proposes a cryptographic core security verification and vulnerability detection method from the perspective of information flow security. The proposed method can accurately measure all logical information flows in cryptographic core designs to formally verify security properties such as confidentiality and integrity. It can detect potential security vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations by capturing harmful information flows. Experimental results show that our information flow security verification method is effective in detecting sensitive information leakage caused by the design vulnerabilities and side channels in cryptographic cores.</jats:p>",

We previously evaluated a prototype, but, due to its prototypical nature, there remain limitations, such as only detecting certain behaviors, high power consumption, and a tendency to bloat the training model. In this paper, we propose a circuit and a learning method to achieve high efficiency, low power consumption, and light weight for the model. In considering these three issues, we focus on time-series metadata obtained by transforming the processor information. To improve efficiency, we implement predictive detection to predict the behavior of metadata in the malware detection component. This lets the model detect malware within less than 19% of the number of execution cycles of the conventional method. To reduce power consumption, we implement a sampling circuit that interrupts the input to the detection circuit at regular intervals, reducing the system’s uptime by 99% while maintaining judgment accuracy. Finally, for a light weight, we focus on the training process of the metadata generator based on a machine-learning model. By applying sampling learning and feature dimensionality reduction in the training process, a metadata generator approximately 16% smaller than the previous version is created.</jats:p>",

The nanocomposite was prepared by implantation of CHCF nanoparticles into copolymer of poly(AA-co-OAP) during the polymerization process. The surface morphology and the porous structure were investigated through transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). The characterization of the prepared (CSNC) was carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric (TGA). Which SEM and TEM images confirmed the nano-size of the prepared CSNC. The values of adsorption capacity of CSNC towards cesium ions and the factors influence on the removal of cesium from solutions were investigated as function in pH, metal ion concentration, temperature and contact time. The results illustrated that the highest value of sorption capacity of the prepared CSNC towards Cs<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions was 2.1 mmol g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at pH 11, 10 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Cs<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and 25 °C.

Also, the adsorption kinetics data was fitted well to pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated in the temperature from 25 to 60 °C and the data revealed that Cs<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> sorption was endothermic, spontaneous, and more favorable at higher temperature.

The cylindrical structures of these CPN belts were confirmed by X‐ray crystallographic analyses.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between community violence exposure and stress reactivity in African American and non-Latino white adolescents with overweight/obesity. Fifty-one adolescents (47% female, 55% African American; aged 14–19) participated in this study. Community violence was assessed using the Survey of Children’s Exposure to Community Violence. Stress reactivity was assessed via salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase area under the curve (AUC) during a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Race was a significant predictor of alpha-amylase reactivity (β = 10740±3665, p = 0.0006), with a higher alpha-amylase AUC observed in African American compared to non-Latino white adolescents. There was also a significant difference in the relationship between community violence exposure and alpha-amylase AUC by race (β = −3561±1226, p = 0.007). At similar increases in violence exposure, African Americans demonstrated a significant decline in alpha-amylase AUC while non-Latino whites demonstrated a significant increase in alpha-amylase AUC. Neither race nor violence exposure were significant predictors of cortisol AUC and there were no significant differences in the relationship between community violence exposure and cortisol AUC by race (all p’s &gt; .05). These preliminary findings suggest exposure to community violence may act to exacerbate autonomic dysregulation in African American adolescents with overweight/obesity. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms by which community violence exposure differentially impacts stress responses by race. </jats:p>",

Investigating a single time point is insufficient, as pregnancy is dynamic, involving several processes, including placenta development, trophoblast proliferation and differentiation and oxygen sensing. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the temporal expression of serum miRNAs in pregnant women with and without GDM. This is a nested case-control study of longitudinal data obtained from a multicentric European study (the ‘DALI’ study). All women (n = 82) were overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 29 kg/m2) and were normal glucose tolerant (NGT) at baseline (before 20 weeks of gestation). We selected women (n = 41) who were diagnosed with GDM at 24–28 weeks, according to the IADPSG/WHO2013 criteria. They were matched with 41 women who remained NGT in their pregnancy. miRNA (miR-16-5p, -29a-3p, -103-3p, -134-5p, -122-5p, -223-3p, -330-3p and miR-433-3p) were selected based on their suggested importance for placentation, and measurements were performed at baseline and at 24–28 and 35–37 weeks of gestation. Women with GDM presented with overall miRNA levels above those observed for women remaining NGT. In both groups, levels of miR-29a-3p and miR-134-5p increased consistently with progressing gestation. The change over time only differed for miR-29a-3p when comparing women with GDM with those remaining NGT (p = 0.044). Our findings indicate that among overweight/obese women who later develop GDM, miRNA levels are already elevated early in pregnancy and remain above those of women who remain NGT during their pregnancy. Maternal circulating miRNAs may provide further insight into placentation and the cross talk between the maternal and fetal compartments.</jats:p>"

This paper discusses the existing, relevant literature from researchers who have studied the issue at least thrice. The authors were divided into those who focused on the surface and those who formed a structure on the surface. In summary, the authors suggested the following research directions: The experimental conditions of porous foam are not diverse, and there is a concern about the separation of foam and coating into the tub. The experimental conditions of the immersion tub should also be varied according to the heat and pressure over time.

The detection accuracy of 83% was achieved with the small training data of just 232 images showing nanoparticles by utilizing transfer learning based on VGG16 to train the image classifier. Although the construction of training data generally requires much effort, the time needed to select the training data candidates was significantly shortened by utilizing a pattern matching technique. Experimental results showed that the high-resolution hologram acquisition efficiency was improved by factors of about 100 and 6 compared to a scan method and a pattern-matching-only method, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article deals with the formation of entrepreneurial competencies by students in various educational programs, where entrepreneurial disciplines are not core. Under non-core areas in the framework of this article, we will agree to understand educational programs for undergraduate programs that are aimed at forming specialists in professions other than entrepreneurs, for example, the profiles of “Project Management”, “Finance and Credit”, “Sports Management”, “Event Management”, “Management in the hotel and Restaurant Business”, “Marketing”, “Civil law”, “Economic security” and others. This is a preparation for a specialty other than entrepreneurship, so the entrepreneurship competencies for these programs is a general professional one. Entrepreneurial education seems to be relevant for students in various areas and profiles of undergraduate studies. Entrepreneurship competencies is a general professional competencies for non-core areas, while it is possible to integrate it into the main educational program as a professional one. Students can open their own business in small and medium-sized businesses, initiate intra-company entrepreneurship. For systematic training, it is advisable to introduce a practice module for running your own startup with a connection to the infrastructure for entrepreneurship. This article is devoted to the solution of this problem – building a system for teaching entrepreneurship in non-core areas of bachelor’s degree, focused on the following goals: а) identify and describe competencies in the field of entrepreneurship for students of managerial, economic, in the future and other profiles of higher education; b) present a system of teaching entrepreneurship through a module of adapted academic disciplines from a proven set of courses in entrepreneurial education; c) identify the main topics of the courses included in the module, and the types of necessary training sessions that will allow you to achieve the required level of development of the proposed competencies. In this article, a team of authors who teach courses on entrepreneurship as core disciplines at Synergy University presents a vision and a general outline for building this direction and basic courses for non-core students, which will also be detailed in subsequent publications.</jats:p>",

Three genes encoding CLD1/PPH homologs (dphA1, dphA2 and dphA3) were found in the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and shown to be conserved in most cyanobacteria. His6-tagged DphA1, DphA2 and DphA3 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to near homogeneity, and shown to exhibit significant levels of dephytylase activity for Chl a and Phein a. Each DphA protein showed similar dephytylase activities for Chl a and Phein a, but the three proteins were distinct in their kinetic properties, with DphA3 showing the highest and lowest Vmax and Km values, respectively, among the three. Transcription of dphA1 and dphA3 was enhanced under high-light conditions, whereas that of dphA2 was not affected by the light conditions. None of the dphA single mutants of S. elongatus showed profound growth defects under low (50 µmol photons m−2 s−1) or high (400 µmol photons m−2 s−1) light conditions. The triple dphA mutant did not show obvious growth defects under these conditions, either, but under illumination of 1,000 µmol photons m−2 s−1, the mutant showed more profound growth retardation compared with wild type (WT). The repair of photodamaged photosystem II (PSII) was much slower in the triple mutant than in WT. These results revealed that dephytylation of Chl a or Phein a or of both is required for efficient repair of photodamaged PSII.</jats:p>",

However, in practice it can be difficult to consolidate data analyses that encapsulates the broad range of datatypes available in the life sciences. We present STENCIL, a web templating engine designed to organize, visualize, and enable the sharing of interactive data visualizations. STENCIL leverages a flexible web framework for creating templates to render highly customizable visual front ends. This flexibility enables researchers to render small or large sets of experimental outcomes, producing high-quality downloadable and editable figures that retain their original relationship to the source data. REST API based back ends provide programmatic data access and supports easy data sharing. STENCIL is a lightweight tool that can stream data from Galaxy, a popular bioinformatic analysis web platform. STENCIL has been used to support the analysis and dissemination of two large scale genomic projects containing the complete data analysis for over 2,400 distinct datasets.

A wide range of variability was observed for days to spike emergence (51–139 days), days to physiological maturity (100–152 days), plant height (45.96–171.32 cm), spike length (3.44–13.73 cm), grain number/spike (10.48–82.35), and 100-grain weight (1.20–6.86 g). Initially, seven independent core sets were derived using 3 core construction tools– MSTRAT, PowerCore, and Core Hunter 3 by employing the maximization method, heuristic sampling, and optimisation of average genetic distances, respectively. The core set-3 generated by Core Hunter 3 by simultaneous optimisation of diversity and representativeness, captured maximum genetic diversity of the whole collection as evident from the desirable genetic distance, variance difference percentage (VD; 87.5%), coincidence rate of range (CR; 94.27%) and variable rate of coefficient of variance (VR; 113.8%), which were more than threshold value of VD (80%), CR (80%), and VR (100%) required for good core collection. The coefficient of variation and Shannon–Weaver diversity indices were increased in the core set as compared with the whole collection. The low value of Kullback-Leibler distance (0.024–0.071) for all traits and quantile-quantile plots revealed a negligible difference between trait distribution patterns among the core set and entire assembly. Correlogram revealed that trait associations and their magnitude were conserved for most of the traits after sampling of the core set. The extraction of the INGB barley core set and identification of promising accessions for agronomically important traits in different genetic backgrounds will pave the way for expedited access to genetically diverse and agronomically important germplasm for barley breeding.</jats:p>"

However, shortcomings, including poor solubility and sensitivity to metabolic transformation, have greatly undermined its value in clinical applications. In this study, the potential of CUR-encapsulated hyaluronic acid (HA)–zein composite nanoparticles (HZ-CUR) as an oral adjuvant for OXA-based chemotherapy was assessed in representative CRC models in mice. Cell viability and colony formation assays in three human CRC cell lines showed that HZ-CUR had a stronger anti-CRC effect than free CUR when given alone and a stronger synergistic effect when combined with OXA, especially in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. Western blotting, cellular uptake, and RNA interference assays revealed that OXA-induced upregulation of CD44 likely contributed to enhanced cellular uptake of HZ-CUR and thus the enhanced anticancer effect. The significantly improved anti-CRC effects and potential underlying mechanism of HZ-CUR alone and in combination with OXA were further validated in a subcutaneous xenograft and an in situ CRC model in mice. These findings support that HZ-CUR may be an effective oral adjuvant for OXA-based CRC chemotherapy that would not only improve its efficacy but also help reduce the associated side effects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Humans are able to estimate head movements accurately despite the short half-life of information coming from our inner ear motion sensors. The observation that the central angular velocity estimate outlives the decaying signal of the semicircular canal afferents led to the concept of a velocity storage mechanism (VSM). The VSM can be activated via visual and vestibular modalities and becomes manifest in ocular motor responses after sustained stimulation like whole-body rotations, optokinetic or galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). The VSM has been the focus of many computational modelling approaches; little attention though has been paid to discover its actual structural correlates. Animal studies localized the VSM in the medial and superior vestibular nuclei. A significant modulation by cerebellar circuitries including the uvula and nodulus has been proposed. Nevertheless, the corresponding neuroanatomical structures in humans have not been identified so far. The aim of the present study was to delineate the neural substrates of the VSM using high-resolution infratentorial fMRI with a fast T2* sequence optimized for infratentorial neuroimaging and via video-oculography (VOG). The neuroimaging experiment (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>=20) gave first in vivo evidence for an involvement of the vestibular nuclei in the VSM and substantiate a crucial role for cerebellar circuitries. Our results emphasize the importance of cerebellar feedback loops in VSM most likely represented by signal increases in vestibulo-cerebellar hubs like the uvula and nodulus and lobule VIIIA. The delineated activation maps give new insights regarding the function and embedment of Crus I, Crus II, and lobule VII and VIII in the human vestibular system.</jats:p>"

However, its deployment is seriously impeded because multiple-input multiple-output digital signal processing (MIMO-DSP) with huge computational load must be adopted to combat intermodal crosstalk for long-haul FMF transmission. In this paper, we present an intermodal-MIMO-free MDM transmission scheme based on weakly coupled multiple-ring-core FMF, which achieves ultralow distributed modal crosstalk (DMC) so that the signal in each LP mode can be independently received by single-LP-mode MIMO-DSP even after hundreds-of-kilometer transmission. Evaluation method for the required DMC levels is proposed and different transmission reaches are investigated by simulation. By adopting an improved method for quantitative DMC measurement, we show that the required DMC level for long-haul transmission is feasible. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate 1800-km LP<jats:sub>01</jats:sub>/LP<jats:sub>02</jats:sub> multiplexed transmission and 525-km LP<jats:sub>01</jats:sub>/LP<jats:sub>21</jats:sub>/LP<jats:sub>02</jats:sub> multiplexed transmission only adopting 2×2 or 4×4 MIMO-DSP.

Electrical behaviors of direct metal–semiconductor (MS) and metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) contacts with mono‐ and bilayer h‐BN in a four‐layer WS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> field‐effect transistor (FET) are evaluated under vacuum from 77 to 300 K. The performance of the MIS contacts differs based on the metal work function when using Cr and indium (In).

An electron mobility up to ≈115 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> V<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> at 300 K is achieved with the insertion of monolayer h‐BN, which is approximately ten times higher than that with MS contacts.

We studied two possible cases: a first one, device-dependent, where the system is trusted, and a second one, semi-device-independent, where the adversary can control the measurements. We experimentally realized the former, extracted randomness, and, after privacy amplification, we achieved a generation rate higher than 10 Mbit/s. In addition, we presented a possible realization of the semi-device-independent protocol using a newly introduced integrated silicon photonic chip.

PST might modulate the biology of BC cells and thus, the molecular subtype. In our single-center, retrospective cohort analysis we evaluated the concordance of the molecular subtype using ER, PR, HER2 status and Ki67 based on the core needle biopsies (CNB) and the excisional biopsies (EB) in primary, early breast cancer (eBC) with and without primary systemic treatment (PST). Finally, we analyzed the subtype shifting in residual tumors after PST.Methods: From January 1st, 2007 to December 31st, 2016 we identified a total of 1250 consecutive eBCs with corresponding samples from the CNB and the EB were analyzed. Upfront surgery after CNB was performed during the observational period in 1002 eBCs, allowing us to compare the histopathological findings of the CNB and the EB in pairs (cohort C1). PST followed by surgery was performed in 248 eBCs. A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 60 cases. One patient with a clinical complete response (cCR) after PST, refused surgery and was excluded from the analysis. A non-pCR as best response was detected after the completion of PST in 187 eBCs, allowing us to compare the histopathological findings of the CNB and the EB in pairs (cohort C2). The analysis was performed separately in C1 and C2 and the final results were compared.Results: In C1 subtype shifting between CNB and EB in C1 was 18.2% for luminal A, 33.0% for luminal B HER2-, 27.8% for luminal B HER2+, 19.3% for HER2 enriched and 10.1% for basal like tumors. In C2, it was 31.5% for luminal A, 49.1% for luminal B HER2-, 39.0% for luminal B HER2+, 23.1% for HER2 enriched and 9.0% for basal like tumors. Regarding ER, PR, HER2 status and Ki67 we identified between CNB and EB in C1 the following discrepancies: 2.0%, 10.0%, 6.0%, 20.3% and in C2 the following treatment related changes: 8.3%, 27.1%, 11.4%, 52.1%. The number of CNBs had no influence on the changes above. Significant variations in subtype shifting based on PST were identified in C2 compared to C1.Conclusion: In C1 we demonstrated a high concordance of the prognostic factors, identified by one experienced pathologist, allowing us to validate the differences induced by PST. In C2 we demonstrated a significant phenotype shifting, which was dominated by the luminal B subtype. Besides fixational and observational issues, intratumoral heterogeneity of BC and the subsequent clonal sensitivity may explain our results. Present experimental data are suggesting that this treatment related changes might be transient in nature. Prospective data will clarify, if this observation might be therapy relevant, or if the subclones dominating the residual tumor in non-pCR require new post-neoadjuvant treatment approaches.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Molecular Subtypes in CNB and EB with and without PSTLuminal ALuminal B HER2-Luminal B HER2+HER2 enrichedBasal likeC1CNB59.1%24.8%6.9%3.4%5.8%EB56.0%26.0%8.7%3.5%5.8%C2CNB22.6%34.2%23.8%7.2%12.2%EB50.4%29.2%17.4%6.7%16.3%</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Athanasios Argyriadis, Michael Bange, Keyur Mehta, Sibylle Loibl, Silvia Khodaverdi, Susanne Braun, Carsten Denkert, Christian Jackisch.

However, there are few inferences as to the magnetic field strength and geometry within the deep interiors of stars. Considering that massive stars harbour a convective core whilst on the main sequence, asteroseismology of gravity (g) modes is able to provide constraints on their core masses, yet it has so far not been used to probe the strength of their interior magnetic fields. Here, we use asteroseismology to constrain an upper limit for the magnetic field strength in the near-core region of the pulsating and magnetic B star HD 43317, based on the expected interaction of a magnetic field and its g modes. We find a magnetic field strength of order 5 × 105 G is sufficient to suppress high-radial order g modes and reproduce the observed frequency spectrum of HD 43317, which contains only high-frequency g modes. This result is the first inference of the magnetic field strength inside a main-sequence star.</jats:p>",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in nine different comparison groups and a total of 4535 DEGs were identified, and these DEGs were preferentially clustered in inflammatory and immune-related pathways, such as MAPK signaling pathway. Only 1 DEG of heat shock protein 90, alpha (cytosolic), class A member 1 (Hsp90aa1) was shared in comparison groups of model with moxibustion treatment. STC analysis also revealed that Hsp90aa1 was increased in AA model, but decreased after 37 °C moxibustion intervention, and constantly decreased after 42 °C moxibustion treatment. GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes enriched in inflammatory and immune-related pathways. Moreover, WGCNA identified that violet module was positively correlated with model temperature while negatively correlated with control, and the paleturquoise module was positively correlated with model. The violet and paleturquoise module gene were significantly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway. Importantly, Hsp90aa1 also played a central role in the violet module by interacting with multiple proteins.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Moxibustion warm improved AA in rat, and we obtained the transcriptome profile and excavate a critical gene of Hsp90aa1, and provided insight into gene signatures for moxibustion warm at Zusanli acupoint in AA rat.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state in the initial oxidative cycloaddition step which is subject to molecular strain. The cylindrical structures of these CPN belts were confirmed by X‐ray crystallographic analyses. As a result of π‐extension through the introduction of naphthalenes in the chiral‐type CPN belts, the anisotropy dissymmetry factors of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence are amplified compared with the corresponding zigzag‐type chiral cyclophenylene belts.</jats:p>",

Owing to the small interlayer twist, resonant tunneling attributed to the conservation of momentum and energy was observed between the single linear band of MLG and multiple subbands of TLG. We show that different subbands of TLG—bilayer-graphene-like subbands and a MLG-like subband—exhibit distinctly different resonant tunneling behaviors. Therefore, we demonstrate subband-resolved resonant tunneling. This technique provides a method to determine band parameters (Slonczewski–Weiss–McClure parameters) and probes the band dispersion of different two-dimensional materials by utilizing a MLG electrode.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 663 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: GI malignancies continue to be a major cause of cancer related deaths, despite advances in therapy options. In pancreatic cancer, the presence of homologous recombination mutations (HRM) has been shown to confer increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy. However, the role of HRM mutations in other GI cancers remains to be determined. The focus of this study is to evaluate the prognostic nature of core and noncore HRM in nonpancreatic GI cancers. Additionally, we aim to understand the predictive nature of these mutations related to platinum exposure. Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients at Moffitt Cancer Center with a primary stage IV nonpancreatic GI cancer treated with platinum therapy. All patients had next generation sequencing and were in the Clinical Genomics Action Committee database between 1/1/2013 and 11/1/2020. All patients had either a core HRM (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2) or noncore HRM (such as ATM, ATR, BARD1, BRIP1, FANCA, NBN, and RAD51). Patients were grouped into core HRM vs. noncore HRM. Response was stratified between responders (complete response and partial response) vs. non responders (stable disease and progressive disease), based on RECIST criteria. Progression free survival and overall survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to assess the difference in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by HRM status and type of platinum therapy used. Results: There were 72 patients included in the study: the majority of patients were male (65.3%) and Caucasian (87.5%). Twenty-one (29.2%) patients had a core HRM and 51 (70.8%) had a noncore HRM. There was no significant difference in response rate between patients with core HRM and patients with noncore HRM for evaluable patients (n = 66): 20.0% of patients with core HRM vs. 21.7% of patients with noncore HRM demonstrated a response to platinum therapy (p = 0.41). An improved OS was noted for patients with core HRM vs. those with noncore HRM at 68.9 vs. 24.3 months (p = 0.019). An improved PFS was also seen in patients with core HRM at 10.4 months vs. 6.3 months with noncore HRM (p = 0.027). There was no difference in PFS based on type of platinum therapy used (oxaliplatin vs. carboplatin vs. cisplatin), while an improved OS was noted for patients treated with oxaliplatin vs. carboplatin vs. cisplatin at 43.1 vs. 28.2 vs. 16.0 months (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that in stage IV nonpancreatic GI malignancies treated with platinum therapy, patients with core HRM had a greater OS and PFS compared to those with noncore HRM, suggesting a potential prognostic and predictive role of these mutations. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. </jats:p>",

Third, the swinging plant’s animation morphing is achieved by combining the physics and adjusting the morphing parameters. Finally, the effects of leaves transforming into trees and swinging in the wind are simulated. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with traditional methods, it reduces the time required to render images and overcomes interactive control limitations. The ability of attractors with parameter variables to control images is very stable. Continuous adjustment of parameters can effectively solve image distortion caused by matrix decomposition during fractal morphing.

Starting in late September, the lakes are covered in ice, with ice persisting well into June or early July. In summer, the lakes are highly productive, supporting waterfowl and fish populations. However, little is known about the diversity and ecology of microscopic life in the lakes that influence biogeochemical cycles and contribute to ecosystem services. Even less is known about the prevalence of species that are characteristic of the seasons or whether some species persist year-round under both ice cover and summer open-water conditions. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we sampled 10 morphometrically diverse lakes in the region of Ekaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay), on southern Victoria Island (NU, Canada). We focused on Greiner Lake, the lakes connected to it, isolated ponds, and two nearby larger lakes outside the Greiner watershed. The largest lakes sampled were Tahiryuaq (Ferguson Lake) and the nearby Spawning Lake, which support commercial sea-run Arctic char (<jats:italic>Salvelinus alpinus</jats:italic>) fisheries. Samples for nucleic acids were collected from the lakes along with limnological metadata. Microbial eukaryotes were identified with high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Ciliates, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, and cryptophytes dominated the lake assemblages. A Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix separated communities into under-ice and open-water clusters, with additional separation by superficial lake area. In all, 133 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred either in all under-ice or all open-water samples and were considered “core” microbial species or ecotypes. These were further characterized as seasonal indicators. Ten of the OTUs were characteristic of all lakes and all seasons sampled. Eight of these were cryptophytes, suggesting diverse functional capacity within the lineage. The core open-water indicators were mostly chrysophytes, with a few ciliates and uncharacterized Cercozoa, suggesting that summer communities are mixotrophic with contributions by heterotrophic taxa. The core under-ice indicators included a dozen ciliates along with chrysophytes, cryptomonads, and dinoflagellates, indicating a more heterotrophic community augmented by mixotrophic taxa in winter.</jats:p>"

Based on the periodic feature of folded core, a methodology to simulate the fully developed flow and heat transfer state with a few unit cells is developed. The influences of geometric parameters on the coolant flow resistance and heat transfer behaviour are evaluated. Afterwards, approximate models are established based on design to optimize the heat dissipation efficiency. Design variables considered are geometric parameters of the V-pattern folded core, while the corresponding relative density is taken as a constraint. The simulation results show that the presented methodology makes it possible to analyse the fully developed regime with less computing resources. It is found that both pressure drop and heat transfer rate increase with the tortuosity of the flow channel and the inclination of the folded core. The optimization generates a design with a mildly tortuous feature in the streamwise direction to gain a maximum of heat dissipation efficiency under the current conditions.</jats:p>",

Abnormal mechanical loading is a known risk factor for intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Based on the rhythmic daily loading pattern of rest and activity, we hypothesized that abnormal mechanical loading could dampen the IVD clock, contributing to IDD. Here, we investigated the effects of abnormal loading on the IVD clock and aimed to inhibit compression-induced IDD by targeting the core clock molecule brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1). In this study, we showed that BMAL1 KO mice exhibit radiographic features similar to those of human IDD and that BMAL1 expression was negatively correlated with IDD severity by systematic analysis based on 149 human IVD samples. The intrinsic circadian clock in the IVD was dampened by excessive loading, and BMAL1 overexpression by lentivirus attenuated compression-induced IDD. Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway by Y-27632 or melatonin attenuated the compression-induced decrease in BMAL1 expression. Finally, the two drugs partially restored BMAL1 expression and alleviated IDD in a diurnal compression model. Our results first show that excessive loading dampens the circadian clock of nucleus pulposus tissues via the RhoA/ROCK pathway, the inhibition of which potentially protects against compression-induced IDD by preserving BMAL1 expression. These findings underline the importance of the circadian clock for IVD homeostasis and provide a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for IDD.</jats:p>"

Until now, the microbial communities that inhabit or have inhabited soils of hyperarid environments at greater depths have been poorly studied. We analyzed for the first time the variation in microbial communities down to a depth of 3.4 m in one of the driest places of the world, the hyperarid Yungay region in the Atacama Desert, and we related it to changes in soil physico-chemical characteristics. We found that the moisture content changed from 2 to 11% with depth and enabled the differentiation of three depth intervals: (i) surface zone A (0–60 cm), (ii) intermediate zone B (60–220 cm), and (iii) deep zone C (220–340 cm). Each zone showed further specific physicochemical and mineralogical features. Likewise, some bacterial phyla were unique in each zone, i.e., members of the taxa <jats:italic>Deinococcota</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Halobacterota</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Latescibacterota</jats:italic> in zone A; <jats:italic>Crenarchaeota</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Fusobacteriota</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Deltaproteobacterium</jats:italic> Sva0485 in zone B; and <jats:italic>Fervidibacteria</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Campilobacterota</jats:italic> in zone C, which indicates taxon-specific preferences in deep soil habitats. Differences in the microbiota between the zones were rather abrupt, which is concomitant with abrupt changes in the physical-chemical parameters. Overall, moisture content, total carbon (TC), pH, and electric conductivity (EC) were most predictive of microbial richness and diversity, while total sulfur (TS) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were additionally predictive of community composition. We also found statistically significant associations between taxa and soil properties, most of which involved moisture and TC contents. Our findings show that under-explored habitats for microbial survival and existence may prevail at greater soil depths near water or within water-bearing layers, a valuable substantiation also for the ongoing search for biosignatures on other planets, such as Mars.</jats:p>"

Tumors that initially respond to treatment may have a preexisting resistant subclone or acquire resistance during treatment, making relapse theoretically inevitable. Here, we investigate treatment strategies that may delay relapse using mathematical modeling. We find that for a single-drug therapy, pulse treatment—short, elevated doses followed by a complete break from treatment—delays relapse compared with continuous treatment with the same total dose over a length of time. For tumors treated with more than one drug, continuous combination treatment is only sometimes better than sequential treatment, while pulsed combination treatment or simply alternating between the two therapies at defined intervals delays relapse the longest. These results are independent of the fitness cost or benefit of resistance, and are robust to noise. Machine-learning analysis of simulations shows that the initial tumor response and heterogeneity at the start of treatment suffice to determine the benefit of pulsed or alternating treatment strategies over continuous treatment. Analysis of eight tumor burden trajectories of breast cancer patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center shows the model can predict time to resistance using initial responses to treatment and estimated preexisting resistant populations. The model calculated that pulse treatment would delay relapse in all eight cases. Overall, our results support that pulsed treatments optimized by mathematical models could delay therapeutic resistance.</jats:p>",

We found a viscosity increase at ∼3–5 GPa, coincident with a structural transition in the liquids. After the transition, the viscosity reaches ∼14–27 mPa·s, a factor of 2–4 higher than that of Fe and Fe‐S liquids. Our computational results from 5 to 330 GPa also indicate a high viscosity of the Fe‐Ni‐C liquids. For a carbon‐rich core in large terrestrial body, the level of turbulence in the outer core would be lessened approaching the inner core boundary.

Pathological necrosis and fibrosis of targeted lymph nodes (LNs) were evaluated. We analyzed the correlation between CNB accuracy and clinical and pathological characteristics.

CNB of fibrotic LNs had significantly worse sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy than that of non-fibrotic LNs. Similarly, CNB of necrotic LNs had significantly worse sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy than non-necrotic LNs. Multivariate regression revealed that fibrotic LN was the only independent factor for a true positive rate, whereas both necrotic LN and fibrotic LN were independent factors for a false negative rate. The diagnostic accuracy of CNB in treated HNSCC patients is affected by LN necrosis and fibrosis. Therefore, CNB results, particularly for necrotic or fibrotic LNs, should be interpreted carefully.\n</jats:p>"

We computed extreme precipitation based on daily data from observations and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)‐Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CORE) multi‐model ensemble mean (ENSMean). First, we evaluated the performance of the CORDEX‐CORE ENSMean in simulating extreme precipitation based on six indices; the number of rainy days (RR1), simple daily intensity index (SDII), maximum consecutive wet days (CWD), maximum consecutive dry days (CDD), heavy precipitation days (R10), and very heavy precipitation days (R20). The results indicate that the CORDEX‐CORE ENSMean can simulate the spatial distributions of extreme precipitation over the ZRB. However, CORDEX‐CORE largely overestimates the magnitudes of RR1 and CWD. The projected changes show a decrease in RR1, CWD, and R10 under all GWLs, with a robust and pronounced decrease under 3.0°C GWL. In contrast, CDD and SDII are projected to increase under all GWLs, with a robust and pronounced increase in CDD under 3.0°C GWL. The regionally averaged changes show that the median values of CWD, RR1, and R10 (SDII and CDD) are projected to decrease (increase) under all GWLs over the ZRB and sub‐basins. The probability density function (PDF) shows negative (positive) shifts in the mean of CWD, RR1, and R10 (SDII and CDD) over the ZRB and sub‐basins under all GWLs. In contrast, R20 is projected to increase (decrease) over most of the western (eastern) ZRB under all GWLs. Assessing the implications of an additional 0.5 and 1.5°C (1.0°C) warming to 1.5°C (2.0°C) GWL shows that limiting GWL to 1.5°C would restrict the future exposure of the ZRB to extreme precipitation.</jats:p>",

The results indicate specific changes in the P3MT properties appear due to its interfacial interactions with the MWCNTs and PVDF components. In the case of the doped P3MT, charge transfer from MWCNT to P3MT leads to partial dedoping of the latter. The evidence of intermolecular charge transfer complex formation between undoped P3MT (donor) and MWCNTs (acceptor) is obtained. Changes in the properties of P3MT in nanocomposites are used to detect and to reliably recognize some chemical warfare agent's simulants of nerve agents and mustard gas. The sensitivity dependences of the nanocomposites on their work functions, Hansen solubility parameters and analytes electronegativity are studied.

The recent development of a high‐salt‐concentration strategy for aqueous electrolytes, which significantly expands their electrochemical potential window, has created attractive opportunities to explore high‐performance electrode materials for aqueous lithium‐ion batteries.

The time taken by the nanostructures to attain this temperature, with external source heating, was also estimated. The heat transfer module in COMSOL Multiphysics was used for the finite element analysis of hyperthermia, based on silver nanostructures. The thermal response of different shapes of silver nanostructures was evaluated by placing them inside the spherical domain of the tumor tissue. The proposed geometries were heated at different time intervals. Optimization of the geometries was performed to achieve the best treatment temperature. It was observed that silver nanorods quickly attain the desired temperature, as compared to other shapes. The silver nanorods achieved the highest temperature of 44.3 °C among all the analyzed geometries. Moreover, the central volume, used to identify the thermal response, was the maximum for the silver nano-ellipsoids. Thermal equilibrium in the treatment region was attained after 0.5 μs of heating, which made these structures suitable for hyperthermia treatment.</jats:p>"

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein but is also actively released into the extracellular fluids including brain interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, it remains elusive whether clearance of extracellular tau impacts tau-associated neurodegeneration. Here, we show that aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a major driver of the glymphatic clearance system, facilitates the elimination of extracellular tau from the brain to CSF and subsequently to deep cervical lymph nodes. Strikingly, deletion of AQP4 not only elevated tau in CSF but also markedly exacerbated phosphorylated tau deposition and the associated neurodegeneration in the brains of transgenic mice expressing P301S mutant tau. The current study identified the clearance pathway of extracellular tau in the central nervous system, suggesting that glymphatic clearance of extracellular tau is a novel regulatory mechanism whose impairment contributes to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration.</jats:p>",

Despite the tremendous progress in blue InP QDs, the synthetic method for tailoring InP core size to realize the blue‐emissive QDs still lags behind. This work suggests a synthetic method for blue‐emitting InP QDs by engineering the core size with an incipient ZnS (i‐ZnS) shell. The formation of i‐ZnS complexes, before the tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine injection (e.g., before core growth process), restrains the overgrowth of InP nuclei by rapidly forming a ZnS shell on its surface, thereby resulting in further dwarfed InP cores. With additional ZnS shell coating, the blue QDs exhibit a photoluminescence quantum yield of ≈52% at 483 nm. The origin of bandgap diminution with the increase of shell thickness, or with the utilization of ZnSe shell is unraveled via the first‐principles density functional theory simulations. Simulational evidence on InP‐core densification with the shell coating, along with accompanying changes in chemical and structural properties, is presented. The blue‐emitting InP QD device shows a maximum luminance of 1162 cd m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> and external quantum efficiency of 1.4%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To tackle the increasing electromagnetic pollution, broadband electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption materials are urgently needed. Toward this goal, traditional strategies resort to the construction of multicomponent dielectric/magnetic hybrid materials, including ternary, quaternary, or even more complicated systems. However, they always suffer from many intrinsic drawbacks in practical applications. Herein, a theory‐directed strategy is presented to design plainified EMW absorption materials (binary hybrids) via amplified interface effects, which are based on well‐designed multilayer alternating core‐shell nanostructures by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A defect‐engineered CVD graphene (DG) core composed of graphitic open edges and in‐plane defects is used as a lossy phase. Correspondingly, a CVD Si<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>layer with nanometer thickness is used as an impedance matching shell. By optimizing the alternating numbers of DG/Si<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>units, enhanced interface polarization and strong frequency dispersion behavior of permittivity (especially the real part, ε′) are obtained, which helps the plainified binary hybrids to reach an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 8.0 GHz at a thickness of 2.7 mm. Moreover, these plainified hybrids show excellent thermal and pH stability. Even after 1000 °C oxidation, for example, an EAB of 7.44 GHz coupling with a minimum reflection coefficient of −77.3 dB is still achieved.</jats:p>",

TP53 mutation not only renders PDAC resistance to chemotherapies but also drives PDAC invasiveness. Therapies targeting activating mutant KRAS are not available and the outcomes of current PDAC treatment are extremely poor. Here, we report that MMRi62, initially identified as an MDM2-MDM4–targeting small molecule with p53-independent pro-apoptotic activity, shows anti-PDAC activity in vitro and in vivo. We show that MMRi62 inhibits proliferation, clonogenic, and spheroid growth of PDAC cells by induction of cell death. MMRi62-induced cell death in PDAC is characteristic of ferroptosis that is associated with increased autophagy, increased reactive oxygen species, and lysosomal degradation of NCOA4 and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1). In addition to induced degradation of FTH1, MMRi62 also induces proteasomal degradation of mutant p53. Interestingly, MMRi62-induced ferroptosis occurs in PDAC cell lines harboring either KRAS and TP53 double mutations or single TP53 mutation. In orthotopic xenograft PDAC mouse models, MMRi62 was capable of inhibiting tumor growth in mice associated with downregulation of NCOA4 and mutant p53 in vivo. Strikingly, MMRi62 completely abrogated metastasis of orthotopic tumors to distant organs, which is consistent with MMRi62's ability to inhibit cell migration and invasion in vitro. These findings identified MMRi62 as a novel ferroptosis inducer capable of suppressing PDAC growth and overcoming metastasis.</jats:p>",

The proposed ARF features a combination of phase birefringence of 9.1 × 10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup>, a minimum loss of 185 dB km<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, a bandwidth of 133 nm, and single‐mode operation. Furthermore, the ARF shows high resistance to fiber bending and wide‐range temperature variations, thus confirming that this carefully designed ARF can serve as a practical workhorse in polarization‐related optical fiber applications.</jats:p>",

The CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@ZnO NPs had a saturation magnetization of approximately 30 emu g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and a coercivity of approximately 280 Oe. The absorbance spectra showed that the absorbance peak of the CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@ZnO NPs broadened and shifted to the right (higher wavelength) with increasing ZnO concentration. The CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@ZnO NPs with higher ZnO concentrations exhibited higher photocatalytic activities and degradation rates. The enhancement of MB degradation can be attributed to the formation of an internal structure between CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and ZnO. The degradation rate of CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@ZnO decreased slightly after each successive recycle. The results indicated that the recycled CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@ZnO NPs could be reused three times for photocatalytic degradation. As there is no significant decrease in the photocatalytic degradation after four successive recycles, the CoFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>@ZnO NPs are suitable for application in dye degradation.</jats:p>",

Compared with the patients with inactive CHB and those with immune-active CHB, the indeterminate patients exhibited intermediate but diverse risk of HCC. When HCC risk was stratified by a HBcrAg level of 10,000 U/mL, 10-year HCC cumulative incidence was 0.51% and 5.33% for low HBcrAg and high HBcrAg groups, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 4.47 (95% confidence interval: 2.62–7.63). This cutoff was validated to stratify HCC risk not only in different subgroup analyses but also in an independent Japanese cohort. Finally, the overall HBeAg-negative CHB patients could be simply reclassified into high-risk and low-risk groups by combining ALT, hepatitis B virus DNA, and HBcrAg levels in both cohorts.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>DISCUSSION:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Serum HBcrAg level of 10,000 U/mL stratifies HCC risk in HBeAg-negative patients with indeterminate phase, which is useful for optimizing their clinical management.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Because of the complex organization of wheat resistance to FHB, this pathosystem represents a relevant model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying plant susceptibility and to identify their main drivers, the pathogen’s effectors. Although the F. graminearum catalog of effectors has been well characterized at the genome scale, in planta studies are needed to confirm their effective accumulation in host tissues and to identify their role during the infection process. Taking advantage of the genetic variability from both species, a RNAseq-based profiling of gene expression was performed during an infection time course using an aggressive F. graminearum strain facing five wheat cultivars of contrasting susceptibility as well as using three strains of contrasting aggressiveness infecting a single susceptible host. Genes coding for secreted proteins and exhibiting significant expression changes along infection progress were selected to identify the effector gene candidates. During its interaction with the five wheat cultivars, 476 effector genes were expressed by the aggressive strain, among which 91% were found in all the infected hosts. Considering three different strains infecting a single susceptible host, 761 effector genes were identified, among which 90% were systematically expressed in the three strains. We revealed a robust F. graminearum core effectome of 357 genes expressed in all the hosts and by all the strains that exhibited conserved expression patterns over time. Several wheat compartments were predicted to be targeted by these putative effectors including apoplast, nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondria. Taken together, our results shed light on a highly conserved parasite strategy. They led to the identification of reliable key fungal genes putatively involved in wheat susceptibility to F. graminearum, and provided valuable information about their putative targets.</jats:p>"

In this study, we aimed to obtain hybrid materials of the dye–host matrix type, by using the sol–gel process. The silica network was generated by tetraethylorthosilicates and modified with organic siloxane derivatives: phenyltriethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane, dimethoxydimethylsilane and dimethoxydiphenylsilane. The nanocomposites obtained by embedding curcumin in siloxane matrices were deposited on polyester fabric and evaluated for their properties, relative to the type of organic network modifier used. Fabrics covered with curcuminoid hybrid systems provide a hydrophobic surface, have fluorescent properties and a UPF +50, and, therefore, they can be used in various fields where it is necessary for textiles to provide signaling, self-cleaning or protection properties against ultraviolet radiation. The coated textile materials have very good resistance properties after several repeated washing cycles, and maintain the original UV protection factor at high values even after washing or during rubbing tests.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The core cell cycle machinery is conserved from yeast to humans, and hence it is assumed that all vertebrates share the same set of players. Yet during vertebrate evolution, the genome was duplicated twice, followed by a further genome duplication in teleost fish. Thereafter, distinct genes were retained in different vertebrate lineages; some individual gene duplications also occurred. To which extent these diversifying tendencies were compensated by retaining the same expression patterns across homologous genes is not known. This study for the first time undertook a comprehensive expression analysis for the core cell cycle regulators in the chicken, focusing in on early neurula and pharyngula stages of development, with the latter representing the vertebrate phylotypic stage. We also compared our data with published data for the mouse, Xenopus and zebrafish, the other established vertebrate models. Our work shows that, while many genes are expressed widely, some are upregulated or specifically expressed in defined tissues of the chicken embryo, forming novel synexpression groups with markers for distinct developmental pathways. Moreover, we found that in the neural tube and in the somite, mRNAs of some of the genes investigated accumulate in a specific subcellular localisation, pointing at a novel link between the site of mRNA translation, cell cycle control and interkinetic nuclear movements. Finally, we show that expression patterns of orthologous genes may differ in the four vertebrate models. Thus, for any study investigating cell proliferation, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, stem cell behaviour and cancer/cancer therapy, it has to be carefully examined which of the observed effects are due to the specific model organism used, and which can be generalised.</jats:p>",

We found here that the core autophagy protein ATG9A plays a critical role in the chemotactic migration of several human cell lines, including highly invasive glioma cells. Depletion of ATG9A protein altered the formation of large and persistent filamentous actin (F-actin)–rich lamellipodia that normally drive directional migration. Using live-cell TIRF microscopy, we demonstrated that ATG9A-positive vesicles are targeted toward the migration front of polarized cells, where their exocytosis correlates with protrusive activity. Finally, we found that ATG9A was critical for efficient delivery of β1 integrin to the leading edge and normal adhesion dynamics. Collectively, our data uncover a new function for ATG9A protein and indicate that ATG9A-positive vesicles are mobilized during chemotactic stimulation to facilitate expansion of the lamellipodium and its anchorage to the extracellular matrix.</jats:p>",

Due to the prevalence of devices and digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms used in this system, it can be well compatible with a commercial coherent optical communication system.

Cranioplasty following traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke is becoming increasingly common, leading to an ever-growing clinical and research interest, especially regarding the optimal material, cost-effectiveness, and timing of cranioplasty concerning neurological recovery and complications. Consequently, heterogeneous reporting of outcomes from such diverse studies has led to limited meta-analysis ability and an ongoing risk of outcome reporting bias. This study aims to define a standardized COS for reporting in all future TBI and stroke cranioplasty studies.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>This study has four aims: (1)\tundertake a systematic review to collate the most current outcome measures used within the cranioplasty literature; (2) undertake a qualitative study to understand better the views of clinicians, patients' relatives, and allied health professionals regarding clinical outcomes following cranioplasty; (3) undertake a Delphi survey as part of the process of gaining consensus for the COS; and (4) finalize consensus through a consensus meeting resulting in the COS.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>An international steering committee has been formed to guide the development of the COS.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the phenomena of core damage and core discing in deep strata of metal mines in Laizhou area, the physical and mechanical mechanism behind these phenomena and characteristics is discussed. The analysis shows that the damage effect of deep high stress rock is obvious after in-situ unloading, the core discing occurs when the damage reaches a certain degree, and the time effect of damage increases with the increase of buried depth. The characteristics of core discing are closely related to the stress environment and the mesostructure and mineral composition of the rock. Monzogranite with a large particle size and high content of potassium feldspar is easier to occur core discing than granodiorite in this area. The mechanism of core discing in Sanshandao gold mine is as follows: tensile failure occurs in the middle of the core, and composite failure of shear and tension occurs at the edge. The crack extends from the middle of the core to the outer edge, and finally, the tensile crack and shear crack intersect and connect to form a cake crack. Considering the stress condition and strength conditions of core discing, the energy release rate of rock mass in the core discing area is large, which has the conditions for strong rock burst. In addition, the ratio of maximum stress to tensile strength at the starting position of core discing is about 6.5 in this area, which is consistent with the previous analysis, so as to provide a strong basis for calculating in-situ stress based on the core discing phenomenon.</jats:p>",

For human IgG recognition, the surface of an E-HIPFG is functionalized by goat anti-human IgG. The functionalized E-HIPFG is tested by human IgG solutions with a concentration range of 10–100 μg/mL and shows a high sensitivity of 0.018 nm/(μg/mL) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.7 μg/mL. Notably, the functionalized E-HIPFG biosensor is found to be insensitive to environmental disturbances, with a temperature sensitivity of 2.6 pm/°C, a strain sensitivity of 1.2 pm/με, and a torsion sensitivity of −23.566 nm/(rad/mm).

One data resource seldom incorporated into DSTs are species distribution models (SDMs), which can produce spatial predictions of habitat suitability. Outputs from SDMs can inform management decisions, but their complexity and inaccessibility can limit their use by resource managers or policy makers. To overcome these limitations, we present the Invasive Species Habitat Tool (INHABIT), a novel, web-based DST built with R Shiny to display spatial predictions and tabular summaries of habitat suitability from SDMs for invasive plants across the contiguous United States. INHABIT provides actionable science to support the prevention and management of invasive species.

Spike proteins consist of S1 and S2 domains, which recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and contain the viral fusion machinery, respectively. Ostensibly, the binding of spike trimers to ACE2 receptors promotes dissociation of the S1 domains and exposure of the fusion machinery, although the molecular details of this process have yet to be observed. We report the development of bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models consistent with cryo-electron tomography data, and the use of CG molecular dynamics simulations to investigate viral binding and S2 core exposure. We show that spike trimers cooperatively bind to multiple ACE2 dimers at virion-cell interfaces in a manner distinct from binding between soluble proteins, which processively induces S1 dissociation. We also simulate possible variant behavior using perturbed CG models, and find that ACE2-induced S1 dissociation is primarily sensitive to conformational state populations and the extent of S1/S2 cleavage, rather than ACE2 binding affinity. These simulations reveal an important concerted interaction between spike trimers and ACE2 dimers that primes the virus for membrane fusion and entry.</jats:p>"

Cystectomy, alone or with other treatments, is used to treat most BCa patients, as it offers the best chance of cure. However, even with curative intent, 29% of patients experience relapse of the cancer, 50% of which occur within the first year of surgery. This study aims to use the liquid biopsy to noninvasively detect disease and discover prognostic markers for disease progression. Using the third generation high-definition single cell assay (HDSCA3.0), 50 bladder cancer patient samples and 50 normal donor (ND) samples were analyzed for circulating rare events in the peripheral blood (PB), including circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and large extracellular vesicles (LEVs). Here, we show that (i) CTCs and LEVs are detected in the PB of BCa patients prior to cystectomy, (ii) there is a high heterogeneity of CTCs, and (iii) liquid biopsy analytes correlate with clinical data elements. We observed a significant difference in the incidence of rare cells and LEVs between BCa and ND samples (median of 74.61 cells/mL and 30.91 LEVs/mL vs. 34.46 cells/mL and 3.34 LEVs/mL, respectively). Furthermore, using classification models for the liquid biopsy data, we achieved a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 92% for the identification of BCa patient samples. Taken together, these data support the clinical utility of the liquid biopsy in detecting BCa, as well as the potential for predicting cancer recurrence and survival post-cystectomy to better inform treatment decisions in BCa care.</jats:p>"

NK cells eliminated disseminated tumor cells from the lung within 24 hr of arrival, but not thereafter. Intravital dynamic imaging revealed that 50% of NK-tumor cell encounters lead to tumor cell death in the first 4 hr after tumor cell arrival, but after 24 hr of arrival, nearly 100% of the interactions result in the survival of the tumor cell. During this 24-hr period, the probability of ERK activation in NK cells upon encountering the tumor cells was decreased from 68% to 8%, which correlated with the loss of the activating ligand CD155/PVR/Necl5 from the tumor cell surface. Thus, by quantitatively visualizing, the NK-tumor cell interaction at the early stage of metastasis, we have revealed the crucial parameters of NK cell immune surveillance in the lung.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sea Island cotton (<jats:italic>Gossypium barbadense</jats:italic>) is world-renowned for its superior natural fiber. Although fiber strength is one of the most important fiber quality traits, genes contributing to fiber strength are poorly understood. Production of sea island cotton also is inextricably linked to improving its relatively low yield, thus enhancing the importance of joint improvement of both fiber quality and yield. We used genomic variation to uncover the genetic evidence of trait improvement resulting from pedigree breeding of Sea Island cotton. This pedigree was aimed at improving fiber strength and yielded an elite cultivar, XH35. Using a combination of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and selection screens, we detected 82 putative fiber-strength-related genes. Expression analysis confirmed a calmodulin-like gene, <jats:italic>GbCML7</jats:italic>, which enhanced fiber strength in a specific haplotype. This gene is a major-effect gene, which interacts with a minor-effect gene, <jats:italic>GbTUA3</jats:italic>, facilitating the enhancement of fiber strength in a synergistic fashion. Moreover, <jats:italic>GbCML7</jats:italic> participates in the cooperative improvement of fiber strength, fiber length, and fiber uniformity, though a slight compromise exists between the first two of these traits and the latter. Importantly, <jats:italic>GbCML7</jats:italic> is shown to boost yield in some backgrounds by increasing multiple yield components to varying degrees, especially boll number. Our work provides valuable genomic evidence and a key genetic factor for the joint improvement of fiber quality and yield in Sea Island cotton.</jats:p>"

The relationship between flocking propensity, foraging habitat quality, and interspecific competition can be altered by human-induced habitat degradation. Here we take a close look at sociality within two ecologically important flock-leader (core) species, the Carolina chickadee (<jats:italic>Poecile carolinensis</jats:italic>) and tufted titmouse (<jats:italic>Baeolophus bicolor</jats:italic>), to better understand how degradation of foraging habitat quality affects mixed-species flocking dynamics. We compared interactions of free ranging wild birds across a gradient of foraging habitat quality in three managed forest remnants. Specifically, we examined aspects of the social network at each site, including network density, modularity, and species assortativity. Differences in the social networks between each end of our habitat gradient suggest that elevated levels of interspecific association are more valuable in the habitat with low quality foraging conditions. This conclusion is supported by two additional findings: First, foraging height for the subordinate Carolina chickadee relative to the tufted titmouse decreased with an increase in the number of satellite species in the most disturbed site but not in the other two sites. Second, the chickadee gargle call rate, an acoustic signal emitted during agonistic encounters between conspecifics, was relatively higher at the high-quality site. Collectively, these results suggest an increase in heterospecific associations increases the value of cross-species information flow in degraded habitats.</jats:p>"

In this review, we described the role of cell-to-cell signaling by the DSF molecule and iron in the regulation of virulence-associated functions. Although DSF and iron are involved in the regulation of several virulence-associated functions, members of the Xanthomonas group of plant pathogens exhibit atypical patterns of regulation. Atypical patterns contribute to the adaptation to different lifestyles. Studies on DSF and iron biology indicate that virulence-associated functions can be regulated in completely contrasting fashions by the same signaling system in closely related xanthomonads. </jats:p>",

Herein, the CdS@CsPbBr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> core–shell microwire (MW) heterojunction was structured via a two-step chemical vapor deposition and was further used to fabricate a UV–Vis photodetector. The photodetector performance is greatly dependent on the thickness of the CsPbBr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> shell. Growth time of 60 min could produce about 80 nm thick CsPbBr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> shell with excellent coverage and adhesion, resulting in optimized performance parameters. As compared with bare cadmium sulfide (CdS) MW photodetector, the CdS@CsPbBr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> core–shell MW heterojunction photodetector exhibits relatively high ratio of photocurrent and dark current (10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup>), much higher light responsivity (319.79 A W<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and faster response time (6.6 ms). The responsivity is 3.3 times to the value of bare CdS photodetector and the photocurrent increases nearly 10 times. The significant performance parameters mainly result from the formation of a type-II energy band structure and the reduction of the defects states on CdS surface, leading to the obviously improved carriers transport process. The results indicate that the CdS@CsPbBr<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> core–shell MW heterojunction is a promising potential candidate to construct high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and α‐carbons of oligo‐NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo‐NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo‐NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo‐NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.</jats:p>",

However, the need for space-saving solutions with high shielding performance requires the development of a three-dimensional (3D) modelling procedure capable of predicting the screening properties for different orientations of the applied field. In this paper, we use a 3D numerical model based on a vector potential formulation to investigate the shielding ability of SC screens with cylindrical symmetry and a height/diameter aspect ratio close to unity, without and with the superimposition of a ferromagnetic (FM) circular shell. The chosen materials were MgB<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and soft iron. First, the outcomes of the calculations were compared with the experimental data obtained with different shielding arrangements, achieving a notable agreement in both axial field (AF) and transverse field (TF) orientations. Then, we used this validated modelling approach to investigate how the magnetic mitigation properties of a cup-shaped SC bulk can be improved by the superimposition of a coaxial FM cup. Calculations highlighted that the FM addition is very efficient in enhancing the shielding factors (SFs) in the TF orientation. Assuming a working temperature of 30 K and using a layout with the FM cup protruding over the SC one, SFs up to eight times greater than those with a single SC cup were attained at applied field up to 0.15 T, reaching values equal to or higher than 10<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the inner half of the shield. In the AF orientation, the addition of the same FM cup incurs a modest worsening at low fields, but at the same time it widens the applied field range where SF ⩾ 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> occurs near the close extremity of the shield to over 1 T.</jats:p>",

Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) are considered one of the promising compact and coherent room temperature signal sources for terahertz applications. In this work, the fabrication process and fabrication challenges for an RTD THz oscillator with a cylindrical resonant cavity are discussed. Successful fabrication of 3D metallic structures with a height of 2–5 μm and a feature size down to 0.5 μm was achieved by combining the traditional trilayer resist process with the dose-modulated (gray-tone) electron-beam (EB) lithography process. It was shown that two-step EB exposure could be used in thick (&amp;gt;2.4 μm) PMMA resist to achieve predictable and controllable fabrication of V-shaped metallic structures with lateral sizes down to 0.5 μm. Applicability of the described fabrication approach was proven by the measurement of oscillation characteristics for the fabricated RTD THz oscillators. Successful operation of the RTD oscillator devices confirms good electrical contact between the top contact of the RTD mesa structure and the RTD pillar structure as well as between the resonant cavity and antenna parts. The fabrication approach described in this work allowed us to eliminate parasitic capacitance formed around RTD mesa in the first fabrication trial and achieve a frequency increase of up to 200 GHz for RTD THz oscillators operating at frequencies 1.5–1.7 THz. The described fabrication approach may also be applicable for the fabrication of 3D metallic structures with a feature size less than 0.5 μm and a height more than 2 μm with EB energies above 50 keV.</jats:p>",

Applying SCMA technology to the field of optical communication has broad prospects, which solves the access problem of a large number of users in optical access network. In this paper, a transmission system based on SCMA over multi-core fiber is proposed. The SCMA coding signal transmission at 30 Gb/s is successfully implemented on a seven-core fiber, which four of seven-core is only used. Its bit error rate (BER) can achieve forward error correction (FEC) limit (BER is 3.8 × 10−3) when the received optical power is -10 dBm. And this experiment verifies the performance of the proposed scheme. In addition, we propose a scheme to reduce the complexity of message passing algorithm (MPA) at the receiver by using the core of fiber dimension. Compared with original MPA, this scheme reduces the number of users superimposed on the same resource block. From the second experiment, for a BER of FEC limit the SNR penalty is∼1 dB for the proposed MPA compared to original MPA.

However, the biological basis of the proposed technology has not been established. To investigate underlying pathophysiology, we conducted controlled infection experiments on Vero E6 cells in vitro and K18-hACE2 mice in vivo. Potentially infectious culture supernatant or mouse oral lavage samples were treated with ethanol or 75% (v/v) Trizol for attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy and proteomics, or RT-PCR, respectively. Controlled infection with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 elicited strong biochemical changes in culture supernatant/oral lavage despite a lack of viral replication, determined by RT-PCR or a cell culture infectious dose 50% assay. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced additional FTIR signals over UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 infection in both cell and mouse models, which correspond to aggregated proteins and RNA. Proteomics of mouse oral lavage revealed increased secretion of kallikreins and immune modulatory proteins. Next, we collected saliva from a cohort of human participants (n = 104) and developed a predictive model for COVID-19 using partial least squares discriminant analysis. While high sensitivity of 93.48% was achieved through leave-one-out cross-validation, COVID-19 patients testing negative on follow-up on the day of saliva sampling using RT-PCR was poorly predicted in this model. Importantly, COVID-19 vaccination did not lead to the misclassification of COVID-19 negatives. Finally, meta-analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced increases in the amide II band in all arms of this study and in recently published cohort studies, indicative of altered β-sheet structures in secreted proteins. In conclusion, this study reveals a consistent secretory pathophysiological response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as a simple, robust method for COVID-19 saliva screening using ATR-FTIR.</jats:p>"

However, the detailed temporal changes in the concentrations of comprehensive metabolites and hormones over a long time by oral glucose ingestion are uncharacterized. We measured 83 metabolites and 7 hormones in 20 healthy human subjects in response to glucose ingestion. We characterized temporal patterns of blood molecules by four features: (i) the decomposability into “amplitude” and “rate” components, (ii) the similarity of temporal patterns among individuals, (iii) the relation of molecules over time among individuals, and (iv) the similarity of temporal patterns among molecules. Glucose and glucose metabolism-related hormones indicated a rapid increase, and citrulline and lipids, which indicated a rapid decrease, returned to fasting levels faster than amino acids. Compared to glucose metabolism-related molecules and lipids, amino acids showed similar temporal patterns among individuals. The four features of temporal patterns of blood molecules by oral glucose ingestion characterize the differences among individuals and among molecules.</jats:p>"

However, the consequence of human astrocyte reactivity in response to specific contexts and within neural networks is obscure. Here, we devised a straightforward bioengineered neural organoid culture approach entailing transcription factor–driven direct differentiation of neurons and astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells combined with genetically encoded tools for dual cell-selective activation. This strategy revealed that Gq-GPCR activation via chemogenetics in astrocytes promotes a rise in intracellular calcium followed by induction of immediate early genes and thrombospondin 1. However, astrocytes also undergo NF-κB nuclear translocation and secretion of inflammatory proteins, correlating with a decreased evoked firing rate of cocultured optogenetic neurons in suboptimal conditions, without overt neurotoxicity. Altogether, this study clarifies the intrinsic reactivity of human astrocytes in response to targeting GPCRs and delivers a bioengineered approach for organoid-based disease modeling and preclinical drug testing.</jats:p>",

Oligo‐NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen‐bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and α‐carbons of oligo‐NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo‐NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo‐NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo‐NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.</jats:p>",

Advanced HPV-negative HNSCC may be treated with surgery, chemoradiation, targeted therapy, or immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). There is considerable need for predictive biomarkers for these treatments. Defects in DNA repair capacity and loss of cell-cycle checkpoints sensitize tumors to cytotoxic therapies, and can contribute to phenotypes such as elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB), associated with response to ICI.

Although water, nutrients, and other molecules can be transferred between ramets via the rhizomes, inter-ramet communication in response to spatially heterogeneous nitrogen availability is not well understood. We studied the response of ramet pairs to heterogeneous nitrogen availability using a split hydroponic system that allowed each ramet root to be exposed to different conditions. Ammonium uptake was compensatively enhanced in the sufficient-side root when roots of the ramet pairs were exposed to ammonium-sufficient and ammonium-deficient conditions. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that a gene regulatory network for effective ammonium assimilation and amino acid biosynthesis was activated in the sufficient-side roots. Allocation of absorbed nitrogen from the nitrogen-sufficient to the nitrogen-deficient ramets was rather limited. Nitrogen was preferentially used for newly growing axillary buds on the sufficient-side ramets. Biosynthesis of trans-zeatin (tZ), a cytokinin, was upregulated in response to the nitrogen supply, but tZ appeared not to target the compensatory regulation. Our results also implied that the O. longistaminata putative ortholog of rice (Oryza sativa) C-terminally encoded peptide1 plays a role as a nitrogen-deficient signal in inter-ramet communication, providing compensatory upregulation of nitrogen assimilatory genes. These results provide insights into the molecular basis for efficient growth strategies of asexually proliferating plants growing in areas where the distribution of ammonium ions is spatially heterogeneous.</jats:p>",

However, the underlying molecular cause of chalkiness remains largely unknown. Here, we cloned the F-box gene WHITE-CORE RATE 1 (WCR1), which negatively regulates grain chalkiness and improves grain quality in rice. A functional A/G variation in the promoter region of WCR1 generates the alleles WCR1A and WCR1G, which originated from tropical japonica and wild rice Oryza ruﬁpogon, respectively. OsDOF17 is a transcriptional activator that binds to the AAAAG cis-element in the WCR1A promoter. WCR1 positively affects the transcription of the metallothionein gene MT2b and interacts with MT2b to inhibit its 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to decreased reactive oxygen species production and delayed programmed cell death in rice endosperm. This, in turn, leads to reduced chalkiness. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying rice chalkiness and identify the promising natural variant WCR1A, with application potential for rice breeding.</jats:p>",

These infections are asymptomatic during vegetative host growth, with associations between asexual Epichloë spp. and their hosts considered mutualistic. However, the sexual cycle of Epichloë spp. involves virulent growth, characterized by the envelopment and sterilization of a developing host inflorescence by a dense sheath of mycelia known as a stroma. Microscopic analysis of stromata revealed a dramatic increase in hyphal propagation and host degradation compared with asymptomatic tissues. RNAseq was used to identify differentially expressed genes in asymptomatic vs stromatized tissues from 3 diverse Epichloë–host associations. Comparative analysis identified a core set of 135 differentially expressed genes that exhibited conserved transcriptional changes across all 3 associations. The core differentially expressed genes more strongly expressed during virulent growth encode proteins associated with host suppression, digestion, adaptation to the external environment, a biosynthetic gene cluster, and 5 transcription factors that may regulate Epichloë stroma formation. An additional 5 transcription factor encoding differentially expressed genes were suppressed during virulent growth, suggesting they regulate mutualistic processes. Expression of biosynthetic gene clusters for natural products that suppress herbivory was universally suppressed during virulent growth, and additional biosynthetic gene clusters that may encode production of novel host-protective natural products were identified. A comparative analysis of 26 Epichloë genomes found a general decrease in core differentially expressed gene conservation among asexual species, and a specific decrease in conservation for the biosynthetic gene cluster expressed during virulent growth and an unusual uncharacterized gene.</jats:p>",

While standard induction therapies, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) induce clinical remission (i.e., complete response) in approximately 50% of SLE patients with nephritis, many patients fail to respond. Therapeutic response is often not assessed until 6–12 months after beginning treatment. Those patients that fail to respond to treatment continue to accumulate organ damage, thus, there is a critical need to predict which patients will fail therapy before beginning treatment, allowing physicians to optimize therapy. Our previous studies demonstrated elevated urine, but not serum, glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in SLE patients with nephritis compared to SLE patients without nephritis, suggesting the urine GSLs were derived from the kidney. In this study, we measured the GSLs hexosylceramide and lactosylceramide in extracellular vesicles isolated from longitudinal urine samples of LN patients that were treated with MMF for 12 months. GSL levels were significantly elevated in the baseline samples (prior to treatment) of non-responders compared to complete responders. While a few other proteins measured in the whole urine were higher in non-responders at baseline, only GSLs demonstrated a significant ability to discriminate treatment response in lupus nephritis patients.</jats:p>"

RIPK2 inhibition by preclinical and clinical drugs inactivates the noncanonical RIPK2/MKK7/c-Myc pathway and effectively impairs PC metastatic outgrowth.

It consists of a set of twenty-first-century projections with two regional climate models (RCMs) downscaling three global climate model (GCM) simulations from the CMIP5 program, for two greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCP8.5 and RCP2.6), over nine CORDEX domains at ∼25-km grid spacing. Illustrative examples from the initial analysis of this ensemble are presented, covering a wide range of topics, such as added value of RCM nesting, extreme indices, tropical and extratropical storms, monsoons, ENSO, severe storm environments, emergence of change signals, and energy production. They show that the CORDEX-CORE EXP-I ensemble can provide downscaled information of unprecedented comprehensiveness to increase understanding of processes relevant for regional climate change and impacts, and to assess the added value of RCMs. The CORDEX-CORE EXP-I dataset, which will be incrementally augmented with new simulations, is intended to be a public resource available to the scientific and end-user communities for application to process studies, impacts on different socioeconomic sectors, and climate service activities. The future of the CORDEX-CORE initiative is also discussed.</jats:p>",

Objectives: In this study, we evaluated the effects of local deferoxamine injection as an angiogenic molecule and core decompression to treat Kienböck‎ disease. Methods: In a pilot clinical trial, 8 patients with stage I to IIIA of Kienböck‎ disease were treated with core decompression and local deferoxamine injection (0.5 mL 500 mg/mL). The outcome measures included wrist range of motions, pinch and grip strength, patient-rated ‎wrist/hand evaluation (PRWE), a short form of disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (Quick-DASH), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. The assessment of lunate revascularization was also done by T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. All measurements were done before the intervention and 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. Results: Wrist flexion, extension, ulnar and ‎radial deviation, and pinch and grip strength were continuously improved over the postoperative periods. These improvements were statistically significant. The mean final pinch and grip strength averaged 87.4% and 72.8% of the non-involved hand, respectively. PRWE, Quick-DASH, and VAS scores were also continuously and significantly improved over the study period. The lunate vascularization revealed a continuous improvement in 6(75%) patients. Conclusion: Local deferoxamine injection in addition to core decompression could improve the radiologic and clinical outcomes of patients suffering from Kienböck‎ disease.</jats:p>"

In order to confirm the role of ITG turbulence in this process, we set out to establish experimentally the relation between core density fluctuations, turbulent heat flux and global confinement. With this aim, we consider the scenarios found in the previous work and carry out power balance analysis for a number of representative ones, including some featuring high ion temperature. We also evaluate the global energy confinement time and discuss it in the context of the ISS04 inter-stellarator scaling.

This is consistent with ITG turbulence limiting the ion temperature at the core of W7-X. In contrast, when turbulence is reduced following a decrease in collisionality, no changes are observed in transport or confinement. This could be explained by ITG modes being combined with TEM turbulence when the latter is destabilized at low collisionalities.</jats:p>",

Several BEN domain factors are known as transcriptional repressors, but, overall, relatively little is known of how BEN factors identify their targets in humans. In particular, X-ray structures of BEN domain:DNA complexes are only known for<jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>factors bearing a single BEN domain, which lack direct vertebrate orthologs. Here, we characterize several mammalian BEN domain (BD) factors, including from two NACC family BTB-BEN proteins and from BEND3, which has four BDs. In vitro selection data revealed sequence-specific binding activities of isolated BEN domains from all of these factors. We conducted detailed functional, genomic, and structural studies of BEND3. We show that BD4 is a major determinant for in vivo association and repression of endogenous BEND3 targets. We obtained a high-resolution structure of BEND3-BD4 bound to its preferred binding site, which reveals how BEND3 identifies cognate DNA targets and shows differences with one of its non-DNA-binding BEN domains (BD1). Finally, comparison with our previous invertebrate BEN structures, along with additional structural predictions using AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold, reveal distinct strategies for target DNA recognition by different types of BEN domain proteins. Together, these studies expand the DNA recognition activities of BEN factors and provide structural insights into sequence-specific DNA binding by mammalian BEN proteins.</jats:p>",

BRD2 and BRD4, which belong to the BET family, are promising drug targets for the management of chronic diseases. The discovery of new scaffold molecules, a pyrano-1,3-oxazine derivative (NSC 328111; NS5) and phenanthridinone-based derivatives (L10 and its core moiety L10a), as inhibitors of BRD2 bromodomains BD1 and BD2, respectively, has recently been reported. The compound NS5 has a significant inhibitory effect on BRD2 in glioblastoma. Here, the crystal structure of BRD2 BD2 in complex with NS5, refined to 2.0 Å resolution, is reported. Moreover, as the previously reported crystal structures of the BD1–NS5 complex and the BD2–L10a complex possess moderate electron density corresponding to the respective ligands, the crystal structures of these complexes were re-evaluated using new X-ray data. Together with biochemical studies using wild-type BRD2 BD1 and BD2 and various mutants, it is confirmed that the pyrano-1,3-oxazine and phenanthridinone derivatives are indeed potent inhibitors of BRD2 bromodomains.</jats:p>",

Overcoming this problem is challenging as these fungi can be highly resistant to approved chemical fungicides. There is thus a need to develop and introduce fundamentally new plant and crop protection strategies for sustainable agricultural production. Highly stable extracellular antifungal proteins (AFPs) and their rationally designed peptide derivatives (PDs) constitute feasible options to meet this challenge. In the present study, their potential for topical application to protect plants and crops as combinatorial biofungicides is supported by the investigation of two <jats:italic>Neosartorya</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Aspergillus</jats:italic>) <jats:italic>fischeri</jats:italic> AFPs (NFAP and NFAP2) and their γ-core PDs.

To assign ages to radar reflections and connect them over large areas in the ice sheet, the layer genesis has to be understood on a microphysical scale. Synthetic radar trace modelling based on the dielectric profile of ice cores allows for the assignation of observed physical properties’ variations on the decimetre scale to radar reflectors extending from the coring site to a regional or even whole-ice-sheet scale. In this paper we rely on the available dielectric profiling data of the northern Greenland deep ice cores: NGRIP, NEEM and EGRIP. The three records are well suited for assigning an age model to the stratigraphic radar-mapped layers, and linking up the reflector properties to observations in the cores. Our modelling results show that the internal reflections are mainly due to conductivity changes. Furthermore, we deduce fabric characteristics at the EGRIP drill site from two-way-travel-time differences of along and across-flow polarized radarwave reflections of selected horizons (below 980 m). These indicate in deeper parts of the ice column an across-flow concentrated<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>-axis fabric.</jats:p>",

In rodents, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the hippocampus (HPC) control the expression of contextual fear memory generalization. Consistently, ACC projections to the ventral HPC contribute to contextual fear generalization. However, the roles of ACC projections to the dorsal HPC (dHPC) in fear generalization are unclear, although the dHPC is required for the retrieval of recent contextual fear memory. To investigate these roles, we examined the effects of optogenetic silencing and stimulation of these projections in contextual fear generalization at the recent and remote time points. Mice underwent contextual fear conditioning and, at 1 or 28 d later, were tested in the conditioned chamber, a novel context, or a similar context. Optogenetic activation of these projections induced higher freezing in mice in the novel context compared with the control group at a recent (1-d), but not remote (28-d), time point following conditioning, suggesting that activation of this pathway enhances contextual fear generalization. In contrast, optogenetic inactivation of these projections induced lower freezing in the similar context compared with the control group at a recent, but not remote, time point, suggesting that inactivation of this pathway impaired contextual fear generalization. These observations suggest that the ACC to the dHPC projections positively regulate the expression of contextual fear generalization when contextual fear memory is recent.</jats:p>",

We also show that the best results are obtained by combining the <jats:italic>ν</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub> scaling relation with stellar spectra. This resolves the notorious problem of degeneracies, which is particularly important for F-type stars.</jats:p>",
