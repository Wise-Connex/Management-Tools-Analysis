      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article recentres labour process theory in the analysis of the South African manufacturing sector to challenge the perception that precarious workers in the formal economy are largely “flexible extras” unrelated to the “core” of production. Through case study analysis of two manufacturing workplaces in Gauteng, South Africa, we demonstrate how precarious workers are both core to production and to the production of surplus value. Our analysis demonstrates how employers have increasingly restructured work through reclassifying large parts of the labour process as “non-core”. This trend has accelerated in recent years as employers seek to evade new legal responsibilities following amendments to the Labour Relations Act in 2014. Despite employers’ attempts to redefine the labour of precarious workers as non-core, we demonstrate that these workers nevertheless play an increasingly central role in the valorisation regimes of manufacturing companies – rendering them core to the production of surplus value for manufacturing capital. Our analysis problematises Von Holdt and Webster’s (2005) core/non-core schema for analysing the South African labour force, which locates precarious workers in the formal sector in the non-core. We argue that while this schema has some utility in describing the make-up of the labour force, its abstraction from an analysis of the labour process obscures the fact that precarious work has become central to manufacturing capital’s valorisation strategy. Finally, the article reflects on how precarious workers are attempting to organise within and in parallel to trade unions. This analysis highlights the importance of going beyond analysing trade unions if we are to contribute to rebuilding the labour movement under conditions of precarity.\nKEYWORDS: labour-process theory; precarious work; surplus value; labour movement; manufacturing; South Africa</jats:p>"

In the hydrodynamic regime the respective space-time profiles scale ballisticly. The particular case of interest is a jump from low to high pressure at uniform temperature and zero mean velocity. Thereby the scaling function for the average stretch (also free volume) is forced to change sign. By direct inspection, the hydrodynamic equations for the Toda lattice seem to be singular at zero stretch. In our contribution we report on numerical solutions and convincingly establish that nevertheless the self-similar solution exhibits smooth behavior. </jats:p>"

Previous laboratory research indicated that bacterial isolates indigen from petroleum reservoir, MSD4 and MSD5, with the amount of inoculum ratio 1:1 in recovery medium can reduce the viscosity value and interfacial tension of oil. The aim of this research was to determine the amount of oil recovery from low saturated oil in  limestone artificial core by using bacterial core flooding method, also to determine the physical character and chemical character changes in limestone rocks and petroleum. Each bacteria, MSD4 and MSD5, were adapted to the medium SMSS that have been added by 5% oil. Inoculum of indigen bacterial cultures to be injected into the limestone core was bred in the SMSS culture medium added molasses with a varied amount, as much as 1%, 2%, and 3%. From the those variation, the amount of molasses added as much as 1% in the medium SMSS, is known that MSD4 and MSD5 cultures can grow to the highest μ respectively at the age of 16-hour and 24-hour with a value at 0.9992 hours-1 and 0, 9993 hours-1. Inoculum MSD4 and MSD5 cultures with the amount of 1:1 ratio and each bacterial cell density 107-108 cells/mL, were injected into artificial limestone cores with oil saturated less than 15%. The value of rock porosity range used for the simulation of bacterial flooding is 37% -42%, while permeability range used low permeability value (1mD-10mD) and fair permeability value (10mD-50mD). High oil recovery factor (RF%) were obtained from bacterial flooding simulation and incubated for 7 days in a temperature of 55°C on medium SMSS for cores with low permeability values and fair, has a range of 16,3% - 32% and 12% -15,3%. The result of microorganisms activity in limestone rocks from a change on physical character, have a range at -41,8% - 698% on permeability value and a range at -63,85% - 1,03% on porosity value. Indicator of bacterial attachment on limestone cores can be determined by photomicrographs analyzing Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the spin-triplet superconductivity arises from the condensation of spinful Cooper pairs, its full characterization requires not only charge ordering, but also spin ordering. For a two-dimensional (2D) easy-plane spin-triplet superconductor, this na\\\"{i}vely seems to suggest the possibility of two distinct Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transitions, one in the charge sector and the other in the spin sector. However, it has been recognized that there are actually three possible BKT transitions, involving the deconfinement of, respectively, the conventional vortices, the merons and the half-quantum vortices with vorticity in both the charge and the spin current.  By considering equal-spin-pairing spin-triplet superconductors with bulk spin degeneracy, we show how all the transitions can be characterized by the relation between the voltage drop and the spin-polarized current bias. This study reveals that, due to the hitherto unexamined transport of half-quantum vortices, there is an upper bound on the spin supercurrent in a quasi-long range ordered spin-triplet superconductor, which provides a means for half-quantum vortex detection via transport measurements and deeper understanding of fluctuation effects in superconductor-based spintronic devices.</jats:p>"

Objetivo: el objetivo de esta investigación es determinar si existen diferencias de actividad electromiográfica en la musculatura del recto abdominal y oblicuo externo entre practicantes de musculación y practicantes de calistenia. Metodología: el estudio es de tipo comparativo, de diseño no experimental, transversal de enfoque cuantitativo en una muestra de 20 sujetos; 10 practicantes de calistenia y 10 que entrenan con ejercicios de musculación clásicos. Resultados: los ejercicios que tuvieron mayor respuesta electromiográfica fueron abdominal en suspensión y abdominal inclinado. Conclusiones: la calistenia es una alternativa viable para la activación muscular a nivel del Core.</jats:p>"

Core Creativity offers ways to go beyond the limitations of ordinary creativity to access the core creativity that comes from the very center of your being: the depths of your unconscious. Dr. Ronald Alexander has decades of experience working with core creatives—artists who regularly draw on deep creativity and have learned what to do when the well seems to have run dry. Using mindfulness practice, meditation and visualizations, and habits and mindsets of highly creative people, anyone can experience the flow of ideas as if from an infinitely abundant source. </p>\n          <p>Core Creativity employs stories of ordinary but highly creative people alongside the latest research that helps people get unstuck. Too often, the mind’s Wi-Fi signal is too weak for the really big ideas to load, but Core Creativity offers readers help with establishing a mindfulness practice; exercises for enhancing creativity and fostering better decision-making; key insights from personal interview with highly creative artists including music producer Val Garay, director Amy Ziering, and actor Denis Quaid; and guidance for reclaiming your creative self so you can achieve profound transformation. Core creativity allows you to come up with ideas that are both fresh and original and experience such a deep state of creative flow that it might feel as if you only played a minor role in the process of creativity. For anyone seeking to enhance their creative abilities and achieve their goals, Core Creativity presents the possibility of genuine breakthroughs.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, there are several pieces of research on designing and implementing new cryptographic algorithms that are lightweight and resistant to several, if not major forms of security attacks. However, some algorithms such as the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), which has been around for some time is yet to record any real threat against its functionality. To ensure its continued usage, current implementations rely on multiphase encryption where it is combined with other algorithms such as ROTation (ROT) and Data Encryption Standard (DES) for maximum security strength. Multiphase encryption implies that there is a tendency for an increase in hardware area and a reduction in overall speed. In such cases, having fast and reduced area algorithms are much desired. This paper, therefore, proposes an efficient hardware implementation of the IDEA cipher that is based on arithmetic modulo multiplication—one of the main computations of the IDEA—on a novel Vedic multiplier architecture. The increase in efficiency of the IDEA crypto architecture and the reduction in resources utilization is achieved through an enhancement of its structural architecture to utilize a fixed set of resources for all eight identical rounds of computation and the use of a proposed fast and lightweight Vedic hardware multiplier. The proposed hardware modification and resulting architecture are designed using the Xilinx ISE and Vivado tools. The architecture is synthesized using Precision Synthesis Tool (PS) and simulated using Modelsim SE 10.6d and ISIM simulation tools. The proposed IDEA cipher is 100% more efficient when designed based on the Vedic multiplier compared to existing designs. The hardware architecture is implemented on Spartan-6-FGG484 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Verilog HDL. Verified results show that the proposed Vedic-based IDEA occupied 212 Slices with the Vedic multiplier only occupying 28 Slices out of the total 212. The proposed architecture operates at a maximum frequency of 253.3 MHz.</jats:p>",

The etection was performed for the bacterial strains cultivated in Luria-Bertani liquid medium. The obtained results indicate that E. coli O157:H7 and MRSA can be detected within 30 min at a high sensitivity of 101 CFU/mL.

In this context, the WASA project made use of a multidisciplinary approach for defining the extension and describing the characteristics of the Late Pleistocene to Holocene deposits in the central Wadden Sea region. In addition to sub-bottom transects, more than 140 sediment cores were taken in such an area for stratigraphic reconstruction, making use of multi-proxy analysis. To harmonize these data with the existing regional core database (LBEG archive) a new core catalogue was developed, that allows the identification of the local Late Quaternary sedimentary sequences and their characteristic facies. The WASA core catalogue has been successfully applied for reviewing the published data about the stratigraphic sequence of the Wadden Sea, for a better definition in terms of stratigraphic sequences and spatial extent of the Quaternary geological evolution of the region, and for a detailed reconstruction of the coastal palaeoenvironments.</jats:p>"

Makalede\n                        kullanılan veriler için “Fırat Üniversitesi Sosyal ve Beşeri Bilimler Etik Kurulu 10.02.2022 tarihli, 18 sayılı kararına göre” etik kurul onayı alınmıştır. Araştırmaya Türkiye’de (Sakarya ili) düzenli bir şekilde yüzme sporuyla\n                        ilgilenen toplam 24 sporcu katılmıştır (Erkek 12, Kız 12) ve katılımda gönüllülük esas alınmıştır. Çalışmada sporcuların yaş ortalamaları 8,08, boy ortalamaları 134,71 cm ve kilo ortalamaları ise 34,625 kg olarak belirlenmiştir.\n                        Haftada 4 gün antrenman yapan yüzücülere 2 gün antrenman programlarına ek olarak core egzersiz uygulanmıştır. Uygulanan antrenmanın 24 sporcu üzerindeki etkisini belirlemek amacıyla ön test – son test verilerinin analizi normallik\n                        sınamasının ardından PairedSamples T Test, core egzersizin cinsiyet üzerindeki etkisini görebilmek adına ise ön test – son test verileri IndepentSample T Test ile incelenmiştir. Sonuç olarak core egzersiz uygulamasının kız sporcularda\n                        30 saniye şınav, 30 saniye mekik, dikey sıçrama ve 50 metre serbest stil yüzme derecelerinde son test lehine anlamlı farklılık oluşturduğu gözlemlenirken, erkek sporcular 30 saniye şınav, 30 saniye mekik, dikey sıçrama testlerinde\n                        anlamlı farklılık olduğu fakat 50 metre serbest stil yüzme derecesinde anlamlılık olmadığı sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Cinsiyet üzerindeki etkinin incelendiği verilerde sadece dikey sıçrama testinde anlamlı farklılık oluştuğu görülmüştür.\n                        Çalışma genel olarak ele alındığında; çocuk yüzücülerin antrenman programlarına eklenecek core egzersizin yüzme becerisi ve fiziksel yetiler yönünden geliştirici olacağı fakat elde edilen veriler neticesinde cinsiyet üzerinde büyük\n                        bir etkiye sahip olmayacağı öne sürülmektedir. Daha sonra yapılacak araştırmaların evren ve örnekleminin genişletilmesinin yanında farklı yaş grubu ve spor branşlarının üzerinde durulmasının literatüre katkı sağlayacağı düşünülmektedir.</jats:p>"

Traditional high-rise building design method generally assumes the structure is fixed at the base, because the influence of soil-structure interaction is considered to be beneficial to the response of structures under the earthquake excitation. However, recent earthquakes and studies indicated that SSI may exert detrimental effects on commonly used structural systems. In this study, a numerical soil-structure model is established in <jats:italic>Abaqus</jats:italic> software to explore the impacts of SSI on high-rise frame-core tube structures. The seismic response of frame-core tube structures with various structural heights, height-width ratios, foundation types and soil types is studied. The numerical simulation results including maximum lateral deflections, foundation rocking, inter-storey drifts and base shears of rigid and flexible base buildings are discussed and compared. The results reveal the lateral displacement and inter-storey drifts of the superstructure can be amplified when SSI is taking into account, while the base shears are not necessarily reduced. Increasing the stiffness of the foundation and the subsoil can generally increase the seismic demand of structures. It has been concluded that it is neither safe nor economical to consider only the beneficial effects of SSI or to ignore them in structural design practice.</jats:p>"

The multiple passes of the FPI enabled by the high refractive index microsphere brought a 40dB enhancement of finesse. The broadband ultrasound sensing over 0.1- 45 MHz is achieved by selecting whispering gallery modes (WGMs) via varying microsphere position. The scattering and internal reflection of light in the microsphere is enabled by multibeam interference, leading to an increase in passages and WGMs at specific resonant wavelengths, and hence the high contrast and quality factor of the transmission spectrum are obtained for broadband ultrasound detection at high sensitivity. The optimized lateral offset is governed by the diameter of the microsphere to maximize the frequency response of the acoustic wave of a piezoelectric transducer centered at 3.7 MHz.</jats:p>"

The definition of strategy and appropriate tactical actions are expected to maintain an effective balance between cultural value and economic potential, not contrasting, but combining these characteristics for the common good of society. The article considers the subjectivity of artists, as well as the methodology of cultural labor research, probable causes and definite inconsistencies in the analysis of cultural space (and cultural labor) in theoretical research in cultural studies, sociology of culture and economic theory.\nBased on the fact that \"cultural labor\" is an interdisciplinary category by definition, the article presents both theoretical developments in the methodology of its research and practical context. Crucial for understanding of cultural labor is the changing subjectivity of cultural worker, which focuses on the protection of labor rights, participation in political and social movements, etc. However, the changes in social perception for artistic subjectivity remain equally important to disclose.</jats:p>"

Materials and Methods: It was a quasi-experimental study with 74 patients with chronic low back pain, divided equally in two groups containing 37 patients each. Both groups were treated with baseline of moist heat pack in combination with interferential. Group A was treated with core stability exercises and group B was treated with endurance training for five times a week.  Pre and post treatment scores were compared with NPRS for intensity of pain and Oswestry Disability Index for functional disability scores. Results: Data was analysis by SPSS.25 on 74 patients. In type of pain, about 79% of patients were suffering from moderate and severe type of pain while there were only 21% of patients who came with mild pain in both groups. Independent t-test was applied for changes between the group on NPRS scale, the results shows significant results with p&lt;0.05. In core stability group the difference between pretreatment and post treatment was 6.08 to 1.4 and in stability group the difference was 6.13 to 1.10. Endurance training exercises on ODI, there was no one with severe disability, and 94.6 %were with minimal disability and only 5.4 % were with moderate disability.  It shows that endurance training exercises were better than stability exercises. Conclusion: It is concluded that endurance training has more clinical difference on outcome measures of NPRS and ODI as compared to core stability exercises in patients with mechanical low back pain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The mechanical properties of braided carbon nanotube yarns (CNTYs) on an elastomeric core to produce stretchable conductive materials were modeled and studied under tension. The elastomeric core served as the stretchable spring and the CNTYs braiding, with shape changing capabilities, as the conductive shell. The model predicts the stress-strain behavior of the composite as a function of the initial braiding angle and the number of pitches. The innovative aspect was included in the model related to the friction between the braid and the core. Results indicated good agreement between the theoretical model and the experimental results. Since the rate of the diameter decrease of the CNTYs braid was higher than that of the elastomeric core diameter, squeezing out of the core through the braid inter yarn space occurred. This limited the maximum potential extension of the braid. Thus, a critical strain was defined where the braid came into contact with the core. The addition of the friction stresses made a significant contribution to the overall stresses and the accuracy of the model and its agreement with the experimental results. An apparent friction coefficient was proposed to account for the effect of the elastomer core/braid interactive restriction and squeezing out of the elastomer through the braiding, as observed in experimental results. As the CNTYs are conductive, a stretchable conductive composite was obtained having a resistivity of 9.05x10<jats:sup>-4</jats:sup> Ohm*cm, which remained constant throughout the tensile loading until failure and under cyclic loading.</jats:p>"

In this survey,  we briefly summarize interesting and important results on $t$-cores from classical results like how to obtain a generating function to recent results like simultaneous cores.  Since there have been numerous studies on $t$-cores, it is infeasible to survey all the interesting results. Thus, we mainly focus on the roles of $t$-cores in number theoretic aspects of partition theory. This includes the modularity of $t$-core partition generating functions, the existence of $t$-core partitions, asymptotic formulas and arithmetic properties of $t$-core partitions, and combinatorial and number theoretic aspects of simultaneous  core partitions. We also explain some applications of $t$-core partitions, which include relations between core partitions and self-conjugate core partitions, a $t$-core crank explaining Ramanujan's partition congruences, and relations with class numbers.</jats:p>"

A total of 75 older individuals were randomly and evenly split into three groups: (A) the core stability group (n=25) received core stability training plus traditional balance exercises, (B) the IMT group (n=25) received IMT training plus traditional balance exercises, (C) the control group (n=25) was assigned to undergo conventional balancing exercises. The evaluation process included both pre-and post-testing, which encompassed the measurement of the time taken to complete the Time Up and Go (TUG) test, as well as the 30 Second Chair Stand Test (30CST). Following eight weeks of training, there was a significant rise in TUG in group A (P&lt;0.05) and 30CST in both groups A and B (P&lt;0.05 and p=0.002), respectively. Post-training, a significant disparity in the TUG and 30CST scores across the three groups was found, with corresponding pvalues of 0.038 and 0.006. So it was concluded that Core muscle stability training with a traditional balance program improves stability in the elderly more than IMT training with a traditional balance program or traditional balance program alone.</jats:p>"

The fluctuations have magnetic components (suggesting the high-beta effect) which have two different frequencies and propagation directions. The phase velocities are of the order of magnetization drifts, and both the velocities and the intensities increase in proportion to the electron density. The self-regulating mechanism of density profile works most apparently in the naturally made confinement system, magnetosphere, which teaches the basic physics of long-lived structures underlying every stationary confinement scheme.</jats:p>",

From the movies taken from the left and right optical tubes of the binocular microscope, we detect the 3D positions of many intrinsic intracellular vesicles and reconstruct cellular surfaces of amoeboid cells in 3D space. Some observations of sampled behaviors are shown in a single-celled organism of <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">Amoeba proteus</jats:italic>. The resultant surface time series is then analyzed to obtain surface velocity, curvature and volume increasing rates of pseudo-pods for characterizing the movements of amoeboid cells.

The relative importance of each measurement is adjusted manually in an often time-consuming, iterative process to meet different experimental needs.  In this work, we introduce several optimization formulations and algorithms with new decision criteria for streamlining and automating this process. These algorithms are designed for two formulations: bilevel optimization and robust optimization. Both formulations are applied to the datasets used in the ATLAS A14 tune and to the dedicated hadronization datasets generated by the SHERPA generator, respectively. The corresponding tuned generator parameters are compared using three metrics. We compare the quality of our automatic tunes to the published  ATLAS A14 tune. Moreover, we analyze the impact of a pre-processing step that excludes data that cannot be described by the physics models used in the MC event generators.</jats:p>"

The present study aimed to test the performance of a new diagnostic interview for depression focusing on the core symptoms of depression. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We developed a diagnostic interview for depression: the CORE Diagnostic Interview, CORE-DI, which assesses each of the core features of depression on the four dimensions: quality, reactivity, globality, and fluctuations over time. The diagnostic performance of this interview was tested in a clinical study including 83 individuals presenting with various depressive symptoms, who were interviewed independently (1) by means of the CORE-DI and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), and (2) by highly skilled specialists in depression representing gold standard diagnoses. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We compared the outcome of the CORE-DI, the M.I.N.I., and the diagnosis made by clinicians, respectively, versus the gold standard diagnosis, using diagnostic efficiency statistics. The CORE-DI diagnosed depression with a high specificity (0.91, 95% CI: 0.85–0.97, for International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 criteria and 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81–0.95, for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] criteria) compared to both M.I.N.I (specificity 0.44, 95% CI: 0.33–0.55) and clinical diagnoses (specificity 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67–0.85). The sensitivity of the CORE-DI was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.55–0.72) for ICD-10 criteria and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57–0.77) for DSM-5 criteria. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discussion/Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The CORE-DI increased the specificity of the depression diagnosis substantially compared to clinical diagnoses and the diagnoses obtained by M.I.N.I. The results point to the usefulness of an elaborated and systematic assessment of the core symptoms in the examination of patients with depressive symptoms and thereby indicate a way for further development of specific diagnostic tools for depression in both clinical and research settings. However, it should be noted that the sensitivity of the CORE-DI was modest, and the psychometric properties of the CORE-DI might be different in other settings with higher or lower prevalence or severity of depressive symptoms. </jats:p>"

To explain this, we develop a model based on principles of statistical physics that predicts differentiated relative abundances for any planetary body in a solar system as a function of its orbital distance. This simple model is successfully tested against available chemical composition data from CI chondrites and surface compositional data of Mars, Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mercury. We show, moreover, that deviations from the proposed law for a given planet correspond to later surface segregation of elements driven both by gravity and chemical reactions. We thus provide a new picture for the distribution of elements in the solar system and inside planets, with important consequences for their chemical composition. Particularly, a 4 wt% initial hydrogen content is predicted for bulk early Earth. This converges with other works suggesting that the interior of the Earth could be enriched with hydrogen.</jats:p>",

At the same time, due to the pandemic, classes without face-to-face contact have been increasing. This study aims to develop teaching-learning contents instructing core principles of artificial intelligence, respectively in face-to-face and non-face-to-face learning environments. Proposed teaching-learning contents mainly target elementary learner and provide simplified experience for convolutional neural network(CNN) algorithm. Learners accomplish convolution operation with simple numbers then extract feature map. Students experience CNN process with 5x5 virtual input image consists of numbers. 2x2 filter is given for convolution operation, and students fill 4x4 feature map with the results. These same teaching-learning activities can be also offered with online interactive worksheets, using ‘LIVEWORKSHEETS’ website. By transforming printed worksheets into online ones, learners in distance learning classes can accomplish identical coursework clicking and typing then score themselves. Teachers and learners can choose appropriate teaching-learning way or mix both of them flexibly based on their situation. Subsequent studies are expected to revise the contents after sufficient pilot classes with diverse learner groups and devise additional physical teaching-learning activity suitable for elementary learners. This study proposes the importance of continuous research on artificial intelligence education for young learners and versatile teaching-learning contents for various learning environment.</jats:p>",

In this study, oil-core polymeric nanocapsules encapsulating nisin were prepared by a nanoprecipitation technique using three different synthetic biodegradable polymers, namely poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), Eudragit RS-100® (EUD), and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), and their physical characteristics, thermal resistance and antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes were investigated. All nanocapsule formulations showed entrapment efficiency superior to 96%. EUD and PCL nanocapsules showed average diameters ranging from 145 to 303 nm, while PBAT-nisin nanocapsules showed larger size and PDI index (556.2 nm and 0.51, respectively), possibly due to changes in the organic phase equilibrium during preparation. The thermogravimetric analysis indicates lower decomposition temperatures in the PCL and EUD nanocapsules containing nisin compared with the unload nanocapsule and the contrary effect in the PBAT. Moreover, all nisin-containing polymeric nanocapsules exhibited antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes in both agar diffusion tests and determination of antimicrobial units (AU/mL) in liquid media. Oil-core polymeric nanocapsules have not been previously described as carriers for nisin, and the results suggested that PBAT, EUD, and PCL could be suitable polymers for nisin delivery systems.</jats:p>"

Plant functional traits are good predictors of plant performance and can reflect the adaptation strategies of plants to the environment. However, it is still unclear whether transplanted populations have comparable levels of leaf functional traits to their wild source populations. To assess the effectiveness of conservation-based translocation of long-living endangered tree species, we investigated the long-term (20–35 years) population dynamics of five co-existing endangered tree species (Davidia involucrata, Dipteronia sinensis, Pterostyrax psilophyllus, Tapiscia sinensis, and Tetracentron sinense) in transplanted populations, and compared the leaf functional traits between the transplanted and their wild source populations. We found that the survival rates of the five species in the transplanted populations ranged from 42.86% to 73.81%, and most of these species could blossom and yield fruit. All species had significant differences in some leaf functional traits between transplanted and wild populations. The intraspecific traits variation of some species in the transplanted populations was decreased compared with that in the wild populations on the whole. We conclude that after a long period of translocation, these species in transplanted populations were able to grow normally and most species become more efficient in resource acquisition or utilisation and more resources were available for growth. However, the intraspecific traits variation of some species in transplanted populations may lead to competitive exclusion, affect species coexistence, and thus affect their performance.</jats:p>"

Two major regional fault trends were interpreted, trending, Northeast–Southwest (NE–SW) and NNE–SSW with minor northwest–southeast (NW–SE) directions. Two depth sources in the area are delineated namely; zone of shallow seated basement which ranges from 0.42km to 1.5km and zone of deeply seated basement which ranges from 1.91 to 3.50km.Results of qualitative interpretation of the Total magnetic intensity map (TMI) and Residual intensity map reveal that the magnetic intensities ranges from 7500 to 8460 nano-Telsa (nT) and -220 to 240 nT respectively. The depth to the centroid and top of the magnetic caustic bodies ranges from 9.00 to 17.10km and 0.4 to 3.10km respectively. Juxtaposing the topographical and core drilling data reveals that the oolitic iron ore level follows the topographical level which implies that the topography of the area controls the configuration of the iron ore deposit level. All these deduction are made considering the geology of the area.</jats:p>"

Even relationships between generally accepted genera such as <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Saccharum</jats:italic> have not been examined in any large-scale molecular detail. Genera such as <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Miscanthidium</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Narenga</jats:italic> pose even greater taxonomic contention. <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic> is not monophyletic and <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic> sect. <jats:italic>Ripidium</jats:italic> (Valdés and Scholz 2006, Lloyd Evans et al. 2019a; Welker et al. 2019) represents a distinct and separate genus, <jats:italic>Tripidium</jats:italic> Scholz. <jats:italic>Miscanthidium</jats:italic> is placed within <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> by many workers, whilst the New World <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic> species and <jats:italic>Narenga</jats:italic> are currently placed within <jats:italic>Saccharum</jats:italic>. As these species represent a significant portion of the gene pool that sugarcane breeders use for introgression into sugarcane, their taxonomic placement and relationships to <jats:italic>Saccharum</jats:italic> are of significant economic import. <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic> species from the Americas have not been significantly employed in sugarcane breeding and may represent an untapped genetic resource. In an attempt to resolve the taxonomic relationships of these genera, we have assembled three novel chloroplasts, from <jats:italic>Miscanthidium capense</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Miscanthidium junceum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Narenga porphyrocoma</jats:italic> (this latter assembled from transcriptomic and long read data). In parallel, five low copy number loci have been assembled from species within <jats:italic>Saccharum</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Sarga</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Sorghum</jats:italic>. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both low copy number genes and whole chloroplasts. The phylogenetic results were compared with karyotype data to circumscribe the genera most closely related to sugarcane. We reveal that genera <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Saccharum</jats:italic> are monophyletic and have never undergone polyploidization outside their own genera. Genera <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Miscanthidium</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Narenga</jats:italic> are allopolyploids, which excludes them from being members of <jats:italic>Saccharum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic>. Moreover, all three of these genera have divergent evolutionary histories. We therefore support the use of the genera <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Miscanthidium</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Erianthus</jats:italic> (for the New World Species) and <jats:italic>Narenga</jats:italic> for those species and genera most closely allied to Saccharum. Our data demonstrate that all these genera should be excluded from <jats:italic>Saccharum sensu lato</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

Laboratory diagnostics have undergone rapid development over the recent years, and the pace shows no signs of abatement. Rapid development challenges the competence of the staff and will most certainly influence the education of future staff. This study was aimed to examine what was considered the necessary competencies needed to pursue a career as a Biomedical Laboratory Scientist\nMethods\n\nA modified Delphi technique was used, and the panel of experts expressed their views in a three questionnaire series. Consensus was defined as the point when 75% or more of the panel participants agreed that a particular competence was necessary.\nResults\n\nThe study highlights the perceived importance of mostly generic competencies that relate to quality, quality assurance, and accuracy, as well as different aspects of safety, respect, trustworthiness (towards patients/clients and colleagues), and communication skills. The results also stress the significance of self-awareness and professionality.\nConclusions\n\nWe identified important competencies for Biomedical Laboratory Scientists. Together with complementary information from other sources, <jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., guidelines, laws, and scientific publications, the competencies identified can be used as learning outcomes in a competency-based education to provide students with all competencies needed to work as professional Biomedical Laboratory Scientists.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Determining how and when Mars formed has been a long-standing challenge for planetary scientists. The size and orbit of Mars are difficult to reproduce in classical simulations of planetary accretion, and this has inspired models of inner solar system evolution that are tuned to produce Mars-like planets. However, such models are not always coupled to geochemical constraints. Analyses of Martian meteorites using the extinct hafnium–tungsten (Hf–W) radioisotopic system, which is sensitive to the timing of core formation, have indicated that the Martian core formed within a few million years of the start of the solar system itself. This has been interpreted to suggest that, unlike Earth’s protracted accretion, Mars grew to its modern size very rapidly. These arguments, however, generally rely on simplified growth histories for Mars. Here, we combine likely accretionary histories from a large number of N-body simulations with calculations of metal–silicate partitioning and Hf–W isotopic evolution during core formation to constrain the range of conditions that could have produced Mars.       \tWe find that there is no strong correlation between the final masses or orbits of simulated Martian analogs and their 182W anomalies, and that it is readily possible to produce Mars-like Hf–W isotopic compositions for a variety of accretionary conditions. The Hf–W signature of Mars is very sensitive to the oxygen fugacity (fO2) of accreted material because the metal–silicate partitioning behavior of W is strongly dependent on redox conditions. The average fO2 of Martian building blocks must fall in the range of 1.3–1.6 log units below the iron–wüstite buffer to produce a Martian mantle with the observed Hf/W ratio. Other geochemical properties (such as sulfur content) also influence Martian 182W signatures, but the timing of accretion is a more important control. We find that while Mars must have accreted most of its mass within ~5 million years of solar system formation to reproduce the Hf–W isotopic constraints, it may have continued growing afterwards for over 50 million years. There is a high probability of simultaneously matching the orbit, mass, and Hf–W signature of Mars even in cases of prolonged accretion if giant impactor cores were poorly equilibrated and merged directly with the proto-Martian core.</jats:p>"

According to the start and end sites, tsRNAs can be broadly divided into tRNA halves (31–40 nucleotides) and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs, 14–30 nucleotides). tsRNAs have been reported in multiple organisms to be involved in gene expression regulation, protein synthesis, and signal transduction. As a novel regulator, tsRNAs have also been identified in various protozoan parasites. The conserved biogenesis of tsRNAs in early-branching eukaryotes strongly suggests the universality of this machinery, which requires future research on their shared and potentially disparate biological functions. Here, we reviewed the recent studies of tsRNAs in several representative protozoan parasites including their biogenesis and the roles in parasite biology and intercellular communication. Furthermore, we discussed the remaining questions and potential future works for tsRNAs in this group of organisms.</jats:p>"

First, the current theoretical ambiguity and potential problems regarding how we understand personalities in dissociate identity disorder are delineated by examining current international diagnostic criteria and views proposed by leading experts on the topic. The general trend is not to acknowledge each personality as having an independent sense of self, but rather a partial and fragmentary one, which does not seem to match well with its clinical manifestations. The author subsequently proposes that each personality has an independent neurological correlate, a neural network integrated as a dynamic core, as proposed by G. Edelman and G. Tononi. Although their theory is not designed to explicate personalities in dissociate identity disorder, the biological correlates of the personalities might be approximated to a coexistence of multiple dynamic cores, which was predicted by them, and partially exemplified by brain functions in split-brain experiments. The author then draws on the current understanding of the mirror neuron system discovered by G. Rizzolatti, V. Gallese, et al., which forms a basis for the understanding of how our sense of self is formed. They propose that the potential dysfunction of the mirror neuron system in a traumatic and critical situation might explain how different personalities are formed. Finally, the article discusses how these advances might be incorporated into our understanding and treatment of individuals with dissociate identity disorder.</jats:p>"

Studies using high throughput technologies such as RNA Sequencing and microarray have identified multiple dysregulated genes in NAFLD. However, these studies utilized vastly different models resulting in few consensus biomarker genes. Thus, in this investigation, we evaluated various datasets to find genes that are similarly expressed across heterogeneous murine models. We hypothesized that there exists a core set of genes dysregulated in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subtype of NAFLD characterized by steatosis and inflammation. These genes are involved in glucose and lipid metabolism as well as in the inflammatory responses and are the drivers of the observed tissue pathology. To test this hypothesis, we obtained publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and analyzed them to find differentially expressed genes. We also cross-referenced the expression of these genes with published studies for further validation. Our dataset analyses identified 18 genes up-regulated and four down-regulated in at least six of seven datasets. Of these genes, glucokinase (Gck) was up-regulated, and the complement component C8 beta chain (C8b) was down-regulated in every murine dataset analyzed. Both exhibited a similar expression pattern in a human NAFLD dataset. Using approaches such as these, we believe that identifying consistently dysregulated mRNA can lead to the discovery of reliable biomarkers and potentially effective therapeutics in humans despite the heterogeneity of the experimental models used.</jats:p>"

A complex glacial history consisting of five ice-flow phases influenced by regional ice stream dynamics was identified, including\na near-complete ice-flow reversal. During each ice-flow phase, the subglacial thermal conditions fluctuated both spatially and temporally, resulting in palimpsest glacial dispersal patterns. Deglacial ages from samples collected as part of this research confirm deglaciation occurred relatively\nrapidly around 8 ka. The results of this work improve our understanding of the glacial history of an inner region of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and have important implications for mineral exploration in the southern Core Zone area.</jats:p>"

As the disease progresses, toxic α-synuclein aggregates transmit throughout the nervous system. No effective disease-modifying therapy has been established, and preventing α-synuclein aggregation is thought to be one of the most promising approaches to ameliorate the disease. In this study, we performed a two-step screening using the thioflavin T assay and a cell-based assay to identify α-synuclein aggregation inhibitors. The first screening, thioflavin T assay, allowed the identification of 30 molecules, among a total of 1262 FDA-approved small compounds, which showed inhibitory effects on α-synuclein fibrilization. In the second screening, a cell-based aggregation assay, seven out of these 30 candidates were found to prevent α-synuclein aggregation without causing substantial toxicity. Of the seven final candidates, tannic acid was the most promising compound. The robustness of our screening method was validated by a primary neuronal cell model and a <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</jats:italic> model, which demonstrated the effect of tannic acid against α-synuclein aggregation. In conclusion, our two-step screening system is a powerful method for the identification of α-synuclein aggregation inhibitors<jats:italic>,</jats:italic> and tannic acid is a promising candidate as a disease-modifying drug for Parkinson’s disease.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies the core identity of Al Mustafa (the chosen) in Gibran's book The Prophet (1923) as an individual property by investigating its discursive features as revealed in the words and deeds of the participants in the discourse. The study deals with how Gibran refers to the protagonist and how this portrayal reflects on the identity of the writer. It examines how the prophet refers to himself, his worries and needs, how the interlocutors address him in the discourse, and finally how the telling of the ongoing actions leads to the perception of Al-Mustafa as a prophetic figure. The results show that the source of the power of such a discursive identity is neither nature, nor certain established institutions, but the people of Orphalese themselves (the participants in the discourse), plus those readers of Gibran's book who discern a prophetic figure in his words. The process through which these power works is that of “recognition”, in that rational individuals recognize Al-Mustafa as a Prophet in the discourse. Such recognition is realized as an active “self-achievement” arising as a deserved property of how the prophet's words and deeds are recognized by his followers.</jats:p>"

However, coiled coils lack features typical of protein-protein interaction sites, and it is therefore challenging to understand how M proteins achieve specific binding, for example, with the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, leading to its neutralization. The crystal structure of a complex of LL-37 with M87 protein, an antigenic M protein variant from a strain that is an emerging threat, revealed a novel interaction mode. The M87 coiled coil unfurled and asymmetrically exposed its hydrophobic core to capture LL-37. A single LL-37 molecule bound M87 in the crystal, but in solution recruited additional LL-37 molecules, consistent with a ‘protein trap’ neutralization mechanism. The interaction mode visualized crystallographically was verified to contribute significantly to LL-37 resistance in an M87 Strep A strain, and was identified to be conserved in a number of other M protein types that are prevalent in human populations. Our results provide specific detail for therapeutic inhibition of LL-37 neutralization by M proteins.</jats:p>"

Each core has a central low refractive index region and a high refractive index ring to ensure that there is a large refractive index difference between modes in the core, so as to reduce the problem of mode coupling. The bending loss of central core and outer core, the crosstalk characteristics between modes and the influence of core parameters on crosstalk performance are simulated and analyzed by the finite element method. The simulation results show that at a wavelength of 1.55 μm and a bending radius of 50 mm, the bending loss of the proposed multi-core fiber is much lower than its attenuation loss, and the crosstalk between the adjacent cores of the five core modes are less than –20 dB/100 km. Therefore, this multi-core fiber can realize independent transmission of the core modes with long-distance under small bending radius.</jats:p>"

Plasmonic material gold (Au) is deposited in microchannel to generate the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, so that sensor can detect the change in RI of its surrounding analyte. Simulation results show that the maximum wavelength sensitivity and resolution are 33600nm/RIU and 2.97×10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup>RIU for y polarization in the RI range of 1.33 to 1.44, respectively. The highest figure of merit (FOM) of the sensor is 961 for y polarization. In addition, we study the effects brought by the structural changes of the fiber sensor, and the results show that the design of “microchannel coating” dramatically improves the refractive index detection ability of the sensor. The D-shaped dual-core microchannel-based photonic crystal fiber sensor proposed in this paper has a simple structure, low manufacturing complexity, and high sensitivity. Combined with external sensing technology, this sensor has great application potential in the fields of biotechnology, medical diagnosis, and environmental protection.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Purpose: To advance the use of structured, monologic discourse analysis by demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of an automated scoring procedure for core lexicon.Method: 49 transcripts from persons with aphasia and 48 transcripts from persons not brain injured were retrieved from the AphasiaBank database. Five structured monologic discourse tasks were scored manually by trained scorers and via automation using a newly developed CLAN command based upon previously published lists for core lexicons. Point-to-point (or word-by-word) accuracy and reliability of the two methods were calculated. Scoring discrepancies were examined to identify errors. Time estimates for each method were calculated to determine if automated scoring improved efficiency.Results: Intra-class correlation coefficients for the tasks ranged from .998 to .978, indicating excellent inter-method reliability. Automated scoring using CLAN represented a significant time savings for an experienced CLAN user and for inexperienced CLAN users following step-by-step instructions.Conclusions: Automated scoring of core lexicon is a valid and reliable alternative to the current gold standard of manually scoring core lexicon from transcribed monologic discourse samples. The downstream time saving of an automated analysis may allow for better clinical utilization of discourse measures. To further encourage the use of this method, go to https://aphasia.talkbank.org/discourse/CoreLexicon/ for materials and the step-by-step instructions utilized in this project.</p>"

In this paper, we investigate the roles of stellar rotation on the occurrence of FFC by carrying out axisymmetric CCSN simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. Our result suggests that electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) angular crossings, which are the necessary and sufficient condition to trigger FFC, preferably occur in the equatorial region for rotating CCSNe. By scrutinizing the neutrino–matter interaction and neutrino radiation field, we find some pieces of evidence that the stellar rotation facilitates the occurrence of FFC.

The need for a repeat breast core biopsy is not uncommon and can occur for a multitude of reasons. Radiologists should carefully correlate the pathology results with imaging features after each breast biopsy and must recognize why certain core biopsies must be repeated to avoid missed or delayed cancer diagnosis. In this review, we discuss the main reasons for repeat core biopsies via case presentation with radiological images and pathological correlation. This review will help multidisciplinary breast care team recognize when to repeat a biopsy to reduce false negatives and will also familiarize radiologists with techniques for improving initial biopsy success.Methods: We performed literature and chart reviews of cases at our institution between January 2015 and December 2019.Results: While some repeat biopsies are inevitable, most can be avoided with careful pre-biopsy planning, adequate sampling techniques, and proper radiological-pathological correlation. Conclusion: Repeat breast core needle biopsies occur due to multiple avoidable and unavoidable radiological or pathological issues. It is imperative for both multidisciplinary breast care team and radiologists to recognize when to repeat a biopsy to reduce false negative or delayed cancer diagnosis via careful reviews before and after the procedure and adequate radiological and pathological correlation.</jats:p>"

In this article, I focus on how the AIATSIS CORE Cultural Learning modules inspired me to rethink culture and identity, and how cultural competence training has influenced how I work. I view culture as an organism: it is dynamic and evolving. The narratives of every generation and different communities’ cultures define their identities. Archivists have a mission to safeguard the culture by preserving tangible materials as the culture is the context of collections. Working with manuscripts reminds me that archives and culture are human-centred. Collections are not just materials; they connect with people. The subjectivity of the archivist is evidence that our culture and identity are genuinely presented in the workplace. Even if the archivists seem anonymous and silent, their subjectivity leads them to choose, interpret, and analyse during the processing of collections. Moreover, recognising power relations in the archive, I realise that archivists have the privilege to select what is to be remembered and what will be forgotten. Two examples are provided to explain how cultural competence training changed the way I work and the thoughts of my career. For the archive as an organisation to preserve and shape history, it is essential that archivists understand the importance of cultural competence. Only when we know ourselves better and recognise our problems can we embrace diversity and preserve culture and history more comprehensively.</jats:p>",

The principal pathways of heterocycle alteration are determined by the most reactive sites in 4-thiazolidinone, which are 3 and 5. In a review paper, the chemistry of 4-thiazolidinones was discussed, in particular the rhodanine ring and several methods for its reactions, including ring modification. The study deals with thioureas and thioglycolic acid react in a single step, catalyzed by protic acid, resulting in the direct preparation of N-aryl rhodanines as well as the rhodanine skeleton, offering a novel method for the synthesis of rhodanine and its derivatives.

We tested six chimpanzees with edited chimpanzee body pictures in eye-tracking tasks. The target body parts were arms or legs. For either target, there were four conditions: “normal” condition as control, where all bodies were normal; “misplaced” condition, where one arm or one leg was misplaced to an incorrect body location in each picture; “replaced by a chimpanzee part” condition, where one arm or one leg was replaced by a chimpanzee leg or arm, respectively, in its original place in each picture; and “replaced by a human part” condition, where one arm or one leg was replaced by a human arm or leg in each picture. Compared to the looking times toward the normal parts, chimpanzees had significantly longer looking times toward the human arms or legs. The looking times toward the misplaced parts were also longer than the normal parts, but the difference just failed to meet significance. These results indicate more interests toward strange body parts, compared to typical parts, suggesting that chimpanzees might have a body representation that is sufficiently sensitive to detect these aspects of strangeness.</jats:p>",

Bladder cancer has distinct gene expression signature, highlighting altered gene expression plays important roles in bladder cancer etiology. However, the mechanism for how the regulatory disorder causes the altered expression in bladder cancer remains elusive. Core promoter controls transcriptional initiation. We hypothesized that mutation in core promoter abnormality could cause abnormal transcriptional initiation thereby the altered gene expression in bladder cancer.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>In this study, we performed a genome-wide characterization of core promoter mutation in 77 Spanish bladder cancer cases.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We identified 69 recurrent somatic mutations in 61 core promoters of 62 genes and 28 recurrent germline mutations in 20 core promoters of 21 genes, including <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>, the only gene known with core promoter mutation in bladder cancer, and many oncogenes and tumor suppressors.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim/Purpose: Digital literacy is critical to participation in a contemporary knowledge-based society and is requisite to both academic success and career development. Institutions of higher education have been slow to define, assess, and amplify digital literacy in parallel with advances in the enhancement of reading, writing, and arithmetic literacy. Perhaps as a consequence of the pandemic, awareness appears to be growing of the need to infuse digital literacy at both institutional and individual levels. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the promotion and amplification of digital literacy within top universities around the globe.\n\nBackground: For years, the role of higher education in the amplification of digital literacy among college students has been debated, but efforts have been limited primarily to ad hoc, unsystematic attempts to rectify disparities between students’ exposure and understanding. The impacts of COVID-19 exposed the reality that many institutions, professors, and college students were under-prepared for the surge in reliance on digital technologies. \n \nMethodology: This paper explores the prevalence of digital literacy in the top public and private universities around the globe by conducting a qualitative examination on compulsory requirements, digital literacy offerings, university identified digital literacy initiatives, and university strategic plans. \n\nContribution: This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence for the need to expand the constructs of what it means to be digitally literate to address the ever-expanding range of emerging technologies and the impact of those technologies on society.\n\nFindings: The review of digital literacy amplification at top universities showed that none of the universities' admissions requirements required students to demonstrate digital competence and compulsory digital literacy was uncommon. However, a majority of universities undertook some form of initiative to promote digital literacy. These initiates included a focus on developing digitally literate society and workforce or developing innovative approaches to digital literacy education.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: The pandemic has generated a greater sense of urgency for institutions of higher education to ensure access to and understanding of digital technologies by students, faculty, and staff. Educational institutions will have to adapt their methodologies to promote explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies that combine the competencies possessed by users of technology with the generation of new competencies required to successfully participate in the digital transformation of education, business, and society.\n\nRecommendations for Researchers: This paper examined the top 50 universities around the globe. Additional re-search is needed to examine national, regional and local efforts in the quest to address the need for a digitally literate citizenry.\n\nImpact on Society: COVID-19 has thrust us into a new normal wherein digital competence is foundational to success in an ever digitally reliant world. Institutions of higher education are best positioned to carry out the initiatives, programs and re-search needed to enhance the digital literacy of all citizens, not just students and employees.\n\nFuture Research: Societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to emerge and will resonate for decades to come. Continued investigation, exploration and dis-semination of information related to effort to enhance and amplify digital literacy is necessary to ensure momentum to reimagine digital literacy education is maintained.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Core-shell structured magnetic nanoparticles combine hard and a soft phases to improve energy efficiency. The mutual interaction of the two phases can lead to the exchange spring effect leading to higher magnetic energy. In this regard, synthesis of Nd2Fe14B based core-shell structured powders have proven to be elusive due to the relatively reactive nature of this phase. In this study, a process has been established for successfully coating the surface of Nd2Fe14B powders with FeCo layer using galvanic displacement method. Initially, a binary phase magnetic powder was synthesized containing Nd2Fe14B and Nd2Fe17 phase. Subsequently, the powders were coated using a Co precursor at 303 K. During coating the metastable Nd2Fe17 phase was dissolved and the Fe ions were released into the solution. Subsequently, the Fe ions deposited together with the Co ions on the surface of Nd2Fe14B powder to form a FeCo shell. The deposited layer thickness and composition was confirmed using TEM analysis.</jats:p>"

Accurate and continuous measurement of human CBT can effectively identify and monitor central high fever, and provide a basis for the effective implementation during TTM, which is therefore of great significance for human health care and disease monitoring. The reliable core measurement sites are nasopharynx, esophagus, bladder, rectum, pulmonary artery, etc., but the measurement methods in these sites are all invasive. At present, the medical field is more inclined to noninvasive data collection methods through monitoring an appropriate site (such as forehead, mouth, or axilla) depending on clinical circumstances, so as to ensure the comfort and security of patients to the greatest extent. This review will provide reference choosing more safe and accurate temperature measurement methods for patients during TTM by reviewing the sites and accuracy of invasive and noninvasive CBT measurements.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Here, we employed zebrafish (<jats:italic>Danio rerio</jats:italic>) to compare the function of six core <jats:italic>atgs</jats:italic> from the core autophagy machineries, which included <jats:italic>atg13, beclin1</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>becn1</jats:italic>), <jats:italic>atg9a, atg2a, atg5</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>atg3</jats:italic>, in vertebrate definitive hematopoiesis via CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein targeting. Zebrafish embryos with various <jats:italic>atg</jats:italic> mutations showed autophagic deficiency throughout the body, including hematopoietic cells. The <jats:italic>atgs</jats:italic> mutations unsurprisingly caused distinctive hematopoietic abnormalities in zebrafish. Notably, <jats:italic>becn1</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>atg9a</jats:italic> mutation resulted in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) expansion during the development of the embryo into a larva, which can be attributed to the proteomic changes in metabolism, HSCs regulators, and apoptosis. Besides, <jats:italic>atg3</jats:italic> mutation lowered the leukocytes in developing zebrafish embryos. Intriguingly, a synergistic effect on HSCs expansion was identified in <jats:italic>atg13+becn1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>atg9a+atg2a</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>atg3</jats:italic> double mutations, in which <jats:italic>atg13</jats:italic> mutation and <jats:italic>atg2a</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>atg3</jats:italic> mutation exacerbated and mitigated the HSCs expansion in <jats:italic>becn1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>atg9a</jats:italic> mutations, respectively. In addition, the myeloid cell type-specific effects of various <jats:italic>atgs</jats:italic> were also determined between neutrophils and macrophages. Of these, a skewed ratio of neutrophils versus macrophages was found in <jats:italic>atg13</jats:italic> mutation, while both of them were reduced in <jats:italic>atg3</jats:italic> mutation. These findings demonstrated the distinct roles of <jats:italic>atgs</jats:italic> and their interplays in zebrafish definitive hematopoiesis, thereby suggested that the vertebrate definitive hematopoiesis is regulated in an <jats:italic>atgs</jats:italic>-dependent manner.</jats:p>"

The genomic landscape of ML-DS is characterized by a combination of mutations in signaling pathway genes and epigenetic modifiers, while aberrant lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and JAK-STAT activation have both been implicated in leukemogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that combined LSD1 and JAK1/2 inhibition exerts synergistic anti-leukemic effects specifically in ML-DS, both <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and in patient derived xenografts <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib enhanced the LSD1 inhibitor-induced differentiation, proliferation arrest and apoptosis in patient-derived leukemic blasts. At the transcriptional level, the combination synergistically repressed gene expression signatures essential for cell division. We further observed an immunogenic gene expression pattern in the form of increased cytokine signaling, which – by sensitizing ML-DS blasts to the JAK-STAT signaling blockade induced by ruxolitinib – could explain the increased susceptibility of ML-DS blasts to combination therapy. Taken together, we establish combined LSD1 and JAK-STAT inhibition as an efficacious therapeutic regimen specifically designed to target important steps in ML-DS leukemogenesis, paving the way for targeted therapies in this entity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Indonesia memiliki penduduk dengan mayoritas beragama Islam sehingga memiliki potensi yang besar dalam pengembangan dan pengelolaan wakaf. Namun terdapat masalah dalam pengelolaan wakaf, salah satunya mengenai akuntabilitas dan transparansi lembaga pengelola wakaf. Hal ini menjadi isu yang penting dalam lembaga pengelola wakaf, karena berkaitan dengan nilai kepercayaan. Waqf Core Principle dan PSAK 112 tentang Akuntansi Wakaf menjadi acuan prinsip dan standar yang sedang dikembangkan di Indonesia untuk entitas wakaf, terutama lembaga pengelola wakaf. Penelitian ini betujuan untuk mengetahui bagaimana penerapan Waqf Core Principle dan PSAK 112 dapat mewujudkan akuntabilitas dan transparansi lembaga pengelola wakaf. Metode penelitian ini adalah penelitian kualitatif dengan pendekatan studi pustaka (library research), dengan mengumpulkan data berupa buku, artikel, manuskrip, atau berita yang relevan dengan objek penelitian atau mengumpulkan data dalam bentuk kepustakaan, untuk memecahkan suatu masalah yang pada dasarnya didasarkan pada tinjauan kritis dan mendalam terhadap bahan pustaka yang relevan. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan akuntabilitas dan transparansi lembaga pengelola wakaf dapat didukung dengan adanya penerapan Waqf Core Principle (WCP) dan PSAK 112 Akuntansi Wakaf. Waqf Core Principle (WCP) memiliki 29 prinsip yang memberikan sistematika yang jelas dan standar tentang elemen-elemen pendukung sistem wakaf yang berlaku dan merepresentasikan bagaimana untuk mewujudkan akuntabiitas dan transparansi pada lembaga pengelola wakaf. Selain itu PSAK 112 tentang Akuntansi Wakaf bertujuan untuk mengatur secara khusus mengenai transaksi wakaf mengenai penerimaan, pengelolaan dan pengembangan aset wakaf, dan berisi mengenai ketentuan pengakuan, pengukuran, penyajian dan pengungkapan. PSAK 112 digunakan sebagai dasar analisis dari transaksi wakaf yang disajikan oleh nazhir organisasi/badan hukum dan wakif organisasi/badan hukum, serta menjadi satu instrumen yang dapat menilai kualitas pelaporan nazir yang akuntabel dan transparan, sehingga kinerja wakaf akan terdokumentasikan dengan baik dan membawa perbaikan pada sistem perwakafan</jats:p>"

We show that the strong energetic preference for boundary cores to lie along close-packed planes introduces a restructuring that rotates adjoining grains and generates elastic stresses in the triple junction region. The interplay of this stress field and the core stabilization determines the length scale of the restructuring and controls the shape and magnitude of the displacement field around the triple junction. Depending on the in-plane angle, restructured boundaries can extend to depths of ~ 15 nm with the associated elastic stress fields extending to even greater depths. These results point to a new mechanism of boundary relaxation at surfaces that is expected to play an important role in grain coalescence and stress evolution in growing films.</p>"

Although the moment method, which is one of the most popular approximations for neutrino transport, requires a closure relation, none of the analytical closure relations commonly employed in the literature capture all aspects of the neutrino angular distribution in momentum space. In this paper, we develop a closure relation by using DNNs that take the neutrino energy density, flux, and the fluid velocity as the inputs and the Eddington tensor as the output. We consider two kinds of DNNs: a conventional DNN, named a component-wise neural network (CWNN), and a tensor-basis neural network (TBNN). We find that the diagonal component of the Eddington tensor is better reproduced by the DNNs than the M1 closure relation, especially for low to intermediate energies. For the off-diagonal component, the DNNs agree better with the Boltzmann solver than the M1 closure relation at large radii. In the comparison between the two DNNs, the TBNN displays slightly better performance than the CWNN. With these new closure relations at hand, based on DNNs that well reproduce the Eddington tensor at much lower costs, we have opened up a new possibility for the moment method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A significant influence of major volcanic eruptions on regime shifts and long-term climate variability has been suggested previously. But a statistical assessment of this has been hampered by inaccurate synchronization of large volcanic eruptions to changes in past climate. Here, this is achieved by combining a new record of bipolar volcanism from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores with records of abrupt climate change derived from the same ice cores. We show that bipolar volcanic eruptions occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance just before the onset of Dansgaard-Oeschger events, the most prominent large-scale abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period. Out of 20 abrupt warming events in the 12–60 ka period, 5 (7) occur within 20 (50) years after a bipolar eruption. A similar statistical relationship is not found for eruptions before the abrupt cooling phases of the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. We hypothesize that this asymmetric response to volcanic eruptions may be a result of the direct influence of volcanic cooling on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which is widely regarded as the main climate subsystem involved in Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. Transitions from a weak to a strong circulation mode, but not vice versa, may be triggered by cooling in the North Atlantic, given the circulation is close to a stability threshold. We illustrate this suggestion by simulations with a global ocean model forced by short-term volcanic cooling. The analysis presented suggests that large eruptions may act as short-term triggers for large-scale abrupt climate change, and may explain part of the variability of Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles.\n                        </jats:p>"

Lithocholic acid (LCA, 2) was identified as a second endogenous agonist of VDR, though its potency is very low. However, the lithocholic acid derivative 3 (Dcha-20) is a more potent agonist than 1α,25(OH)2D3, (1), and its carboxyl group has similar interactions to the 1,3-dihydroxyl groups of 1 with amino acid residues in the VDR ligand-binding pocket. Here, we designed and synthesized amide derivatives of 3 in order to clarify the role of the carboxyl group. The synthesized amide derivatives showed HL-60 cell differentiation-inducing activity with potency that depended upon the substituent on the amide nitrogen atom. Among them, the N-cyanoamide 6 is more active than either 1 or 3.</jats:p>"

Life Skills Assessment Scale by Nair et al., (2010) was used to collect the data on measuring variable. One group quasi experimental research design was conducted by using module based online training sessions for the intervention. Evaluation of pre-intervention data highlighted that all the student participants were in low level life skill with none at average and high levels, whereas, in post-intervention evaluation, more students were found at average and high levels with merely few of them remained in low level of life skill. Dimension-wise analysis indicated significantly improved in each dimensions of life skills with non-significant gender differences after attending enrichment programme.

TMD comprises two groups of disorders, namely intra-articular TMD and masticatory muscle disorders. There is still difficulty in establishing the effectiveness of different therapeutic modalities for TMD with robust evidence, despite the large volume of publications in the area. The lack of outcomes standardization may represent a limiting factor in the search for scientific evidence.\nObjective\n\nThis study aims to develop a core outcome sets (COS) for clinical trials in intra-articular TMD and masticatory muscle disorders.\nMethods\n\nThe protocol for determining the COS-TMD will consist of three phases: 1. Synthesis of TMD Management Intervention Outcomes. The identification of outcomes will be carried out through a systematic review, which will include randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions used in TMD management. 2. Through a two-round international Delphi survey, the list of outcomes will be scored by three panels of stakeholders. 3. A representative sample of key stakeholders will be invited to participate in a face-to-face meeting where they can discuss the results of the Delphi survey and determine the final core set.\nConclusions\n\nThe implementation of this protocol will determine the COS-TMD, which will be made available for use in all TMD clinical studies. The use of COS when planning and reporting TMD clinical trials will reduce the risk of publication bias and enable proper comparison of results found by different studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Planktic foraminifera are widely used in palaeoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies. The accuracy of such reconstructions depends on our understanding of the organisms’ ecology. Here we report on field observations of planktic foraminiferal abundances (&gt;150 µm) from 5 depth intervals between 0–500 m water depth at 37 sites in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. The total planktic foraminiferal assemblage comprises 29 morphospecies; with 11 morphospecies accounting for ~90 % of the total assemblage. Both species composition and dominance in the net samples are broadly consistent with the published data from the corresponding surface sediments. The abundance and vertical distribution of planktic foraminifera are low offshore west Sumatra, and increase towards offshore south Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands (LSI). Average living depth of Trilobatus trilobus, Globigerinoides ruber, and Globigerina bulloides increases eastward, while that of Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, and Globorotalia menardii remains constant. We interpret the overall zonal and vertical distribution patterns in planktic foraminiferal abundances as a response to the contrasting upper water column conditions during the southeast monsoon, i.e., oligotrophic and stratified offshore Sumatra (non-upwelling) vs. eutrophic and well-mixed offshore Java-LSI (upwelling). Overall, the inferred habitat depths of selected planktic foraminifera species show a good agreement with those from sediment trap samples and from surface sedimentss off Sumatra, but not with those from surface sediments off Java-LSI. The discrepancy might stem from the different temporal coverage of these sample types. Our findings highlight the need to consider how foraminiferal assemblages and ecology vary on shorter timescales, i.e., from “snapshots” of the water column captured by plankton net to seasonal and interannual variability as recorded in sediment traps and how these changes are transferred and preserved in deep-sea sediments.\n                        </jats:p>"

For this reason, this paper proposes a guided teaching model based on core literacy. According to the structure of the oral English mixed teaching model, determine the application plan of the oral English mixed teaching model, design the development environment, obtain the corpus, design the oral training model, extract the oral features, identify the wrong pronunciation and correct it in time, clarify the evaluation purpose, obtain preliminary evaluation indicators, reduce evaluation indicators and determine indicator weights, obtain indicator feature information, generate fuzzy rules, obtain fuzzy matrices, achieve quantitative evaluation, and synthesize all evaluation scores to construct a result vector matrix to realize the study of mixed spoken language teaching mode. Research shows that the mixed teaching method is effective and feasible and can effectively improve the accuracy of the evaluation results of the mixed oral English teaching model.</jats:p>",

A “1” represents a strong disagreement about integrating a topic in the NSA curriculum, and a “4” indicates a firm agreement.

Serviceability performance is evaluated under the 50year wind and 43-year earthquake whereas safety performance is assessed under the 2475-year earthquake. Collapse performance is elaborated through incremental dynamic analysis. Our study revealed that the service performance is controlled by the maximum interstory drift limits specified for wind loads, and safety performance is controlled by the flexural steel strain limits of coupling beams. Collapse occurs in two consecutive stages: flexural collapse of coupling beams, followed by crushing of concrete at critical shear wall segments.  Collapse spectra  are defined for these two collapse limit states. Collapse spectra can be extrapolated from the 2475-year maximum considered earthquake (MCE) spectrum provided that the prevailing inelastic mechanisms are similar under the MCE and collapse ground motions. The building displays a significantly higher seismic performance at all performance levels, which is primarily attributed to the overstrength due to the limitation of axial stresses on vertical members under design earthquake load combination. The annual frequency of the mean earthquake ground motions that leads to incipient collapse is determined as 8·10  -5  , which is significantly lower than the annual frequency of 2475-year ground motions.</jats:p>"

For the biosynthesized bimetallic core shell nanoparticles (OTAuAgNPs) visual and spectrophotometric analysis was performed. Development of a deep purple color suggested the creation of OTAuAgNPs. It was then validated by UV-Vis spectrophotometry within 4 hours of incubation showing a surface plasmon resonance peak at 560 nm. FESEM-EDAX, FT-IR, particle analyzer and XRD were the analytical techniques employed to characterize the biosynthesized OTAuAgNPs. Using a known antibiotic as a control, OTAuAgNPs had a substantial bacteriostatic effect against Gram +ve (<jats:italic>Bacillus subtilis</jats:italic>) and Gram -ve (<jats:italic>E.coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>) bacteria. The OTAuAgNPs showed good catalytic action for the adsorption of Coomassie brilliant blue R250 dye (CBB), confirmed by the reduction in absorbance maxima that is time dependant. A remarkable adsorption of CBB (94.79%) was attained within 120 min, and the results were best suited PSO and Elovich models with adsorption kinetic constant of 5.96E<jats:sup>−04</jats:sup> g/mg.min and 37.81mg/g.min respectively. Further the toxicity studies of brilliant blue R250 dye and metabolite of CBB (post nano-remediated dye solution) was carried out on <jats:italic>Vigna radiata</jats:italic> (green gram) germination and growth. OTAuAgNPs as nano catalyst remediated water revealed that it was nontoxic. Thus an ecofriendly and cost effective approach for bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis could be further explored for removal of CBB from wastewater effluents.</jats:p>"

Previous genetic and clinical studies report that mutations of the epigenetic gene <jats:italic>ASH1L</jats:italic> are highly associated with human ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Recent studies demonstrate that loss of <jats:italic>Ash1l</jats:italic> in the mouse brain is sufficient to induce ASD/ID-like behavioral and cognitive memory deficits, suggesting that disruptive <jats:italic>ASH1L</jats:italic> mutations are likely to be the causative driver leading to the ASD/ID pathogenesis in human patients.

As an alternative to overcome this issue, in this work, it is proposed and demonstrated the use of coupled-core optical fiber Bragg gratings. It was found that the relative reflectivity from such gratings changed when the coupled-core fiber was subjected to point or periodic bending. This feature makes the interrogation of such gratings simple, fast, and cost-effective. The reflectivity changes of the gratings are attributed to the properties of the supermodes supported by the coupled-core fiber. As potential applications of the referred gratings, intensity-modulated vector bending and vibration sensing are demonstrated. We believe that the results reported here can pave the way to the development of many inexpensive sensors. Besides, coupled-core fiber Bragg gratings may expand the use of grating technology in other areas.</jats:p>"

Such quantum states of MnBi2Te4 have been intensively studied mainly in atomically thin exfoliated samples, yet thin film samples with critically tuned Fermi level would be indispensable for further pursuit of topological functionality in MnBi2Te4 and related heterointerfaces. Here, we report on fabrication of an Sb-doped MnBi2Te4 thin film by molecular beam epitaxy and their transport properties. The Sb-substitution induces the change in the carrier type and the subsequent increase in resistivity, demonstrating the tuning of the Fermi level (EF) across the bulk bandgap and the phase change to the topologically nontrivial phase. The EF is further finely controlled in a field-effect transistor device. We observe the enhancement of the anomalous Hall conductivity at the charge neutral point, confirming the opening of the magnetic exchange gap in surface Dirac states. The precise control of the band structure and the Fermi level in the thin-film form will lead to exploring exotic phenomena based on intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.</jats:p>",

The fact that half of the cave ice cores (3 out of 6) published in 2020 represent non-European localities, however, predicts that an increasing number of cave ice drilling projects will be carried out in the near future in other geographical areas hosting ice caves. Based on the gathered experience the most commonly encountered technical challenge of ice-core drilling problems in cave environment is englacial rocky/woody debris. The complex stratigraphy of cave ice deposits represents a crucial methodological problem. We propose an (Cave Ice Sedimentary Architecture and Deposition - CISAD) approach to take into consideration of the stratigraphic peculiarities of the investigated cave ice deposit and additional crucial meta-data before establishing the location of a drilling site best-suited to obtain the highest quality paleoenvironmental data.</jats:p>"

This approach to teaching has been shown to encourage deeper learning that can be integrated across subdisciplines of biology and has been adopted by several other biology subdisciplines. However, Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy, although one of the oldest biological areas of study, has not had its core concepts identified. Here, we present five core concepts and seven competencies (skills) for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy that came out of an iterative process of engagement with the broader community of vertebrate morphologists over a 3-year period. The core concepts are (A) evolution, (B) structure and function, (C) morphological development, (D) integration, and (E) human anatomy is the result of vertebrate evolution. The core competencies students should gain from the study of comparative vertebrate anatomy are (F) tree thinking, (G) observation, (H) dissection of specimens, (I) depiction of anatomy, (J) appreciation of the importance of natural history collections, (K) science communication, and (L) data integration. We offer a succinct description of each core concept and competency, examples of learning outcomes that could be used to assess teaching effectiveness, and examples of relevant resources for both instructors and students. Additionally, we pose a grand challenge to the community, arguing that the field of Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy needs to acknowledge racism, androcentrism, homophobia, genocide, slavery, and other influences in its history and address their lingering effects in order to move forward as a thriving discipline that is inclusive of all students and scientists and continues to generate unbiased knowledge for the betterment of humanity. Despite the rigorous process used to compile these core concepts and competencies, we anticipate that they will serve as a framework for an ongoing conversation that ensures Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy remains a relevant field in discovery, innovation, and training of future generations of scientists.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Integrity ties are necessary in hollow-core slab floors as connections to prevent floor displacements under lateral loads and maintain the overall structural integrity of buildings. In Eastern Canada, the integrity tie for hollow-core slabs on masonry walls usually consists of a 10M (no. 3), L-shaped steel bar that is hammered into the supporting wall and grouted to the slabs. However, current North American design codes do not offer sufficient provisions to determine the capacity or predict the mode of failure of these ties and connections. This paper introduces the results of testing nine full-scale reinforcing bar connection assemblies under monotonic in-plane forces (compression, tension, and shear) until failure. Test parameters in this study included direction and orientation of the in-plane loading, the bearing type of the hollow-core slabs, and the use of adhesive. Test results showed that connections with dry-fit bars tested under compression failed by bar yielding followed by masonry beam crushing. In addition, the mode of failure under tension forces was governed by the loss of bearing of the slabs due to bar pullout and cover spalling. Under shear forces, the connection failed by bar yielding. Finally, the connections with adhesive had a similar mode of failure compared to their counterparts with dry-fit bars, but these did not show bar pullout from the masonry beam, therefore demonstrating higher stiffness.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to establish a core collection of <jats:italic>Astragalus</jats:italic> germplasm resources based on molecular 10 SSR markers. Based on 380 samples of <jats:italic>Astragalus</jats:italic> collected from different areas, five different methods were utilized to construct the core collection of <jats:italic>Astragalus</jats:italic>, including PowerCore-based M strategy, CoreFinder-based M strategy, Core Hunter-based stepwise sampling, PowerMarker-based simulated annealing algorithm based on allele maximization, and PowerMarker-based simulated annealing algorithm based on maximizing genetic diversity. Of the constructed <jats:italic>Astragalus</jats:italic> core collections, the CoreFinder-based M strategy was found to be the most suitable approach as it reserved all the alleles and most of the genetic diversity parameters were higher than those of the initial collection. Additional analyses demonstrated that the genetic diversity of the core collection matched the properties of the initial collection. Further, the phylogenetic trees indicated that the population structure of the core collection was similar to that of the initial collection. In addition, our results showed that the optimal grouping value of <jats:italic>K</jats:italic> was 2. The construction of a core collection is beneficial for the understanding, management, and utilization of <jats:italic>Astragalus</jats:italic>. Moreover, this study will act as a valuable reference for constructing core collections for other plants or fungi.</jats:p>"

The significance of the study lies in the fact that intercultural communication through the prism of cultural and civilizational developments reflects the sociocultural changes taking place at all levels of social development. The problem of application of theoretical knowledge about the communicative paradigm of modern culture with its polylogical core for the development of a specific model of intercultural communication and effective cultural policy relates to the difficulties of achieving compliance of the research results with the real state of the sociocultural environment. Basing on the previous and current research approaches and taking into consideration a systemic and synergistic approach as well as a dialogue concept, the authors aim to investigate theoretical modeling of intercultural interaction. As a result of investigation, the authors conclude that the study of models of intercultural interaction cannot be carried out without understanding the principles and factors of the dynamics of cultural changes in the modern world which allows us to consider the transition from a dialogue model to a polylogue model as a natural stage in the dynamics of culture. Also, the methodological set of philosophical and cultural studies of the dynamics of modern culture is proved as constantly expanding due to the new tendencies, like total digitalization. It is stated that overcoming outdated models of intercultural interaction and adopting the new ones is a long process that must be tested by the human society</jats:p>"

Currently, two important key points are making them more and more successful in the civil field, namely the decrease of production costs and the increase in navigation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Kalman filtering-based sensor fusion algorithm, using a low cost navigation platform that contains an inertial measurement unit (IMU), five ultrasonic ranging sensors and an optical flow camera. The aim is to improve navigation in indoor or GPS-denied environments. A multi-rate version of the Extended Kalman Filter is considered to deal with the use of heterogeneous sensors with different sampling rates, and the presence of non-linearities in the model. The effectiveness of the proposed sensor platform is evaluated by means of numerical tests on the dynamic flight simulator of a quadrotor. Results show high precision and robustness of the attitude estimation algorithm, with a reduced computational cost, being ready to be implemented on low-cost platforms.</jats:p>"

However, GPU architecture and programming model are different from that of traditional CPU. Accordingly, it is rather challenging to develop efficient GPU applications. This paper focuses on the key techniques of programming model and compiler optimization for many-core GPU, and addresses a number of key theoretical and technical issues. This paper proposes a many-threaded programming model ab-Stream, which would transparentize architecture differences and provide an easy to parallel, easy to program, easy to extend and easy to tune programming model. In addition, this paper proposes memory optimization and data transfer transformation according to data classification. Firstly, this paper proposes data layout pruning based on classification memory, and then proposes Ta T (Transfer after Transformed) for transferring Strided data between CPU and GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed techniques would significantly improve performance for GPGPU applications.</jats:p>",

Thirty-two outpatients affected by DD were administered the Structured Interview for DSM-IV-TR Personality Disorders (SIDP-IV), the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS). We analyzed the prevalence of personality disorder in our sample of patients with DD and studied the correlations between the severity of delusions and the different affective variables. Finally, we obtained a multivariate explanatory model of the severity of the delusions. The severity of delusions was directly associated with “grandiose fantasy” item of narcissistic personality and inversely related with the feelings of shame, fear, and guilt. In the multivariate model, the feeling of shame was the only independent variable capable of accounting for the severity of delusions that, in DD patients, would lie on an affective core of shame. </jats:p>"

While the identified wishes (e.g., for love, for support) were consistent between relative and non-relative narratives, there was significantly higher disharmony and lower harmony in narratives involving relatives with pathological narcissism. Described disharmony in these relationships involved the relative’s rejecting, subjugating and attacking behaviours, and participants rejecting and withdrawing behaviours. There was a prominent deactivation of participants attachment system when interacting with their relative with pathological narcissism, endorsing predominately dismissing relationship styles. Individuals with pathological narcissism were similarly rated as predominately dismissing.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Together, these results reflect the cycles of interpersonal dysfunction for individuals with pathological narcissism and their partners and family members.

The reasearch shows that the link importance assessment strategy based on betweenness centrality is the current optimal solution, but its high computational complexity makes it difficult to meet the application requirements of large-scale networks. The $ k $-core decomposition method, as a theoretical tool that can effectively analyze and characterize the topological properties of complex networks and systems, has been introduced to facilitate the generation of link importance assessment strategy and, based on this, a link importance assessment indicator link shell has been developed. The strategy achieves better results in numerical simulations. In this study, we incorporated topological overlap theory to further optimize the attack effect and propose a new link importance assessment indicator link topological shell called $ t $-$ shell $. Simulations using real world networks and scale-free networks show that $ t $-$ shell $ based target link importance assessment strategies perform better than $ shell $ based strategies without increasing the computational complexity; this can provide new ideas for the study of large-scale network destruction strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

Then, sensing electrodes were fabricated by modifying Pd/Ag@C core-shell nanoparticles on screen-printed electrodes (SPE) for electrochemical determination of bisphenol A (BPA). The composition and morphology of nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The electrochemical response characteristics of nanocomposites to BPA was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The results indicated that, compared with Ag@C and Pd/C, Pd/Ag@C nanocomposite shows greater catalytic activity to the oxidation of BPA due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Ag. Among the four synthesized Pd/Ag@C-x (x=1-4) nanomaterials, the Pd/Ag@C-3 exhibits the best sensing performance toward the sensitive detection of BPA. The linear range for BPA determination was from 8.0×10<jats:sup>-8</jats:sup> M to 1.5×10<jats:sup>-5</jats:sup>M with a detection limit of 1.0×10<jats:sup>-8</jats:sup> M. A less than 9% oxidation peak current change was observed on the determination of BPA using Pd/Ag@C-3/SPE when added different interfering species into the BPA solution. The oxidation peak current attenuation of BPA on Pd/Ag@C-3/SPE within five weeks was found to be less than 3.6%.</jats:p>"

This evaluation aims to confirm that the innovative design of the mission’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) meets the expectations of intended users. In this study, we provide an overview of initial results obtained for three high-priority applications; flood mapping, sea ice analysis, and wetland classification. In our study, the focus is on results obtained using not only linear polarization, but also the adopted Compact Polarimetric (CP) architecture in RCM. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba, suggesting smooth continuity between the two satellite missions for operational flood mapping. Visual analysis of coincident RCM CP and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. A statistical analysis using selected sea ice samples confirmed the increased contrast between thin and both rough and deformed ice in CP SAR. This finding is expected to enhance Canadian Ice Service’s (CIS) operational visual analysis of sea ice in RCM SAR imagery for ice chart production. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87. Marsh presented the highest user’s and producer’s accuracies (87.77% and 82.08%, respectively) compared to fog, fen, and swamp.</jats:p>"

If there is a shortage of such samples, preparation and development of artificially consolidated rock samples become necessary. These samples can be made of different compositions and by using different technologies. The used model materials can play a role in the exploitation of petroleum and natural gas, and they can also promote the development, selection or application of secondary or tertiary technologies in conventional and non-conventional reservoirs. The process developed and used by us makes it available to construct these rock samples from different raw materials, under different pressure and temperature conditions and by using different post-treatment methods. In this paper, the changes of petrophysical parameters (porosity, permeability) originating from a CO2-rich environment ensured by a post-treatment (cure) were analyzed. The authors proposed further investigations of additional important parameters – zeta-potential, wettability – which could alter during different preparation methods of artificially consolidated rock samples, and by this, they could also enhance the research of geological storage of CO2 and EOR technologies.</jats:p>"

However, little is known about how the offering of these retention strategies may vary across workplaces with different core work activities because the opportunities to implement different types of retention strategies are preconditioned by differences in the economic and labor market climate.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Research Design and Methods</jats:title><jats:p>The study utilizes data from a survey conducted among Danish workplaces in 2018, which is linked to administrative register data to conduct Karlson-Holm-Breen-corrected logistic regression models. The study distinguishes among production workplaces, service and welfare workplaces, and information workplaces.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Phased retirement is most prevalent in service and welfare workplaces, whereas job bridging is most prevalent in both service and welfare and production workplaces.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Determining the mechanical properties of fault-core-zone materials is challenging because of the low strength of such materials, which affects field sampling, specimen preparation, and laboratory testing. We overcame this problem by preparing and testing mechanical properties of 132 artificial fault-core-zone specimens consisting of mixtures of breccia, sand, clay, and water. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus (E), and penetration resistance value (PRV) of these fault-core-zone materials were measured, and the effects of breccia content and water content on mechanical properties were assessed. Results show that UCS is inversely proportional to breccia content and water content, and that E is inversely proportional to water content. Furthermore, the inverse relationship of UCS with water content varies with breccia content. UCS is proportional to both PRV and E, and the relationship for each varies with breccia content. High coefficients of determination (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.62–0.88) between the parameters suggest that breccia content, water content, and PRV are potentially useful parameters for estimating the mechanical properties of fault core zones.</jats:p>"

[3,4,5] Despite a multitude of existing exercise therapies, McGill has introduced three exercises for rehabilitating lower back pain, termed the McGill Big Three (MGB3).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Sports bras are engineer designed to enhance sports performance, which means that they need to provide an excellent fit, and offer adequate support and protection of the breasts to optimize their functionality. To effectively reduce breast motion during different intensity levels of exercise, the materials of sports bras are generally rigid which exert compressive forces onto the soft tissues of the breasts.  However, these materials may still restrict air flow and inhibit body heat loss, while the pressure from the bra exerted onto the skin may also increases physiological strain and wear discomfort.  This excessively high exerted pressure is known to produce an inhibitory effect on the sweating rate and associated with a significant rise in the axillary and core temperatures.  This preliminary study therefore investigates the influence of bra pressure on the upper body temperature and thermal comfort following a short duration of treadmill running. Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of increased bra pressure on thermal response following exercise.  The findings provide bra designers with insight into bra pressure and related bra design features necessary for optimal wear comfort during physical activities. Methods: A total of 12 young women have participated in this study to don a changeable sports bra that allows adjustment of tension or replacement of the bra components.  The skin and body core temperatures as well as heart rate for four bra conditions during treadmill running for 15 minutes at 8 km/h are recorded by using temperature and heart rate sensors. The subjectively perceived thermal and pressure comfort are evaluated by using a visual analog scale with ratings of 1 to 10.Results: Following exercise, there is no change in core temperature for all of the bra conditions studied.  Even though the body core temperature may increase due to the higher rate of heat production with muscular work done during treadmill running, the increase in heat dissipation tends to balance the increase in rate of metabolic heat production to maintain a stable core temperature.  After a short duration of treadmill running, the change in skin temperature ranges from 0.22oC to 3.56oC amongst the 4 bra conditions.  The shoulder strap area shows a slight change in skin temperature during exercise, and the participants are particularly sensitive to the increased pressure in this area, thus adversely affecting their ratings of the thermal and pressure comfort. Conclusion: In this study, the increased bra pressure does not show significant change in core temperature and heart rate during short duration exercise.  Even though the results are not statistically significant, the shoulder strap pressure is found to be related to the changes in skin temperature and subjective ratings of thermal and pressure comfort.</jats:p>"

In order for a construction project to be executed successfully, a competent team has to work closely together and implement project goals, and a project manager usually leads the team. For any project to succeed, every stakeholder, including the sponsor and implementation team, is responsible for its completion. However, the project manager has a vital role to play. This study, therefore, seeks to investigate the core competencies necessary for successfully completing a construction project. The study, conducted in Gauteng Province, South Africa, surveyed construction professionals. Survey results were used to develop a relative importance index. Findings from the survey revealed that innovative thinking, problem-solving skills, dependability, emotional maturity and control, confidence are vital traits required from project stakeholders to successfully complete projects. The study classified the identified competencies into two categories relating to personality traits and managerial traits. It was, therefore, concluded specific competencies must be inherent in project team members and management for a project to reach successful completion.</jats:p>"

While a wealth of research has been carried out on the various dimensions of this concept, including the drafting and implementation of frameworks for nursing competence, no unifying international framework has been forthcoming. Indeed, the continued development of more localized approaches, based on geography or specialization, would appear to be the most realistic objective. It is incumbent on nurse educationalists and researchers to build on existing frameworks and develop evidence-based tested methodologies for competence assessment in localized contexts. Currently, there is a dearth of such evidence-based frameworks in the Middle East and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in particular. This study aimed to formulate and validate a competence framework for undergraduate nursing students in KSA. Results: Following documentary analysis, framework drafting and a three round Delphi process, a consensus was reached as to elements, comprising six discrete domains, to be included. The identified competence domains provide a framework to guide the implementation of a competence-based assessment and move towards a competency-based curriculum for nursing education in KSA. Conclusions: The study concluded that providing a competency-based model and expanding and standardization of competency concept in different dimensions of nursing profession is a necessity; considering that clarification of the concept of competency, the recognition of its dimensions, characteristics and the factors affecting it help in determining the criteria and standardizing the competency tools.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Synthesizing academic literature into new knowledge through writing is a core skill that doctoral students engaged in research must learn. However, developing efficacy in synthesis skills as an academic writer is a culturally and cognitively demanding process that occurs over many years, requires abstraction, and draws upon critical reading skills. Doctoral reading is an invisible part of training, despite large reading loads in doctoral coursework. Further, reading, writing, and researching skills are co-constructed at the doctoral level as previously described by Kwan (2008). The purpose of this essay is to describe how the primary author used her experience as an EdD student, science teacher, and writer to develop a method that addresses doctoral reading challenges. The novel method described here combines categorical reading strategies with social collaborative annotation (SCA). This method centers on active, categorial reading to deconstruct arguments in the primary literature by identifying claim, evidence, reasoning, implications, and context (CERIC), which can serve as a critical reading pedagogy in existing courses, reading clubs, and seminars. Combining CERIC with SCA tools—ranging from homemade variations of Google Suite to purposeful annotation software, such as Hypothes.is.—can support an efficient doctoral reading process. This essay illustrates several worked examples and explores how this process supports retrieval, engagement, collaboration, inclusion, and community, particularly in online learning environments. Significant implications of this work are to make hidden reading expectations explicit and transform professor-centered transmission models of learning to student-centered sociocultural models of learning. The essay proposes next steps for testing the approach's effectiveness in online doctoral learning.</jats:p>"

Under the influence of various factors, such as the lack of experience, there are also several problems in the reform and practice of the curriculum. Among them, the most apparent problems are as follows: the curriculum reform is not synchronized with the development of teaching materials, the pertinence of practical teaching is lacking, and the guidance provided for professional certificate examinations is not well-established. This paper specifically analyzes the problems existing in the reform and practice of the core curriculum of Civil Engineering and Architecture under the “1+X” system, and then puts forward effective strategies for these problems.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this article is to identify the main patterns associated with the demolition of Soviet and Russian monuments in the two countries. The ‘decommunisation’ of public space is an element of Ukraine’s and Poland’s politics of memory, enshrined in legal acts. Its driving force is the Institutes of National Remembrance, whose priorities include dismantling Soviet and pre-revolutionary Russian monuments, which came into full swing after the beginning of Russia’s special military operation to denazify and demilitarise Ukraine. The official narratives allot Poland and Ukraine the role of victims of ‘two aggressors’ in World War II, which found themselves under ‘communist occupation’. Therefore, the politics of memory of the two countries seek to get rid of the ‘Soviet legacy’ as the legacy of the ‘occupying country’. Whilst Poland pursues ‘residual decommunisation’ focused on dismantling the remaining memorials to Soviet soldiers-liberators, Ukraine is committed to transforming ‘decommunisation’ into full-scale ‘derussification’. At the same time, the process of ‘re-Sovietisation/Sovietisation’ has been launched in the liberated territories of Ukraine. It consists in restoring previously destroyed monuments or installing new ones.</jats:p>"

This paper presents the design and implementation of a General Purpose FIFO Core which allows adjustment of the capacity along with the size of each data word. Status indicators were provided to indicate whether or not the FIFO was empty, half-full, or full. The number of data words stored in the FIFO was also indicated by designated output ports of the system. A status flag was also available to indicate when the size reached a predetermined threshold value. A separate interface was provided that allowed the data at any address to be accessed for reading. It was also possible to write a data word to the back of the FIFO while another data word was read from the front simultaneously. The FSM-D architectural model was applied to the design of the FIFO Core and the implementation was done in VHDL using the Xilinx ISE 14.7. The implemented core was simulated using ISim Logic Simulator of the Xilinx ISE platform, and it was found that the system core behaved as specified by the test cases.</jats:p>"

Salah satu sentra produksi tuna berada di Provinsi Jawa Timur tepatnya di Pelabuhan Perikanan Pantai (PPP) Pondokdadap, Kabupaten Malang. Kualitas ikan tuna di PPP Pondokdadap sebagian besar memiliki kualitas sedang (grade B) dan tidak sedikit pula yang memiliki kualitas C dan D. Hal ini terjadi karena fasilitas penanganan yang kurang memadai dan kurangnya pengetahuan para pelaku usaha bahwa dalam setiap kegiatan penanganan dan transportasi yang kurang baik terdapat risiko yang mengakibatkan terjadinya penurunan mutu sehingga nilai jualnya kurang maksimal. Tujuan penelitian ini yaitu mengidentifikasi dan memetakan risiko prioritas dalam aktivitas penanganan dan transportasi ikan tuna di PPP Pondokdadap dengan pendekatan FMEA. Sehingga didapatkan risiko kritis dan harus segera dilakukan pengembangan mitigasi pada perikanan tuna di PPP Pondokdadap. Penelitian dilaksanakan pada bulan November 2020. Metode pengumpulan data  menggunakan metode wawancara dan observasi langsung. Hasil yang diperoleh bahwa penurunan mutu terbesar berada pada spesies tuna albakor dengan berat ≥20kg. Terdapat 4 mode kegagalan (failure mode) yang menjadi risiko prioritas dalam penurunan mutu selama penanganan dan transportasi ikan tuna albakor ≥20kg di PPP Pondokdadap. Mode kegagalan tersebut yaitu pencucian ikan dengan air kotor, ikan dilempar saat penyortiran, ikan diletakkan di lantai tanpa alas dan penggunaan moda transportasi dengan mobil bak terbuka.&#x0D;\nKata kunci: Albakor, FMEA, penanganan, pondokdadap, risiko, transportasi</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Unlike intracellular chromosome, extracellular DNA (eDNA) may accelerate the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through natural transformation, but one of the core issues regarding to the taxonomic characterization of eDNA in the complex water environments is largely unknown. Hence, Illumina Miseq sequencing was used to identify the genotype of eDNA from wastewater (WW), river water (RW) and stormwater (SW) runoff. High-throughput qPCR targeting 384 genes was implemented to detect extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and mobile genetic elements (eMGEs). We obtained 2,708,291 high quality sequences from 66 eDNA samples. The SW exhibited the significant higher Shannon Index. Subsequently, we identified 34 core bacteria sources of eDNA widely distributed in the three water compartments. Among which, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Limnohabitans, Burkholderiaceae_unclassified, Methylotenera and Acinetobacter were the most prevalent. A total of 302 eARGs and eMGEs were detected, suggesting that eDNA is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir. Among the 127 shared genes of the three groups, 15 core resistance genes were filtered, including IS6100, sul1 NEW, intI1, ISPps1-pseud, aac3-Via, qacH_351 and ISSm2-Xanthob. The Procrustes analysis and Variance Partitioning Analysis (VPA) demonstrated that core bacteria and MGEs were significantly correlated with eARGs. These results suggested that the occurrence and changes of eARGs in the water compartments may be largely attributed to the core microbiota and eMGEs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim/Purpose: Digital literacy is critical to participation in a contemporary knowledge-based society and is requisite to both academic success and career development. Institutions of higher education have been slow to define, assess, and amplify digital literacy in parallel with advances in the enhancement of reading, writing, and arithmetic literacy. Perhaps as a consequence of the pandemic, awareness appears to be growing of the need to infuse digital literacy at both institutional and individual levels. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the promotion and amplification of digital literacy within top universities around the globe.\n\nBackground: For years, the role of higher education in the amplification of digital literacy among college students has been debated, but efforts have been limited primarily to ad hoc, unsystematic attempts to rectify disparities between students’ exposure and understanding. The impacts of COVID-19 exposed the reality that many institutions, professors, and college students were under-prepared for the surge in reliance on digital technologies.  \n\nMethodology: This paper explores the prevalence of digital literacy in the top public and private universities around the globe by conducting a qualitative examination on compulsory requirements, digital literacy offerings, university identified digital literacy initiatives, and university strategic plans. \n\nContribution: This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence for the need to expand the constructs of what it means to be digitally literate to address the ever-expanding range of emerging technologies and the impact of those technologies on society.\n\nFindings: The review of digital literacy amplification at top universities showed that none of the universities' admissions requirements required students to demonstrate digital competence and compulsory digital literacy was uncommon. However, a majority of universities undertook some form of initiative to promote digital literacy. These initiates included a focus on developing digitally literate society and workforce or developing innovative approaches to digital literacy education.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: The pandemic has generated a greater sense of urgency for institutions of higher education to ensure access to and understanding of digital technologies by students, faculty, and staff. Educational institutions will have to adapt their methodologies to promote explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies that combine the competencies possessed by users of technology with the generation of new competencies required to successfully participate in the digital transformation of education, business, and society.\n\nRecommendations for Researchers: This paper examined the top 50 universities around the globe. Additional re-search is needed to examine national, regional and local efforts in the quest to address the need for a digitally literate citizenry.\n\nImpact on Society: COVID-19 has thrust us into a new normal wherein digital competence is foundational to success in an ever digitally reliant world. Institutions of higher education are best positioned to carry out the initiatives, programs and re-search needed to enhance the digital literacy of all citizens, not just students and employees.\n\nFuture Research: Societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to emerge and will resonate for decades to come. Continued investigation, exploration and dis-semination of information related to effort to enhance and amplify digital literacy is necessary to ensure momentum to reimagine digital literacy education is maintained.</jats:p>"

The design and implementation of an AHB Master, RAM, ROM, FIFO and Memory Controller implementation is proposed in this paper. It is primarily divided into two categories: operation initiator (AHB MASTER) and AHB SLAVE. Furthermore, AHB master generate the operation in burst mode, single transfer according to interface requirement and Address generator, generates the address in increment or wrap mode, as well as completing data transfers with an asymmetric asynchronous FIFO with variable data widths for read and write. A bridge between an AHB Master and an AHB slave will be demonstrated using a memory controller, and their outcome in terms of area and speed will be address ed. A finite state machine will be used to design the control framework. Xilinx Virtex 2 XC2VP40 will be used to implement the AHB Master and Slave IP.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The composition of the Earth's core and mantle is set by the chemical equilibrium between metals and silicates during core/mantle segregation. The metallic core separated from the mantle by gravitational descent in the form of diapirs in a magma ocean, and therefore the dynamics of the diapir's downward movement has an influence on the chemical equilibrium. In this study, we characterize the descent of metallic droplets into a molten silicate using numerical models. By varying the silicate and metal viscosities (between 0.1 and 1000 Pa·s for each phase) as well as the partition coefficient between metal and silicate (Dmet/sil, varying between 1 and 1000), we obtained quantifying parametrizing equations for the degree of equilibrium between molten metal and molten silicate, in a regime characterized by low We (We &lt; 10) and low Re (10−3 &lt; Re&lt;102). We showed that the main parameters controlling the equilibrium for a siderophile element are the viscosity of the silicate and the partition coefficient. We applied our parameterization for Ni and Co in the context of late accretion on Earth so as to quantify the variation of the Ni/Co ratio after a large impact as a function of the magma ocean viscosity, for an iron-rain scenario of metal/silicate segregation. Using previous models (Canup, 2004) of the Moon–forming impact, we showed that the Moon formation had an effect on the current Ni/Co ratio. Depending on the radius of Theia's core and the viscosity of the magma ocean produced after the impact between the proto-Earth and Theia, the Moon formation could account for 0.45% to 3% of the current Ni/Co ratio for magma ocean viscosities of 0.1 to 100 Pa·s, respectively.</jats:p>"

Firstly, copper nanorods with tunable longitudinal surface plasmon resonances were synthesized by a seed-mediated method using Au nanoparticles as seeds. A convenient in situ sulfidation method was then applied to convert the outermost layer of Cu nanorods into Cu2−xS, to increase their stability and surface activity in photocatalytic applications. The thickness of Cu2−xS layer can be adjusted by controlling the amount of S source. The Cu/Cu2−xS core/shell nanorods exhibits two characteristic surface plasmon resonances located in visible and near-infrared regions, respectively. The photocatalytic performances of Cu nanorods and their derivatives were evaluated by measuring the degradation rate of methyl orange dyes. Compared with Cu nanorods, the Cu/Cu2−xS core/shell nanorods demonstrate more than a 13.6-fold enhancement in the degradation rate at 40 min. This work suggests a new direction for constructing derivative nanostructures of copper nanorods and exploring their applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Standard ad auction formats do not immediately extend to settings where multiple size configurations and layouts are available to advertisers. In these settings, the sale of web advertising space increasingly resembles a combinatorial auction with complementarities, where truthful auctions such as the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction can yield unacceptably low revenue. In “Fast Core Pricing for Rich Advertising Auctions,” Niazadeh, Hartline, Immorlica, Khani, and Lucier study and suggest core-selecting auctions, which boost revenue by setting payments so that no group of agents, including the auctioneer, can jointly improve their utilities by switching to a different outcome. Their main result is a combinatorial algorithm that finds an approximate bidder-optimal core point with an almost linear number of calls to the welfare-maximization oracle. This algorithm is faster than previously proposed heuristics in the literature and has theoretical guarantees. By accompanying the theoretical study with an experimental study based on Microsoft Bing Ad Auction data, the authors conclude that core pricing is implementable even for very time-sensitive practical use cases such as real-time online advertising and can yield more revenue than the VCG or generalized second price auction. </jats:p>",

This study considers the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services of Atresmedia and Mediaset España, the two main traditional media organizations in Spain that form a duopoly in the country’s commercial television sector, with the aim of understanding and evaluating their positioning strategy in this market and the results obtained through the diversification of their core business. Based on an analysis of their content, price, and promotion policies and the results in terms of subscriptions and revenues, slight differences emerge regarding the strategy and scope of these two groups in their own environment in the sector. They compete for customers to achieve growth in the audiovisual market while seeking to retain a cross-media, multiplatform audience, as well as expand their core business of commercial linear television against a background of a reduction of advertising spend on television and the expected increase of hybrid financing models.</jats:p>"

Although we know the computational complexity and the types of price functions necessary for combinatorial exchanges with quasilinear preferences, the respective literature does not consider financially constrained buyers. We show that computing market outcomes that respect budget constraints but are core stable is a problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Problems in this complexity class are rare, but ignoring budget constraints can lead to significant efficiency losses and instability. We introduce mixed integer bilevel linear programs (MIBLP) to compute core-stable market outcomes and provide effective column and constraint generation algorithms to solve these problems. Although full core stability quickly becomes intractable, we show that realistic problem sizes can actually be solved if the designer limits attention to deviations of small coalitions. This n-coalition stability is a practical approach to tame the computational complexity of the general problem and at the same time provides a reasonable level of stability for markets in the field where buyers have budget constraints. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Physical literacy, as embodied within physical education, has been vaunted as having increasing importance as a disposition for students of all abilities to establish lifelong adherence to physical activity. Physical education is a school curricular subject that supports the development of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for participating in active and healthy lifestyle. Physical literacy has become a hot topic in the field of physical education in schools in recent years. With the promulgation of \"the Development of Core literacy of Chinese Students\", the cultivation of Core literacy of Discipline becomes an important direction of deepening curriculum reform in China. The core literacy of physical education and health disciplines plays an important role in promoting students' core literacy. In order to cultivate the core literacy of physical education, we should make good use of every physical education class and reform the traditional physical education teaching model. The Chinese Health Physical Education Curriculum Model has its unique teaching characteristics, and it has positive effects on all dimensions of the core literacy of physical education and health discipline. This study used the Chinese Health Physical Education Curriculum Model to explore how the teaching characteristics of the model are used in physical education and what evidence is currently available to validate this view. This study uses an explorative literature overview with an inductive approach, comparative analysis, and significant themes in published peer reviewed articles, with a focus on physical literacy and physical education, and mathematical statistics method are also used in this study. The results show that the Chinese Physical Education Curriculum Model has an indirect effect on athletic ability, healthy behavior, and sports morality. Through structured exercises and 10 minutes of physical fitness, students' physical activity participation was improved, students' physical and mental health was enhanced, and students' core literacy of physical education and health discipline was promoted.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;span&gt;This research presents a new pre-processed class decomposition technique called density core graph-cut (DCGC). The method uses supervised clustering instead of a traditional unsupervised one to decompose the class. Supervised clustering requires additional label information to function and with that it gains a better understanding of the distribution. DCGC employs nearest neighbors to form a density core graph for each class. Then, the edges of each graph to be removed or cut is identified utilizing class information. Lastly, it yields final clusters by grouping all connected cores and assigning the remaining samples to a cluster where the nearest core belongs. Training neural network classifiers on complex label data will yield a better accuracy with the modified class representation. Intuitively, the decision boundaries separating classes based on the modified labels are less complex, and classifiers’ chance to reach these hyperplanes is higher. The results present that training neural networks using label representations from DCGC significantly helps improve the classification accuracy of neural networks on syntactic datasets as high as 30%. For real-world problems, the experiment presents a mixed result in which some datasets moderately benefit from DCGC.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Teacher educators have been doing similar pedagogical work: trying to identify the dynamic elements of what makes an expert teacher and distill those elements into a learner-centered teacher education framework that brings knowledge into action. One such practice-based teacher education framework is ambitious teaching core practices. Core practices are empirically-based moves and social routines that teachers learn to enact adaptively to enhance learning across diverse groups of students. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of ambitious teaching core practices to coach development and take a step toward identifying and defining coaching core practices. Findings from this Delphi panel of expert coaches resulted in 15 ambitious coaching core practices for facilitating athlete performance and well-being including allowing space for athlete exploration, creativity, and problem solving and developing and flexibly executing a practice plan. Applying the concept of core practices to coaching is both a novel way to understand effective coaching and a first step toward a new practice-based coach development framework.</jats:p>",

Similarly, steel cladding is at the center of attraction for researchers nowadays. In this research, the feasibility of using Uranium-Silicides (i.e., U3Si, U3Si2, and U3Si5) combined with different types of austenitic steel (i.e., AISI) was investigated to improve the safety performance. A three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-coded star ccm+ model was used to assess heat transfer performance in the hexagonal fuel assembly of a supercritical water-cooled reactor VVER-1200. Utilizing the computational environment of star ccm+, the test analysis was conducted for a portion of fuel height using the realizable K-Epsilon Two-Layer Wall turbulence model. This analysis showed that the combination of U3Si2 fuel with AISI-348 cladding got superiority over other ATF-AISI fuel-claddings assemblies to use in the reactor core of VVER-1200 because of their lower central fuel temperature value with good mechanical and thermal advantages. This work also derived an empirical heat transfer coefficient equation to guide the relevant future investigations on the thermal analysis of the core.</jats:p>",

Myths surrounding leadership are explored. Issues of loss, fear, and unequal treatment across social identities are explored, as is the impact of gender on perceptions of empathy in supervision. The impact of COVID-19 on supervision is discussed, with a focus on empathetic and compassionate practice. The typical arc of an employee from recruitment to departure is examined through an empathetic lens. The chapter also explores how an empathetic supervision style does not mean complacency nor does it mean a lack of strength.

Guided by the generalized multiparticle Mie theory, the Dirac electron scattering from a cluster of quantum dots is addressed. Indeed distant quantum dots may experience a sort of individual cloaking. But despite the multiple scattering of an incident electron from a set of adjacent quantum dots, <jats:italic>collective cloaking</jats:italic> may happen. Via a proper choice of the radii and bias voltages of shells, two most important scattering coefficients and hence the scattering efficiency of the cluster dramatically decrease. Energy-selective electron cloaks are realizable. More importantly, clusters simultaneously transparent to electrons of different energies, are achievable. Being quite sensitive to applied bias voltages, clusters of core–shell quantum dots may be used to develop switches with high on-off ratios.</jats:p>",

Food insecurity and nutrient deficiencies are major problems in the country, so breeding for enhanced nutritional traits, such as Zn content, could help to alleviate problems with malnutrition. <jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>To understand the breeding potential of nutritional traits in teff a core set of 24 varieties were sequenced and their mineral content, levels of phytate and protein, as well as a number of nutritionally valuable phenolic compounds measured in grain. Significant variation in all these traits was found between varieties. Genome wide sequencing of the 24 teff varieties revealed 3,193,582 unique SNPs and 897,272 unique INDELs relative to the teff reference var. Dabbi. Sequence analysis of two key transporter families involved in the uptake and transport of Zn by the plant led to the identification of 32 Zinc Iron Permease (ZIP) transporters and 14 Heavy Metal Associated (HMA) transporters in teff. Further analysis identified numerous variants, of which 14.6% of EtZIP and 12.4% of EtHMA variants were non-synonymous changes. Analysis of a key enzyme in flavanol synthesis, flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase (F3’H), identified a T-G variant in the teff homologue Et_s3159-0.29-1.mrna1 that was associated with the differences observed in kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside levels. <jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>Wide genetic and phenotypic variation was found in 24 Ethiopian teff varieties which would allow for breeding gains in many nutritional traits of importance to human health.</jats:p>"

The Brief Core Schemas Scale (BCSS) was developed to evaluate adaptive and dysfunctional beliefs about the self and others. This study describes the first psychometric analysis of the BCSS in the Portuguese population. Participants were recruited from community ( N = 320, Mage=27.31, DP = 12.75). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the BCSS factorial structure. Four-factor model revealed moderate to adequate goodness-of-fit indices (χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/df = 717.1, (246) p = .01; SRMR = .044; RMSEA = .077; CFI/TLI &lt; .90). Negative views of the self and others correlated positively with early maladaptive schemas, distress, and symptomatology and correlated negatively with psychological well-being. An inversed correlational pattern was found with the positive views of the self and others. Despite the model's moderate adherence to the data, results suggest that the BCSS may be an asset in the assessment of dysfunctional and adaptive cognitions about the self and others. Further analysis is required to deepen the psychometric properties of the BCSS in the Portuguese population. </jats:p>",

The Partnership for Native American Cancer Prevention (NACP) was established to addresses cancer health disparities in Native Americans. The Outreach Core of NACP ensures research and tribal community engagement are undertaken in a respectful and inclusive manner with tribal communities. The University of Arizona (UA) Outreach Core: (1) developed (&amp; distributed to 22 Arizona tribal communities) information materials focused on proper tribal consultation and engagement, foundational cancer information including statistics on leading causes of cancers, considerations for cancer survivors and caregivers over the continuum of cancer care including palliative/hospice care and clinical trials. (2) Hosts an Indigenous Cancer Prevention webinar series to showcase successful community-led cancer control initiatives in Indian Country. (3) In collaboration with the UA Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Program, offer training in Tribal Consultation &amp; Engagement with Native Communities. (4) Partnered to develop a well-women video to promote preventative cancer screening of Native American women. As part of the Indigenous Cancer Prevention webinar series, a total of seven speakers have presented on various Native American-focused cancer initiatives including: understanding pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, initiatives to address cancer burden; human papillomavirus and cervical cancer; quality of life among cancer survivors and survivorship issues; cancer among Alaska Natives; and cancer trends in Indian Country. Both the webinar series and the UA RCR training have been well received and pre- and post-tests and evaluations demonstrate an increase in knowledge and positive review of content and delivery. The webinar series has reached over 200 attendees of students, service providers, community members, and faculty across half of the United States.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Keyauni Leist, Jacquanette Slowtalker.

The cases to be studied come from companies, States, organizations, which are located in the center, such as in Southeast Asia: the Republic of India and the People’s Republic of China. It also takes the leading countries of Southeast Asia, led by Japan, first-generation of the Asian Tigers, Singapore, South Korea, Republic of China Taiwan (ROC); second generation, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, among others. Then, strategic cases are described, analyzed, and sought, in the period 2021-2022, the same countries of Central Asia, plus Japan, the first-generation Tigers, all those previously analyzed, plus Hong Kong and the Second generation, all the analyzed in the previous period, plus Malaysia and Cambodia (OJEDA F.

With this research scheme, the reader establishes a “road map” of the companies, which has been generated from a highly volatile international environment, but with great opportunities. It is also an attempt to show a business “catalogue of practices” from these countries, which can be an example for Western organizations, in times of global crisis and international price volatility, especially affecting the value chains of food commodities, energy and basic electronic supplies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aging is an archetypical complex process influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Genetic variants impart a gradient of effect sizes, albeit the effect sizes seem to be skewed toward those with small effect sizes. On one end of the spectrum are the rare monogenic premature aging syndromes, such as Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome, whereby single nucleotide changes lead to rapidly progressive premature aging. On the end of the spectrum is the complex, slowly progressive process of living to an arbitrary-defined old age, i.e., longevity. Whereas the genetic basis of rare premature aging syndromes has been elucidated, only a small fraction of the genetic determinants of longevity and life span, time from birth to death, have been identified. The latter point to the complexity of the process and involvement of myriad of genetic and non-genetic factors and hence, the diluted effect of each determinant on longevity. The genetic discoveries point to the involvement of the DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, particularly in the premature aging syndromes. Likewise, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1/mTOR/FOXO pathways have emerged as major regulators of life span. A notable fraction of the genetic variants that are associated with life span is also associated with age-related cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and dyslipidemia, which places cardiovascular aging at the core of human life span. The clinical impact of the discoveries pertains to the identification of the pathways that are involved in life span, which might serve as targets of interventions to prevent, slow, and even possibly reverse aging.</jats:p>"

The Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT) method provides a clinical guide for understanding the narratives of relationship conflicts told during therapy. We follow the case of Barbara, a 60 year old with a long history of chronic shyness. Her narratives follow a common CCRT: she wishes to feel safe, but fears that others are out to get her, which makes her withdraw. These patterns have pervasively repeated themselves in the past, present, and across different relationships (self, family, partners, colleagues). The therapist responds carefully by creating safety, tolerating her fears, and working to overcome these CCRT patterns, thus reducing her impulse to withdraw from treatment. Psychotherapists from many theoretical orientations can learn how patients mastering these repetitive negative CCRTs can lead to more adaptive relationship patterns that improve their mental health.</jats:p>",

To this end, we conduct axially symmetric numerical relativity simulations with multi-energy neutrino transport, using a hadron–quark hybrid equation of state (EOS). We consider four nonrotating progenitor models, whose masses range from 9.6 to 70 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>. We find that the two less-massive progenitor stars (9.6 and 11.2 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>) show a successful explosion, which is driven by the neutrino heating. They do not undergo the QCD phase transition and leave behind a neutron star. As for the more massive progenitor stars (50 and 70 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>), the proto-neutron star (PNS) core enters the phase transition region and experiences the second collapse. Because of a sudden stiffening of the EOS entering to the pure quark matter regime, a strong shock wave is formed and blows off the PNS envelope in the 50 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> model. Consequently the remnant becomes a quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, leading to the formation of the hybrid star. However, for the 70 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> model, the shock wave cannot overcome the continuous mass accretion and it readily becomes a black hole. We find that the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from supernova explosions driven by the hadron–quark phase transition are detectable for the present generation of neutrino and GW detectors. Furthermore, the analysis of the GW detector response reveals unique kHz signatures, which will allow us to distinguish this class of supernova explosions from failed and neutrino-driven explosions.</jats:p>",

In this study, we identified and classified lithofacies based on sedimentology reports in conjunction with well logs. Lucia's petrophysical classification method is used to classify rocks into three classes. Results revealed three lithofacies as A (sandstone, coarse to medium-grained), B (fine to medium-grained sandstone), and C (carbonaceous claystone, finely laminated with siltstone). Lithofacies A is the best reservoir quality and corresponds to class 1, while lithofacies B and C correspond to class 2 and 3, which are good and poor reservoir quality rock, respectively. An integrated reservoir zonation for the rocks is based on four different zonation methods (Flow Zone indicator (FZI), Winland r35, Hydraulic conductivity (HC), and Stratigraphy modified Lorenz plot (SMLP)). Four flow zones Reservoir rock types (RRTs) were identified as RRT1, RRT3, RRT4, and RRT5, respectively. The RRT5 is the best reservoir quality composed of a megaporous rock unit, with an average FZI value between 5 and 10 µm, and HC from 40 to 120 mD/v<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, ranked as very good. The most prolific flow units (RRT5 and RRT4 zones) form more than 75% of each well's flow capacities are supplied by two flow units (FU1 and FU3). The RRT1 is the most reduced rock quality composed of impervious and nanoporous rock. Quartz is the dominant framework grain, and siderite is the dominant cement that affects flow zones. This study has demonstrated a robust approach to delineate flow units in the OW oilfield. We have developed a useful regional petrophysical reservoir rock flow zonation model for clastic reservoir sediments. This study has produced, for the first time, insights into the petrophysical properties of the OW oilfield from the Bredasdorp Basin South Africa, based on integration of core and mineralogy data. A novel sandstone reservoir zonation classification criteria developed from this study can be applied to other datasets of sandstone reservoirs with confidence.</jats:p>"

However, the details of this light control mechanism have not been revealed to date. In this work, guanine micro-platelets floating in water are visualized via light projection near an image sensor. These guanine platelets demonstrate light scattering in specific directions. By setting a thin water layer on top of the image sensor’s cover glass, each platelet in the water layer forms column- or bar-code-shaped images on the screen. The existence of nanohole gratings in these platelets was confirmed by high-resolution optical microscopy. Numerical electromagnetic simulations indicated that the nanohole gratings contributed to the formation of unique light projection spots.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Wood cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) are the most abundant organic substance on earth, but their nanostructures are poorly understood. There are controversies regarding the glucan chain number (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>) of CMFs during initial synthesis and whether they become fused afterwards. Here, we combined small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses to resolve these controversies. We successfully developed SAXS measurement methods for the cross-section aspect ratio and area of the crystalline-ordered CMF core, which showed higher density than the semi-disordered shell. The 1:1 aspect ratio suggested that CMFs remain mostly segregated, not fused. The area measurement revealed the chain number in the core zone (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>core</jats:italic></jats:sub>). The ratio of ordered cellulose over total cellulose, termed <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>oc</jats:italic></jats:sub>, was determined by ssNMR. Using the formula <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>core</jats:italic></jats:sub> / <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>oc</jats:italic></jats:sub>, we found that the majority of wood CMFs contain 24 chains, conserved between gymnosperm and angiosperm trees. The average wood CMF has a crystalline-ordered core of ∼2.2 nm diameter and a semi-disordered shell of ∼0.5 nm thickness. In naturally and artificially aged wood, we only observed CMF aggregation (contact without crystalline continuity) but not fusion (forming conjoined crystalline unit). This further argued against the existence of partially fused CMFs in new wood, overturning the recently proposed 18-chain fusion hypothesis. Our findings are important for advancing wood structural knowledge and more efficient utilization of wood resources in sustainable bio-economies.</jats:p>"

It argues that these narratives have failed either to offer a holistic conceptualisation of such participation in theory or to achieve its enactment in practice for four main reasons: participation is framed as polemic, with limited evidence of efficacy; public service delivery has been conceptualised as a linear process, with participation at its margins; structural changes have been insufficient in embedding participation; and power asymmetries have been reinforced through successive reforms. To combat these long‐standing challenges, a value‐creation approach is presented, which starts from an assumption of participation as a defining feature of public service delivery and considered how its import can be maximised to create value for individuals and society.</jats:p>",

Electronic medical records were reviewed and noted for operative times as well as the presence or absence of a trainee (postgraduate year [PGY]-3 ophthalmology resident, PGY-5 pediatric ophthalmology fellow, or both).</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Results The average time needed for a two-horizontal muscle recession by all the three surgeons in the absence of a trainee averaged at 35.7 minutes (range: 24–48). This is increased by 34% in the presence of a trainee with an average of 47.88 minutes (range: 20–81) with a p-value &lt; 0.001. Similar comparisons were performed for a two-horizontal muscle recession in addition to bilateral inferior oblique weakening procedures for two surgeons. On average, in the absence of a trainee, this required an average of 61.9 minutes for completion with an increase of 31.8% with the participation of a trainee requiring 81.56 minutes.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Discussion The presence of trainees, whether residents or fellows, is a crucial component of medical education and training. It is important for their learning and helps develop strong future surgeons. However, this may increase surgical procedure times and affect the efficiency of the primary surgeon. This has important implications for surgical scheduling, surgical time utilization, and surgical productivity of those involved in trainee education.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Conclusion The presence of a trainee with a primary surgeon, although crucial to surgical training, may result in significant prolongation of strabismus surgical times.</jats:p>",

After determining the member forces, including bending moments, an alternative load path is indicated, generated if the internal welds are missing. Formulas are given to determine the weld stresses. In ULS some of the welds require a small amount of strengthening if the internal welds are omitted. In addition fatigue resistance was determined.

The structural response of concrete members subjected to low velocity high falling weight raised the interest of researchers in the previous years. The effect of impact due to landslide falling rocks on reinforced concrete (RC) slabs has been investigated by many researchers, while very few studied the effect of impact loading on pre-stressed structures, noting that a recent study was conducted at Beirut Arab University which compared the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete and post-tensioned slabs under impact loading from a 605 kg impactor freely dropped from a height of 20 m. Hollow core slabs are widely used in bridges and precast structures. Thus, studying their behavior due to such hazards becomes inevitable. This study focuses on these types of slabs. For a better understanding of the behavior, a full scale experimental program consists of testing a single span hollow core slab. The specimen has 6000 mm × 1200 mm × 200 mm dimensions with a 100 mm cast in a place topping slab. Successive free fall drops cases from 14 m height will be investigated on the prescribed slab having a span of 6000 m. This series of impacts will be held by hitting the single span hollow core slab at three different locations: center, edge, and near the support. The data from the testing program were used to assess the structural response in terms of experimental observations, maximum impact and inertia forces, structural damage/failure: type and pattern, acceleration response, and structural design recommendations. This research showed that the hollow core slab has a different dynamic behavior compared to the post tensioned and reinforced concrete slabs mentioned in the literature review section.</jats:p>"

While no different from other forms of confounding in theory, confounding by indication often requires specific methods to address the bias it creates in addition to common epidemiological adjustment or restriction methods. Clinical indication influencing treatment prescription is patient‐specific and complex, making it challenging to measure within nonexperimental research. Restriction of the study population to patients with the indication for treatment would effectively mitigate confounding by indication and bring about comparability between exposure and comparator populations with respect to probability of the exposure. Active comparators are often an effective practical solution to restrict the study population in this manner when indication cannot be measured accurately. This article discusses various forms of confounding by indication, the utility of active comparators for nonexperimental studies of treatment effects, and the active comparator, new user (ACNU) study design to implicitly condition on indication. Considerations for selecting active comparators and conducting an ACNU study design are discussed to enable increased adoption of these methods, improve quality of nonexperimental studies, and ultimately strengthen our evidence base for intended and unintended treatment effects in relevant target populations.</jats:p>",

Specific geometries of unit cells can thus be tailored for particular needs due to recent progress in additive manufacturing techniques. This paper experimentally studies how the grading of the cell unit angle of an auxetic core in a sandwich panel affects its energy absorbing capability and structural response. 3D printed sandwich panels with uniform and graded auxetic cellular core were tested under quasistatic compression. The results show that sandwich panels with graded core exhibit much better energy absorption capabilities with higher plateau stress and densification strain. This indicates that, by appropriately controlling its geometry, auxetic structures can show further potential as core in sandwich panels for energy absorption applications.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of printed hierarchical-sinusoidal corrugated core patterns and the load direction on the flexural properties of the cotton/epoxy composites sandwich panels. For the cores, six sinusoidal corrugated structures were considered. Besides, possible arrangements (transvers or longitudinal wave, arch downward or upward) of the sinusoidal corrugated cores with respect to the loading direction were considered. Totally, 72 cores were fabricated using a 3D printer and poly lactic acid material. It was observed that for the transverse arrangement, the flexural strength of sandwich panels is significantly improved by changing the pattern from the simple form to the hierarchical patterns. In contrast, for the longitudinal pattern, improvement in the flexural properties was not obtained by changing the core pattern. It was also manifested that corrugated core arrangement has remarkable effect on the mechanical properties of the sandwich panels. For the transverse pattern core panel, the maximum values of normalized face-sheet bending strength (FBS), core shear ultimate strength (CSUS) and energy absorption were obtained as 7.17 MPa/kg, 223.91 MPa/kg and 114.56 J/kg, respectively. Besides, for the longitudinal pattern core panel, the maximum values of FBS, CSUS and energy absorption were obtained as 7.86 MPa/kg, 245.78 MPa/kg and 330.75 J/kg, respectively. Comparing the obtained results with the available data in the literature manifested that the flexural properties of the corrugated core sandwich structures are significantly improved by changing its core system from the other materials to the printed material. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Estimation of core temperature is one of the crucial functionalities of the lithium-ion Battery Management System (BMS) towards providing effective thermal management, fault detection and operational safety. It is impractical to measure the core temperature of each cell using physical sensors, while at the same time implementing a complex core temperature estimation strategy in onboard low-cost BMS is also challenging due to high computational cost and the cost of implementation. Typically, a temperature estimation scheme consists of a heat generation model and a heat transfer model. Several researchers have already proposed ranges of thermal models with different levels of accuracy and complexity. Broadly, there are first-order and second-order heat resistor–capacitor-based thermal models of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for core and surface temperature estimation. This paper deals with a detailed comparative study between these two models using extensive laboratory test data and simulation study. The aim was to determine whether it is worth investing towards developing a second-order thermal model instead of a first-order model with respect to prediction accuracy considering the modeling complexity and experiments required. Both the thermal models along with the parameter estimation scheme were modeled and simulated in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. Models were validated using laboratory test data of a cylindrical 18,650 LIB cell. Further, a Kalman filter with appropriate process and measurement noise levels was used to estimate the core temperature in terms of measured surface and ambient temperatures. Results from the first-order model and second-order models were analyzed for comparison purposes.</jats:p>"

In this paper, for Si, Ge and core/shell Si/Ge nanowires the effect of the volume fraction and the type of core material on thermal conductivity at 300 K is investigated by means of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. Nanowires with experimentally observed &amp;lt;100&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;110&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;111&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;112&amp;gt; orientations and different cross sections were taken into account. It was found that for &amp;lt;112&amp;gt;-oriented Si-core/Ge-shell nanowires with a core volume fraction of ~30% the thermal conductivity is the lowest (5.76 W/(m · K)), while the thermal conductivity values for pure Si and Ge nanowires are 13.8 and 8.21 W/(m · K), respectively.

Using cardboard virtual reality viewers, this qualitative study explored how immersive 360° videos are relevant to journalism students’ core (i.e., emotional) skill acquisition in a classroom on crisis and trauma coverage. In this pilot study on applied instructional design, twenty-three student journal entries were analyzed, supported by the Cognitive and Affective Model of Immersive Learning (CAMIL). Key emerging themes included emotional impact, sense of presence, appeal of immersive experiences, and novelty. Pedagogical recommendations are presented to educators, instructional designers, and other audiences interested in integrating usable, existing, and affordable immersive content in journalism education.</jats:p>"

Longer length was strongly associated with higher Grade Group (GG) on biopsy or prostatectomy specimen, higher risk of extraprostatic extension/seminal vesicle invasion and positive surgical margin, and larger estimated tumor volume. When cases were compared based on biopsy specimen GG, higher grade was strongly associated with higher prostatectomy specimen GG, higher incidence of pT3/pT3b disease, and larger tumor volume. Outcome analysis further showed significantly higher risks for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in patients with 1 mm or more, 2 mm or more, 3 mm or more, GG2-4, GG3-4, GG4, less than 1 mm/GG2-4, less than 1 mm/GG3-4, less than 2 mm/GG3-4, 3 mm or more/GG2-4, or 3 mm or more/GG3-4 tumor on biopsy specimens, compared with respective control subgroups. In particular, 3 mm or more, GG3, and GG4 on biopsy specimens showed significance as independent prognosticators by multivariate analysis. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in the rate of upgrading or downgrading after radical prostatectomy among those subgrouped by biopsy specimen tumor length (eg, &amp;lt;1 mm [44.7%] versus ≥1/&amp;lt;2 mm [41.5%] versus ≥2/&amp;lt;3 mm [45.7%] versus ≥3 mm [46.9%]).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions.—</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>These results indicate that pathologists still need to make maximum efforts to grade relatively small prostate cancer on biopsy specimens.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

However, non-modular operations, such as sign and division operations, are computationally complex. A fractional representation based on the Chinese remainder theorem is widely used. In some cases, this method gives an incorrect result associated with round-off calculation errors. In this paper, we optimize the division operation in RNS using the Akushsky core function without critical cores. We show that the proposed method reduces the size of the operands by half and does not require additional restrictions on the divisor as in the division algorithm in RNS based on the approximate method.</jats:p>"

We report on the comprehensive survey of six major SV proteins to show that SV endocytosis in mouse hippocampal neurons at physiological temperature occurs independent of clathrin while the endocytic retrieval of a subset of SV proteins including the vesicular transporters for glutamate and GABA depend on sorting by the clathrin adaptor AP-2.

We hypothesized that cervical muscles are also part of the linked chain of axial muscles that provide core stabilization against torques applied to the hip joint by the extrinsic muscles of the legs. To test whether specific cervical muscles play a role in postural stabilization of the head and/or core stabilization of the pelvic girdle, we used surface electromyography to measure changes in muscle activity in response to force manipulations during constant speed running and maximum effort counter-movement jumps. We found that doubling the mass of the head during both running and maximum effort jumping had little or no effect on (1) acceleration of the body and (2) cervical muscle activity. Application of horizontal forward and rearward directed forces at the pelvis during running tripled mean fore and aft accelerations, thereby increasing both the pitching moments on the head and flexion and extension torques applied to the hip. These manipulations primarily resulted in increases in cervical muscle activity that is appropriate for core stabilization of the pelvis. Additionally, when subjects jumped maximally with an applied downward directed force that reduced acceleration and therefore need for cervical muscles to stabilize the head, cervical muscle activity did not decrease. These results suggest that during locomotion, rather than acting to stabilize the head against the effects of inertia, the superficial muscles of the neck monitored in this study help to stabilize the pelvis against torques imposed by the extrinsic muscles of the legs at the hip joint. We suggest that a division of labor may exist between deep cervical muscles that presumably provide postural stabilization of the head versus superficial cervical muscles that provide core stabilization against torques applied to the pelvic and pectoral girdles by the extrinsic appendicular muscles.</jats:p>",

To this end, it is essential to adopt integrated and continuous care focused on the person in his/her context. As a contribution, the Brief International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set for schizophrenia has been developed by international experts. The present study aims to develop a scale to classify the degree of disability for each of the categories of the Brief ICF Core Set for schizophrenia. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The classification criteria were first developed by the researchers and then submitted for assessment by national experts in the area of schizophrenia, using the modified e-Delphi method. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Two rounds of questions were asked, and a consensus was reached on the development of the Schizophrenia Functioning Core Set, consisting of all categories of the Brief ICF Core Set for schizophrenia and the criteria for classifying the degree of disability. The degree of agreement of the experts was greater than 90% in all categories. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The construction of the disability grading criteria was based on the characteristics of schizophrenia as defined in DSM-V, as well as on some functional assessment scales specifically for this disorder. The development of the Schizophrenia Functioning Core Set allows for reducing the subjectivity in the assessment of the functioning of people with schizophrenia, standardizing the application of criteria to assign the degree of disability in each of the categories. </jats:p>"

Data of 98 consecutive patients with SCD who underwent PCI between November 1, 2012, and March 10, 2015, were analyzed. Laboratory evaluation and virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) examination of culprit lesions were conducted before PCI. Patients were divided according to the median apo-C3 value into low apo-C3 (≤8.5 mg/dL) and high apo-C3 (&gt;8.5 mg/dL) groups. VH-IVUS data indicated that the percentage of necrotic core volume (%NC) was significantly higher in the high apo-C3 group than in the low apo-C3 group. Moreover, the %NC significantly correlated with the apo-C3 level (R=0.2109, P=0.037). Kaplan–Meier curve analysis revealed that freedom from MACEs decreased more in the high apo-C3 group than in the low apo-C3 group and in the high %NC group than in the low %NC group. Multivariate Cox hazards analysis showed that the %NC and high apo-C3 were independent predictors of 4-year MACEs. Apo-C3 may be a useful marker for future MACEs in patients with SCD after PCI and contribute to %NC growth.</jats:p>"

Some SBI programmes have proved their efficiency in some skill areas but not in others, even within the same study (Oxford, 1989). This study explores the effect of vocabulary strategy instruction application with a sample of 40 EFL learners attending a common core class in a Moroccan high school. The student participants were divided into an experimental group, which received vocabulary strategy training, and a control group, which followed the regular English language course. Vocabulary strategy use in both groups was evaluated with the use of the adapted Vocabulary Learning Questionnaire of Gu and Johnson’s (1996, pp. 673-679) (VLQ Version 3), which was distributed before and immediately after the intervention. The results indicated that after the completion of the intervention programme, the experimental group showed significant improvement in self-reported vocabulary strategy use as a whole as well as in all strategy groups. The findings of the current study prove the \"teachability\" of learning strategies and insist that explicit and integrated strategy training should be implemented in the EFL classroom. From a theoretical point of view, the results of the study may lead to a good understanding of the nature of language acquisition in general, particularly in foreign language learning contexts. Furthermore, the results may be very useful for practitioners who are involved in the areas of syllabus design, curriculum planning, and material development.</jats:p>"

First, based on the theory of the solid beam subjected to transverse blast loading, a semi-empirical analytical solution for the dynamic response of rectangular hollow metal tube is given subjected to transverse blast loading considering local denting effect and combined axial force and bending moment. Then, based on the analytical solution for the dynamic response of the metal tube, a semi-empirical analytical solution for the dynamic response of clamped rectangular sandwich tubes with metal foam core under transverse blast loading is obtained. The numerical calculation for the dynamic response of clamped rectangular sandwich tubes is carried out. The numerical results locate between the upper and lower bounds of the analytical solution. Next, using the least square method, an analytical method to predict the maximum deflection of sandwich tubes is given under no experimental or numerical data conditions based on the existing data. The present analytical method can be used to predict the dynamic response of clamped rectangular sandwich tubes with metal foam core under transverse blast loading. Also, the comparison of energy absorption between rectangular sandwich tube with metal foam core and rectangular hollow tube for the same mass is conducted. It is shown that the sandwich tube is better than the hollow tube in terms of energy absorption in large deflection. </jats:p>",

Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different core build-up materials on fracture resistance of endodontic ally treated teeth. Materials and methods:Freshly extracted forty permanent mandibular first molars were selected. Standardized access cavities were prepared, following which mesial canals were prepared up to F2 (8%25) and distal canals up to F3 (9%30)and obturated. The coronal portion of the specimen was altered by removing  the  mesial  wall  and  retaining  buccal,  lingual  and  mesial  walls  of 2mm and distal 5mm girth.Ten specimens each were rehabilitated with high copper amalgam, type IX GIC, posterior composite and Alkasite as core build-ups.  All  the  specimens  were  finally  rehabilitated  with  a  metal  crown.  The specimens  were  tested  for  fracture  resistance  using  a  universal  testing machine  under  oblique  (135oto  the  long  axis  of  teeth)  cyclic  loading.  The number  of  cycles  taken  to fracture,and  the  fracture  site  was  recorded.The results  of  mechanical  cyclic  loading  to  evaluate  fracture  resistance  showed that  compositecore  endured  the  maximum  number  of  cycles  to  fracture followed by amalgam, Alkasite and type IX GIC.To test the statistical significance inthe difference of mean value KICamong four   groups,   Kruskal-Wallis   one-way   analysis   of   variance   was   applied. Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was performed to determine which group significantly differed from the others. Results:From the results of this study, the composite was considered to be the best core build-up material. The newer material, Alkasite can bear stress almost to that of amalgam restoration. Conclusion:This studysuggeststhat Alkasite could be used as a core material for restoring the endodontically treated teeth.</jats:p>"

A majority of patients with sepsis enter the health system through the emergency department, and health professionals need to provide evidence-based care. Within the health system, interdepartmental teams were formed with the purpose to set a system-wide standard to meet the evidence-based practice standards for sepsis. Participants were recruited from every department that was involved with the care delivery of emergency department patients with sepsis. The team developed a team charter to state the group objectives. A gap analysis was completed to set group priorities. The first priority was to develop a system-wide sepsis alert process. The Operational Excellence coach conducted direct observations and interviews at each system facility and then a sepsis alert plan was developed. Two hospitals volunteered to pilot the sepsis alert within their emergency departments, and education was completed at each hospital. Informatics nurses developed electronic medical record workflow and outcome elements to help the team with the process. The pilot process showed an increase in compliance for core measures and laid the groundwork for each hospital to develop an individualized process.</jats:p>",

Improving the mechanical properties of the cores is significant to the strength, modulus, and stability of composite sandwich structures. Two kinds of core machining configurations were designed by combining thin grooves, perforated holes, and thick contour cuts as well as non-machining plain cores. The cores and sandwich structures with these configurations were fabricated using a vacuum-assistant infusion process. Static tensile, compressive, shear, and peeling tests were conducted on the infused cores and sandwich structures. The results showed that the tensile, compressive, and shear moduli, and compressive strength of the infused cores can be greatly improved. The tensile strength changed negligibly due to stress concentration induced by irregular foam cell and the shear-lag phenomenon of the resin column/foam interface. The shear strength of the infused cores increased slightly. The thick contour cuts and perforated holes can greatly improve the face sheet/core peel capacity of the sandwich structures, whereas the thin grooves can moderately improve the peel capacity. Both infused cores with the designed machining configurations exhibited positive effects on the compressive, tensile, and shear moduli, and compressive strength, considering the material costs. The study provides a comprehensive and quantitative insight into the effects of core machining configurations on mechanical properties of infused cores and composite sandwich structures.</jats:p>"

Recently, for a stationary EV charging system, the existence of a ferrite core improves power efficiency. However, for dynamic wireless charging, the output power fluctuates when the EV moves. Two main obstacles that must be dealt with is air-gaps and misalignment between the coils. This paper investigates clear design guidelines for fabrication of an efficient Resonant Inductive Power Transfer (RIPT) system for the EV battery charging application using a ferrite core. Two different geometry shapes of ferrite core, U and I cores, will be investigated and tested using simulation and experimental work. The proposed design was simulated in JMAG 14.0, and the prototype was tested in the laboratory. The expected output analysis from these two techniques was that the power efficiency of the ferrite pair should first be calculated. From the analysis and experimental results, it is seen that the pair of ferrite cores that used a U shape at the primary and secondary side provides the most efficient coupling in larger air-gap RIPT application with 94.69% on simulation JMAG 14.0 and 89.7% from conducting an experiment.\nABSTRAK: Teknologi Alih Kuasa Wayarles (WPT) dinamik telah diterima pakai dalam Kenderaan Elektrik (EV).

      "abstract": "<ns3:p>Identification of transcription factors (TFs) that could induce and direct cell conversion remains a challenge. Though several hundreds of TFs are usually transcribed in each cell type, the identity of a cell is controlled and can be achieved through the ectopic overexpression of only a small subset of so-called core TFs. Currently, the experimental identification of the core TFs for a broad spectrum of cell types remains challenging. Computational solutions to this problem would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell identity during natural embryonic or malignant development, as well as give a foundation for cell-based therapy. Herein, we propose a computational approach based on over-enrichment of transcription factors binding sites (TFBS) in differentially accessible chromatin regions that could identify the potential core TFs for a variety of primary human cells involved in hematopoiesis. Our approach enables the integration of both transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing, scRNA-seq) and epigenenomic (single-cell assay for transposable-accessible chromatin, scATAC-seq) data at the single-cell resolution to search for core TFs, and can be scalable to predict subsets of core TFs and their role in a given conversion between cells.</ns3:p>"

We present regional constraints of mantle viscosity for North America using a local Bayesian joint inversion of mantle flow and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models. Our localized mantle flow model uses new local geoid kernels created via spatio-spectral localization using Slepain basis functions, convolved with seismically derived mantle density to calculate and constrain against the regional free-air gravity field. The joint inversion with GIA uses two deglaciation of ice sheet models (GLAC1D-NA and ICE-6G-NA) and surface relative sea level data. We solve for the local 1D mantle viscosity structure for the entire North America (NA) region, the eastern region including Hudson Bay, and the western region of North America extending into the Pacific plate. Our results for the entire NA region show one order of magnitude viscosity jump at the 670 km boundary using a high seismic density scaling parameter (e.g., δlnp/δlnvs = 0.3). Seismic scaling parameter demonstrates significant influence on the resulting viscosity profile. However, when the NA region is further localized into eastern and western parts, the scaling factor becomes much less important for dictating the resulting upper mantle viscosity characteristics. Rather the respective local mantle density heterogeneities provide the dominate control on the upper mantle viscosity. We infer local 1D viscosity profiles that reflect the respective tectonic settings of each region's upper mantle, including a weak and shallow asthenosphere layer in the west, and deep sharp viscosity jumps in the eastern transition zone, below the suggested/proposed depth range of the eastern continental root.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The headline inflation in Saudi Arabia is subject to dramatic changes caused by new policies as the economy is undergoing structural changes since 2016. These changes could mislead policymakers as the underlying inflation may differ from the headline one. Since the announcement of Saudi Vision 2030 in April 2016, the Saudi economy entered a new era where the government has started to reform the economy to reduce its dependence on oil. As a result, many initiatives have been implemented with different impacts on the headline inflation such as imposing new taxes and expat levies and reforming energy prices. This research aims to calculate the core inflation in Saudi Arabia using two different methods: Trimmed Mean, and Median CPI. These two different methods were assessed based on their ability to track trends in the headline inflation over time as measured by the root mean square error and it ability to predict the future headline inflation.</jats:p>"

The compositional stratification and geodynamo of the Earth’s core are closely correlated with the transport properties of the fluid in the Earth core. We selected the typical FeNi fluid, and systemically calculated its diffusion coefficient and viscosity under Earth’s core condition by quantum molecular dynamics simulation. The diffusion coefficients and viscosity are almost constant along the core adiabatic curve. The self-diffusion coefficients of Ni along the core adiabatic range from 8.37\\(\\times\\)10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to 8.87\\(\\times\\)10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The diffusion coefficient increases with temperature increase, while viscosity decrease with temperature increase. The calculations on the transport properties suggest that the Ni impurities have a negligible effect on the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of Earth’s core. Combining the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni and the diffusion equation, the thickness of compositional stratification at the top of the core is 138.5 km.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As an important component of family business management, human resource allocation greatly affects all aspects of the company’s strategic direction and organizational structure. Therefore, the optimal allocation of core human resources in family businesses has become a topic of great practical significance. Based on the Markov model, this article is based on the B/S architecture, designed the three‐tier architecture of the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data layer adopted by the system, forming the basis of quality management, job management, performance management, and salary management‐oriented human resources optimization configuration system. Taking family business A as an example, the Markov chain is used to predict the flow of personnel in the company in the next three years. The results show that with the development of normalization and the improvement of the management level, the demand for personnel in the family business will decrease year by year. Competency analysis of human resources positions found that grassroots employees have higher requirements for competency, but at the same time, lower performance requirements, while company seniors need relatively low requirements for competence indicators and higher requirements for performance. In addition, through data calculation and prediction, it is found that the prediction accuracy of the model algorithm is 81.37% on average. Compared with other model algorithms, the Markov model algorithm has the highest accuracy in predicting the state, and the accurate prediction results make the recruitment work predictable. The system makes up for the shortcomings of traditional human resource management data, such as insufficient data, low accuracy, and inability to achieve homogeneity. It uses a centralized database to comprehensively and organically link human resource management‐related information to provide a basis for future family business human resource optimization.</jats:p>",

The experiments were conducted on two different structures of aluminum-tube honeycomb core, square structure and star structure. The specimens were tested in order to find energy absorption, specific energy absorption, and crashworthiness behaviors. The results revealed that circular honeycomb cores with star structure could resist higher impact load than circular honeycomb cores with square structure. In addition, the larger tubes showed a lower impact load the smaller tubes. It was also revealed that the greater the collapse distance of the aluminum-tube honeycomb core, the lower the load. Moreover, FEA simulation results, through ABAQUS.CAE, were compared to the experimental results. The results revealed that good agreement was achieved between the experimental results and the FEA results. The comparison results showed that the difference in maximum load between experimental and FEA model was 0.47–11.84%, which is a reliable analysis result. In terms of energy absorption and specific energy absorption, the difference in maximum load between experimental and FEA model was 23.54% and 16.23%, respectively.</jats:p>",

They are normally formed by two centrioles, embedded in a cloud of proteins known as pericentriolar material (PCM). The PCM ascribes centrioles with their microtubule nucleation capacity. <jats:italic>Toxoplasma gondii</jats:italic>, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, divides by endodyogeny. Successful cell division is critical for pathogenesis. The centrosome, one of the microtubule organizing centers of the cell, plays central roles in orchestrating the temporal and physical coordination of major organelle segregation and daughter cell formation. The <jats:italic>Toxoplasma</jats:italic> centrosome is constituted by two domains; an outer core, distal from the nucleus, and an inner core, proximal to the nucleus. This dual organization has been proposed to underlie <jats:italic>T. gondii</jats:italic>’s cell division plasticity. Homeostasis of the outer core has been shown to be critical for the proper assembly of the daughter cells. However, the role of the inner core remains undeciphered. Here, we focus on understanding the function of the inner core by studying the dynamics and role of its only known molecular marker; TgCEP250L1. We show that upon conditional degradation of TgCEP250L1, parasites are unable to survive. Mutants exhibit nuclear segregation defects, whilst normally forming daughter cells. In addition, the rest of the centrosome, defined by the position of the centrioles, disconnects from the nucleus. We explore the structural defects underlying these phenotypes by high resolution microscopy. We show that TgCEP250L1’s location is dynamic and encompasses the formation of the mitotic spindle. Moreover, we show that in the absence of TgCEP250L1, the microtubule binding protein TgEB1, fails to translocate from the nucleus to the mitotic spindle, while polyploid nuclei accumulate. Overall, our data supports a model in which the inner core of the <jats:italic>T. gondii</jats:italic> centrosome critically participates in cell division by directly impacting the formation or stability of the mitotic spindle.</jats:p>"

In this study, motivated by recent findings, we have addressed the modifications of structures and properties of HBC-porphyrin compounds by using instead of aromatic porphyrins antiaromatic 20π isophlorin derivatives of thiophene or selenophene. We have reported the first comparative computational investigation of the following systems: (i) HBC with one non-metallated aromatic porphyrin, P(N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), unit, HBC-P(N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), (ii) HBC with one S-core-modified antiaromatic porphyrin (S-isophlorin), PS<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, unit, HBC-PS<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, and (iii) HBC with one Se-core-modified antiaromatic porphyrin (Se-isophlorin), PSe<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, unit, HBC-PSe<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>. The study has been done employing the B3LYP/6-31G* approach (in the gas phase and in the implicit solvents, benzene and dichloromethane), and comparison with the B3LYP/6-31G** and B3LYP/6-311G* approaches was performed, where relevant. The effects of the core-modified antiaromatic isophlorins on the structures, electronic, and other properties, potentially including reactivity, of the whole building block HBC-isophlorin have been shown to be quite pronounced and to be noticeably stronger than the effects of the original aromatic non-metallated porphyrin. Thus, we have demonstrated theoretically that the complete porphyrin core-modification with other elements, this time with S and Se leading to the formation of the antiaromatic isophlorins, should be considered as a promising way for modifying and tuning structures, electronic properties and reactivity of the hexabenzocoronene-porphyrin(s) building blocks.</jats:p>",

Evidence suggests that RNA aids nucleation of these pathological aggregates; however, the mechanism has not been investigated at the level of atomic structure. Here we present the 3.4 Å resolution structure of fibrils of full-length recombinant tau protein in the presence of RNA, determined by electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM). The structure reveals the familiar in-register cross-β amyloid scaffold, but with a small fibril core spanning residues Glu391 to Ala426, a region disordered in the fuzzy coat in all previously studied tau polymorphs. RNA is bound on the fibril surface to the positively charged residues Arg406 and His407 and runs parallel to the fibril axis. The fibrils dissolve when RNAse is added, showing that RNA is necessary for fibril integrity. While this structure cannot exist simultaneously with the tau fibril structures extracted from patients’ brains, it could conceivably account for the nucleating effects of RNA cofactors followed by remodeling as fibrils mature.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance statement</jats:title><jats:p>Application of cryoEM has greatly expanded our understanding of atomic structures of mature pathological amyloid fibrils, but little is known at the molecular level of the initiation of fibril formation. RNA has been shown to be one cofactor for formation of fibrils of tau protein, and is known also to bind to other proteins, including TDP-43, FUS, and HNRNPA2, which form pathological inclusions. Our cryoEM structure of recombinant tau protein with RNA reveals a 36 residue, C-terminal fibril core bound to RNA which runs parallel to the fibril axis. We speculate that this structure could represent an early step in the formation of tau fibrils.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The international ice core community has a target to obtain continuous ice cores stretching back as far as 1.5 million years. This would provide vital data (including a CO2 profile) allowing us to assess ideas about the cause of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT). The European Beyond EPICA project and the Australian Million Year Ice Core project each plan to drill such a core in the region known as Little Dome C. Dating the cores will be challenging, and one approach will be to match some of the records obtained with existing marine sediment datasets, informed by similarities in the existing 800 kyr period. Water isotopes in Antarctica have been shown to closely mirror deepwater temperature, estimated from Mg / Ca ratios of benthic foraminifera, in a marine core on the Chatham Rise near to New Zealand. The dust record in ice cores resembles very closely a South Atlantic marine record of iron accumulation rate. By assuming these relationships continue beyond 800 ka, our ice core record could be synchronised to dated marine sediments. This could be supplemented, and allow synchronisation at higher resolution, by the identification of rapid millennial scale-events that are observed both in Antarctic methane records and in emerging records of planktic oxygen isotopes and alkenone sea surface temperature (SST) from the Portuguese Margin. Although published data remain quite sparse, it should also be possible to match 10Be from ice cores to records of geomagnetic palaeointensity and authigenic 10Be/9Be in marine sediments. However, there are a number of issues that have to be resolved before the ice core 10Be record can be used. The approach of matching records to a template will be most successful if the new core is in stratigraphic order, but should also provide constraints on disordered records, if used in combination with absolute radiogenic ages.\n                        </jats:p>"

Given this contextual setting, the study examines whether core elements of MM utilised in developed countries are relevant in developing countries, using higher education institutional (HEI) buildings in the Nigeria education sector as a case study. In obtaining data for this study, an empirical research design was employed. Precisely, a Delphi study piloted showed eight (8) core elements that influence effective maintenance management of HEI buildings in Nigeria. Of these eight (5) cores elements, five (5) of the elements have a very high influence on maintenance management of HEI buildings (VHI: 9.00 -10.00), and three (3) other elements had a high influence (HI: 7.00-8.99). The key finding from the study reveals that the core elements that influence maintenance management of HEI buildings include organisational maintenance policies, maintenance budget, human resources management, training, monitoring and supervision, maintenance information, communication among stakeholders, and maintenance culture. The study's finding indicated that these core elements are related to those of other countries, and effective MM of HEI buildings in developing countries education sectors is guaranteed when these core elements are integrated into the maintenance processes and operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The shock resistance of structures is of current interest of academia and industry. Sandwich structures have been proposed as alternatives to conventional monolithic structures in order to enhance the shock resistance. Sandwich structures are widely used in many important fields, such as ship, aircraft, automotive and aerospace industries, packaging and construction engineering.\nIn this study, a number of experiments were conducted to investigate the structural response of dynamically loaded on clamped (both end) 1mm thick monolithic aluminium beams and rubber core sandwich beams of 3.02 mm and 4.02 mm thicknesses impacted by a blunt nosed cylindrical projectile made of mild steel of diameter 12.8 mm, length 30.2 mm and mass 0.03018 Kg in sub ordinance velocity range (20 to 110 m/s). Sandwich structure consists of two face sheets of aluminium adhered to a low-density rubber core. The failure of composite specimens observed in the tests can be classified with respect to the front face sheet, core and back face sheet, respectively Different parameters like impact velocity, residual velocity, velocity drop, energy absorbed, kinetic energy, deflection, dimensionless external dynamic energy, and dimensionless maximum transverse permanent deformation were observed experimentally and calculated analytically with the help of work in the past.\nThree modes of failure of beams have been found during the experiment on monolithic and rubber core sandwich beams like mode-1: Fracture at the point of strike i.e. tearing; mode-2: Fracture at one or both support either on front face sheet or on back face sheet of beam i.e. end shear; mode-3: Fracture at the point of strike with bulging (cup shape) and after fracture beam turnaround from the support (in case of monolithic) or Fracture at the point of strike without bulging on front face sheet and after fracture on the back face sheet with bulging and beam turnaround from the support (in case of sandwich beam).</jats:p>"

In fact, the development of new products made of metal foams and steel could improve the performance of conventional buildings in terms of stiffness and resistance. The first structural applications of these materials have already shown the potential of composites made of foam and steel, and demonstrated the feasibility of producing mono‐dimensional and bi‐dimensional elements with a high resistance‐to‐weight ratio. Reducing the structural weight can be a significant advantage in many cases, such as infrastructures or buildings in seismic zones. Within this framework, the work presented in this paper aims to assess the response of composite sandwich panels made of steel and aluminium foam using a set of tests that will serve as the basis for developing a new system of dry‐assembled composite floors. The tests were carried out at the Strength laboratory (Structural Engineering Test Hall) at the University of Salerno, Italy and were designed to verify the mechanical properties of metal foam panels and double‐skin glued sandwich panels. The tests have shed light on the basic mechanical properties of both foams and sandwich panels.</jats:p>",

Therefore, many studies use tools modified and supplemented by Choi to measure the clinical performance of nursing students, but there is no tool to measure the core competencies of nursing students. Aim/Objectives: This methodological study tested the reliability and validity of a self-report instrument measuring the core competencies of nursing students. Internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity were assessed using confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis. Methods: Questionnaire data was collected from 249 nursing students at four universities in J province, South Korea, from August 20 to September 30, 2020. Results: The core competencies showed reliable internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.90 for the total scale. Factor loadings of the 32 items on seven subscales ranged from 0.53 to 0.88, and three factors explained a total variance of 66.22%. The seven subscales model was validated by confirmatory factor analysis (root mean square residual 0.90). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the instrument is useful in measuring the core competencies of nursing students.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nap-core sandwich, which is lightweight and characterized by many remarkable properties, comes from an extraordinary combination of sandwich-structured composites and textile materials. However, the application of it in industries is still limited due to a lack of understanding its mechanical properties and behaviors. Several studies based on experimentation or numerical simulation have been conducted to fulfill the shortage, and this study is in the mainstream of exploring how the sandwich composite performs when geometries or materials of the nap-core vary. Namely, the comparison of double sided structure and single sided structure used for the nap-core will be presented in this article. The inquiry derives from the fact that a nap-core can take either of the two structures, but the advantages and disadvantages of each have not been identified yet while manufacturers hardly own costly molds for both. Since only the double sided nap-core is actually available, a modeling method is being deployed in Abaqus engineering software to compare it with an equivalent single sided nap-core that is simulated having the same materials and boundary dimensions. Before that, the Representative Volume Element homogenization method was employed to effectively determine engineering constants of the nap-core’s knitted fabric. The final results reveal that the single sided nap-core has better strength than the double sided nap-core in typical loading cases, but it assumes less smooth stress distribution. </jats:p>",

To observe the effect of 12‐week core stability training on Cobb angle and the ratios of AEMG (averaged EMG) and IEMG (integral EMG) of paravertebral electromyography in thoracic and lumbar segments in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients and offer a practical‐based evidence for the rehabilitation treatment for AIS patients. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. 31 AIS female middle school students were randomly divided into an exercise group (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 16, 12 weeks of core stability training, 3 times/week) and AIS group (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 15). In addition, 15 female secondary school students without scoliosis were included as the normal group (the AIS group and normal group did not perform any regular physical exercise throughout the trial period and only receive regular evaluation and guidance). Before and after the experiment, the digital diagnostic equipment of Philips was used to examine the Cobb angle and Noraxon was used to measure the surface EMG signals of the back thoracic and lumbar paravertebral muscles. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. Compared with that before training, after 12 weeks of core stability training, the Cobb angle in the exercise group significantly decreased, and the ratio of AEMG (convex/concave) and IEMG (convex/concave) of paravertebral muscles in the thoracolumbar segment significantly decreased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively); there was no significant difference in the above indicators in the AIS group before and after the experiment (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05, respectively).

The core stability training can significantly reduce the Cobb angle of AIS and correct the bad posture of scoliosis patients, which may be related to the balance of the electromyographic activities (convex concave side) of paravertebral muscles in AIS patients.</jats:p>",

This area is located in The Konawe Regency, Kendari City and The South Konawe Regency with 21,785.14 ha. This area was still in initiation, so it has not marine spatial planning. This study aims to formulate and determine the core zone. Marxan was used to assign the core zone and solve the marine spatial planning and utilization conflict. Three scenarios were used to analyze the critical habitat of level protection at 30%, 50%, and combinations. These results described that scenario A has 751 ha, scenario B has 1008 ha, and combinations scenario have 1498 ha. The core zone area is under 1 % of the total area conservation. So, all scenarios do not qualify the criteria required by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Besides, all scenarios have qualified the thirty percents of critical habitat protection. Managers and stakeholders could use these findings to decide the core zone, spatial planning, and sustainable developments.</jats:p>",

The most common materials to achieve this goal are composite layered materials, including the sandwich ones. High strength, stiffness and low density have made sandwich composites one of the fundamental materials of the aerospace industry. Sandwich-structured composites can be manufactured with a variety of methods, differing primarily in the manufacturing time, which translates into an overall cost of making a composite component. The research focused on three methods of manufacturing sandwich composite materials with a honeycomb core, differing in the number of operations, during which it was possible to obtain a finished composite panel (single-phase, two-phase and three-phase methods). The authors manufactured and examined composites with a honeycomb cover and two composite glass fibre-reinforced covers. The composites were made by means of the vacuum bag method. As a result of the conducted study, it was found that composites manufactured with the single-phase method have the shortest manufacture time as well as the lowest material consumption, however their strength properties are the lowest. The two-phase method requires a longer manufacture time and more material consumption, however it makes it possible to obtain a composite with higher strength compared with the single-phase method. The three-phase method has the longest composite manufacture time and the highest material consumption.</jats:p>"

The sandwich panels with glass fiber-reinforced skins and polyurethane foam core were fabricated and then were treated with different hydrothermal aging conditions. The moisture absorption characteristic of the composite skins was evaluated. A modified Fickian formulation was proposed to predict the moisture absorption behavior of composite skins. The low-velocity impact resistance of the aged sandwich panels was determined at three different impact energies. The impact responses including contact force, deflection, and dissipated energy of the sandwich panels with and without hydrothermal aging were analyzed. The macroscopic and microscopic damage morphologies were observed by visual inspection and scanning electron microscope methods, respectively. The damage mechanism of the aged panels was revealed. Results indicate that the impact resistance of aged sandwich panels is degraded, and the performance degradation is larger with increasing aging temperature. Compared to the panel without hydrothermal aging, the reduction of the contact force is 35.69%, and the increase of the deflection is 71.43% for the aged panel at 70°C aging temperature. The fiber/matrix interfacial cohesive performance is degraded resulting from the hydrothermal aging.</jats:p>",

A single-center cross-sectional comparative study of 201 patients who presents with a recent history of fever. Infants Up to 12 months of age were included. Demographic characteristics such as age and gender, weight, mean axillary and rectal temperatures were documented. Fever is defined as rectal temperature &gt;38°C as opposed to &gt;37.4 in the axillary method. Results. The mean age was 6.1 ± 3.5 months. The mean (SD) rectal-axillary temperature difference was 0.8°C ± 0.7°C which was statistically significant ( P &lt; .001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of the axillary method for fever &gt;37.4 were 79.34% (95% CI [73-84.9]), 14.3% (95% CI [0.36-57.9]), 96.2% (95% CI [95-97.2]), and 2.4% (95% CI [0.4-13.5]), respectively. Conclusion. The rectal method remains highly important for accurate and prompt diagnosis in infants. </jats:p>",

CoFe2O4(111) thin films show a surface-to-bulk core level shift in both the Co 2p and Fe 2p core level photoemission spectra. Surface weighted components in the core level photoemission spectra of both Co 2p3/2 and Fe 2p3/2 can be distinguished from the bulk components, by angle-resolved x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, for CoFe2O4(111) thin films. The surface termination of CoFe2O4(111) contains both Co and Fe with no evidence of strong preferential surface termination of either an iron or cobalt oxide, except for CoFe2O4(111) in the thin film limit. With extensive annealing above room temperature, the cobalt oxide component of very thin CoFe2O4(111) films, grown on Al2O3 (0001), will lose oxygen.</jats:p>",

Using a pan-genomic approach to analyse whole genome sequences, it was found that the strains consisted of approximately 2200 shared genes and a much greater pool of genes present as an accessory genome. An unknown transmissible sequence of approximately 91 kb harbouring bacitracin resistance genes found in strain LmNG2 (1/2b) was revealed to be an Inc18 plasmid. The CT2051, strain LmNG3 (1/2a) haboured more unique genes (252 vs 230) than the well-known reference strain LmEGD-e (1/2a).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Low-permeability sandstone reservoirs have become an important exploration and reserve increase target in China, but most low-permeability sandstone reservoirs with high wax content and high freezing point will reduce their production after fracturing injection, especially in winter. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the field fracturing construction measures and reservoir characteristics. Generally, the fracturing fluid injected by fracturing operation is at room temperature, even lower than 5 °C in winter, and the viscosity and freezing point of crude oil in this block are high. Therefore, the research focuses on the properties of crude oil and the influence of temperature reduction on oil-bearing cores. In order to find out the mechanism of reservoir cold damage, this paper first observed the pore throat of rock sample slice after displacement experiment, and found that there were black paraffin particles in some pore throats; then the distribution of core pore size after displacement was analyzed by T2 spectrum of NMR, and it was found that the proportion of small pores increased gradually with the decrease of temperature. Finally, the displacement experiment is used to simulate the change of permeability in the process of formation cooling and heating after field fracturing. The permeability of crude oil is tested by changing the ambient temperature of displacement experiment. It is found that the permeability before cooling is larger than that after heating recovery, and the process is irreversible. Therefore, the cause of cold damage is that the injection temperature of fracturing fluid is far lower than the formation temperature and the precipitation of paraffin during the cooling process of crude oil. For reservoirs with high wax content and high freezing point, paraffin precipitation caused by cold damage has a great influence on formation permeability, and cold damage can be prevented by changing injection fracturing fluid temperature or adding paraffin inhibitor.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, leishmaniasis constitutes a public health issue in more than 88 countries, affecting mainly people from the tropics, subtropics, and the Mediterranean area. Every year, the prevalence of this infectious disease increases, with the appearance of 1.5–2 million new cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 500,000 cases of visceral leishmaniasis, endangering approximately 350 million people worldwide. Therefore, the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment makes the discovery and development of new antileishmanial therapies one of the focuses for the scientific community that, in association with WHO, hopes to eradicate this disease shortly. This paper is intended to highlight the relevance of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing tricyclic heterocycles, particularly acridine and xanthene derivatives, for the development of treatments against leishmaniasis. Thus, in this review, a thorough compilation of the most promising antileishmanial acridine and xanthene derivatives is performed from both natural and synthetic origins. Additionally, some structure–activity relationship studies are also depicted and discussed to provide insight into the optimal structural features responsible for these compounds’ antileishmanial activity.</jats:p>"

Communication, which so far played mainly the role of providing information in the course of the current rapid evolution, is beginning to be noticeable in every aspect of business operations. Currently, managers must be aware that communication affects the entire organization, while it is their role to influence communication in order to obtain the best benefits. The purpose of this article is to present comments or problems that were noticed by the authors of the reviewed articles during the communication process. Design/methodology/approach: This review is based on studies conducted in case to understand communication problems, published between 2017 and 2022. Findings: The analysis highlight that the communication problems in organizations are increasingly encountered and, what is most important, almost always very easy to solve. Practical implications: In the case that almost all the publications discussed are focused on the most common problems in enterprises, it can be assumed that with a high probability such problems will appear or have already appeared in every organization. Thanks to this review, as well as a deeper analysis of the aforementioned literature, readers of this article can very quickly identify similar communication problems in their environment and its exemplary solution. Originality/value: This review emphasizes that communication should be considered on many levels since it affects both people and organizations in different respects. In addition, in this research work, it can be indicated that communication allows us to better understand human needs and act on them appropriately.</jats:p>"

The pulse evolution dynamics with and without the effect of mode-area dispersion are compared and analyzed. We show that strong dispersion of the mode area in the proximity of the cladding wall thickness-induced resonances has a significant impact on the soliton pulse propagation, resulting in considerable changes in the conversion efficiencies in nonlinear frequency mixing processes. The differences become more prominent when the pump has higher energy and is nearer to a resonance. Hence, the mode-area dispersion must be accounted for when modeling such a case.</jats:p>"

Low-income households are adversely affected, being priced out of the limited stock. Core housing, a partial-provision strategy believed to require less financial resources has been neglected. This research focused on the potentials of core housing strategy in financial cost-saving and other aspects of public housing products’ performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) is the most promising and technologically evolved among the six nuclear reactor concepts selected by the Generation IV International Forum. Although it is compatible with a closed fuel cycle for sustainable energy production, its competitiveness depends on being able to achieve high fuel burn-up up to 200 GWd/t. This would enable efficient fuel utilization to minimize fuel cycle costs. Hence, development of optimized core materials, especially for fuel cladding tubes that are subjected to extreme conditions of intense fast-spectrum neutron irradiation, high temperatures, and mechanical and chemical fuel–cladding interactions, continues to be a priority worldwide. Resistance to void swelling, irradiation creep, and embrittlement are required to be enhanced to minimize dimensional changes and loss of ductility in core components, which limit achievable burn-up. Current SFR core materials comprise austenitic stainless steels (SS) and ferritic-martensitic (FM) steels. Cold-worked austenitic SS grades 304, 316, 316Ti, niobium-stabilized grades FV548, EI-847, EP-172, and Ti-modified 15Cr-15Ni SS, such as D9, 1.4970, 15/15Ti SS, and ChS-68, have been used for fuel cladding and ducts in SFRs built to date, and they withstand neutron irradiation damage up to 80–100 dpa. Subsequent improvements have been made by optimizing minor elements (titanium, silicon, and phosphorous) and multi-stabilization to develop advanced grades such as Si-modified 15-15Ti, Indian Fast Reactor Advanced Clad (IFAC-1), PNC-316, EK-164, and HT-UPS, which could support burn-up of 150 GWd/t. In the case of FM steels, several commercial grades are found suitable in view of their inherent void swelling resistance to 200 dpa, and are being developed for improved creep strength by oxide dispersion strengthening to realize burn-up of 200–250 GWd/t. This article presents the development of structural materials for SFR fuel pin cladding and ducts and associated enhancement of permissible fuel burn-up. Indian and international experience resulting from extensive in-pile and out-of-pile mechanical testing and fuel–cladding interactions has been covered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Communication between neurons through synapses includes the release of neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) and of neuromodulator-containing dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Neurexins (Nrxns), a polymorphic family of cell surface molecules encoded by three genes in vertebrates (Nrxn1–3), have been proposed as essential presynaptic organizers and as candidates for cell type-specific or even synapse-specific regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. However, it remains unknown whether Nrxns also regulate DCVs. Here, we report that at least β-neurexins (β-Nrxns), an extracellularly smaller Nrxn variant, are involved in the distribution of presynaptic DCVs. We found that conditional deletion of all three β-Nrxn isoforms in mice by lentivirus-mediated Cre recombinase expression in primary hippocampal neurons reduces the number of ultrastructurally identified DCVs in presynaptic boutons. Consistently, colabeling against marker proteins revealed a diminished population of chromogranin A- (ChrgA-) positive DCVs in synapses and axons of β-Nrxn-deficient neurons. Moreover, we validated the impaired DCV distribution in cerebellar brain tissue from constitutive β-Nrxn knockout (β-TKO) mice, where DCVs are normally abundant and β-Nrxn isoforms are prominently expressed. Finally, we observed that the ultrastructure and marker proteins of the Golgi apparatus, responsible for packaging neuropeptides into DCVs, seem unchanged. In conclusion, based on the validation from the two deletion strategies in conditional and constitutive KO mice, two neuronal populations from the hippocampus and cerebellum, and two experimental protocols in cultured neurons and in the brain tissue, this study presented morphological evidence that the number of DCVs at synapses is altered in the absence of β-Nrxns. Our results therefore point to an unexpected contribution of β-Nrxns to the organization of neuropeptide and neuromodulator function, in addition to their more established role in synaptic vesicle release.</jats:p>"

Surface stress, surface elasticity (surface Young's modulus), surface slice thickness and anisotropic deformation were considered. For a nanofilm with only several nanometers, curling behavior is apt to be more common than isotropic bending behavior. The curling behavior is an anisotropic problem and is different from isotropic bending behavior as Stoney formula interprets. The isotropic bending behavior makes nanofilm to become a ball-like object while curling behavior makes nanofilm to become a tube-like object. If surface elasticity is imbalance, surface stress sum will bend nanofilms and surface stress difference expands nanofilms. For the balance surface elasticity, surface stress sum induces isotropic elongation deformation despite the anisotropic shape of nanotubes. If surface elasticity is imbalance, the anisotropic elongation deformation in tangential and cylindrical directions appears.</jats:p>"

The mule-ear orchid,<jats:italic>Trichocentrum undulatum</jats:italic>(Orchidaceae), is a large flowering epiphyte found in southern Florida (USA), the Greater, and Lesser Antilles including Cuba. The plant is Florida state-listed as endangered with only one remaining small and declining population in a coastal mangrove forest due to historical extraction and habitat destruction. Currently, there is no systematic understanding of the species’ habitat requirements. To fill this void, we compared the habitat and microhabitat of the species on its northern distribution edge (southern Florida) and the core range (in Cuba). The Florida population has only one host species,<jats:italic>Conocarpus erectus</jats:italic>, found in one habitat type. This is in sharp contrast to the 92 documented hosts and 5 habitats across 8 provinces in Cuba. Based on our findings from Cuba, we suggest conservation and restoration options in Florida by proposing potential suitable host plants and habitats. Proactive restoration of this species will help to ease the threat from sea-level rise to the species by securing and expanding range margins.</jats:p>"

The conversion was determined by gravimetry; mean particle size, size distribution, and thermal response were measured by quasi-elastic light scattering (QLS). The core/shell structure was confirmed by TEM, and FTIR showed the presence of N-isopropyl acrilamide (NIPA), N-isopropyl methacrylamide (NIPMA), and CS in the nanohydrogels. The nanohydrogels were loaded with the drug doxycycline hyclate, and their release kinetic profile was determined at pH = 2.0 and 7.4 at their volume phase transition temperatures (TVPT). A higher amount of drug was released at acidic pH. Some mathematical models described in the literature were used to fit the experimental drug release data.</jats:p>"

In contrast to optical imaging, SAR imaging systems are not affected by weather and time and can detect targets in harsh conditions. Therefore, the SAR image has important application value in military and civilian purposes. This paper introduces the classification of Gaussian process. Gaussian process classification is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bass frame. This is a complete probability expression. Based on Gaussian process and SAR data, Gaussian process classification algorithm for SAR images is studied in this paper. In this paper, we introduce the basic principle of Gaussian process, briefly analyze the basic theory of classification and the characteristics of SAR images, provide the evaluation index system of image classification, and give the SAR classification model of Gaussian process. Taking Laplace approximation as an example, several classification algorithms are introduced directly. Based on the two classifications, we propose an indirect multipurpose classification method and a multifunction classification method for two-pair two-Gaussian processes. The SAR image algorithm based on the two categories is relatively simple and achieves certain results.</jats:p>",

This may pose a threat to medication safety and quality of care in municipal health and care services. This study explores how nurses and doctors in Norwegian nursing homes and home care services experience access to and exchange of CPI before two new national solutions, the Shared Medication List and the Summary Care Record, are implemented in Norway. We used a qualitative research design with semi-structured individual interviews with nurses (n = 17) and medical doctors (n = 6) from home care services and nursing homes in six Norwegian municipalities. Data were coded and analyzed following an approach based on grounded theory. Our participants reported having extensive experience of various challenges related to accessing and sharing CPI. Five main challenges emerged from our data: 1) excessive time consumption; 2) frustration; 3) uncertainty; 4) dependence; and 5) complexity and risk. Our participants thought that these challenges posed a risk to patient safety and quality of care, and they were especially concerned about medication information in patient transitions between levels of care. Our study shows that nurses and medical doctors face substantial challenges, because they lack seamless, up-to-date digital solutions able to share CPI across healthcare services. The ongoing national implementation of the SML and SCR should address these challenges directly, and closely evaluate their impact on patient safety and quality of care.</jats:p>"

The simulated and theoretical results reveal that the Fano resonance relies on the interference between a narrow band electric dipole resonance and a broad band magnetic dipole resonance. The electric and magnetic dipole resonances can be controlled independently. The radiation direction mutates between forward and backward scatterings at Fano resonance frequency with lower plasma frequency, but there is a “delay” of the mutation in frequency with higher plasma frequency. The reasons for generating the mutation and delay are explained by using scattering amplitudes. The research results can be applied to antenna, directional emission control, and sensor areas.</jats:p>",

Histological subtype, lymphovascular space invasion and tumor grade could have a prognostic and predictive value for patients’ outcome and the knowledge of these histologic characteristics may influence clinical decision making. However, studies evaluating the diagnostic value of various biopsy techniques regarding these parameters of cervical cancer are scarce. We reviewed 318 cases of cervical carcinoma with available pathology reports from preoperative core needle biopsy (CNB) assessment and from final postoperative evaluation of the hysterectomy specimen. Setting the postoperative comprehensive pathological evaluation as reference, we analysed CNB assessment of histological tumor characteristics. In addition, we performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors influencing the accuracy in identifying LVSI and tumor grade. CNB was highly accurate in discriminating histological subtype. Sensitivity and specificity were 98.8% and 89% for squamous cell carcinoma, 92.9% and 96.6% for adenocarcinoma, 33.3% and 100% in adenosquamous carcinoma respectively. Neuroendocrine carcinoma was always recognized correctly. The accuracy of the prediction of LVSI was 61.9% and was positively influenced by tumor size in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and negatively influenced by strong peritumoral inflammation. High tumor grade (G3) was diagnosed accurately in 73.9% of cases and was influenced by histological tumor type. In conclusion, CNB is an accurate sampling technique for histological classification of cervical cancer and represents a reasonable alternative to other biopsy techniques.</jats:p>"

Method: The mean age of the experimental group (EG) was 11.46±.51 years, the mean body weight was 38.38±12.02 kg, the mean height was 144,06±8.99 cm, the mean age of the control group (CG) was 11.53±.51 years. The average body weight of the thirty female volleyball players participating in the study as volunteers was 38.48±7.99 kg, the average height was 147.93±12.70 cm, and the training age was 3±1.2 years. The athletes participating in the research were randomly divided into two groups as control and experimental groups. Different training programs were applied to these groups. (EG), in addition to regular volleyball training, static and dynamic core training was performed 3 times a week for 30 minutes for 8 weeks. While (CG) only weekly regular volleyball training was applied. Pre-test measurements (balance, vertical jump, agility and flexibility) of both groups were performed before the studies. At the end of 8 weeks, the last test measurements of the groups were taken. To compare the pre and post values of the groups separately (2x2) repeated ANOVA was used. Results: The first and last test measurements of the groups were compared between the groups; According to the analysis of the data, a statistically significant difference was observed in the measurement values of the balance test, vertical jump test, agility test and flexibility test (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: In addition to regular volleyball training, dynamic and static core programs applied within the scope of conditioning studies contributed positively to some measured motor development characteristics of the athletes.</jats:p>"

The underlying mechanisms are only partly understood and there is no treatment to reverse PD progression. Here, we investigated the disease mechanism using mDA neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying the ILE368ASN mutation within the <jats:italic>PINK1</jats:italic> gene, which is strongly associated with PD. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and gene expression analysis of a <jats:italic>PINK1</jats:italic>-ILE368ASN and a control cell line identified genes differentially expressed during mDA neuron differentiation. Network analysis revealed that these genes form a core network, members of which interact with all known 19 protein-coding Parkinson’s disease-associated genes. This core network encompasses key PD-associated pathways, including ubiquitination, mitochondrial function, protein processing, RNA metabolism, and vesicular transport. Proteomics analysis showed a consistent alteration in proteins of dopamine metabolism, indicating a defect of dopaminergic metabolism in <jats:italic>PINK1</jats:italic>-ILE368ASN neurons. Our findings suggest the existence of a network onto which pathways associated with PD pathology converge, and offers an inclusive interpretation of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PD.</jats:p>"

Electron microscopy shows podocytes’ complex morphology, but direct visualization of their cytoskeleton and definitive identification of the proteins that comprise the cytoskeletal structures have remained elusive. The authors describe a novel technique that reveals the three-dimensional organization of the podocyte cytoskeleton, finding that actin cables inside foot processes are connected directly to slit diaphragms, to form a continuous mesh-like sheet covering the glomerular basement membrane. Their findings also reveal these actin cables to be part of an extensive, contiguous actin network surrounding the major processes and the podocyte cell body. Applying this technique may help elucidate the mechanobiologic mechanisms regulating podocyte architecture and reveal the ultrastructural changes in the actin network on podocyte injury.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Actin stress fibers are abundant in cultured cells, but little is known about them <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">in vivo</jats:italic>.

A technology to image the actin cytoskeleton at high resolution is needed to better understand the role of structures such as actin stress fibers in podocytes.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We developed the first visualization technique capable of resolving the three-dimensional cytoskeletal network in mouse podocytes in detail, while definitively identifying the proteins that comprise this network.

Based on the creep prediction formula given in the code for the design of CFST highway arch bridges issued in 2015, the creep prediction models of CFST under different core concrete conditions are studied. The results show that the concrete microcracks around the cavity defects are continuously generated and expanded during the compression process, resulting in the dislocation and sliding of the concrete. It increases the additional deformation of CFST; debonding defects hinder the redistribution of stress between the steel tube and the core concrete, weaken the interaction effect between the steel tube and the concrete, and increase the creep deformation of the core concrete. According to Different core concrete states, appropriate reference factors are selected to modify the creep prediction formula of CFST, which greatly improves the creep prediction accuracy of CFST members and defective members.</jats:p>",

Our study sheds light on the social forces and historical circumstances underlying an outsider’s journey from the margins of an established field to its core. Drawing on unique historical material, we develop a novel process view that highlights the shifting influence of forces operating at different levels in the accumulation, deployment, and conversion of various forms of capital (i.e., human, social, economic, and symbolic) that outsiders need to promote their ideas. In particular, our multilevel perspective accounts simultaneously for the individual’s efforts to push forward these ideas (micro-level), as well as the audience dynamics (meso-level) and exogenous forces (macro-level) that shape their recognition. Chanel’s historical case analysis also affords a window into one of the first female entrepreneurs with global impact in business history, with the added challenge of establishing herself in what at the time was a male-dominated and mature field.</jats:p>",

The research focuses on the built-up areas of villages, which together with public and private green areas, are defined as the Cores of the Village (CoV). The research was based on the Wroclaw Functional Area (WFA). The main objective of the study was to identify which sites in a CoV have the potential to increase Green Infrastructure (GI) network connectivity and how these have changed with the development of built-up areas. These sites have been defined as Potential Green Infrastructure Elements (PeGI). The study was conducted over three time periods: the early 20th century, the early 21st century and future plans. The research revealed that, within the historic CoV areas, there existed PeGIs that communicated with external GI elements, but that such connections between PeGIs and GI elements have not been taken into account in future development plans. Furthermore, increases in the area of built-up land have not been matched by an increase in PeGI area. However, through the creation of greenways, among other things, there is potential for shaping PeGI inside a CoV in a way which would strengthen GI structural connectivity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This research work deals with the development of a polymeric super-hydrophobic surface involving nano silica–titania core–shell particles. This core–shell structure enhanced the properties of two different materials in a single nanoparticle in an outstanding manner; polymeric coatings containing core silica and shell titania have improved the mechanical behavior and hydrophobicity of coating surfaces, respectively. This nano core–shell was synthesized through two different methodologies which were prepared at high and low processing temperature separately, that is, called sol–gel and peptization synthesis. Further surface properties of the prepared nanoparticles were investigated individually in solvent-based emulsions and water-based emulsions. Nanocoating formulations were developed on mild steel substrate for analysis on the mechanical behavior of the coating and contact angle measurement. In the coating formulation, nano core–shell concentrations ranged from 1% (wt) to 6% (wt), and used nanoparticles were functionalized with methyl trimethoxy silane for better surface properties. Based on the results of the experiment, core–shell nanocoatings have been found mechanically robust and superhydrophobic (∼145.1° ± 2°) coating. </jats:p>",

Such quasi-1D core–shell heterostructures are interleaved to build robust 3D networks with porous internal channels, which are favorable for efficient electron transport and ion diffusion, exposing active sites, fast redox kinetics, and high electrochemical utilization. When used as Li-ion anodes, both CNT@HBP-1 and CNT@HBP-2 exhibit larger specific capacity, better rate performance, and higher cycling stability compared to their pure polymers. Furthermore, CNT@HBP-2 delivers higher reversible capacities of 351 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 0.05 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and 81 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 1.0 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, compared to CNT@HBP-1 (335 and 56 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Besides, CNT@HBP-2 retains 268 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and 617 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the 500th cycles at 0.5 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, outperforming CNT@HBP-1 (155 and 256 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Further improvements in the electrochemical performance for CNT@HBP-2 relative to CNT@HBP-1 are attributable to the incorporation of additional redox-active triazine units into HBP-2. This work would unlock insights into the rational development of metal-free polymer-based electrodes for rechargeable batteries.</jats:p>",

The development started at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland in 2017, with the aim to replace VTT’s outdated legacy codes used for the deterministic safety analyses of Finnish power reactors. In addition to conventional large PWRs and BWRs, Kraken is intended to be used for the modeling of SMRs and emerging non-LWR technologies. The main computational modules include the Serpent Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport code, the Ants nodal neutronics solver, the FINIX fuel behavior module and the Kharon thermal hydraulics code, all developed at VTT. The core physics solution can be further coupled to system-scale simulations. In addition to development, significant effort has been devoted to verification and validation of the implemented methodologies. The reduced-order Ants code has been successfully used for steady-state, transient and burnup simulations of PWRs with rectangular and hexagonal core geometry. The Ants–Kharon–FINIX code sequence is actively used for the core design tasks in VTT’s district heating reactor project. This paper is a general overview on the background, functional description, current status and future plans for the Kraken framework. Due to the short history of development, Kraken has not yet been comprehensively validated or applied to full-scale core physics calculations. A review of previous studies is instead provided to exemplify the practical use.</jats:p>"

The obtained theoretical predictions of the effective Young’s modulus of nanowires agree well with the experimental data, which shows that the fixed-fixed nanowire is stiffened and the cantilevered nanowire is softened as the characteristic size of the cross section decreases. Furthermore, the contrastive analysis on the two kinds of nanowires demonstrates that increasing the nanowire aspect ratio would enhance the surface effect.

This method opens up an eco-friendly, practical, and straightforward route for synthesizing monometallic or bimetallic nanoparticles with a clean surfactant-free electrocatalytic surface. It is quite promising for large-scale preparation. The Pd@PdPt/CNTs electrocatalyst demonstrated a high specific mass activity for methanol oxidation (400.2 mAmgPt−1) and excellent stability towards direct methanol oxidation compared to its monometallic counterparts.</jats:p>"

In doing this, BPS disregards the integral role late-stage evolution plays in determining the final fate, remnant type, and remnant mass within the neutrino-driven explosion paradigm. To highlight differences between a popular prescription, which relies only on the core and final stellar mass and emerging methods, which rely on a star’s presupernova core structure, we generate a series of compact object distributions using three different methods for a sample population of single and binary stars computed in BPASS. The first method estimates remnant mass based on a star’s carbon–oxygen (CO) core mass and final total mass. The second method uses the presupernova core structure based on recent bare CO-core models combined with a parameterized explosion criterion to first determine final fate and remnant type, then remnant mass. The third method associates presupernova helium-core masses with remnant masses determined from public explosion models which rely implicitly on core structure. We find that the core-/final mass-based prescription favours lower mass remnants, including a large population of mass gap black holes, and predicts neutron star masses which span a wide range, whereas the structure-based prescriptions favour slightly higher mass remnants, mass gap black holes only as low as 3.5 M⊙, and predict NS mass distributions which cluster in a narrow range.</jats:p>",

In this study, we observed an out-of-plane shift current and demonstrated its electrical control at room temperature in a ferroelectric two-dimensional material CuInP2S6, by utilizing a multilayer graphene as a transparent electrode. The shift current origin was confirmed by an analysis of the excitation power dependence.

The simulation results show that a high nonlinear coefficient of 4410.303 W–1·km–1 and a low confinement loss of 10−20 dB·km–1 can simultaneously be achieved in the proposed PCFs at a 4.5 μm wavelength. Chromatic dispersions are ﬂat. The values of dispersion increase with increasing filling factor d/Λ and decrease with the increase in lattice constant Λ. In particular, some chromatic dispersion curves also cut the zero-dispersion line at two points. The flat dispersion feature, high nonlinearity, and small confinement loss of the proposed photonic crystal fiber structure make it suitable for supercontinuum.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, a composite sandwich panel with M-shaped core made of carbon fiber has been fabricated in this experiment.

Afterward, polyurethane foam with density of 80 kg/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> has been injected into the core of the sandwich panel. Then, a unique design was presented to sandwich panel cores. The study of force-displacement curves obtained from sandwich panel compression and three-point bending tests, showed that an optimum mechanical strength with a considerable lightweight. It should be noted that the experimental data was compared to numerical simulation in ABAQUS software. According to the results, polyurethane foam has improved the flexural strength of sandwich panels by 14% while this improvement for compressive strength is equal to 23%. As well as, it turned out that numerical results are in good agreement with experimental ones and make it possible to use simulation instead of time-consuming experimental procedures for design and analysis. </jats:p>",

First, according to the differentially expressed genes between different states (DCM/ICM and normal, or DCM and ICM) of samples, three sets of initial modules were obtained from the human metabolic network. Two permutation tests were used to evaluate the significance of the Pearson correlation coefficient difference score of the initial modules, and three candidate modules were screened out. Then, a cardiomyopathy risk module that was significantly related to DCM and ICM was determined according to the significance of the module score based on Markov random field. Finally, based on the shortest path between cardiomyopathy known genes, 13 core genes related to cardiomyopathy were identified. These core genes were enriched in pathways and functions significantly related to cardiomyopathy and could distinguish between samples of different states.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The identified core genes might serve as potential biomarkers of cardiomyopathy.

The radio galaxy sample is divided into two groups of core/non-core FRII, based on the existence of strong, weak or lack of single radio core component. We show that FRII LERGs with radio emission of the core have significantly higher [O III] line luminosities compared to the non-core LERG FRIIs. There is no significant difference between the hosts of the core and non-core FRIIs of LERG type in galaxy sizes, concentration indices, star formation rates, 4000-Å break strengths, colours, black hole masses, and black hole to stellar masses. We show that the results are not biased by the stellar masses, redshifts, and angular sizes of the radio galaxies. We argue that the detection of higher [O III] luminosities in the core FRIIs may indicate the presence of higher amounts of gas, very close to the active galactic nuclei (AGN) nucleus in the core FRIIs compared to the non-core FRIIs or may result from the interaction of the radio jets with this gas. The core and non-core FRIIs of the HERG type show no significant differences perhaps due to our small sample size. The effect of relativistic beaming on the radio luminosities and the contribution of restating AGN activity have also been considered.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During last few decades, the researchers have developed new structural systems which have no or minor damage after being hit by severe events like earthquake. Development of self-centering wall having alternative energy dissipation mechanisms was one of these achievements. A wide variety of rocking wall systems, such as jointed walls, hybrid walls, precast walls with end columns (PreWEC), and PreWEC core wall systems, are proposed and studied. This paper describes an analytical investigation of the lateral load behavior of two new types of hybrid rocking wall systems. Core rocking wall is achieved by merging four single hybrid rocking walls and coupled rocking wall is accomplished by coupling two rocking walls using embedded reinforced concrete beams. The concept of coupling hybrid rocking walls using embedded reinforced coupling beam is emerged from previous coupled conventional shear walls studies. As single rocking wall system, in coupled and core rocking wall, post-tensioning tendons are used as a mean to provide self-centering force, and mild steel bars are used to dissipate energy. The nonlinear behavior of the wall is due to the gap opening at the base joint. Three-dimensional finite element model of each system was developed. The stress distribution, crack propagation, and critical sections of these systems are investigated. The effect of spalling concrete cover in the toe region due to rocking action is explained. In addition, the reduction in stiffness and lateral load resisting capacity of the systems due to cracks is monitored. Finally, the lateral load behavior of single rocking walls is compared to that of core and coupled rocking wall systems.</jats:p>"

To this end, we build a constrained optimization model whose goal is to minimize the number of components used by optimally placed regenerators—the single biggest variable metric in core IP-over-WDM network design that eventually impacts total hardware count.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: Lung cancer histologic types and subtypes are closely associated with treatment selection and prognosis prediction. In this study, we aim to evaluate the suitability of computed tomography-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy (CT-guided PCNB) in typing and subtyping lung cancer. Methods: From August 2007 to December 2015, the patients who underwent CT-guided PCNB and lung lesion resection were retrospectively collected and analyzed. All pathological sections were reassessed in consensus by 2 junior pathologists (group A) and 2 senior pathologists (group B), respectively. All cases were diagnosed on 3 levels: first, malignant and benign diagnosis; second, histologic types diagnosis; and third, histologic subtypes diagnosis and compared with surgery results. Pearson chi-square test was used to compare the differences of diagnostic accuracy between pathologists in group A and group B. Results: A cohort of 160 patients was included in this study. On the first level, the diagnostic accuracy was 90.63% (group A) and 94.38% (group B), ( P = .20). On the second level, the diagnostic accuracy for malignant lesions, adenocarcinoma (ADC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) were, respectively, 72.66%, 84.72%, and 69.05% (group A) and 76.98%, 90.28%, and 71.43% (group B) ( P &gt; .05). On the third level, the diagnostic accuracy for ADC subtypes were 26.39% (group A) and 55.56% (group B) ( P &lt; 0.01); for SQC subtypes were 28.57% (group A) and 38.10% (group B) ( P = 0.36). Conclusion: Small specimens obtained by CT-guided PCNB were suitable for the diagnosis of lung cancer histologic types, which may contribute to the selection of a suitable treatment strategy for the unresectable lung cancers. While for the diagnosis of subtypes, discussion with experienced pathologists was recommended. </jats:p>",

Many studies use the rich emotional images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) to facilitate affective research. While IAPS images can be classified into emotional categories such as fear or disgust, the number of images per discrete emotional category is limited.

In this study, core–shell-structured Si-based NiO nanoflowers, Si@NiO, were prepared by a modified chemical bath deposition method followed by thermal reduction. The crystal morphology and basic structure of the composites were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), specific surface area (BET) and porosity analysis (BJT), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The electrochemical properties of the Si@NiO nanoflowers were examined through the redox reaction of ascorbic acid with the metal ions present on the surface of the core–shell nanoflowers. This reaction favored the formation of reactive oxygen species. The Si@NiO nanoflowers showed excellent anticancer activity and low cytotoxicity toward the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), respectively, demonstrating that the anticancer activities of the Si@NiO nanoflowers were primarily derived from the oxidative capacity of the metal ions on the surface, rather than from the released metal ions. Thus, this proves that Si-based NiO nanoflowers can act as a promising candidate for therapeutic applications.</jats:p>"

Optical responses, power balances, and field distributions collectively show that the hollow-core system has many advantages over the solid-core system in terms of selective reflection, omnidirectional absorption capability, and overall cooling performance. The investigation sheds more light on the physics in the hollow-core structures and suggests an alternative biomimetic scheme for thermal management.</jats:p>",

Due to the flexible and adjustable refractive index of the deposited material, the RI detection range of the sensor is expanded. The simulation results show that the proposed sensor owns good responses in both low and high refractive index regions, with the corresponding RI sensitivities of 1043.71 nm/RIU and 1234.86 nm/RIU respectively, while the FWHM is only about 20 nm. There are some potential applications for the proposed sensor in environmental monitoring, biochemical detection, food safety etc.</jats:p>",

Identifying a core population for a hospital trust, particularly those in urban areas where there are multiple providers and high population churn, is essential to understanding local key health needs especially given the move to integrated care systems. This can enable effective planning and delivery of preventive interventions and community engagement, rather than simply treating those presenting to services. In this article we describe a practical method for identifying a hospital’s catchment population based on where potential patients are most likely to reside, and describe that population’s size, demographic and social profile, and the key health needs.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A 30% proportional flow method was used to identify a catchment population using an acute hospital trust in West London as an example. Records of all hospital attendances between 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> April 2017 and 31<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> March 2018 were analysed using Hospital Episode Statistics. Any Lower Layer Super Output Areas where 30% or more of residents who attended any hospital for care did so at the example trust were assigned to the catchment area. Publicly available local and national datasets were then applied to identify and describe the population’s key health needs.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A catchment comprising 617,709 people, of an equal gender-split (50.4% male) and predominantly working age (15 to 64 years) population was identified. Thirty nine point six percent of residents identified as being from Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups, a similar proportion that reported being born abroad, with over 85 languages spoken. Health indicators were estimated, including: a healthy life expectancy difference of over twenty years; bowel cancer screening coverage of 48.8%; chlamydia diagnosis rates of 2,136 per 100,000; prevalence of visible dental decay among five-year-olds of 27.9%.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We define a blueprint by which a catchment can be defined for a hospital trust and demonstrate the value a hospital-view of the local population could provide in understanding local health needs and enabling population-level health improvement interventions. While an individual approach allows tailoring to local context and need, there could be an efficiency saving were such public health information made routinely and regularly available for every NHS hospital.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

An online questionnaire survey is used in the research design. The data was analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. To evaluate the data from 216 workers, correlation analysis and regression were performed using all exogenous constructs as independent variables and the endogenous construct as the dependent variable. The study’s findings revealed that workplace bullying causes emotional labor among teachers, leading to employee cynicism, with core-self-evaluation as a significant mediator. The current study’s findings have consequences for both practice and theory.

The Inventory of Carbon &amp; Energy (ICE) and the Carbon Calculator tool were used to calculate the carbon footprint from \"cradle to grave\" to determine whether the use of a CLT solution provides improved environmental performance over the traditional concrete solutions. The carbon footprint results indicate that the use of a hollow-core precast concrete floor system emits less carbon than the other two systems, although the concrete requires more fossil fuel input than the timber during the manufacturing process, so based on this, the footprint from cradle to gate for the timber was expected to be the less than that of the concrete. However, the results show the opposite; this is because of the differences in the material quantities needed in each system.</jats:p>"

The herein described deoxyenhygrolides C–J (1–8) feature a butenolide core with an ethyl residue at C-3 of the γ-lactone in contrast to the previously described derivatives, deoxyenhygrolides A and B, which feature an isobutyl residue at this position.

Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous and dissolved organic\ncarbon concentrations increased with <jats:italic>C. polykrikoides</jats:italic> density.\nThis may reflect the change in biogeochemical cycling due to HAB release\nof extra polymeric substances. Furthermore, a total of 88 core bacterial\noperational taxonomic units (OTUs, with relative abundance\n&gt; 1%) were identified. These included Gammaproteobacteria\n(36 OTUs), Flavobacteriia (24), Alphaproteobacteria (18), and other taxa\n(11).

The proposed assembly can replace conventional components such as mirrors and lenses for realizing subminiature optical engines applicable to on-board integration. To minimize the total insertion loss of the waveguide when connected to a high-speed VCSEL and a GI-core multimode fiber (MMF) at each end, the characteristics of the beam emitted from VCSELs are measured and taken into consideration for the waveguide design. In order to confirm the effect of insertion loss reduction by the waveguide numerical aperture control, 90°-bent GI-core polymer waveguides are fabricated applying the Mosquito method. The fabricated waveguide exhibits a total insertion loss as low as about 2 dB at 850-nm wavelength, which includes the coupling losses at both ends, bending, and propagation losses. We also investigate a way to reduce the insertion loss when a gap exists between the waveguide and VCSEL chip. We theoretically and experimentally confirm that filling the gap with a high index resin can reduce the coupling loss by 5 dB.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the two-walled cylindrical shell is stimulated applying an acoustic oblique plane wave. The equations of motion are derived according to Hamilton’s principle using the first-order shear deformation theory for every three layers of the construction. Additionally, by the aid of employing the Zener mathematical model for the core of polymeric foam, mechanical properties are determined. To authenticate the results of this study, the damping of the core layer goes to zero. Therefore, the numerical results in this special case are compared with those of isotropic shells. The results prove that the presented model has high accuracy. It is also designated that decreasing the power-law exponent of the core leads to improving the sound transmission loss through the thickness of the construction. Besides, in addition to probe some configurations versus alterations of frequencies and dimensions, the convergence algorithm is provided. Consequently, it is realized that by increasing the excitation frequency, the minimum number of modes to find the convergence conditions is enhanced. The results also contain a comparison between the sound transmission loss coefficient for four different models of a core of a sandwiched cylindrical shell. It is comprehended that the presented model has a transmission loss coefficient more than the other types of the core at high frequencies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Metastasis is the leading cause of melanoma-related mortality. Current therapies are rarely curative for metastatic melanoma, revealing the urgent need to identify more effective preventive and therapeutic targets. This study aimed to screen the core genes and molecular mechanisms related to melanoma metastasis. A gene expression profile, GSE8401, including 31 primary melanoma and 52 metastatic melanoma clinical samples, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between melanoma metastases and primary melanoma were screened using GEO2R tool. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analyses of DEGs were performed using the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and Cytoscape with Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in tools were utilized to detect the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network among DEGs. The top 10 genes with the highest degrees of the PPI network were defined as hub genes. In the results, 425 DEGs, including 60 upregulated genes and 365 downregulated genes, were identified. The upregulated genes were enriched in ECM–receptor interactions and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, while 365 downregulated genes were enriched in amoebiasis, melanogenesis, and ECM–receptor interactions. The defined hub genes included CDK1, COL17A1, EGFR, DSG1, KRT14, FLG, CDH1, DSP, IVL, and KRT5. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of the hub genes during melanoma metastasis were verified in the TCGA database and paired post- and premetastatic melanoma cells, respectively. Finally, KRT5-specific siRNAs were utilized to reduce the KRT5 expression in melanoma A375 cells. An MTT assay and a colony formation assay showed that KRT5 knockdown significantly promoted the proliferation of A375 cells. A Transwell assay further suggested that KRT5 knockdown significantly increased the cell migration and cell invasion of A375 cells. This bioinformatics study provided a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of melanoma metastasis. The in vitro experiments showed that KRT5 played the inhibitory effects on melanoma metastasis. Therefore, KRT5 may serve important roles in melanoma metastasis.</jats:p>"

Two copper-beryllium (Cu-2Be) rings with thermal conductivities of 175.3 W/m·K and 206.5 W/m·K were manufactured and installed onto a wheel core as the substrate of the cooling wheel. The effects of cooling rate on the soft magnetic properties of Fe-Si-B amorphous ribbons were investigated by pragmatic ribbon casting. The results show that the increment in the thermal conductivity of the cooling wheel substrate from 175.3 W/m·K to 206.5 W/m·K lowered the coercive force of amorphous ribbon from 2.48 A/m to 1.92 A/m and reduced the core losses at 1.4 T and 50 Hz by up to 22.1%.</jats:p>"

The core demand is large in the study of reservoir lithology and physical properties. Although the high-cost freezing and encapsulation processes are used in the process of coring site and indoor processing, they are still easy to damage in the process of extracting cores. Moreover, the physical parameters of ordinary artificial cores are too different from those of producing cores to obtain accurate lithology and physical parameters. So, replacing the production cores with outcrop cores may become an important method to study the physical parameters of reservoirs. In this paper, the micro-velocity displacement method and saturated heavy oil method are used to study the lithology and physical property parameters of outcrop cores. The results show that compared with those of producing cores, the rock mechanics parameters of outcrop cores after high-pressure heavy oil saturation treatment are basically consistent with those of field cores. Therefore, it can be used to replace the core to study the physical parameters of rocks in special cases.</jats:p>"

Random number generators (RNGs) find application in many devices, ranging from dice and roulette wheels, via computer algorithms, lasers to quantum systems, which inevitably capitalize on their physical dynamics at respective spatio-temporal scales. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first mathematically proven true RNG (TRNG) based on a mechanical system, particularly the triple linkage of Thurston and Weeks. By using certain parameters, its free motion has been proven to be an Anosov flow, from which we can show that it has an exponential mixing property and structural stability. We contend that this mechanical Anosov flow can be used as a TRNG, which requires that the random number should be unpredictable, irreproducible, robust against the inevitable noise seen in physical implementations, and the resulting distribution’s controllability (an important consideration in practice). We investigate the proposed system’s properties both theoretically and numerically based on the above four perspectives. Further, we confirm that the random bits numerically generated pass the standard statistical tests for random bits.</jats:p>",

Generally, numerous studies were conducted on reinforcement materials for outer surfaces, reinforcement design, and utilizing fibers produced from various materials. In this study, a hollow-core slab was manufactured with concrete, which had a regular strength, and a design that discharged the explosive energy upon contact explosion via the hollow cores of the slabs and prevented the redirection of the explosive energy to the area below the slabs was investigated. Because the hollow-core slab in the study did not have any lateral reinforcement, the utilization of the tensile strength of the concrete proved advantageous. For this purpose, in the experimental tests of the study, contact explosions were conducted on hollow-core slabs with hollow diameters of 14 cm for each core. Before the explosion tests, the TNT equivalent of 910gr explosive was determined by performing the TNT equivalent tests. In the explosion tests of prepared hollow core concrete slabs, 125 gr, 250 gr, 375 gr, and 500 gr dynamites were used as the explosive materials. In conclusion, the explosive loads that the slabs could withstand were calculated and various slabs with distinctive hollow-core diameters were determined depending on the amount of the explosives.</jats:p>"

In this study, we applied a machine learning model for tropical cyclone detection, which was trained using both simulation and satellite observation data. Consequently, the classification performance was significantly lower than that obtained with the application of simulation data. Owing to the large gap between the simulation and observation data, the classification model could not be practically trained only on the simulation data. Thus, the representation capability of the simulation data must be analyzed and integrated into the observation data for application in real problems.</jats:p>"

The formation of a healthy lifestyle, the preservation of ecosystems, and the development of mankind are based on knowledge of biology. The purpose of the article is to develop and use a model of a methodology for organizing project-based education in biology in non-core institutions of secondary vocational education. The interrelation of theoretical knowledge and practical skills is a prerequisite for increasing the level of training of future specialists in any industry. In connection with the introduction of new FSES SPE into the work of educational institutions, secondary schools are required to improve the organization of the educational process and teaching materials. The involvement of students in the implementation of various projects leads to the development and development of project competence, and its level is determined by the number and quality of developed projects. The author concludes that the formation of competencies among students at secondary schools through project activities takes place.</jats:p>"

In this study, a facile approach for fabricating silver@mesoporousanataseTiO2 (Ag@mTiO2) core-shell nanoparticles employing sol-gel and hydrothermal reaction is demonstrated. The Ag@mTiO2nanoparticles display excellent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensitivity and they can detect the methylene blue (MB) molecules with the concentration of as low as 10−8 M. They also exhibit outstanding photocatalytic activity compared with mTiO2, due to the efficient separation and recombination restrain of electron–hole pairs under ultraviolet light. The Ag@mTiO2nanoparticles also present good stability and they can achieve recyclable photocatalytic degradation experiments for five times without loss of activity. Subsequently, the nanoparticles with dual functions were successfully used to in situ monitor the photodegradation process of MB aqueous solution. These results, demonstrating the multifunctional Ag@mTiO2 nanoparticles, hold promising applications for simultaneous SERS analysis and the removal of dye pollutants in environmental field.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Solar-driven water splitting is a promising route toward clean H2 energy and the photoelectrochemical approach attracts a strong interest. The oxygen evolution reaction is widely accepted as the performance limiting stage in this technology, which emphasizes the need of innovative anode materials. Metal oxide semiconductors are relevant in this respect owing to their cost-effectiveness and broad availability. The combination of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition was implemented in this study for the synthesis of randomly oriented CNT-ZnO core-shell nanostructures forming an adhering porous coating. Relative to a directly coated ZnO on Si, the porous structure enables a high interface area with the electrolyte and a resulting 458% increase of the photocurrent density under simulated solar light irradiation. The photoelectrochemical characterization correlates this performance to the effective electrons withdrawing along the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the resulting decrease of the onset potential. In terms of durability, the CNT-ZnO core–shell structure features an enhanced photo-corrosion stability for 8 h under illumination and with a voltage bias.</jats:p>"

A thermoset sandwich for high mechanical properties and thermal insulation is presented in this paper. It has an innovative 3D continuous reinforced core, which allows the optimisation of the substance exploitation by wide-ranging possibilities of fibre orientation. This was demonstrated with three sandwich variants. The reference had no core reinforcement and the other two were reinforced with different spacer fabrics. The process chain for the manufacturing consists of Structural Reaction Injection Moulding (SRIM) and Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding (VARTM). Significant increases in absolute as well as specific characteristic values were demonstrated by the reinforcement in a compression and bending test. It was also shown that quasi-static characteristic values under fatigue loading are maintained to a greater extent with the core reinforcement. The sandwich material was applied as a floor assembly for a snow groomer. The design was tailor-made for the mechanical, thermal and acoustic requirements. This proved the transferability of the process chain for manufacturing samples to the production of large-volume components with complex geometry.</jats:p>"

Roosevelt Island is an independent ice rise located at the northeastern margin of the Ross Ice Shelf. In this study, we use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to investigate the relationship between RICE ice-core oxygen-18 isotopes (δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O) and Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation during the extended austral winter (April–November). The RICE δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O record is correlated with Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Pacific–South American pattern 1 (PSA1), which both project onto the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Sea (ABS) geopotential height field. Pacific sector Southern Ocean, eastern Ross Sea, and West Antarctic’s atmospheric circulation, sea ice, and surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies, as well as RICE δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O, are strongest when El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and SAM are “in-phase”. That is when the SAM−/PSA1+ (El Niño) and SAM+/PSA1− (La Niña) phasing prevails. When in-phase, the δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O correlation with the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) is strong in regions (e.g., the Amundsen Sea) where their anomalies associated with SAM and PSA1 show the same sign.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A viscoelastic model is proposed in this approach to determine the sound transmission loss coefficient of a sandwich shell system with double curvature. The structure is composed of a double-walled composite shell subjected to a viscoelastic core. Investigating the efficient impresses of rotary inertia and shear deformation, vibration equations of both outer and inner shells are extracted within the framework of shear deformation shallow shell theory. Besides, the Zener mathematical model is used for viscoelastic material, which is based on a spring connected in series with a parallel mixture of spring and dashpot. This model presents the dynamic response in the whole frequency domain at which shear modulus and bulk complex modulus are frequency dependent. Since the performed studies on the sound transmission loss of this kind of structures are insignificant, the outcomes of plate models with a viscoelastic core are used to provide a reliable sound transmission loss comparison. The results show that the applied strategy can improve the acoustic characteristics of the system at high frequencies compared to that of a single-layer one with the same mass. This issue is more highlighted while the thickness of the viscoelastic layer enhances, which confirms the positive performance of the viscoelastic materials in this range of frequency, particularly in the resonant frequency. In addition to the curvature effect on acoustic features, the vibration response of the system is configured based on various frequencies and materials. </jats:p>",

The <jats:italic>K</jats:italic> = 0 transitions present a slightly different kinematic signature than the remaining lines, indicating that they might be tracing a different gas component.

A major reduction in core density reduced the structural integrity of the metal sandwich panel and promoted a significant effect of failure such as early delamination. Therefore, an effective optimisation analysis with highly precise determination is required to reduce the overall cost. The output from the finite element analysis was segregated into the nine main criteria that contributed to the sandwich panel performance. The analytical hierarchical process was used to develop a pairwise comparison matrix table and determine the weightages for each criterion. Further analysis using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was conducted to find the optimal solution for the core design. The results showed that a hemispherical dimple core design with a diameter of 6.0 mm and a depth of 3.0 mm achieved the highest-ranked closeness coefficient (CCi = 0.930 and 0.996) at both 70 and 50% of cyclic loading conditions. It was concluded that using small dimensions in the hemispherical core design configuration tends to produce better bonding strength performance in the sandwich panel, rather than configurations of larger dimensions. Hence, this method proved to be effective in determining the optimum selection, although the criteria and alternatives are intertwined, which complicates the process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The injection of sulfur into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions is the dominant driver of natural climate variability on interannual-to-multidecadal timescales. Based on a set of continuous sulfate and sulfur records from a suite of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, the HolVol v.1.0 database includes estimates of the magnitudes and approximate source latitudes of major volcanic stratospheric sulfur injection (VSSI) events for the Holocene (from 9500 BCE or 11500 year BP to 1900 CE), constituting an extension of the previous record by 7000 years. The database incorporates new-generation ice-core aerosol records with sub-annual temporal resolution and demonstrated sub-decadal dating accuracy and precision. By tightly aligning and stacking the ice-core records on the WD2014 chronology from Antarctica we resolve long-standing previous inconsistencies in the dating of ancient volcanic eruptions that arise from biased (i.e. dated too old) ice-core chronologies over the Holocene for Greenland. We reconstruct a total of 850 volcanic eruptions with injections in excess of 1 TgS, of which 329 (39 %) are located in the low latitudes with bipolar sulfate deposition, 426 (50 %) are located in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics and 88 (10 %) are located in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics. The spatial distribution of reconstructed eruption locations is in agreement with prior reconstructions for the past 2,500 years, and follows the global distribution of landmasses. In total, these eruptions injected 7410 TgS in the stratosphere, for which tropical eruptions accounted for 70 % and NH extratropics for 25 %. A long-term latitudinally and monthly resolved stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) time series is reconstructed from the HolVol VSSI estimates, representing the first Holocene-scale reconstruction constrained by Greenland and Antarctica ice cores. These new long-term reconstructions of past VSSI and SAOD variability confirm evidence from regional volcanic eruption chronologies (e.g., from Iceland) in showing that the early Holocene (9500–7000 BCE) experienced a higher number of volcanic eruptions (+16 %) and cumulative VSSI (+86 %) compared to the past 2,500 years. This increase coincides with the rapid retreat of ice sheets during deglaciation, providing context for potential future increases of volcanic activity in regions under projected glacier melting in the 21st century. The reconstructed VSSI and SAOD data are available at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.928646 (Sigl et al., 2021).\n                        </jats:p>"

With the advancement of technology and the demands of talent development, the vocal music teaching methodology for the vocal music performance major in colleges and universities must be continuously enhanced. Otherwise, there will be an issue of disconnect between teaching style and talent development, which will harm both the development of high‐quality vocal music talents and the innovation and growth of vocal music performance majors in colleges and universities. The vocal music performance major at colleges and universities should actively support the reform and innovation of the vocal music teaching mode in order to extend students’ knowledge, develop their all‐around ability, and provide a strong foundation for vocal music performance, to develop students’ all‐encompassing musical abilities. This research suggests a design strategy for the monitoring and model optimization of the teaching environment for vocal performance majors from the standpoint of core literacy. To increase the efficiency and objectivity of course instruction, cluster analysis aids students in categorising and searching for vocal music performance main repertoire as well as using collaborative filtering recommendations to locate their own vocal music performance. The simulation test analysis is completed lastly. The method has a certain accuracy, which is 7.59% higher than the conventional algorithm, according to the simulation findings. In addition to significantly increasing student interest in studying vocal music performance courses, we further reform and innovation of the teaching method for these courses at colleges and universities can also strengthen students’ understanding of various repertoire styles and significantly enhance their musical literacy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magnetically hard–soft core-shell ferrite nanoparticles are synthesized using an organometallic decomposition method through seed-mediated growth. Two sets of core-shell nanoparticles (S1 and S2) with different shell (Fe3O4) thicknesses and similar core (CoFe2O4) sizes are obtained by varying the initial quantities of seed nanoparticles of size 6.0 ± 1.0 nm. The nanoparticles synthesized have average sizes of 9.5 ± 1.1 (S1) and 12.2 ± 1.7 (S2) nm with corresponding shell thicknesses of 3.5 and 6.1 nm. Magnetic properties are investigated under field-cooled and zero-field-cooled conditions at several temperatures and field cooling values. Magnetic heating efficiency for magnetic hyperthermia applications is investigated by measuring the specific absorption rate (SAR) in alternating magnetic fields at several field strengths and frequencies. The exchange bias is found to have a nonmonotonic and oscillatory relationship with temperature at all fields. SAR values of both core-shell samples are found to be considerably larger than that of the single-phase bare core particles. The effective anisotropy and SAR values are found to be larger in S2 than those in S1. However, the saturation magnetization displays the opposite behavior. These results are attributed to the occurrence of spin-glass regions at the core-shell interface of different amounts in the two samples. The novel outcome is that the interfacial exchange anisotropy of core-shell nanoparticles can be tailored to produce large effective magnetic anisotropy and thus large SAR values.</jats:p>"

These are used as an absorber in the zinc oxide (ZnO)/cadmium sulfide (CdS) core-shell nanowire arrays, in order to improve the performance of solar cells. The relationship between the average increase in absorption rates and CdS shell thickness (compared to the thin film) reveals that the optimum thickness with the maximum average absorption rate (39.95%) compared to thin film is 30 nm. The cells’ electrical and optical performance was significantly improved with the introduction of graphene between the ZnO and CdS layers. The shell thicknesses for a better performance of these nanowire solar cells were 30 and 40 nm, with almost the same open-circuit voltage, the similar short-circuit current density, and efficiency, which were 630 mV, 6.39 mA/cm2, and 16.8%, respectively. Furthermore, a minimum reflection of 40% was obtained with these same shell thicknesses.</jats:p>",

The power handling capability of the Nested HC-ARF is also demonstrated in this work. Pulses of 75 W, 160 ps from the thulium-doped fiber laser are delivered using a 6-m-long fabricated Nested HC-ARF. The tested fiber is coiled into a 20 cm bending radius and achieves a coupling efficiency of 86.7%. The maximum average power of 60.5 W is transmitted through our Nested HC-ARF in a robust single-mode fashion without introducing any damage to the input and output fiber end-faces, which demonstrates the superior ability of such a fiber for high-power laser delivery.</jats:p>",

The outstanding photoelectrochemical properties of the photocathodes of CuO@CuFe2O4 were studied with the use of combinatory photo-electrochemical instrumental techniques which proved that the electrodes were stable over the whole water photolysis run under relatively positive potentials. Their outstanding performance was explained by the coupling of two charge transfer mechanisms occurring in core–shell architectures.</jats:p>"

Here we present the phase diagram of the Fe-FeSi system, reconstructed from in situ X-ray diffraction measurements at pressure and temperature conditions spanning over those expected for Mercury’s core, and ex situ chemical analysis of recovered samples. Under high pressure, we do not observe a miscibility gap between the cubic fcc and B2 structures, but rather the formation of a re-entrant bcc phase at temperatures close to melting. Upon melting, the investigated alloys are observed to evolve towards two distinct Fe-rich and Fe-poor liquid compositions at pressures below 35-38 GPa. The evolution of the phase diagram with pressure and temperature prescribes a range of possible core crystallization regimes, with strong dependence on the Si abundance of the core.</jats:p>"

They could play a key role in achieving the 17 SDGs due to some critical reasons: their deep roots in humanity, their wide spread across city life and environment, hence their horizontal connections with all the other SSC categories. There are many options of SSC structures, which have the potential to be dedicated on culture and heritage. QR codes, GIS., VR, apps, IoT, virtual events are some of them, widely implemented by cities. Via these ways, culture and heritage could 1) contribute to the humans' welfare index and 2) interact with the other sectors of the city ecosystem.

These activities arise from collective neural behaviors and are not totally understood yet. This paper aims to investigate a cortical model from this perspective. Historically, epilepsy has been regarded as a functional brain disorder associated with excessive synchronization of large neural populations. Epilepsy is believed to arise as a result of complex interactions between neural networks characterized by dynamic synchronization. In this paper, we investigated a network of neural populations in a way the dynamics of each node corresponded to the Jansen–Rit neural mass model. First, we study a one-column Jansen–Rit neural mass model for four different input levels. Then, we considered a Watts–Strogatz network of Jansen–Rit oscillators. We observed an epileptic activity in the weak input level. The network is considered to change various parameters. The detailed results including the mean time series, phase spaces, and power spectrum revealed a wide range of different behaviors such as epilepsy, healthy, and a transition between synchrony and asynchrony states. In some points of coupling coefficients, there is an abrupt change in the order parameters. Since the critical state is a dynamic candidate for healthy brains, we considered some measures of criticality and investigated them at these points. According to our study, some markers of criticality can occur at these points, while others may not. This occurrence is a result of the nature of the specific order parameter selected to observe these markers. In fact, The definition of a proper order parameter is key and must be defined properly. Our view is that the critical points exhibit clear characteristics and invariance of scale, instead of some types of markers. As a result, these phase transition points are not critical as they show no evidence of scaling invariance.</jats:p>"

The pandemic provides a context to study psychological injury as it relates to unmet basic human needs and traumatic stressors, including moral incongruence. We surveyed 1,122 health-care workers from across the United States between May 2020 and August 2020. Using a mixed-methods design, we examined moral injury and unmet basic human needs in relation to traumatic stress and suicidality. Nearly one third of respondents reported elevated symptoms of psychological trauma, and the prevalence of suicidal ideation among health-care workers in our sample was roughly 3 times higher than in the general population. Moral injury and loneliness predict greater symptoms of traumatic stress and suicidality. We conclude that dehumanization is a driving force behind the psychological injury resulting from moral incongruence in the context of the pandemic. The pandemic most frequently threatened basic human motivations at the foundational level of safety and security relative to other higher order needs. </jats:p>",

Multi-core few-mode fibers provide an effective way to break through the bottleneck of existing transmission capacity. In this paper, a 5-LP-mode weakly-coupled low-crosstalk 7-core fiber is designed by using a combination of trench assistance and air hole isolation structure. The fiber with a standard outer diameter achieves low crosstalk between cores and modes. The inter-core crosstalk area and the effective mode area of the core are calculated by the finite element method. After design optimization, there are 5 stable transmission LP modes in the C+L band of optical communication in this fiber. The effective refractive index difference between LP&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; mode and LP&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt; mode is the smallest and is greater than 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt;. The LP&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; mode in the optical fiber has the largest inter-core crosstalk and the loss is lower than –50 dB/km. The fiber can achieve low crosstalk transmission between modes and cores at the same time. The mode areas of the 5 LP modes in the 7 cores are larger than 86 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the relative core multiplexing factor is 57.63 at a wavelength of 1550 nm. Therefore, this fiber can be used in a large-capacity high-speed fiber transmission system.</jats:p>"

It is established that the semantic core is a set of words and phrases that reflect the theme and structure of the site. All key business-related queries are distributed across different clusters. The distribution takes into account the type of phrase, morphology, location and seasonality of business activities. The collection of the semantic core consists of the study of business topics; creating a structure for the semantic core; collection of initial keys for parsing with the widest possible value; keyword parsing; cleaning the core from debris; clustering. Clustering in SEO is the clustering of key queries with a common theme. With the help of clustering, the semantic core is finally cleaned and divided into convenient groups. There are two main methods for clustering keywords, namely, manual grouping of synonyms and keys with morphological coincidence and automatic clustering by search results. The advantages and disadvantages of the main clustering methods are considered. Advantages of clustering of the semantic core by the method of search delivery: grouping without deep knowledge in the topic; grouping speed; clustering avoids errors in the distribution of queries; are taken into account and fall into the desired cluster of reformulations and synonyms. Disadvantages of clustering by the method of search delivery: clustering will work in the current competition; not all keys fall into the target clusters, because there is a possibility of synonyms in different groups, if competitors decide to promote them on different pages. Advantages of manual clustering: almost perfect clustering result; there are no clusters with a similar theme. Disadvantages of manual clustering: high man / hours; deep knowledge of the topic and specifics of business is required. It is proved that automatic clustering is much more effective in promotion. It is noted that in cases of clustering of semantics in low-competitive niches there is a lack of the desired result, because the data are taken from the search results. Also, automatic clustering works poorly when collecting semantics for Ukrainian-speaking local businesses.</jats:p>"

Thus, it is necessary to explore the relevance between teachers’ identification with the core competency of 12-year basic education curriculum guidelines and its pedagogical transformation. Considering the professional knowledge and practical skills of vocational teachers, it is hard to combine them with the core competency into courses for pedagogical transformation. Thus, we analyze the impact of teaching seniority on core competency and its pedagogical transformation by collecting survey data from teachers in vocational schools in Taiwan. Teaching seniority shows a significant difference from the core competency, further affecting pedagogical transformation. Therefore, we propose specific suggestions as follows. First, teachers need to be encouraged to attend workshops to strengthen core competency. Second, course discussion among teachers is required to combine core competencies into courses. Third, the increase of identification to a core competency for senior teachers is demanded to perform pedagogical transformation with teachers’ rich experiences.</jats:p>"

Filling the core flow\n   area of the gas channel in a thermoelectric generator with metal foam can\n   greatly improve the heat transfer capacity of the gas channel with a small\n   pressure loss, thereby improving the power generation efficiency. The\n   results show that, first, the heat transfer enhancement achieved by\n   partially filling the core area of the gas channel with metal foam can\n   significantly improve the performance of thermoelectric generators, the\n   maximum output power is about 1.5 times higher than that of the unfilled\n   channel. Second, for a thermoelectric generator with different modules, the\n   friction coefficient for different filling ratios increases by about 16\n   times at most, while the Nu value increases by only three times at most, and\n   according to the PEC of the gas channel, metal foam with high filling rate\n   and low pore density is more suitable for the thermoelectric generator.\n   Third, it is more appropriate to use the thermoelectric module with a high\n   figure of merit as the selection criterion for deciding whether to adopt the\n   technique of enhancing heat exchange through the gas channel. The maximum\n   output power and efficiency of the thermoelectric generator using the high\n   figure of merit module are 300% and 160% higher than those of the\n   thermoelectric generator using the low figure of merit module, respectively.</jats:p>"

As a structure capable of suppressing impurity scattering, p-Si/i (intrinsic)-Ge core–shell NWs with radial heterojunctions inside the NWs were formed. When forming NWs using a top-down method, the positions of the NWs can be controlled, but their surface is damaged. When heat treatment for repairing surface damage is performed, the surface roughness of the NWs closely depends on the kind of atmospheric gas. Oxidation and chemical etching prior to shell formation removes the surface damaged layer on p-SiNWs and simultaneously achieves a reduction in the diameter of the NWs. Finally, hole gas accumulation, which is important for suppressing impurity scattering, can be observed in the i-Ge layers of p-Si/i-Ge core–shell NWs.</jats:p>",

In order to clarify the need for and orientation of basic literacy in college music appreciation teaching, as well as to understand the special value of the subject, we conducted research on the relationship between basic literacy and college music appreciation teaching. Based on this, a new detection algorithm that fuses feature fusion and AM (attention mechanism) is proposed, and visual AM is added to the algorithm based on AM features to help the agent learn the best course of action quickly. The findings indicate that this method’s cumulative normalized discount gain increases by about 0.07 and that the recommended list’s overall quality has significantly improved.

In this paper, we examine arboricity from a game-theoretic perspective and investigate cost-sharing in the minimum forest cover problem. We introduce the arboricity game as a cooperative cost game defined on a graph. The players are edges, and the cost of each coalition is the arboricity of the subgraph induced by the coalition. We study properties of the core and propose an efficient algorithm for computing the nucleolus when the core is not empty. In order to compute the nucleolus in the core, we introduce the prime partition which is built on the densest subgraph lattice. The prime partition decomposes the edge set of a graph into a partially ordered set defined from minimal densest minors and their invariant precedence relation. Moreover, edges from the same partition always have the same value in a core allocation. Consequently, when the core is not empty, the prime partition significantly reduces the number of variables and constraints required in the linear programs of Maschler’s scheme and allows us to compute the nucleolus in polynomial time. Besides, the prime partition provides a graph decomposition analogous to the celebrated core decomposition and the density-friendly decomposition, which may be of independent interest.</jats:p>",

The article analyzes the current development of the insurance market of Ukraine, which is characterized by an unstable economic core of functioning, identifies the main problems and analyzes in proportion to the large-scale Russian invasion of real insurance. Today, the insurance market is saving an invariably low share of premiums from insurance companies in the structure of the added value of the entire financial sector. An assessment of the financial status of the taken insurance company has been made, it has been highlighted that it is effective to live from the effective victory of the money, the obligation to pay the selected insurance premiums for the income increase of the population. It was concluded that the functioning of institutions in rather difficult conditions for the country's economy negatively affects the real financial condition of each insurer. Since the beginning of the war, insurers have faced significant problems in their activities, which are a threat to financial security: the inability to work in regions of active hostilities, a decrease in the solvency of customers, a noticeable narrowing of the life insurance segment, an increase in the rate of increase in the amount of insurance capital, insurance reserves, and a decrease in their financial stability. A stable financial condition is the basis of an appropriate level of financial security of insurance companies, which enables effective protection of economic entities from all risks and threats, including, in particular, during the period of martial law. More financially stable and initiatives to introduce new insurance products of the company will successfully ensure insurance activity, but will contribute to ensuring the fulfillment of its obligations to consumers of insurance services.</jats:p>"

Based on a hypothesis that digital maturity is a trigger for territorial development, this study assesses the digital maturity of core enterprises, i.e. their readiness to implement new technologies in all business processes for improving productivity and competitiveness. Digital maturity levels were determined according to the identification of strategic areas of activity, including unique technological competencies and personnel work. The proposed strategy for developing a new digital maturity model of enterprises takes into account the structure and content of existing models, since there are currently no best practices that can be scaled. In order to analyse digital maturity levels in detail, a survey of the expert community, as well interviews with digital transformation specialists were conducted. As a result, we constructed a digital maturity model of core enterprises that includes five levels, characterising organisational, production, human resources and external (impact on territorial development) processes. The parameter of the job creation multiplier was tested in the developed model. As a result, the conducted research confirmed the hypothesis that digital development of enterprises directly affects the territorial development. This, on the one hand, opens new opportunities for the socio-economic development of territories, and, on the other hand, places new demands on the digital infrastructure, quality of provided services, personnel competence, etc. The research results are of interest to state and local authorities, industry core enterprises, and the scientific community, as the obtained findings determine the prospects for studying digital maturity in relation to territorial and industrial development.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to evaluate in an exploratory way the shear transferring mechanism between the steel beam with circular web opening and the precast hollow-concrete slab. The shear connection is formed by in-situ concrete passes through the web openings and infill the voids of the precast slabs. One push-out test was conducted to investigate the shear transferring mechanism of shear connection and the experimental results were compared to analytical methods. The shear resistance of the shear connection was predicted with good accurate by analytical methods.</jats:p>"

Herein, an in situ integration engineering strategy of oxygen‐vacancy and core–shell heterojunction to fabricate an anemone‐like CoP@CoOOH core–shell heterojunction with rich oxygen‐vacancies supported on carbon paper (CoP@CoOOH/CP), is described. Benefiting from the synergy of CoP core and oxygen‐vacancy‐rich CoOOH shell, the as‐obtained CoP@CoOOH/CP catalyst displays low overpotentials at 10 mA cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup> for HER (89.6 mV/81.7 mV) and OER (318 mV/200 mV) in neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Notably, a two‐electrode electrolyzer, using CoP@CoOOH/CP as bifunctional catalyst to achieve 10 mA cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup>, only needs low‐cell voltages in neutral (1.65 V) and alkaline (1.52 V) electrolyte. Besides, systematically experimental and theoretical results reveal that the core–shell heterojunction efficiently accelerates the catalytic kinetics and strengthens the structural stability, while rich oxygen‐vacancies efficiently decrease the kinetic barrier and activation energy, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate‐determining‐step for OER intermediates, thus intrinsically boosting OER performance. This work clearly demonstrates that oxygen‐vacancy and core–shell heterojunction engineering provide an effective strategy to design highly‐efficient non‐precious, bi‐functional electrocatalysts for pH‐universal water splitting.</jats:p>",

Although various numerical simulations have confirmed that the collapsed structure can be described by a cored Navarro–Frenk–White-like density profile, there is still disagreement about the relation between the core mass and the halo mass. To fully understand this relation, we have assembled a large sample of cored haloes based on both idealized soliton mergers and cosmological simulations with various box sizes. We find that there exists a sizeable dispersion in the core–halo mass relation that increases with halo mass, indicating that the FDM model allows cores and haloes to coexist in diverse configurations. We provide a new empirical equation for a core–halo mass relation with uncertainties that can encompass all previously found relations in the dispersion, and emphasize that any observational constraints on the particle mass m using a tight one-to-one core–halo mass relation should suffer from an additional uncertainty of the order of 50  per cent for halo masses ${\\gtrsim} 10^9 \\, [8\\times 10^{-23} \\, \\mathrm{eV}/(mc^2)]^{3/2} \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the framework of disciplinary knowledge integrating technology, the multimedia teaching application of music performance attracts a major opportunity for reflection and reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to explore the laws and experiences of music performance teachers’ multimedia teaching applications under the framework of subject teaching knowledge integrating technology. Through the research to understand the classroom multimedia teaching application of music performance teachers, according to the research results, relevant strategies are put forward for the application of music performance teachers’ classroom multimedia teaching, in order to effectively improve the classroom teaching effect of music performance teachers. This research mainly uses the classroom observation method and data statistical analysis method and takes 100 music video lessons of the National Educational Resources Public Service Platform as the survey object. A total of 100 teachers were observed and scored in the classroom through the compiled multimedia teaching observation table for music performance teachers, and then the data was analyzed to draw conclusions. The conclusions of this study are as follows: The multimedia application behaviors of the teachers of the excellent courses are different from those of the teachers of the daily classes. The two types of teachers have differences in the effectiveness of multimedia teaching application of music performance, and the scores of the practical application of information technology are uneven. The overall score of multimedia teaching applications of excellent course teachers is higher than that of daily course teachers, and the classroom teaching effect is better. In this regard, based on the observation and assessment of the effectiveness of multimedia teaching applications by two types of teachers, this paper puts forward some suggestions for music performance teachers to improve the effectiveness of multimedia teaching applications in classrooms from the aspect of teachers themselves and educational functions. It is hoped that it can provide some theoretical basis and practical materials for the personal and professional development of music performance teachers.</jats:p>",

However, all practitioners should be vigilant about suicide risk and potentially help to reduce vulnerabilities to future suicide risk as part of their routine work. Many of the risk factors and processes hypothesised to play a role in the development of suicidal thinking and behaviours are likely to be evident within the usual content of standard evidence-based protocols for depression or anxiety disorders. In this paper we are suggesting that even within the current primary care remit, (i) an increased awareness of suicide risk vulnerability factors and (ii) using knowledge of a psychological model of suicidal behaviour to inform clinical care are likely to be extremely helpful in structuring clinical formulation and informing interventions.</jats:p>\n\t  <jats:sec id=\"S1754470X22000344_s1\" sec-type=\"other\">\n\t    <jats:title>Key learning aims</jats:title>\n\t    <jats:p>\n\t      <jats:list list-type=\"number\">\n\t\t<jats:list-item>\n\t\t  <jats:label>(1)</jats:label>\n\t\t  <jats:p>To understand the IMV model and the factors associated with suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviour.</jats:p>\n\t\t</jats:list-item>\n\t\t<jats:list-item>\n\t\t  <jats:label>(2)</jats:label>\n\t\t  <jats:p>To understand how core CBT skills and interventions can address these factors.</jats:p>\n\t\t</jats:list-item>\n\t\t<jats:list-item>\n\t\t  <jats:label>(3)</jats:label>\n\t\t  <jats:p>To support CBT practitioners in using their current CBT knowledge and skills in the service of reducing the risk of suicidal behaviour.</jats:p>\n\t\t</jats:list-item>\n\t      </jats:list>\n\t    </jats:p>\n\t  </jats:sec>"

The obtained results showed a regular red shift behavior versus gamma irradiation dose, in photoluminescence peak and absorption edge of the CdTe/ZnSe QDs. Structural properties of CdTe/ZnSe QDs before and after gamma irradiation were characterized by means of X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) analyses. The obtained results showed that the crystalline structure of CdTe/ZnSe core/shell QDs did not change after gamma irradiation. Concentration and shell thickness as two important factors on the sensitivity of CdTe/ZnSe QDs in front of gamma irradiation have been investigated.

Antarctica’s Southern Ocean supports a unique biota and represents the only global marine region without any known biological invasions. However, climate change is removing physiological barriers to potential invasive nonnative species and increasing ship activities are raising propagule pressure. The successful conservation of iconic Antarctic species and environments relies on addressing both climate change and direct, localized human impact.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most fuel cycle simulation tools are based either on fixed recipes or assembly calculations for reactor modeling. Due to the high number of calculations and extensive computational power requirements, full-core computations are often seen as not viable for this purpose. However, this leads to additional hypotheses and modeling biases, thus limiting the realism of the resulting fuel cycle. For several applications, the current modeling method is sufficient, but precise calculations of discharged fuel composition may require further refinements. CLASS (<jats:bold>C</jats:bold>ore <jats:bold>L</jats:bold>ibrary for <jats:bold>A</jats:bold>dvanced <jats:bold>S</jats:bold>imulation <jats:bold>S</jats:bold>cenarios) is a dynamic fuel cycle simulation code developed since 2012 with reactor models based on neural networks to produce nuclear data and physical quantities. Past work has shown a first coupling between CLASS and DONJON5 to quantify neural networks approach biases. This work assesses the applicability of 3D full-core diffusion calculations using the DONJON5 code coupled with nuclear scenario simulations involving a realistic PWR core at equilibrium cycle conditions. DONJON5 interpolates burnup dependent diffusion coefficients and cross sections generated beforehand by DRAGON5, a deterministic lattice calculation tool. Whereas previous studies considered only homogeneous reactors (i.e. homogeneous assembly in terms of composition and enrichment as well as homogeneous core), the present contribution focuses on the integration of full-core calculations in CLASS for fuel cycles involving a MOX/UO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> PWR core (i.e. 1/3 MOx–2/3 UOx). The DONJON5 model considered in this work describes a core with critical boron concentration at each time step partially loaded with MOx heterogeneous assemblies composed of three enrichments. In fuel cycle calculations, the main issue is to adapt, in the fabrication stage, the fresh fuel composition for the reactor with regards to the isotopic composition of the available stocks. This work presents a fuel loading model based on power peaking factors minimization that respects irradiation cycle length, <jats:sup>235</jats:sup>U enrichment as well as Pu concentration and fissile quality, hence, ensuring a more uniform power distribution in the core.</jats:p>"

In the first step, soft magnetic and hard magnetic Fe3O4 and SrFe12O19 powders were synthesized using carbon reduction and co-precipitation routes, respectively. In the second step, silica coating was performed by controlling the hydrolysis and con- densation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) precursor on the magnetic cores. In the third step, a layer of TiO2 or ZnO photocatalytic shells was made on the as-prepared composites using titanium n-butoxide (TNBT) or zinc nitrate hexahydrate, respectively. The formation of the core/shell/shell structures was confirmed by FESEM and TEM analyses. The saturation magnetizations of the Fe3O4/SiO2/TiO2, SrFe12O19/SiO2/TiO2 and Fe3O4/SiO2/ZnO photocatalytic materials were 41.5, 33 and 49 emu/g, respectively. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation percentages of methylene blue (MB) under UV illumination, which were 88%, 83% and 62%, for the Fe3O4/SiO2/TiO2, SrFe12O19//TiO2 and Fe3O4/SiO2/ZnO composites, respectively. The first-, and second-order reaction kinetics were used to find out the suitable MB removal kinetics.</jats:p>"

It provides comparative evidence that professional learning opportunities were strongly related to instructional practices, whereas curriculum and instructional resources had more modest and mixed relationships. In particular, collaboration with colleagues around instruction had consistently positive relationships with instructional practices in math and science, and these relationships were as strong among teachers who perceived many barriers to standards implementation as those who did not. We discuss implications for education leaders as they make decisions about how to best support teachers in standards-aligned math and science instruction. </jats:p>",

The sensitivities of the fabricated heterostructures were ~ 5–8 times higher than those of bare Cu or Ag thin films. We also found that the width of the plasmon resonance reflectivity curves can be reduced by adding dielectric/graphene layers. An unexpected blueshift of the plasmon resonance spectral position was observed after covering noble metals with high-index dielectric/graphene heterostructures. We suggest that the observed blueshift and a large enhancement of surface plasmon resonance sensitivity in metal-dielectric-graphene hybrid heterostructures are produced by stationary surface dipoles which generate a strong electric field concentrated at the very thin top dielectric/graphene layer.</jats:p>",

It explains that the core of brand strategy is to win consumer psychology and the significance of brand strategy to consumer habits. The methods adopted in this research are mainly literature research and case analysis. Analysis Every consumer is only willing to choose and accept some brands when buying products. Enterprises can only grasp the target customers’psychological gap through the brand information output by the brand strategy, or tap into the target customers’psychological resources more effectively than competitors, thus occupying the important position of the target customers’ psychological resources. This subtle psychological change is that there is only consumer perception and no objective facts. According to the results of the analysis, the brand strategy is mainly based on the attributes of the product and the consumer's psychology has an impact on consumer spending habits. Brand strategy is to use the brand as a logo to distinguish other competing brands, form a cognitive image, be recognized by consumers, and reflect a durable and credible value commitment related to the products and services behind the brand. It can be said that brand strategy has created a certain product attribute in consumer perception. And win the consumer's psychology through the key factors that affect the consumer's consumer psychology, so as to promote the consumer's consumption behavior, so that the consumer forms a certain consumption habits, so the brand strategy has an important effect on consumers' consumption habits. This article combines psychology and management related knowledge, analysis Faced with a large number of products, consumers cannot accept all products, so the brand is of great significance to consumers' consumption habits. This article analyzes how brand strategy wins consumers' consumer psychology, and the key factors to win consumer psychology, for companies to implement more accurate, consumer psychology and consumer habits in the context of the era of huge competition today.

The detailed temperature distribution can be achieved, the maximum error coefficient of temperature rise is only 6% compared with the test results of prototype, and the accuracy of finite element calculate method is verified. Taking the equal height and heat flux design parameters of reactor as research object, the natural-convection cooling performance of reactor with and without the rain cover is investigated. It can be found that the temperature rise of reactor is significantly increased when adding the rain cover, and the reasons are given by analyzing the fluid velocity distribution of air ducts between the encapsulation coils. In order to reduce the temperature rise of the reactor with the rain cover, the optimization method based on the orthogonal experiment design and finite element method is proposed. The six factors of the double rain cover are given, which mainly affect the temperature rise of reactor, and the five levels are selected, the influence curve and contribution rate of each factor on the temperature rise of reactor are analyzed. The results show that the contribution ratio of the parameter H1, L1, and L2, are obviously higher than the parameter H2, L3, and ?, so the more attention should be paid in the design of double rain cover. Meanwhile, the optimal structural parameters of rain cover are given based on the influence curves, and the temperature rise is only 43.25?. The results show that the optimization method can reduce the temperature rise of reactor significantly. In addition, the temperature distribution of inner encapsulations coils of reactor are basically the same, the current carrying capacity of coils can be fully utilized, which provides an important guidance for the optimization design of reactor.</jats:p>"

Until now, the core function genes of tellurite resistance and their characteristics are still obscure. Pseudomonas citronellolis SJTE-3 was found able to resist high concentrations of tellurite (250 μg/mL) and formed vacuole-like tellurium nanostructures. The terZABCDE gene cluster located in the large plasmid pRBL16 endowed strain SJTE-3 with the tellurite resistance of high levels. Although the terC and terD genes were identified as the core function genes for tellurite reduction and resistance, the inhibition of cell growth was observed when they were used solely. Interestingly, co-expression of the terA gene or terZ gene could relieve the burden caused by the expression of the terCD genes and recover normal cell growth. TerC and TerD proteins commonly shared the conserved sequences and are widely distributed in many pathogenic bacteria, highly associated with the pathogenicity factors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, the idea of recognizing resentment as a characteristic feature of the Russian people has been strongly implanted in a collective consciousness, producing a negative impact on the formation of the image of Russia, the people, and undermining the country's authority, both in the world community and in the eyes of its own citizens. In this regard, the paper looked to determine the validity of such a statement. To meet this objective the author involved an extensive material on Russian culture and specifics of the Russian people`s character in a cultural and historical context: from Ancient Russia to the modern stage of civilizational development. The character of the Russian people and its cultural code have been formed over the centuries, enriched by their own and world experience under the influence of various factors. It was determined that, as in any other country, ressentiment emerged at crucial moments in the state`s history: during wars, revolutions, crises accompanied by the transformation of the value system, the crisis of culture. Russian culture is characterized by tolerance, kindness, forgiveness, generosity, mercy, compassion, which gives grounds to the following idea: envy, hatred, meanness, and revenge, which contribute to the formation of ressentiment, are not characteristic for a Russian person, therefore, ressentiment is not a characteristic feature of the Russian people. The paper articulates the idea that any position that asserts ressentiment as a characteristic feature of a nation or ethnic group, is a delusion. Resentment is formed in the presence of unfavorable socio-economic and cultural conditions in individual individuals, groups, marginal communities outside of belonging to a particular nation or ethnic group. Still the modern society gives shelter to the factors that contribute to the formation of ressentiment and its dissemination through information and communication technologies. The paper comes up with methods of preventing ressentiment.</jats:p>"

It adopts a guiding procedure integrating the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines into the bibliometric standard workflow and using VOSviewer as the visualization tool. With the help of the built-in WoS analysis tools, the annual publication trends and the most influential productive countries are examined. VOSviewer is used to explore the influential sources in the field, research themes, cited references and their intersections with other references, cited sources and their links to other sources, and most frequently cited authors. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords distinguishes eight research themes, namely, linguistic analysis, ideology and manipulation, power embodied in political communication, interpreting and critical discourse analysis (CDA), the recontextualization of political discourse in media discourse, diplomatic translation, the representation of political speeches in news translation, and conflict and politics. The co-citation analysis of the cited references focuses on discourse analysis models, research approaches, and theoretical frameworks. The co-citation of sources suggests that interdisciplinary features characterize political discourse translation studies, interacting with other disciplines through fields such as pragmatics, discourse analysis, and communication research. </jats:p>",

To make TFCF-based RI sensors, the whitelight was launched into any one of the cores to define the excitation orientation and is called a vertex-core excitation scheme. When the four-core fiber (FCF) was gradually tapered, the four cores gathered closer and closer. Originally, the power coupling occurred between its two neighboring cores first and these three cores are grouped to produce supermodes. Subsequently, the fourth diagonal core enters the evanescent field overlapping region to excite asymmetric supermodes interferences. The output spectral responses of the two cores next to the excitation core are mutually in phase whereas the spectral responses of the diagonal core are in phase and out of phase to that of the excitation core at the shorter and longer wavelengths, respectively. Due to the lowest limitation of the available refractive index of liquids, the best sensitivity can be achieved when the tapered diameter is 10 μm and the best RI sensitivity S is 3249 nm/RIU over the indices ranging from 1.41–1.42. This is several times higher than that at other RI ranges due to the asymmetric supermodes.</jats:p>"

Here, Au@RhCu nanodendrites with core‐shell nanostructure were facile generated via seed‐mediated method. Through composition optimization, the Au@Rh<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Cu nanodendrites show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 83 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, together with a small Tafel slope of 33.4 mV dec<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Meanwhile, the Au@Rh<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Cu nanocrystals are also a good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with an overpotential of 415 mV (at 10 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) and a Tafel slope of 127 mV dec<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Additionally, the Au@Rh<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Cu exhibits excellent stability for both HER and OER. Such attractive catalytic performance can be assigned to the large surface area produced by the unique core‐shell dendritic nanostructure, the synergistic effect between different metal elements and the positive influence of Au seeds. This work would offer a reliable pathway for the design of multimetallic core‐shell dendritic nanostructures as promising electrocatalysts toward water splitting.</jats:p>",

Complex partners facilitate knowledge creation and innovation in complex problem‐solving. Relying on R&amp;D cooperation with forerunners, latecomers can acquire new knowledge factors and new ideas and use them to create new knowledge. This study demonstrated the knowledge innovation mechanism based on linkages between periphery knowledge and core knowledge with knowledge map theory and set methodology. A case of R&amp;D cooperation between latecomers and forerunners was introduced to verify this mechanism. The results show that latecomers could share forerunners’ periphery knowledge in R&amp;D cooperation through formal and informal interaction and acquire the core knowledge factors in periphery knowledge based on the linkages between them. With these core knowledge factors, latecomers integrate them into their internal knowledge system and create new knowledge. By analyzing the linkages between periphery and core knowledge factors, this study creatively demonstrates the knowledge innovation mechanism in knowledge linkage perspective. It deepens the understanding of R&amp;D cooperation between latecomers and forerunners and expands the focus of knowledge innovation theory. This study provides a new insight into latecomers effectively activating internal and external knowledge resources through R&amp;D cooperation.</jats:p>",

However, subducted slabs may be important for the characteristics of the ULVZs as well. Here we use ScS precursor (SdS) and postcursor (ScscS) phases, as well as Scd phases recorded by USArray to investigate the lowermost mantle structure across the north Atlantic, which spans the African LLSVP and the subducted Farallon slab. Our results show a ULVZ located near the edge of the African LLSVP, with thicknesses ranging from 11–16 km and S wave velocity reductions of 12%–24%. At the same time, a thin high‐velocity layer (HVL) with thicknesses of 20–30 km, Vs increases of 3%–4%, is also detected outside the LLSVP in the northwest region. Further west there is a clear D\" layer at 250 km above the core mantle boundary (CMB), overlaid by a low velocity layer with Vs reduction of 3%. This transition profile from D\" to HVL to ULVZ provides an excellent opportunity for us to understand the heterogeneities near the CMB region. We propose that interactions between the subducted Farallon slab with ambient mantle and LLSVP material, together with thermal effects, may result in this transition between different seismic structures along the CMB.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carrageenan is a gelling agent that can be extracted using coconut water solvent. The ability of carrageenan to form a gel can be applied in various products, such as jelly candy. Beetroot is one of the raw materials that can be used in making jelly candy. Beetroot is known to contain various vitamins and minerals as well as betalain pigments which are very beneficial for the body. The weakness of beetroot is its distinctive aroma and taste that is considered unpleasant. Therefore, the pineapple core was added to reduce it. This research aims to determine the interaction between the ratios of beetroot juice and pineapple core juice with carrageenan concentrations on the quality of jelly candy. This research consisted of two main stages consisted of carrageenan extraction, and followed by application into jelly candy made from the beetroot-pineapple core. This study used a factorial Randomized Block Design (RBD) with first factor (S) the ratio of beetroot juice and pineapple core juice (100%: 0%, 75%: 25%, 50%: 50 %) and second factor (K) concentration of carrageenan (3%, 3.5%, 4%). Parameters observed for the first stage included yield, water content, viscosity, gel strength. Meanwhile, the second stage included water content, ash content, reducing sugar, antioxidant activity, texture, color, and organoleptic (color, aroma, taste, texture). The results showed that there were interactions between treatments on water content, ash content, texture, organoleptic of color, aroma, taste, and texture of jelly candy. The ratio of 50% beetroot juice : 50%  pineapple core and 4% carrageenan concentration was known as the best treatment with a water content of 14.79%, ash content 0.72%, reducing sugar 1.81%, antioxidant activity 71.23%, texture 59,6N, brightness (L) 34.53, redness (a+) 0.3, yellowness (b+) 0.83, color 4.2 (attractive), aroma 4 (pleasant) , taste 4.16 (good), texture 3.96 (slightly chewy). </jats:p>"

Most previous works use the accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) to test heat generation of batteries. However, utilizing ARC can only obtain heat generation of the battery operating under the adiabatic condition, deviating from common operation scenarios with heat dissipation. Besides, using ARC is difficult to measure heat generation of the high-rate operating battery because the battery temperature easily exceeds the maximum safety limit. To address these problems, we propose a novel method to obtain heat generation of cylindrical battery based on core and surface temperature measurements and select the 21700 cylindrical battery as the research object. Based on the method, total heat generation at 1 C discharge rate under the natural convection air cooling condition in the environmental chamber is about 3.2 kJ, and the average heat generation rate is about 0.9 W, while these two results measured by ARC are about 2.2 kJ and 0.6 W. This gap also reflects that different battery temperature histories have significant impacts on heat generation. In addition, using our approach, total heat generation at 2 C discharge rate measured in the environmental chamber is about 5.0 kJ, with the average heat generation rate being about 2.8 W. Heat generation results obtained by our method are approximate to the actual battery operation and have advantages in future applications.</jats:p>",

Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study using data from 665 patients who underwent CT-guided CNB of pulmonary nodules in our hospital between May 2019 and May 2021, including 39 ground-glass nodules (GGNs) and 626 solid nodules. We used a 1:4 PSM analysis to compared the diagnostic yields and complications rates of CT-guided CNB between 2 groups. Results: After PSM, 170 cases involved in the comparison (34 GGNs vs 136 solid nodules) were randomly matched (1:4) by patient demographics, clinical history, lesion characteristics, and procedure-related factors. There was no statistically significant difference in the diagnostic yields and complications rates between 2 groups. Significant pneumothorax incidence increase was noted at small lesion size, deep lesion location, and traversing interlobar fissure ( P &lt; .05). Post-biopsy hemorrhage was a protective factor for pneumothorax ( P &lt; .05). The size/proportion of consolidation of GGN did not influence the diagnostic accuracy and complication incidence ( P &gt; .05). Conclusions: The accuracy and safety of CT-guided CNB were comparable for ground-glass and solid nodules and the size/proportion of consolidation of GGN may be not a relevant risk factor. The biopsy should avoid traversing interlobar fissure as far as possible. Smaller lesion size and deeper lesion location may lead to higher pneumothorax rate and post-biopsy hemorrhage may be a protective factor for pneumothorax. </jats:p>",

In this study, we have probed the immune and molecular profiles of COVID-19 patients at 48-h intervals after hospitalization to identify early markers, if any, of disease progression and severity. Our study reveals that the molecular profiles of patients likely to enter the host-immune response-mediated moderate or severe disease progression are distinct even in the early phase of infection when severe symptoms are not yet apparent. Our data from 37 patients suggest that at hospitalization, interleukins (IL6) (&amp;gt;300 pg/ml) and IL8 levels (&amp;gt;200 pg/ml) identify cytokine-dependent disease progression. Monitoring their levels will facilitate timely intervention using available immunomodulators or precision medicines in those likely to progress due to cytokine storm and help improve outcomes. Additionally, it will also help identify cytokine-independent progressive patients, not likely to benefit from immunomodulators or precision drugs.</jats:p>",

CORE-CARE is equipped with radiant panels in each surface, which can be controlled separately. The room presents two real windows on the East side, equipped with shading systems. Furthermore, the mechanic controlled ventilation system installed in the room can act as integration of sensible or latent heat both in heating and in cooling conditions. The climatic chamber is provided with a data acquisition system, consisting of 38 sensors, that allow the evaluation of the surface temperatures in different positions, the air temperature at different heights, the mean radiant temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration. The CORE-CARE chamber is thermally characterized using a detailed model developed at the Industrial Engineering Department of the University of Padova and the simulations results are compared with test measurements. Moreover, the impact of radiant asymmetry is investigated.</jats:p>"

CoPt nanoparticles were prepared at room temperature by ultrahigh vacuum atom beam deposition using two different routes: simultaneous deposition of the two metals (CoPt) or sequential deposition. In this last case, Co deposition on a Pt-core (Pt@Co) and the reverse configuration (Co@Pt) are explored. In the Pt@Co case, our experimental analysis of 2.5 nm particles shows the stability of a Pt rich-core (80% Pt) surrounded by a two-monolayers-thick Co shell. In the reverse case, the core-shell structure is also stabilized, while the codeposited sample leads to an alloyed structure. These results suggest that the growth kinetics can trap the thermodynamically non-favorable core-shell structure even for this system which has a high alloying tendency. Besides the lack of atom mobility at room temperature, this stabilization can also be associated with core strain effects. Post thermal treatment of core-shell samples induces a structural transition from the core-shell configuration to the equilibrium alloyed configuration. This study demonstrates that the element-selective scattering technique, AGISAXS is highly efficient for the extraction of chemical segregation information from multi-component supported nanoparticles, such as core-shell structures, up to ultimate small sizes.</jats:p>"

To address this gap in data quality, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a core set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating SRMNCAH services and outcomes in humanitarian settings, and assessed their feasibility in the field in Jordan, in addition to three other countries; with the goal of aggregating information from global consultations and field-level assessments to reach consensus on a set of core SRMNCAH indicators for services and outcome evaluation in humanitarian settings among WHO global partners. <jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: The feasibility assessment in Jordan focused on the following constructs: relevance/usefulness, feasibility of measurement, systems and resources, and ethical issues. The multi-methods assessment included five components; a desk review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, facility assessments, and observational sessions. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: Findings suggest that there is widespread support among regional, national, as well as global stakeholders for developing a core list of SRMNCAH indicators for monitoring and evaluation of services and outcomes in humanitarian settings in Jordan. There are numerous resources and data collection systems that could be leveraged, built upon, and improved to ensure the feasibility of collecting this proposed set of indicators. However, the data collection load requested from donors, the national government, international and UN agencies, coordination/cluster systems must be better harmonized, standardized, and less burdensome. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Despite stakeholder support in developing a core set of indicators, this would only be useful if it has the buy-in from the international community. Greater harmonization and coordination, alongside increased resource allocation, would improve data collection efforts and allow stakeholders to meet indicators’ reporting requirements.</jats:p>"

Among the various established synchronizers of the circadian clock in cell culture (temperature, serum shock, glucocorticoids), the artificial glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (DEX) is the most widely used. DEX treatment as a protocol to reset the circadian clock in culture gives simple readout with minimal laboratory requirements. Even though there are many studies regarding clock resetting in culture using DEX, reference points or expression patterns of core clock genes and their protein products are scarce and sometimes contradict other works with similar methodology. We synchronise a cell line of human origin with DEX to be used for studies on circadian rhythms.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We treat HEK 293T cells with DEX and describe the patterns of mRNA and proteins of core clock regulators, while making a clear point on how <jats:italic>CLOCK</jats:italic> is less than an ideal molecule to help monitor rhythms in this cell line.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

The authors adopted a qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews driven by the saturation point. The use of computer-aided qualitative data software (Atlas. ti) through visualization networks indicated evidence of inadequate preparedness to tackle the spread of COVID-19. They found 13 thematic challenges associated with the Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) protocols and the need for training. The findings also unfolded a visualization network featuring 11 pre-requisite skills that emphasized hygienic protocols.

In order to test the generality of CHX resistance in taxa originally identified as members of <jats:italic>Stichococcus</jats:italic> (the detailed taxonomic relationships within this group of algae have been updated since our study took place), six strains were studied: two strains isolated from recent substrate collections from Signy Island (maritime Antarctica) (“Antarctica” 1 and “Antarctica” 2), one isolated from this island about 50 years ago (“Antarctica” 3) and single Arctic (“Arctic”), temperate (“Temperate”) and tropical (“Tropical”) strains. The sensitivity of each strain towards CHX was compared by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and growth rate and lag time when exposed to different CHX concentrations. All strains except “Temperate” were highly resistant to CHX (MIC &gt; 1000 µg/mL), while “Temperate” was resistant to 62.5 µg/mL (a concentration still considerably greater than any previously reported for algae). All highly resistant strains showed no significant differences in growth rate between control and treatment (1000 µg/mL CHX) conditions. Morphological examination suggested that four strains were consistent with the description of the species <jats:italic>Stichococcus bacillaris</jats:italic> while the remaining two conformed to <jats:italic>S. mirabilis</jats:italic>. However, based on sequence analyses and the recently available phylogeny, only one strain, “Temperate”, was confirmed to be <jats:italic>S. bacillaris</jats:italic>, while “Tropical” represents the newly erected genus <jats:italic>Tetratostichococcus</jats:italic>, “Antarctica 1” <jats:italic>Tritostichococcus</jats:italic>, and “Antarctica 2”, “Antarctica 3” and “Arctic” <jats:italic>Deuterostichococcus</jats:italic>.

The scale of CSE is an integral indicator that reflects of a personal resources of proactive behavior, as well as a generalized dispositional predictor of job satisfaction and positive self-assessment of the results of activity. The validation and psychometric testing were conducted in several stages, the total number of respondents N=917, who work in Moscow, St Petersburg, Belgorod, and other Russian cities, between the ages of 18 and 60, of which 62% are female and 38% are male. The design of the study included methods: an adapted Russian version of the Core Self-Evaluation scale by Judge et al., 5PFQ as adapted by A.B.Hromov, Generalized self-efficacy scale, Schwarzer, Jerusalem as adapted by V.G.Romek, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Locus of control as adapted by Kseno- fontova, Gallup’s Q12 Employee Engagement Survey. A two-factor structure of the CSEs (Ru) was identified which includes positive and negative core self-evaluation scales. The CSEs (Ru) demonstrated a satisfactory reliability. The validation testing demonstrated significant correlations with self-esteem, level of subjective control, self-efficacy, neuroticism, и engagement. The CSEs (Ru) includes 10 items and has a sufficient preliminary reliability and validity, making it a useful tool when measuring the core self-evaluation of organizations’ staff. Diversities of the negative core self-evaluation level’s strength within respondents of different age and sex were identified. Сore self-evaluation level is important in staffing work teams of different professional specialization as a predictor of proactive behavior and team resilience. Further research could be focused on the proof of the measurement’s reliability and validity when measuring of proactive behavior in teams.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we extend one of the approaches and combine it with a priori error bounds for Laplacian eigenvalues to obtain a unified method that has wide application. We describe how to evaluate some constants required to verify the positivity of desired solutions. We apply our method to several problems, including those to which the previous method is not applicable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We proposed a novel sensor based on an ultracompact leaky-guided liquid core fiber Mach–Zehnder interferometer (LLCFMZI) for high modulation of an interference spectrum. The sensor structure is based on a micro-sized hollow-core fiber (HCF) splicing a tilt end face single-mode fiber (SMF) to create a miniature oblique gap for the effective access of different liquids. The liquid core with a relatively lower refractive index (RI) than the cladding can achieve a leaky-mode optical waveguide (LMOW) mechanism, and its volume is only approximately 7.85 pL. In addition, the utilized micro-length HCF can reduce the energy loss of core in the LMOW to obtain an acceptable extinction ratio (&gt;30 dB) with high temperature (T) sensitivity in the interference spectra. Experimental results show that the interference spectra can be highly modulated within the wide measurement range of 1250–1650 nm with a steadily linear response for thermal effect. The measured temperature sensitivities (T-sensitivities) of various liquids of DI water, ethanol, and Cargille-liquid (nD = 1.305) are 0.8869, 4.4754, and 4.8229 nm/°C, and the corresponding measured thermal optics coefficient (TOC) are −4.16 × 10−5, −2.11 × 10−4, and −3.6 × 10−4 °C−1, respectively. Measurement results demonstrate that the used liquids with a higher TOC can obtain better T-sensitivity modulation. The highest experimental sensitivity of the liquid-core filled with Cargille-liquid (nD = 1.40) is up to +13.87 nm/°C with a corresponding TOC of −4.07 × 10−4 °C−1. Furthermore, the experimental and theoretical values are in good agreement according to FSR the measuring scheme that investigates the effectiveness of the proposed LLCFMZI.</jats:p>"

Currently, the computer aided design models have been used for projection simulation. Compared with the stereolithographic model, the Unigraphics NX (UG) model can describe complex objects with multiple materials. However, calculating the intersection of a ray with a UG model can only be performed by an internal function, which greatly decreases the efficiency of the projection simulation. Therefore, we propose a fast method for projection simulation based on multi‐core. In this method, we use the internal function to calculate the intersection points and the corresponding face normal vectors for a ray. By computing the dot product between the direction vector of the ray and the face normal vectors, we can determine the entry and exit point pairs, and further obtain the simulation projection. On this basis, the projection simulation tasks are evenly decomposed to multiple processes. Then, we invoke these processes by multi‐thread in a main process, and realize parallel implementation of the projection simulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the method, and we can obtain nearly linear speedup of the multi‐core acceleration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Saturated soft loess has a large pore structure, high compressibility, low strength, fluid plastic state, and poor engineering properties. It is still one of the key problems that engineering needs to solve. In order to study the influence of deep foundation pit excavation in the saturated soft loess area on the deformation of foundation pits, the deformation laws of ground settlement, enclosure structure, and supporting axial force were clarified based on the field tests on the deformation characteristics of deep foundation pits in areas with the high‐water level in saturated soft loess, combined with geological conditions and on‐site construction procedures. The results indicate the following: water supply and construction process were found to be the main factor in changing the surface settlement curve of deep foundation pits in saturated soft loess; increasing the construction speed of the pit bottom floor, inverted braces, floor frame beams, and sidewall frame beams to close the structure, which is conducive to restraining the deformation of the continuous underground wall and foundation pits in similar areas. In the initial stage of support layout, the axial force of steel support tends to increase too fast or even exceed the standard control value. Therefore, a reasonable preadding axial force is an effective means to control the deformation of the continuous underground wall and the axial force of the steel support. The current research results may provide a reference for constructing deep foundation pits in similar areas.</jats:p>",

Its striking feature – the nine‐fold symmetrical structure, was discovered over 70 years ago by transmission electron microscopy, and since elaborated mostly by cryo‐electron microscopy and super‐resolution microscopy. Here, we review the discoveries that led to the current understanding of how the nine‐fold symmetrical structure is built. We focus on the recent findings of the centriole structure in high resolution, its assembly pathways, and its nine‐fold distributed components. We propose a model that the assembly of the nine‐fold symmetrical centriole depends on the concerted efforts of its core proteins.

Thus, antibacterial and anti-inflammation nanomaterials are always attracting for infected wound healing. In this work, ultra-uniform (∼20 nm) and colloidally stable Ag nanoparticles (Ag-Hes NPs) with core-shell structure were prepared by using hesperidin as reducing and capping agent. The obtained Ag-Hes NPs present effective antibacterial properties on both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Ag-Hes NPs also got high 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging capability of 69%. Under the package of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate, Ag-Hes NPs were encapsulated into electro spun nanofibers to form hydrogel (Ag-Hes@H). This strategy provides a moisture environment which could enrich and release Ag-Hes NPs gradually. Cell experiments and animal wound healing investigation proved that Ag-Hes@H could promote the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and accelerate infected wound healing. Meanwhile, Ag-Hes@H significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, MMP9 and TNF-α. Immunohistochemistry data further suggested that Ag-Hes@H accelerated wound closure by promoting collagen deposition and skin cell proliferation. The designed antibacterial and anti-inflammatory Ag-Hes@H has great potential for promoting infected wound healing.</jats:p>",

One is the Regional Model version 2015 (REMO2015) and the other is the fourth version of the Regional Climate Model (RegCM4-v7). RCMs are nested in three Earth system models (ESMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and in the reanalysis ERA-Interim, at ∼25-km spacing grid resolution. This study highlights misrepresented underlying physical processes associated with these rainfall biases through a process-based evaluation. Both RCMs produce a weaker Congo basin cell, associated with a weaker land–ocean zonal surface pressure gradient. Consequently, less water vapor enters the region, and little is transported from WCEA to ECEA, resulting in higher moisture availability in the west than in the east. This leads to an unevenly distributed moisture across the region, favoring a stronger atmospheric instability in WCEA where the moist static energy (MSE) anomalously increases through an enhanced latent static energy (LSE). Moisture arrives at a slower pace in ECEA, associated with the weak cell’s strength. The intensity of ascent motions in response to the orographic constraint is weak to destabilize atmospheric stability in the lower layers, necessary for initiating deep convection. Therefore, the convection is shallow in ECEA related to underestimating the MSE due to the reduced LSE.</jats:p>",

However, in recent years, potential side effects associated with long-term PPI use have been reported. Many patients take PPI for a long period of time, even though it is unnecessary, and it is necessary to discontinue PPI administration in such patients. However, sudden discontinuation may cause symptoms to recur and discontinuation may be unsuccessful. A strategy for safe and secure PPI discontinuation has not yet been established. The purpose of this study is to determine whether PPI can be safely discontinued by tapering the PPI dose or by abrupt discontinuation of PPI, and to establish a strategy for safe and secure PPI discontinuation.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The evaluation will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with five assessment points at the start of the study and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the start of the study. One intervention group is the group in which PPI administration is abruptly discontinued (Group A), and the second group is the group in which the PPI dose is gradually tapered and then PPI administration is discontinued (Group B). The primary outcome and secondary outcome are the proportion of patients who successfully discontinued the PPI at 6 months and at 12 months after the start of the study in groups A and B, respectively.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We predict that the proportion of patients who successfully discontinue PPI will be higher in the group in which PPI administration was gradually tapered than in the group in which PPI administration was abruptly discontinued.

Circadian processes control sleep, but little is known about how sleep affects the circadian system. Therefore, we performed a 28-day sleep restriction (SR) treatment in mice. Sleep restriction disrupted the clock genes’ circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythms of the Cry1 and Per1/2/3 genes disappeared. The acrophase of the clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Rev-erbα, and Rorβ) that still had a circadian rhythm was advanced, while the acrophase of negative clock gene Cry2 was delayed. Clock genes’ upstream signals ERK and EIFs also had circadian rhythm disorders. Accompanied by changes in the central oscillator, the plasma output signal (melatonin, corticosterone, IL-6, and TNF-α) had an advanced acrophase. While the melatonin mesor was decreased, the corticosterone, IL-6, and TNF-α mesor was increased. Our results indicated that chronic sleep loss could disrupt the circadian rhythm of the central clock through ERK and EIFs and affect the output signal downstream of the core biological clock.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background and Objective: Computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy is a commonly used method for clarifying the nature of nodules, masses or lung consolidation. However, the diagnostic yield of nodules needs to be improved when compared with masses during percutaneous lung biopsy. In recent years, 3D-printed coplanar templates have been gradually utilized in radioactive seed implantation for lung cancer treatment. However, there is little research on the application of 3D-printed coplanar templates in pulmonary nodules biopsy. Therefore, we conducted a single center and retrospective study to explore the application value of 3D-printed coplanar puncture template-assisted computed tomography-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of small pulmonary nodules. Methods: 210 patients hospitalized in Taihe Hospital with pulmonary nodules underwent percutaneous core needle biopsy for histopathology diagnosis and were included in the study. 106 patients underwent conventional percutaneous lung biopsy (control group) and 104 patients underwent 3D-PCT-assisted percutaneous lung biopsy (3D-PCT group). The diagnostic yield and incidence of complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: The overall diagnostic yield significantly improved in 3D-PCT group (95.2%) compared with Control group (87.7%) ( P &lt; .05); the diagnostic yield for lung nodules smaller than 2 cm in the 3D-PCT group and the control group was 94.4% and 80.5%, respectively, ( P &lt; .05). Incidence of pneumothorax (17.3% vs 18.9%) and pulmonary hemorrhage (7.7% vs 9.4%) were not significantly difference between the two groups ( P &gt; .05). Conclusions: Studies indicated that application of 3-Dimensionally printed coplanar template improves diagnostic yield of CT-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy for pulmonary nodules, especially for pulmonary nodule smaller than 2 cm. </jats:p>",

Methods: Exploratory-descriptive research with a quantitative approach using the Delphi technique. Initially, a matrix composed of six domains outlining 112 core competencies of the clinical nurse specialist in oncology was elaborated. The Likert scale was used to measure the degree of agreement. Data collection took place through the Google Forms® platform from February to May 2021. Data were compiled and analyzed based on expert suggestions and literature. Results: 100 competencies achieved consensus (agreement level above 85.7%) in the first round; 13 new competencies were proposed by expert members; and 125 were validated during the Delphi technique. Conclusion: The mapping and validation of core competencies will allow the development of new training models aimed at advanced practice in oncology and future educational harmonization.</jats:p>"

Electrospun meshes composed by core–shell fibers (random or aligned; PDMS core; piezoelectric PVDFhfp shell) were fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. Elastic modulus and residual strain were assessed. Human ASCs were seeded on such scaffolds either under static conditions for 1 week or with subsequent 10% dynamic stretching for 10,800 cycles (1 Hz, 3 h), assessing load elongation curves in a Bose® bioreactor system. Gene expression for tenogenic expression, extracellular matrix, remodeling, pro-fibrotic and inflammatory marker genes were assessed (PCR). For cell-seeded meshes, the E modulus increased from 14 ± 3.8 MPa to 31 ± 17 MPa within 3 h, which was not observed for cell-free meshes. Random fibers resulted in higher tenogenic commitment than aligned fibers. Dynamic cultivation significantly enhanced pro-inflammatory markers. Compared to ASCs in culture flasks, ASCs on random meshes under static cultivation showed a significant upregulation of Mohawk, Tenascin-C and Tenomodulin. The tenogenic commitment expressed by human ASCs in contact with random PVDFhfp/PDMS paves the way for using this novel highly elastic material as an implant to be wrapped around a lacerated tendon, envisioned as a functional anti-adhesion membrane.</jats:p>"

The large volume of inorganic phase adding raises questions about calcium carbonate as filler in the loading and embossing capacity, quality, and efficient bonding potentiality for relevant products. The process parameters have been recorded around this article on emboss temperature, calcium carbonate concentration, web thickness to carry out the hypothesis achievable in the spunbond system. Filler adding polypropylene has lower heat capacity, which transfers heat efficiently to achieve optimum bonding effect. Modulated differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC) characterizes heat capacity. Morphology of fabric has validated the circumjacent structure changes around the oval pattern.

This theme was developed in different ways in 20th century British literature. An interpretation of the background, setting and story in William Golding's Lord of the Flies can be very useful for the understanding of the darkness of one's soul and the way in which people can dread human nature. The digital tool EVOLI offers a chance for teachers and students alike to teach and learn about Lord of the Flies by transgressing the borders of language and turning affected spirituality into a reason for analysing the depths of cultural codifications. The elements connected to the novel are taken into account using various views on methodological hermeneutics so that meanings may be made transparent and the message of the author can be rendered without any bias. The importance of this approach is shown by students’ feedback to this kind of a perspective on a theme of evilness, terror and death. The presence of a Beast in the midst of the action and of an overall Beelzebub influencing all characters helps one create a scale of human corruption which determines a gradation of the connotations of what haunting is.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the wide use of computers, machine translation has been gradually applied in many fields from natural language processing, such as industry, education, and so on. Due to the increasing demand for multilanguage translation, it is an urgent problem to effectively improve the quality of text translation. Driven by the upsurge of artificial intelligence, neural network technology is increasingly integrated into the field of machine translation, which gradually expands the traditional machine translation method into neural machine translation method. With the continuous improvement of deep learning technology, machine translation has gradually integrated these methods and strategies and achieved good results in multiple tasks, but there are still some shortcomings. The most prominent problem is that, since word vector is the basis for the model to obtain semantic and grammatical information, the existing methods cannot obtain semantic and grammatical feature information, which greatly reduces the accuracy of English translation. Based on this, this paper proposed a method of splicing word vector with character- level and word-level encoding vector. The characterization of fusion of more word vector can effectively solve the word does not appear in the table, the word with some low frequency, can express meaning more complete information, performance directly affects the whole translation model, the results can be seen through the experiment, we put forward the characteristics of the fusion method and strategy, can effectively enhance the overall translation performance of the model.</jats:p>",

With the adoption of k‐core technology, the critical nodes can be identified to study the transformation efficiency of the innovation value in the network. Finally, according to the provincial innovation value transformation data of China from 1998 to 2016, an empirical study was carried out to calculate and analyze the transformation efficiency of innovation achievements in 30 provinces. The results indicate that (1) the transformation efficiency of innovation value can be expressed by the structure of the time series network constructed by the input‐output vectors; (2) the mapping relationship of the value transformation vectors could be reflected by the cosine similarity of the time series network, while the transformation efficiency of innovation value could be identified using the <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>‐core; and (3) the transformation efficiency of innovation value in three coastal provinces is relatively higher, while that of the rest of the provinces is roughly the same among the 30 provinces.</jats:p>",

Some existing analytical dependencies for the interpretation of laboratory studies of the OFP are briefly analyzed: the Corey model, the Sigmund and McCaffery model, the Chierici model, the LET-model. The advantage of the LET-model and the high evaluation of this model in independent studies of the authors are described. In the process of preliminary analysis, the authors of the article revealed that the non-trivial issue of determining the adjustable coefficients of the model using mathematical methods was not sufficiently covered, which became the central object of the work. Further, the application of the LET-model is formalized and the methodology for determining the adjustable coefficients of the model (L, E and T) is described. The task of selecting model parameters is interpreted as a multidimensional optimization problem. Also, a class of nonlinear least squares methods was defined to solve the problem. Several common numerical optimization methods for selecting the coefficients of the model are considered: the brute-force search method, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm method, the trust region method. Computational experiments were carried out to assess their applicability and comparative analysis of optimization algorithms. Based on the results of the experiments, it was concluded that the method of confidence domains is suitable for practical application, since they converge to the optimal solution quickly enough and demonstrates high accuracy in the selection of coefficients L, E, T. The final part of the article demonstrates the difference between the LET-model and the basic Corey model when approximating core relative phase permeabilities.</jats:p>"

After compression experimental tests on core cell geometries, fatigue tests under bending are also executed on reinforced GFRP plates in order to validate best compromise between ABS core design and GFRP laminated skin properties and stiffness requirement, highlighting influence of ABS wire performances as deposited in the form of beam-based lattice geometry.

To address this gap in quality data, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a core set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating SRMNCAH services and outcomes and assessed their feasibility in four countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with the goal of aggregating information from global consultations and field-level assessments to reach consensus on a set of core SRMNCAH indicators among WHO partners. <jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: The feasibility assessment in DRC focused on the following constructs: relevance/usefulness, feasibility of measurement, systems and resources, and ethical issues. The multi-methods assessment included five components; a desk review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, facility assessments, and observational sessions. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: The findings suggest that there is widespread support among stakeholders for developing a standardized core list of SRMNCAH indicators to be collected among all humanitarian actors in DRC. There are numerous resources and data collection systems that could be leveraged, built upon, and improved to ensure the feasibility of collecting this proposed set of indicators. However, the data collection load requested from donors, the national government, international and UN agencies, coordination/cluster systems must be better harmonized, standardized, and less burdensome. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Despite stakeholder support in developing a core set of indicators, this would only be useful if it has the buy-in from the international community. Greater harmonization and coordination, alongside increased resource allocation, would improve data collection efforts and allow stakeholders to meet indicators’ reporting requirements.</jats:p>"

Here, we characterize the continuous Majorana/Andreev crossover interpolating between fully-separated, partially-separated, and fully-overlapping Majorana modes, in terms of global and local topological invariants, fermion parity, quasiparticle densities, Majorana pseudospin and spin polarizations, density overlaps and transition probabilities between opposite Majorana components. We found that in inhomogeneous wires, the transition between fully-overlapping trivial ABS and nontrivial MBS does not necessarily mandate the closing of the bulk gap of quasiparticle excitations, but a simple parity crossing of partially-separated Majorana modes (ps-MM) from trivial to nontrivial regimes. We demonstrate that fully-separated and fully-overlapping Majorana modes correspond to the two limiting cases at the opposite sides of a continuous crossover: the only distinction between the two can be obtained by estimating the degree of separations of the Majorana components. This result does not contradict the bulk-edge correspondence: indeed, the field inhomogeneities driving the Majorana/Andreev crossover have a length scale comparable with the nanowire length, and therefore correspond to a nonlocal perturbation which breaks the topological protection of the MBS.</jats:p>",

Obtaining better embeddings enhances the quality of downstream analyses, such as DNA sequence motif detection and protein function prediction. In this study, we adopt a pre-training algorithm for the effective embedding of RNA bases to acquire semantically rich representations and apply this algorithm to two fundamental RNA sequence problems: structural alignment and clustering. By using the pre-training algorithm to embed the four bases of RNA in a position-dependent manner using a large number of RNA sequences from various RNA families, a context-sensitive embedding representation is obtained. As a result, not only base information but also secondary structure and context information of RNA sequences are embedded for each base. We call this ‘informative base embedding’ and use it to achieve accuracies superior to those of existing state-of-the-art methods on RNA structural alignment and RNA family clustering tasks. Furthermore, upon performing RNA sequence alignment by combining this informative base embedding with a simple Needleman–Wunsch alignment algorithm, we succeed in calculating structural alignments with a time complexity of O(n2) instead of the O(n6) time complexity of the naive implementation of Sankoff-style algorithm for input RNA sequence of length n.</jats:p>",

To analyze the effect of respiratory training combined with core muscle training on the overall motor function and activities of daily living of patients with early and midterm stroke, 90 cases with early and midterm stroke admitted to the neurological department of our hospital from April 2018 to April 2019 were chosen as the research objects. According to the odd or even hospitalization numbers, they were equally divided into the study group and the reference group. Both groups received basic drug treatment.

While all the NPs adopt a Fe-Au core-shell chemical order, they can be sorted into three different types. Isolated NPs, displaying either a highly symmetric centered core geometry (CC-type) or an asymmetrical off-centered core geometry (OC-type), are observed despite the rather large metallic volume. The majority of the NPs however displays a multicore geometry, with Fe cores in the 10-12 nm range, larger than the NPs observed in a pure Fe (3nm) film grown under identical conditions. The driving forces leading to the different morphologies are discussed together with the role played by the environnement.</jats:p>"

Due to the strongly-coupled and highly complex processes to produce battery electrode, it is imperative to develop an effective solution that can predict the properties of battery electrode and perform reliable sensitivity analysis on the key features and parameters during the production process. This paper proposes a novel tree boosting model-based framework to analyze and predict how the battery electrode properties vary with respect to parameters during the early production stage. Three data-based interpretable models including AdaBoost, LPBoost, and TotalBoost are presented and compared. Four key parameters including three slurry feature variables and one coating process parameter are analyzed to quantify their effects on both mass loading and porosity of battery electrode. The results demonstrate that the proposed tree model-based framework is capable of providing efficient quantitative analysis on the importance and correlation of the related parameters and producing satisfying early-stage prediction of battery electrode properties. These can benefit a deep understanding of battery electrodes and facilitate to optimizing battery electrode design for automotive applications.</jats:p>",

Herein, a nanofiber/hydrogel core–shell scaffold with three-dimensional (3D) multilayer patterned structure (3D-PT-P/GM) was introduced for promoting diabetic wound healing with improved angiogenesis. The results showed that the 3D-PT-P/GM scaffolds possessed multilayered structure with interlayer spacing of about 15–80 μm, and the hexagonal micropatterned structures were uniformly distributed on the surface of each layer. The nanofibers in the scaffold exhibited distinct core–shell structures with Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel as the shell and Poly (<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>, <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>-lactic acid) (PDLLA) as the core. The results showed that the porosity, water retention time and water vapor permeability of the 3D-PT-P/GM scaffolds increased to 1.6 times, 21 times, and 1.9 times than that of the two-dimensional (2D) PDLLA nanofibrous scaffolds, respectively. The in vitro studies showed that the 3D-PT-P/GM scaffolds could significantly promote cell adhesion, proliferation, infiltration and migration throughout the scaffolds, and the expression of cellular communication protein-related genes, as well as angiogenesis-related genes in the same group, was remarkably upregulated. The in vivo results further demonstrated that the 3D-PT-P/GM scaffolds could not only effectively absorb exudate and provide a moist environment for the wound sites, but also significantly promote the formation of a 3D network of capillaries. As a result, the healing of diabetic wounds was accelerated with enhanced angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, and collagen deposition. These results indicate that nanofiber/hydrogel core–shell scaffolds with 3D multilayer patterned structures could provide a new strategy for facilitating chronic wound healing.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

The results showed that the flame retardant distribution in PBT presented high external concentrations and low internal concentrations when the injection time was reduced. The lowest flame retardant content of 20 wt% was evident at an injection time of 2 s while displaying a high limiting oxygen index of 27.1. Although this resulted in a V‐0 flame‐retardant level, the mechanical properties were not affected. Therefore, the flame retardant was proportionately reduced by a shorter injection time to form a concentration gradient core‐shell‐like macrostructure, significantly increasing the flame‐resistant efficiency while retaining the mechanical properties.</jats:p>",

Herein, extrusion-based core–shell bioprinting is introduced as a potent tool allowing a spatially defined delivery of cell types and differentiation factors TGF-β3 and BMP-2 in separated compartments of hydrogel strands, and, therefore, a local supply of matching factors for chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Ink development was based on blends of alginate and methylcellulose, in combination with varying concentrations of the nanoclay Laponite whose high affinity binding capacity for various molecules was exploited. Release kinetics of model molecules was successfully tuned by Laponite addition. Core–shell bioprinting was proven to generate well-oriented compartments within one strand as monitored by optical coherence tomography in a non-invasive manner. Chondrocytes and osteoblasts were applied each in the shell while the respective differentiation factors (TGF-β3, BMP-2) were provided by a Laponite-supported core serving as central factor depot within the strand, allowing directed differentiation of cells in close contact to the core. Experiments with bi-zonal constructs, comprising an osteogenic and a chondrogenic zone, revealed that the local delivery of the factors from the core reduces effects of these factors on the cells in the other scaffold zone. These observations prove the general suitability of the suggested system for co-differentiation of different cell types within a zonal construct.</jats:p>",

Among patients with HF, the prevalence of attention impairment is reported to range from 15% to 27%. Although attention is fundamental to human activities including HF self‐care, cognitive interventions for patients with HF that target improvement in attention are scarce. The COgnitive intervention to Restore attention using nature Environment (CORE) study aims to test the preliminary efficacy of the newly developed Nature‐VR, a virtual reality‐based cognitive intervention that is based on the restorative effects of nature. Nature‐VR development was guided by Attention Restoration Theory. The target outcomes are attention, HF self‐care, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). Our exploratory aims examine the associations between attention and several putative/established HF biomarkers (eg, oxygen saturation, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, apolipoprotein E, dopamine receptor, and dopamine transporter genes) as well as the effect of Nature‐VR on cognitive performance in other domains (ie, global cognition, memory, visuospatial, executive function, and language), cardiac and neurological events, and mortality.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>This single‐blinded, two‐group randomized‐controlled pilot study will enroll 74 participants with HF.

The active comparison group, Urban‐VR, will view three‐dimensional urban pictures using a virtual reality headset to match the Nature‐VR intervention in intervention dose and delivery mode, but not in content.

Hence, many researchers have carried out numerous researches on flow instability characteristics, but few publications cover the effects of local throttling on two-phase flow instabilities in open-channel systems such as coolant rod bundle subchannel with spacer grids in the nuclear reactor core. This paper provides a numerical study on the effects of local throttling on two-phase flow instabilities in a simplified typical coolant open-channel system in a nuclear reactor core by using the NUSOL-SYS code. The effects of local throttling ratio, throttling position, and other throttling parameters on the stability of the boiling channel system were carried out. The results show that usually in uniformly distributed throttling conditions, the stability of the system and high throttling ratio are positively correlated. In fixed throttle ratio conditions, the stability of the system is positively correlated with the distance from the throttling region to the entrance and local void fraction. If throttling regions are uniformly arranged along the heating channel with a certain value, the number of throttle regions will enhance the instability of the system. Besides, this paper preliminarily proposed a criterion function f(n, RT, ?) to study the complicated throttling effects on flow instability which could provide technical reference for the safe design and operation of two-phase systems, especially, the reactor core.</jats:p>"

The ARF allows liquid analytes to flow through its hollow area for detection. To obtain ideal sensing performance, an epsilon negative (ENG) material is introduced into the selected anti-resonant tube. With the high absorption of the ENG material, only one fundamental mode is available for detection and is sensitive to the RI variation of analytes. Moreover, the effects of structural parameters on the sensing performances are discussed and analyzed to further understand the mechanism and optimization. The final result shows that the ARF sensor can exhibit a high sensitivity of −372.58 dB RIU<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at a fixed wavelength within a broad RI range from 1.33 to 1.45, which covers most liquid analytes.

Compared to 915 and 97x nm, the absorption cross-section at ~940 nm (~0.173 pm2) demonstrates a weaker temperature dependence. Hence, the 940 nm pump mechanism is favorable for achieving a high-power laser output at 1.5 μm. Additionally, the double-exponential fluorescence decay of Yb3+ ions and the emission intensity ratio of I1018nm/I1534nm were measured to evaluate the energy transfer efficiency from Yb3+ ions to Er3+ ions. Through the external heating and active quantum defect heating methods, the emission intensity ratios of I1018nm/I1534nm increase by 30.6% and 709.1%, respectively, from ~300 to ~480 K.

The scientific novelty lies in the development of theoretical foundations for studying the labor market with the help of artificial intelligence technologies and in the development of methods for determining the core competencies and the trajectory of training professional competencies of specialists. The research uses general scientific and economic methods of analysis, ISM, MICMAC, and DEMATEL analysis, as well as statistical methods of grouping, classifications and graphing. The author obtained the following research results: the ways to develop professional competencies of HR specialists by training technical skills (with the prevalence of “hard” competencies in training programs) and by training communicative and business qualities (with the prevalence of “soft” competencies) were established. The author concludes that the fundamental skills of HR specialists in organizations of Belarus are communication skills, business documentation, teamwork, mastering “1C: Enterprise 8. Salary and Personnel Management”, and the use of office programs (Microsoft office).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the recently discussed cases of 'OECD Education 2030' and the Minerva School, this study tried to examine the development of core competency-based curriculum standards for liberal arts subjects. University C was based on the concept of competency of the 'OECD Education 2030' project followed by the DeSeCo project to develop curriculum standards and the case of Minerva School. These mainly show how the content and competency of subjects are linked and that the competency encompasses knowledge, skills, values and attitudes, and that competency education is mediated through the educational content. Based on this point, University C developed the curriculum standards for liberal arts subjects to enhance core competencies and designed classes for compulsory liberal arts subjects according to these standards.\r\nIn this curriculum standard, learning outcomes are first derived based on the nature of the subject, and educational goals are developed that link these to core competencies and include rubrics for each learning outcome. Then, we are preparing a learning framework that meets these educational goals, standards for educational content centered on core concepts, and strategies for operating curriculum for each subject. This case study presents a method in which core competencies are closely related to the content of the subject, and shows a class framework in which knowledge, skills, values and attitudes are practically integrated away from fragmentary knowledge education, and applied in various situations. It is valuable in that it presents the core concept of the subject with high potential as the most important learning content.</jats:p>",

Up to 59.1 W output and 90% efficiency were obtained in the fundamental mode and linear polarization in the co-pumped case, while less power and efficiency were achieved in the counter-pumped setup for additional loss. The amplifier performs indistinguishably in terms of laser linewidth and relative intensity noise in the frequency range up to 10 MHz for both configurations. However, the spectral pedestal is raised in co-pumping, caused by cross-phase modulation between the pump and signal laser, which is observed and analyzed for the first time. Nevertheless, the spectral pedestal is 34.9 dB below the peak, which has a negligible effect for most applications.</jats:p>"

Black carbon (BC), commonly known as soot, is directly emitted to the atmosphere by wildfires and other processes and can be transported and deposited in remote regions including high‐altitude glaciers and the polar regions. Here, we present a continuous, high‐resolution record of BC and ammonium (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) from 1933 to 2001 extracted from two ice cores retrieved in 2002 from the col between Mt. Bona and Mt. Churchill in the Wrangell‐St. Elias Mountain Range, southeast Alaska. Despite the substantial increase of BC from fossil fuels in the Arctic since the Industrial Revolution, BC at Bona‐Churchill originates primarily from biomass burning and thus provides a record reflecting a fire history for Alaska. The BC record from Bona‐Churchill reveals that high fire activity became more frequent after 1984 in agreement with Alaska fire records. Most years associated with high BC or high NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> before 1984 occurred during El Niño events when precipitation in Alaska was below “normal,” suggesting that precipitation played an important role in modulating fire activity in Alaska prior to the 1980s. Conversely, years with high BC or NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> after 1984 coincided with years with “normal” and low precipitation, but elevated temperatures, strongly suggesting that temperature became a more dominant factor influencing fire activity in Alaska after the 1980s as suggested by other studies.

Quantitative evaluation of the roughness of CS microparticles is, however, a challenging task with approaches using electron microscopy images being scarce and showing pronounced differences in terms of methodology and results. This work presents a generalized method for the reliable roughness determination of nonplanar specimens such as CS particles from electron microscopic images, the method being robust and reproducible with a high accuracy. It involves a self‐written software package (Python) that analyzes the recorded images, extracts corresponding data, and calculates the roughness based on the deviation of the identified contour. Images of single particles are taken by a dual mode scanning electron microscopy (SEM) setup which permits imaging of the same field‐of‐view of the sample with high resolution and surface sensitive in SE InLens mode as well as in transmission mode (TSEM). Herein, a new type of polystyrene core–iron oxide shell–silica shell particles is developed to serve as a set of lower micrometer‐sized study objects with different surface roughness; the analysis of their images by the semiautomatic workflow is demonstrating that the particles’ profile roughness can be quantitatively obtained.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The orders of tension waves, their displacement velocities, and the frequencies of forced force actions are analyzed. The electromagnetic torques of tangential tensions are investigated. It is shown that with non-sinusoidal excitation of the rotor, same-order higher harmonics of the magnetic induction from the rotor magnets and stator currents cause high-frequency electromagnetic torques. Three resonant frequencies of the stator core at radial magnetic forces are calculated. The stator core radial displacement amplitudes and vibration velocities were determined, which have been found to be close to experimental data. An experimental frequency response of the motor casing noise for its idle operation mode is obtained. Comments regarding the sources of noise bursts occurring at a number of frequencies are given. The influence of insufficiently suppressed high-frequency reactive torque (the \"walking\" torque) on the motor noise is pointed out. It is shown that the presence of a residual reactive torque with an amplitude measured from experiment leads to a rather high burst of motor casing noise at a frequency of 3500 Hz.</jats:p>"

To analyze the impact of femoral neck cortical bone defect induced by core decompression on postoperative biomechanical stability using the finite element method. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Five finite element models (FEMs) were established, including the standard operating model and four models of cortical bone defects at different portions of the femoral neck (anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior). The maximum stress of the proximal femur was evaluated during normal walking and walking downstairs. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. Under both weight‐bearing conditions, the maximum stress values of the five models were as follows: femoral neck (inferior) &gt; femoral neck (superior) &gt; femoral neck (posterior) &gt; femoral neck (anterior) &gt; standard operation. Stress concentration occurred in the areas of femoral neck cortical bone defect. Under normal walking, the maximum stress of four bone defect models and its increased percentage comparing the standard operation were as follows: anterior (17.17%), posterior (39.02%), superior (57.48%), and inferior (76.42%). The maximum stress was less than the cortical bone yield strength under normal walking conditions. Under walking downstairs, the maximum stress of four bone defect models and its increased percentage comparing the standard operation under normal walking were as follows: anterior (36.75%), posterior (67.82%), superior (83.31%), and inferior (103.65%). Under walking downstairs conditions, the maximum stress of bone defect models (anterior, posterior, and superior) was less than the yield strength of cortical bone, while the maximum stress of bone defect model (inferior) excessed yield strength value. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. The femoral neck cortical bone defect induced by core decompression can carry out normal walking after surgery. To avoid an increased risk of fracture after surgery, walking downstairs should be avoided when the cortical bone defect is inferior to the femoral neck except for the other three positions (anterior, posterior, and superior).</jats:p>",

Among the possible non-contact evaluation methods, optical interferometric techniques possess the potential of providing superior resolution. However, in the optical frequency region, the ambiguity in the absolute phase-shift makes it difficult to measure these parameters of optically thick dispersive materials with sufficient resolution. Here, we demonstrate that dual frequency-comb spectroscopy can be used to precisely determine the absolute sample-induced phase-shift by analyzing the data smoothness. This method enables simultaneous determination of the geometrical thickness and the refractive index of a planar sample with a precision of five and a half digits. The thickness and the refractive index at 193.414 THz (λ = 1550 nm) of a silicon wafer determined by this method are 0.5204737(19) mm and 3.475625(58), respectively, without any prior knowledge of the refractive index.</jats:p>",

Na década de 80, seções de alvéolos não circulares tornaram-se populares, com seções mais altas de 320, 370, 400 e 500 mm. O presente trabalho é uma continuidade dos estudos em pisos pré-moldados realizados pelo Núcleo de Estudo e Tecnologia em Pré-moldados de Concreto (NETPre), e tem como objetivo analisar os mecanismos de ruptura de lajes alveolares protendidas submetidas a esforços cortantes com ênfase no estudo comparativo da variação da altura das lajes (lajes altas e baixas). Neste trabalho foram analisados ensaios destrutivos realizados de acordo com a EN1168 em 06 protótipos de lajes (03 com altura de 200 mm e 03 com altura de 300 mm) com 6 m de comprimento cada, com aplicação de uma carga concentrada até a ruptura para avaliação da resistência à força cortante última. A partir das análises dos mecanismos resistentes concluiu-se que as lajes de 200 mm apresentaram maior influência do mecanismo de flexão o que resultou em maior deformabilidade do elemento para valores menores de força em comparação com as lajes mais altas. No caso das lajes de 300 mm o mecanismo de ruptura quanto ao cisalhamento foi bem definido com ruptura brusca e aparecimento de fissura inclinada típica com extensão do apoio ao ponto de aplicação da força. Além disso, analisando os resultados e comportamento das peças próximo a ruína, pode-se concluir que tanto as lajes de 300 mm como as de 200 mm apresentaram boa eficiência de ancoragem. O escorregamento das cordoalhas somente ocorreu após a ruptura por cisalhamento em região fissurada por flexão de acordo com o critério de cálculo adotado na NBR14861.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the models of asphalt‐rejuvenator‐asphalt and asphalt‐epoxy resin‐asphalt were established to simulate the interface of asphalt and capsule‐core materials. The cross‐linking between poxy resin and curing agent, and tensile tests were then simulated through Perl scripts. Finally, the bi‐plate DSR test was applied to reveal the different action mechanisms between core materials and asphalt materials. The results showed that the cohesive energy of the epoxy resin and asphalt is greater than that of the rejuvenator at the same simulation time. Meanwhile, the maximum stresses generated after stretching for the two models were 69.9 and 34.68 MPa, respectively. The healing indexes HI<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and HI<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> have a sound linear correlation with the maintenance time. The HI<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> value of the epoxy resin is greater than that of the rejuvenator, and the maximum value exceeds 1.

The pathogenesis depends on asbestos‐induced iron accumulation, which eventually leads to ferroptosis‐resistance of mesothelial cells via somatic mutations.

Here we studied the role of PCBP1/2 in rat/human mesothelial and MM cells as well as rat/human MM specimens. Normal peritoneal mesothelial cells in rats exhibited PCBP1 but not PCBP2 immunopositivity whereas primary/immortalized mesothelial cells showed PCBP1/2 immunopositivity. Rat MM specimens induced by intraperitoneal injection of chrysotile, including in situ lesion, revealed PCBP1/2 immunopositivity (90% for both) in the nucleus and cytoplasm with a tendency of higher expression in epithelioid subtype. Knockdown of <jats:italic>PCBP2</jats:italic> but not <jats:italic>PCBP1</jats:italic> significantly decreased both TfR1 and FTH expression in MM cells with inhibition of proliferation, indicating stagnation of intracellular iron transport. Erastin, a cysteine‐deprivation type ferroptosis inducer, decreased the expression of both PCBP1/2 in MM cells. Furthermore, <jats:italic>PCBP2</jats:italic> knockdown significantly increased the sensitivity of MM cells to erastin‐induced ferroptosis with increased catalytic Fe(II).

The material sources for the study were 69 corresponding lexemes extracted from two dictionaries - \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language\" by S.I. Ozhegov and N.Yu. Shvedova and \"Dictionary of the Russian language\" edited by A.P. Evgen'eva. In addition, the contexts of the corpus of Russian everyday speech \"One Day of Speech\" were involved in the analysis. The material of a specific analysis was 15 units from this list and 25 varieties of their meanings (semanthemes), which are included in all the lexical minimums for Russian as a foreign language. The analysis showed that there is a known inconsistency in the number of meanings of the language units in academic dictionaries and in the living speech of native speakers, which demonstrates the semantic change of many lexemes in the course of the continuous development of the language. All these 15 words and 25 semanthemes were tested in a linguistic survey of the Chinese who study Russian in Taiwan and have never been to Russia. Based on the average vocabulary of a foreign students, it can be assumed that students studying Russian for less than a year can reach the A2 level, from two to four years - B1, from five to seven years - B2, and more than 7 years - C1. Chinese often have difficulty distinguishing words with similar feminine meanings (e.g. devochka, devushka and dama). In addition, there is an absolute preponderance of kinship meaning in the mental vocabulary of native Chinese speakers. The obtained results are useful in many applied aspects: translation, linguodidactics, lexicographical practice.</jats:p>"

Aim: The goals of the study were to quantify the impact of maternal exposure to CO in the first trimester of pregnancy in the core Niger Delta by measuring MCOHb concentrations and to assess the effect of maternal demographic and obstetric characteristics on the impact. Material and methods: The study was of cross-sectional design carried out at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH) in Nigeria. 490 consecutive pregnant women in the first trimester were recruited from the antenatal clinic from January 2021 to January 2022. Gestational age was estimated with the aid of an ultrasound scan. Demographic, social and obstetric characteristics were taken. MCOHb concentrations were measured with the aid of a smokerlyser. Data was analyzed, using SPSS version 25.0 (Armonk, NY) software. Ethical approval was obtained from the RSUTH Ethics Committee. Results: The mean value of MCOHb concentration was 1.15±0.40% Out of the 490 patients that were assessed, 461(94.08%) had mild impact from CO exposure (MCOHb= 0.78-1.5%), 18 (3.67%) – moderate impact (MCOHb = 1.75-2.23%) and 11 (2.24%) had severe impact (MCOHb = 2.39% and above). Moderate and severe impact were most prominent in women of 25-29 and 35-39 years of age respectively at which they occurred in 11 out of 145 (7.59%) and 7 out of 103 women (6.80%) respectively and the differences at various age groups were statistically significant [X2=23.119, p&lt;0.010, 95%CI (0.038,0.046)]. The differences in the severity of maternal impact among women with different BMI classes were statistically significant [X2=56.707, p&lt;0.001, 95%CI (0.001,0.001)] with those with class III BMI most likely to have severe impact [4(22.22%) out of 18 patients]. There was inverse relationship between parity and the severity of the impact of CO exposure but the differences at various parity groups were not statistically significant [X2=10.580, p&lt;0.012, 95%CI (0.101,0.113)]. There was also a paradoxical finding of 3 smokers having only mild impact. Conclusion: The mean value of MCOHb was 1.15±0.40. Mild, moderate and severe impact from maternal CO exposure was established with the moderate and severe impacts more prominent at maternal ages of 25-39 years, at higher BMI and at lower parity.</jats:p>",

Although the involvement of autophagy in HBV infection has become apparent, it remains unknown whether selective autophagy plays a critical role in HBV restriction. Here, we report that a member of the galectin family, GAL9, directs the autophagic degradation of HBV HBc. BRET screening revealed that GAL9 interacts with HBc in living cells. Ectopic expression of GAL9 induces the formation of HBc-containing cytoplasmic puncta through interaction with another antiviral factor viperin, which co-localized with the autophagosome marker LC3. Mechanistically, GAL9 associates with HBc via viperin at the cytoplasmic puncta and enhanced the auto-ubiquitination of RNF13, resulting in p62 recruitment to form LC3-positive autophagosomes. Notably, both GAL9 and viperin are type I IFN-stimulated genes that act synergistically for the IFN-dependent proteolysis of HBc in HBV-infected hepatocytes. Collectively, these results reveal a previously undescribed antiviral mechanism against HBV in infected cells and a form of crosstalk between the innate immune system and selective autophagy in viral infection.</jats:p>"

In this work, we report electrical transport properties of a monolayer WSe2 based field effect transistor with most needed multilayer Co/Pt ferromagnetic electrodes exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We studied contact behavior by performing I-V curve measurements and estimating Schottky barrier heights (SBHs). SBHs estimated from experimental data are found to be comparatively small without using any tunnel barrier.

As the most important form of light, fluorescence is significant to applications in bioimaging and optoelectronic devices. However, fluorescence quenching problem constitutes a serious bottleneck in materials creation. Inspired from the core–shell structure in nature, we report an effective strategy to overcome this long‐standing problem by utilizing a molecular core–shell structure. With an emissive core and multifunctional shell fragments, these compounds show aggregation‐induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF) properties by restricting singlet oxygen (<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) generation and suppressing the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA). Protected by the functional shell, the aggregation‐induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit strong emission with high photoluminescent quantum yield and exciton utilization. Furthermore, because the shell materials can form exciplex with electron‐transport materials, the fully solution‐processed organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on these core–shell materials show low turn‐on voltages, excellent device performance with current efficiency of 61.4 cd A<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and power efficiency of 42.8 lm W<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, which is a record‐breaking efficiency based on all‐solution processed organic multilayer systems among the AIE‐OLEDs so far.

However, CRISPR–Cas9 still has some drawbacks, such as limitations of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, target specificity, and the large size of the cas9 gene. To combat invading bacterial phages and plasmid DNAs, bacteria and archaea have diverse and unexplored CRISPR–Cas systems, which have the potential to be developed as a useful genome editing tools. Recently, discovery and characterization of additional CRISPR–Cas systems have been reported. Among them, several CRISPR–Cas systems have been applied successfully to plant and human genome editing. For example, several groups have achieved genome editing using CRISPR–Cas type I-D and type I-E systems, which had never been applied for genome editing previously. In addition to higher specificity and recognition of different PAM sequences, recently developed CRISPR–Cas systems often provide unique characteristics that differ from well-known Cas proteins such as Cas9 and Cas12a. For example, type I CRISPR–Cas10 induces small indels and bi-directional long-range deletions ranging up to 7.2 kb in tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Type IV CRISPR–Cas13 targets RNA, not double-strand DNA, enabling highly specific knockdown of target genes. In this article, we review the development of CRISPR–Cas systems, focusing especially on their application to plant genome engineering. Recent CRISPR–Cas tools are helping expand our plant genome engineering toolbox.</jats:p>",

However, a large dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool maintained in deep oceans during the Neoproterozoic may have extended the time interval between the two oxygenation events. To test the DOC hypothesis, we conducted detailed micro-drilled analyses of carbonate carbon isotopes (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb&lt;/sub&gt;) of a long Ediacaran drill core (the Wangji drill core), for which whole-rock δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb&lt;/sub&gt; and organic carbon isotope (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;org&lt;/sub&gt;) records were available. The micro-drilled δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb &lt;/sub&gt;values obtained in this study are consistent with whole-rock δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb&lt;/sub&gt; results, precluding the influence of severe authigenic carbonate incorporation. Importantly, the multiple negative δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb&lt;/sub&gt; excursions in the Wangji drill core were likely linked with upwelling events, during which DOC was supplied to the surface water and oxidized. Using box models, we estimate that ~3.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; mol and ~2.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; mol DOC were converted to bicarbonate during two negative δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb&lt;/sub&gt; excursions spanning millions of years. The estimations are approximately 1000 times the modern marine DOC reservoir.

Despite all this, most mobile medical platforms in China still face many problems, including the immature business model, the stagnation of the interaction of knowledge and information among platform members, and the weak platform competitiveness. Based on a review of the platform and commercial ecosystems, this paper adopts the evolutionary game method and simulation to analyze the evolutionary stability strategy of operators, partners, and users in the core layer of the platform during preflow and postflow periods of a mobile medical platform, hence, to construct a beneficial dynamic equilibrium model of a platform business ecosystem under the optimal decisions made by all parties involved in the platform: the goal in the early stage (preflow period) is to increase platform user flow. Hence, the knowledge/information sharing of platform users is needed to enhance platform’s visibility. While in the late period (postflow period), when the platform user flow reaches a certain scale, platform’s goal is to promote revenue, which relies mainly on the pricing strategy. It is critical to promote the stability of the platform and the dynamic balance of interests at the core layer in the pricing process. This paper applies the platform business ecosystem theory and the evolutionary game theory to mobile medical platform development, contributing theoretically and practically in the following: (1) providing a more solid theoretical support for the mobile medical platform research and enriching the theoretical framework of the platform business ecosystem; (2) proposing the dynamic equilibrium model based on the optimal decisions of the platform core layers, which help to reveal the inherent law of the evolution of the mobile medical platform; (3) providing policy suggestions and management implications in constructing an appropriate business ecosystem and achieving sustainable development in mobile medical platforms.</jats:p>",

FSC does so by identifying and steering forward slices (rather than backward slices) to dedicated in-order FIFO queues. Moreover, FSC puts load-consumers that depend on L1 D-cache misses on the side to enable younger independent load-consumers to execute faster. Finally, FSC eliminates the need for dynamic memory disambiguation by replicating store-address instructions across queues. Considering 3-wide pipeline configurations, we find that FSC improves performance by 27.1%, 21.1%, and 14.6% on average compared to Freeway, the state-of-the-art sOoO core, across SPEC CPU2017, GAP, and DaCapo, respectively, while at the same time incurring reduced hardware complexity. Compared to an OoO core, FSC reduces power consumption by 61.3% and chip area by 47%, providing a microarchitecture with high performance at low complexity.\n          </jats:p>",

To obtain the best property, the excitation polarization normally needs to match the orientation of the structure. The strong polarization dependence, however, greatly limits the excitation efficiency. In this work, a patchy structure is introduced to release the dependence of polarization. In the proposed method here in this work, the lost properties due to unmatched polarizations are compensated for by the plasmonic resonance coupling between the patch and capped structure in the heterozygous dimer. By overlapping the two modes at the same wavelength, the absorption keeps rather stable undisturbed status during the variation of incident polarization. This work focuses on the theoretical exploration of the feasibility. Electromagnetic field in the interaction between light and heterozygous dimer is essential before extinction coefficient is calculated. The field of the model is obtained by solving Maxwell equations through using the finite element method. The numerical calculation presents a good understanding of the mechanism of the plasmonic interactions in the dimer, based on which the nanostructure with optimized configuration parameters can achieve the stable and high absorption in the near infrared wavelength.</jats:p>"

During the past decade, our understanding of the diversity of viruses they carry has greatly expanded. Most of these viruses are considered mosquito-specific, but there is increasing evidence that these viruses may affect the vector competence of mosquitoes. Metagenomics approaches have focused on specific mosquito species for the identification of what is called the core virome. Despite the fact that, in most ecosystems, multiple species may participate in virus emergence and circulation, there is a lack of understanding of the virus-carrier/host network for both vector-borne and mosquito-specific viruses. Here, we studied the core virome of mosquitoes in a diverse local ecosystem that had 24 different mosquito species. The analysis of the viromes of these 24 mosquito species resulted in the identification of 34 viruses, which included 15 novel viruses, as determined according to the species demarcation criteria of the respective virus families. Most of the mosquito species had never been analysed previously, and a comparison of the individual viromes of the 24 mosquito species revealed novel relationships among mosquito species and virus families. Groups of related viruses and mosquito species from multiple genera formed a complex web in the local ecosystem. Furthermore, analyses of the virome of mixed-species pools of mosquitoes from representative traps of the local ecosystem showed almost complete overlap with the individual-species viromes identified in the study. Quantitative analysis of viruses’ relative abundance revealed a linear relationship to the abundance of the respective carrier/host mosquito species, supporting the theory of a stable core virome in the most abundant species of the local ecosystem. Finally, our study highlights the importance of using a holistic approach to investigating mosquito viromes relationships in rich and diverse ecosystems.</jats:p>",

Reflection high-energy electron diffraction patterns, scanning transmission electron microscopy lattice images, and x-ray diffraction spectra indicate that the (In0.94−x,Gax,Fe0.06)Sb layers have a zinc blende crystal structure without any other second phase. The lattice constant of the (In0.94−x,Gax,Fe0.06)Sb films changes linearly with the Ga concentration x, indicating that Ga atoms substitute In atoms in the zinc-blende structure. We found that the carrier type of (In0.94−x,Gax,Fe0.06)Sb can be systematically controlled by varying x, being n-type when x ≤ 10% and p-type when x ≥ 20%. Characterization studies using magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy indicate that the (In0.94−x,Gax,Fe0.06)Sb layers have intrinsic ferromagnetism with relatively high Curie temperatures (TC = 40–120 K). The ability to widely control the fundamental material properties (lattice constant, bandgap, carrier type, and magnetic property) of (In0.94−x,Gax,Fe0.06)Sb demonstrated in this work is essential for spintronic device applications.</jats:p>",

Low-angle and high-angle fractures with different occurrences are usually developed in carbonate reservoirs. It is difficult to simulate the water injection development process and the law of water flooding is unclear, due to the large variation of the fracture dip. Based on the characteristics of water flooding displacement streamlines in fractured cores with different occurrences, the matrix is discretized into a number of one-dimensional linear subregions, and the channeling effect between each subregion is considered in this paper. The fractures are divided into the same number of fracture cells along with the matrix subregion, and the conduction effect between the fracture cells is considered. The fractured core injection-production system is divided into three areas of linear flow: The injected fluid flows horizontally and linearly from the matrix area at the inlet end of the core to the fracture and then linearly diverts from the fracture area. Finally, the matrix area at the outlet end of the core also presents a horizontal linear flow pattern. Thus, a trilinear flow model for water flooding oil in fractured cores with different occurrences is established. The modified BL equation is used to construct the matrix water-flooding analytical solution, and the fracture system establishes a finite-volume numerical solution, forming a high-efficiency semianalytical solution method for water-flooding BL-CVF. Compared with traditional numerical simulation methods, the accuracy is over 86%, the model is easy to construct, and the calculation efficiency is high. In addition, it can flexibly portray cracks at any dip angle, calculate various indicators of water flooding, and simulate the pressure field and saturation field, with great application effect. The research results show that the greater the fracture dip angle, the higher the oil displacement efficiency. When the fracture dip angle is above 45°, the fracture occurrence has almost no effect on the oil displacement efficiency. The water breakthrough time of through fractures is earlier than that of nonthrough fractures, and the oil displacement efficiency and injection pressure are more significantly affected by the fracture permeability. With the increase of fracture permeability, the oil displacement efficiency and the injection pressure of perforated fractured cores dropped drastically. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of the water drive law and optimizing its parameters in cores with different fracture occurrences. The three-linear flow model has strong adaptability and can accurately solve low-permeability reservoirs and high-angle fractures, but there are some errors for high-permeability reservoirs with long fractures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Objective:</jats:bold> Cancer pain is an important factor in cancer management that affects a patient’s quality of life and survival-related outcomes. The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of East Asian herbal medicine (EAHM) for primary cancer pain and to explore core herb patterns based on the collected data.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A comprehensive literature search was conducted in 11 electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp;amp; Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Korean Studies Information Service System, Research Information Service System, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, Korea Citation Index, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and CiNii for randomized controlled trials from their inception until August 19, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.1.1 and R studio program using the default settings of the meta-package. When heterogeneity in studies was detected, the cause was identified through meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Methodological quality was independently assessed using the revised tool for risk of bias in randomized trials (Rob 2.0).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A total of 38 trials with 3,434 cancer pain patients met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis favored EAHM-combined conventional medicine on response rate (risk ratio: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.09, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.0001), continuous pain intensity (standardized mean difference: −1.74; 95% CI: −2.17 to −1.30, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.0001), duration of pain relief (standardized mean difference: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.22, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.0001), performance status (weighted mean difference: 10.71; 95% CI: 4.89 to 16.53, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.0003), and opioid usage (weighted mean difference: −20.66 mg/day; 95% CI: −30.22 to −11.10, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.0001). No significant difference was observed between EAHM and conventional medicine on response rate and other outcomes. Patients treated with EAHM had significantly reduced adverse event (AE) incidence rates. In addition, based on the ingredients of herb data in this meta-analysis, four combinations of herb pairs, which were frequently used together for cancer pain, were derived.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> EAHM monotherapy can decrease adverse events associated with pain management in cancer patients. Additionally, EAHM-combined conventional medicine therapy may be beneficial for patients with cancer pain in increasing the response rate, relieving pain intensity, improving pain-related performance status, and regulating opioid usage. However, the efficacy and safety of EAHM monotherapy are difficult to conclude due to the lack of methodological quality and quantity of studies. More well-designed, multicenter, double-blind, and placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed in the future. In terms of the core herb combination patterns derived from the present review, four combinations of herb pairs might be promising for cancer pain because they have been often distinctly used for cancer patients in East Asia. Thus, they are considered to be worth a follow-up study to elucidate their actions and effects.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Systematic Review Registration:</jats:bold><jats:ext-link>https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/</jats:ext-link>, identifier CRD42021265804</jats:p>"

Japan has studied the feasibility of an enhanced high burnup low-void effect (CFV) core and fuel using oxide dispersion-strengthened steel cladding in ASTRID 600, considering Japan’s target for core performance. The neutronics design of the core has satisfied most required design targets and conditions. Regarding passive shutdown capabilities, Japan team has performed a preliminary numerical analysis for ASTRID 600 using a complementary safety device (CSD), called a self-actuated shutdown system (SASS), one of the safest approaches in Japan. Japan’s team used the SASS in place of the hydraulically suspended absorber rod, called RBH, one of the safest approaches of France, to investigate the potential of the SASS as a design measure common to the countries. The preliminary analysis has shown that the SASS can satisfy the countries’ main requirements. This study has also revealed that the mitigation measures of ASTRID 600 against a severe accident are promising to achieve in-vessel retention for both countries.</jats:p>"

The WSe2 monolayer shows linear optical response at the intensity I = 1010 W/cm2, while a complex nonlinear behavior is observed at I = 1012 W/cm2. The nonlinear response of the WSe2 monolayer in terms of saturable absorption is observed at a strong laser field. By changing the chirality of the resonant light, a strong circular dichroic effect is observed in the excited state population. A relatively weak laser field shows effective valley polarization while a strong field induces a spin-polarized carrier peak between K(K′) and Γ-point via a nonlinear process. On the other hand, the strong laser field shows high harmonics up to the 11th order. Our results demonstrate that a circularly polarized resonant pulse generates high harmonics in the WSe2 monolayer of order 3n ± 1.</jats:p>",

The study revealed that ensuring national food security in Russia is under the influence of several strategic threats, in particular: insufficient stability of the institutional environment; biased quantitative criteria for achieving food security; lack of strategic management of emergency periods. Overcoming these challenges is possible by building a strategic system hierarchical approach, in the theory of strategy and methodology of strategizing by Professor Vladimir L. Kvint. The fifth is called the Hierarchic System of Strategy based on the alignment of global, national, regional, and corporate interests. The latter primarily concern strategic agro-industrial holdings, whose industry leadership, production potential and financial stability can have a positive impact on increasing the sustainability of regional food markets by expanding the physical and economic availability of food, which contributes to improving the quality of life of the population – the main guideline of the strategy at any level.</jats:p>"

Thermally conductive polymer-based heat sinks, with lightweight and moldability features as well as high-performance and reliability, are promising candidates in solving such inconvenience. The present work deals with the experimental evaluation of the temperature effect on the thermophysical properties of nanocomposites made with polylactic acid (PLA) reinforced with two different weight percentages (3 and 6 wt%) of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Thermal conductivity and diffusivity, as well as specific heat capacity, are measured in the temperature range between 298.15 and 373.15 K. At the lowest temperature (298.15 K), an improvement of 171% is observed for the thermal conductivity compared to the unfilled matrix due to the addition of 6 wt% of GNPs, whereas at the highest temperature (372.15 K) such enhancement is about of 155%. Some of the most important mechanical properties, mainly hardness and Young’s modulus, maximum flexural stress, and tangent modulus of elasticity, are also evaluated as a function of the GNPs content. Moreover, thermal simulations based on the finite element method (FEM) have been carried out to predict the thermal performance of the investigated nanocomposites in view of their practical use in thermal applications. Results seem quite suitable in this regard.</jats:p>"

Associated complications of osteochondroma include deformity, fracture, neurovascular compromise, bursa formation, and malignant transformation. Measurement of the cartilage cap thickness is an important index suggesting secondary malignancy of osteochondroma. The upper limit of cap thickness after skeletal maturation is 1.5 cm which can be reliably measured on ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Hereditary multiple exostoses are linked to the mutations of different exostoses genes located on chromosome 8, 11, and 19.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a design of a highly birefringent terahertz fiber based on the hybrid guidance mechanism of the anti-resonant mechanism and the total internal reflection mechanism is provided. Several HC-AR fibers with both ultra-low transmission loss and ultra-low birefringence have been achieved in the near-infrared optical communication band. We propose a HC-AR fiber design in terahertz band by introducing a microstructure in the fiber core which leads to tremendous improvement in birefringence. Calculated results indicate that the proposed HC-AR fiber achieves a birefringence higher than 10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> in a wide wavelength range. In addition, low relative absorption loss of 0.8% (8.6%) and negligible confinement loss of 1.69×10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> dB/cm (9.14×10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> dB/cm) for x-polarization (y-polarization) mode at 1THz are obtained. Furthermore, the main parameters of the fiber structure are evaluated and discussed, proving that the HC-AR fiber possesses great design and fabrication tolerance. Further investigation of the proposed HC-AR fiber also suggests a good balance between birefringence and transmission loss which can be achieved by changing strut thickness to cater numerous applications ideally.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Temporal trends of industrial organic contaminants can show how environmental burdens respond to changes in production, regulation, and other anthropogenic and environmental factors. Numerous studies have documented such trends from the Northern Hemisphere, while there is very limited data in the literature from sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that the temporal trends of legacy and contemporary industrial contaminants in sub-Saharan Africa could greatly differ from the regions in which many of these chemicals were initially produced and more extensively used. For this purpose, a dated sediment core covering six decades from a floodplain system in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was analysed. The samples were analysed for selected legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs)] and chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) [alternative brominated flame retardants (aBFRs), chlorinated paraffins (CPs), and dechloranes]. All groups of chemicals showed a steep increase in concentrations towards the uppermost sediment layers reflecting the more recent years. Concentrations of the individual compound groups in surface sediment were found in the order CPs &amp;gt;&amp;gt; aBFRs ∼ ∑<jats:sub>25</jats:sub>PBDEs &amp;gt; dechloranes ∼ ∑<jats:sub>32</jats:sub>PCBs. Time trends for the individual compounds and compound groups differed, with ∑<jats:sub>32</jats:sub>PCBs showing presence in sediments since at least the early 1960s, while some CECs first occurred in sediments corresponding to the last decade. Investigations into potential drivers for the observed trends showed that socioeconomic factors related to growth in population, economy, and waste generation have contributed to increasing concentrations of PBDEs, aBFRs, CPs, and Dechlorane Plus. Further monitoring of temporal trends of industrial organic contaminants in urban areas in the Global South is recommended.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the highest‐level network obtained by <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>‐core decomposition was used as the core layer of the “Belt and Road” aviation network, including 53 airports in 37 countries, all of which have high degree centrality and eigenvector centrality; the core layer network exhibits strong “small world” characteristics; there is little difference between the degree values of nodes, and the network has high stability. The status of China’s airports in the core layer network is not prominent; the four regional sectors such as East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East are closely connected regarding air transport. Europe is relatively weakly connected with three sectors: East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia; geographical factors are still the dominant factors determining the status of hub airports along the “Belt and Road.”</jats:p>",

Their detection in the radio domain testifies of the presence of relativistic electrons, and shows that they are potentially efficient energetic particle accelerators. If hadrons can also be accelerated, these energetic particles are expected to interact with the surrounding medium to produce a gamma-ray signal even in the multi–TeV range. The intensity of this signal depends on various factors, but an essential one is the density of the circumstellar medium. Such a signal should however be limited by electron–positron pair production arising from the interaction of the gamma-ray photons with optical photons emitted by the supernova photosphere, which can potentially degrade the gamma-ray signal by over ten orders of magnitude in the first days/weeks following the explosion. We calculate the gamma-gamma opacity from a detailed modelling of the time evolution of the forward shock and supernova photosphere, taking a full account of the non-isotropy of the photon interactions. We discuss the time-dependent gamma-ray TeV emission from Type II-P SNe as a function of the stellar progenitor radius and mass-loss rate, as well as the explosion energy and mass of the ejected material. We evaluate the detectability of the SNe with the next generation of Cherenkov telescopes. We find that, while most extragalactic events may be undetectable, Type II-P SNe exploding in our Galaxy or in the Magellanic Clouds should be detected by gamma-ray observatories such as the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.</jats:p>",

With vigorous developments in nanotechnology, such materials have exhibited numerous advanced EM functions, including radiation prevention and antiradar stealth. To achieve improved EM performance and multifunctionality, the elaborate control of microstructures has become an attractive research direction. By designing them as core–shell structures with different dimensions, the combined effects, such as interfacial polarization, conduction networks, magnetic coupling, and magnetic–dielectric synergy, can significantly enhance the EM wave absorption performance. Herein, the advances in low‐dimensional core–shell EM wave absorption materials are outlined and a selection of the most remarkable examples is discussed. The derived key information regarding dimensional design, structural engineering, performance, and structure–function relationship are comprehensively summarized. Moreover, the investigation of the cutting‐edge mechanisms is given particular attention. Additional applications, such as oxidation resistance and self‐cleaning functions, are also introduced. Finally, insight into what may be expected from this rapidly expanding field and future challenges are presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introducción / justificación:  La evaluación de la citología in situ (ROSE, del inglés rapid on-site evaluation) se plantea como una posible mejora de la técnica diagnóstica de lesiones oncológicas tras la obtención de la muestra por punción aspirativa con aguja fina o biopsia con aguja gruesa. Esta técnica podría mejorar el método de valoración de la idoneidad de la muestra, e incluso permitir un rápido diagnóstico preliminar.   Objetivo:  Evaluar la eficacia, efectividad y seguridad de la citología con evaluación in situ en punción aspiración con aguja fina y biopsia con aguja gruesa ecoguiadas con respecto al protocolo de evaluación habitual.   Metodología:  Revisión sistemática de la literatura, incluyendo informes de evaluación de tecnologías, revisiones sistemáticas y metaanálisis. Para su elaboración se consultaron las siguientes bases de datos referenciales hasta septiembre de 2021 (con lenguaje libre y controlado): Medline (Ovid), Embase (Excerpta Medica DataBase), Cochrane Library (Cochrane Review Database), INAHTA (International HTA Database), WOS (SCI Science Citation Index) y PubMed (Ahead of print/First on line). También se exploraron EvidenceSearch y TripDataBase, así como las principales webs de agencias europeas: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) y la Red española de Agencias de Evaluación de Tecnologías Sanitarias y Prestaciones del SNS (RedETS). La selección de los estudios y el análisis de su calidad se realizaron por dos investigadores independientes. La síntesis de los resultados se llevó a cabo de forma cualitativa. La calidad de los estudios fue evaluada mediante las herramientas AMSTAR-2 para revisiones sistemáticas.   Resultados:  Se incluyeron 2 revisiones sistemáticas con metaanálisis. Se identificaron algunas debilidades en el análisis de la calidad de los trabajos seleccionados y la calidad general fue moderada-baja.   Se evaluó la eficacia de la técnica ROSE para la indicación de sospecha de cáncer de mama, gracias a una de las revisiones sistemáticas incluidas. La diferencia en la eficacia entre las intervenciones en las que se usó esta técnica y en las que no se usó, no resultó estadísticamente significativa. Los autores de la revisión destacan que esta diferencia no significativa puede deberse a que la tasa de adecuación de las muestras sin la utilización de ROSE ya es alta por lo que el margen de posible mejora con esta técnica es limitado.  Se evaluó la eficacia, la seguridad y la eficiencia de la técnica ROSE para la indicación de sospecha de cáncer de pulmón, gracias a una de las revisiones sistemáticas incluidas. En cuanto a la seguridad de la técnica en esta indicación, no se observaron diferencias significativas en la ratio de complicaciones en pacientes en los que se usó la técnica ROSE frente a pacientes en los que no se usó. En cuanto a la eficacia, todas las variables resultado mostraron valores de mayor eficacia cuando se aplicó la técnica ROSE, aunque cabe destacar la variabilidad de dichos valores entre los diferentes estudios incluidos en la revisión.   Conclusiones:  La técnica ROSE puede suponer una mejora en la adecuación de las muestras oncológicas y proveer un prediagnóstico de utilidad clínica para el posible tratamiento del paciente. Esta mejora es especialmente significativa en las muestras de sospecha de cáncer de pulmón, a diferencia de las pacientes con sospecha de cáncer de mama en las cuales la eficacia de la técnica no muestra diferencias significativas. Se necesitan más estudios prospectivos, controlados y aleatorizados para ambas indicaciones. Se recomienda que estos estudios homogenicen los parámetros de la técnica ROSE para evitar posibles fuentes de heterogeneidad. Además, se aconseja que estos estudios incluyan aspectos económicos que permitan la evaluación de la eficiencia.</jats:p>"

In the study of three-phase flows, semi-empirical methods for calculating relative phase permeabilities (RPP) are used in practice, which do not consider the structure of the pore space and the fundamental equations of hydrodynamics. The paper proposes and substantiates a physical and mathematical model of mass transfer in the filtration flow of an oil-water-gas mixture in a porous medium. The pore space structure model is based on the distribution of pore diameters obtained from capillary pressure curves (CCP). In the core, clusters are identified, consisting of a large channel through which oil, water and gas move in a “beaded” mode; channels of medium diameter filled with water and gas and channels of small radius in which gas moves. A system of equations is presented and solved that determines the distribution of moving volumes and volumetric flows over channels and phases. When determining pressure losses in the system of pore channels, friction losses, local losses, and also losses due to interfacial interaction are taken into account. For the first time, on the basis of a hydrodynamic model, analytical expressions were obtained to determine the RPP for oil, water and gas. The calculation-experimental method is based on three model experiments, the results of which determine the properties of the cluster channels in relation to the separately filtered phases. It is shown that the developed theory and calculation method, in the particular case of an oil-water mixture, coincide with the previously developed theory of two-phase filtration on the core scale.</jats:p>"

We present that the classical beam theory accurately analyzes surface bending strains in single-layer and double-layer polymer films through measuring the strains by a surface-labeled grating method. The experimental analysis reveals that the bending strains on the outer and inner surfaces of the single-layer film are symmetrical, whereas those of the double-layer film are asymmetrical. These results are well explained by the classical beam theory considering stress–strain curves of polymer films. This approach will further advance the strain design of polymer films, which aids in the development of mechanically durable devices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Significance. Introduction of non-core subjects into the curriculum of pedagogical universities, in particular, “Fundamentals of Medical Knowledge” is fraught with greatest difficulties.  On the one hand, this is a subject that does not develop any professional competences of students, it is of an introductory nature only. On the other hand, acquiring practical skills in first aid, students should know a clear algorithm of medical actions and remember it until the end of their studies at the university.   The purpose of the study. To analyze the level of competence development in first aid provision. Маtеrial and methods. A survey of two groups of students was conducted: the 1st group – the first-year students who have completed  “Fundamentals of Medical Knowledge” at the end of the academic year (2021), a total of 98 students; the 2nd group - graduate students (2021), who studied this subject also in the first year, i.e. 4 years ago, a total of 103 students. The method of random selection was used. All students answered 29 questions anonymously. The sampling error on the questionnaire questions did not exceed 5%.  To analyze data of the sociological survey, an alternative analysis (extensive indicators) was used, and to identify cause-and-effect relationships a correlation analysis was undertaken. Reliability of the correlation coefficient was assessed using tabular standard values.  Results. The majority of the respondents in both the 1st group (94.9%) and the 2nd group (96.1%) consider the non-core subject “Fundamentals of Medical Knowledge” as the need to use the acquired knowledge in future.  According to the competence-based approach, the subject is aimed at developing knowledge and skills in managing conditions that can become fatal within a short period of time. Upon completion of the subject in the 1st year, signs of clinical death could be determined by 42.9%, while by the end of the studies at the university - only 8.7%. A similar situation is relevant to first aid for bleeding - 61.2% and 29.1%, respectively.  The main reasons why students fail to master the threshold level of competence in first aid are both a feeling of fear, lack of experience, ethical side (vomit, blood), insufficient technical equipment during practicals, as well as the fact that this subject is taught by educators without medical background, which is confirmed by the results and correlation analysis.  In addition, the respondents were faced with the approaches that do not correspond to the correct algorithm of actions:  8.2% - in the 1st group and 15.5% - in the 2nd.  The level of competence development among students is decreasing, by the end of the university only 8.7% can implement “I know, can do, and master the skill”. Conclusion. The competence-based approach to non-core subjects does not produce the expected result. This is due to the lack of cumulative acquisition of knowledge, competences and skill throughout the study process at the university, insufficient technical equipment during practicals and the fact that the subject is taught by specialists without relevant background. Scope of application. The data obtained can be used to develop state educational standards.</jats:p>"

Although hepatocyte proliferation and hypertrophy have been reported, little is known about the dynamics of biliary epithelial cells (BECs), which comprise the bile duct epithelium in the liver. Here, we show that BECs transiently proliferate during the early stage of gestation. Lineage tracing revealed that BEC progeny were retained in the bile duct epithelium and did not differentiate into hepatocytes, indicating BEC self‐replication during pregnancy. RNA‐sequencing analysis of BECs identified their early pregnancy‐signature transcriptomes, which highlighted Yes‐associated protein (YAP) signaling‐related genes. Nuclear accumulation of YAP was enhanced in BECs during pregnancy but was barely detectable in hepatocytes. In addition, the pharmacological inhibition of YAP attenuated BEC proliferation and liver weight gain during pregnancy. Our results delineate the proliferation and transcriptomic dynamics of BECs during pregnancy and suggest the relevance of YAP‐mediated signals.</jats:p>",

The design has been modelled and the model has also been validated with the experimental and analytical method. Six different configurations of sandwich structures have been proposed. Out of these six, three configurations have the varying cell size i.e. 3.2 mm, 4 mm and 4.8 mm and the other three configurations have the varying panel width i.e. 40 mm, 45 mm and 50 mm keeping rest of the design parameters unchanged. Using ANSYS, analysis has been performed for all these six configurations and equivalent stiffness has been calculated. It has been observed that the honeycomb core cell size does not have a significant effect on the stiffness properties of a composite sandwich panel. The analysis also reveals that with the increased panel width the stiffness of composite panel increases significantly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a situation where our state has faced a significant number of threats from the Russian Federation, among which threats of information terrorism and extremism represent a significant part of the existing risks, the number of criminal investigations into the facts of committing such crimes has increased. The investigation of almost each of them is associated with the need to use particular knowledge to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, objectivity and at the same time compliance with reasonable deadlines for pre-trial investigation. The peculiarity of a significant number of modern expert studies conducted in criminal proceedings on extremist crimes is that their objects are products of speech activity which find their expression in oral or written speech and are stored on a storage medium in graphic or digital forms. Both data storage materials and the speech product stored on them are subject to expert research. The aim of research is to analyse the practice of using the capabilities of forensic examination in order to study texts during the pre-trial investigation of crimes related to public calls for committing illegal actions aimed at undermining the constitutional order, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine; to reveal the potentials of linguistic expert examination and to justify the need for comprehensive psychological and linguistic studies of texts calling for the perpetration of illegal actions, as well as denial of the legitimacy of resolving legal issues during such examinations. The study substantiates that the most important tool for identifying, investigating and proving facts of extremist activities aimed at undermining the constitutional order, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine are forensic examination and expert research. Manifestations of speech extremism become frequent objects of study in forensic linguistic examination. When translating the signs of such extremist crimes into a meta-language of linguistic semantics, two groups of features are distinguished – semantic and pragmatic. By virtue of introduction of the methodology for conducting forensic linguistic, psychological and linguistic examination of materials in criminal proceedings related to the investigation of the facts of calls for extremism and terrorism, modern experts are armed with a system of linguistic categories and methods that must be used in the study of statements that have fallen into the legal sphere. Forensic examinations in such criminal proceedings are also a means of remedial action, since the correctness of its expert evaluation depends on an objective, methodically correct expert assessment of the disputed material. Due to the verbal nature of the objects of expert research, bodies of pre-trial investigation most often appoint forensic linguistic, psychological, psycho-linguistic, and other examinations, as well as various options for complex research.</jats:p>"

In this study, we provide evidence that the Nemo-related protein, optineurin (OPTN), plays a key role in restricting HSV-2 infection both in vitro and in vivo. Contrary to previous reports regarding the proviral role of OPTN during Sendai virus infection, we demonstrate that lack of OPTN in cells causes enhanced virus production. OPTN deficiency negatively affects the host autophagy response and results in a marked reduction of CCL5 induction. OPTN knockout (OPTN−/−) mice display exacerbated genital disease and dysregulated T cell frequencies in infected tissues and lymph nodes. A human transcriptomic profile dataset provides further credence that a strong positive correlation exists between CCL5 upregulation and OPTN expression during HSV-2 genital infection. Our findings underscore a previously unknown OPTN/CCL5 nexus that restricts hyperproliferative spread of primary HSV-2 infection, which may constitute an intrinsic host defense mechanism against herpesviruses in general.</jats:p>",

A range of Ag@Au NPs with varying molar ratios of Ag–Au were prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Micro CT was used to evaluate the X-ray attenuation capabilities of Ag@Au NPs with different compositions. The CT imaging effects of Ag@Au NPs with high X-ray attenuation were detected in U87 glioma cells and a mouse subcutaneous glioma model. The characterization results showed that Ag@Au NPs synthesized with different molar percentages of Ag (75%, 50% and 25%) were spherical, and their mean diameters were between 12–16 nm. Ag@Au NPs with an Ag molar percentage of 50% were selected for subsequent research, because of their excellent X-ray attenuation capability, morphology and dispersibility. The attenuation coefficient of glioma cells treated with Ag@Au NPs increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The contrast of the tumor area of the mice was significantly enhanced in CT images after intratumoral injection of Ag@Au NPs. Our results suggested that Ag@Au NPs could be an excellent CT contrast agent, which provided a new thought for the development of highly efficient contrast agents for tumor CT imaging. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Understanding the long-term evolution of Earth's plate-mantle system is reliant on absolute plate motion models in a mantle reference frame, but such models are both difficult to construct and controversial. We present a tectonic rules-based optimisation approach to construct a plate motion model in a mantle reference frame covering the last billion years and use it as a surface boundary condition for mantle flow models. Our plate motion model results in lithospheric net rotation consistently below 0.25°/Myr, in agreement with mantle flow models, while trench motions are confined to a relatively narrow range of −2/+2 cm/yr since 320 Ma, during Pangea stability and dispersal. In contrast, the period from 600 Ma to 320 Ma, nicknamed here the \"zippy tricentenary\", displays twice the trench motion scatter compared to more recent times, reflecting a predominance of short and highly mobile subduction zones. Our model supports an orthoversion evolution from Rodinia to Pangea with Pangea offset approximately 90° eastwards relative to Rodinia—this is the opposite sense of motion compared to a previous orthoversion hypothesis based on paleomagnetic data. In our coupled plate-mantle model a broad network of basal mantle ridges forms between 1000 and 600 Ma, reflecting widely distributed subduction zones. Between 600 and 500 Ma a short-lived degree-2 basal mantle structure forms in response to a band of subduction zones confined to low-latitudes, generating extensive antipodal lower mantle upwellings centred at the poles. Subsequently the northern basal structure migrates southward and morphs into a Pacific-centred upwelling while the southern structure is dissected by subducting slabs and disintegrates into a network of ridges between 500 and 400 Ma. From 400 to 200 Ma, a stable Pacific-centred degree-1 convective planform emerges, lacking an antipodal counterpart due to the closure of the Iapetus and Rheic oceans between Laurussia and Gondwana as well as coeval subduction between Baltica and Laurentia and around Siberia, populating the mantle with slabs until 320 Ma when Pangea is assembled. A basal degree-2 structure forms subsequent to Pangea breakup, after the influence of previously subducted slabs in the African hemisphere on the lowermost mantle has faded away. This succession of mantle states is distinct from previously proposed mantle convection models. This Solid Earth Evolution Model for the last 1000 million years (SEEM1000) forms the foundation for a multitude of spatio-temporal data analysis approaches.\n                        </jats:p>"

To quantificationally detect QR, a sensitive electrochemical sensor was fabricated by palladium nanoparticles loaded on carbon sphere @ molybdenum disulfide nanosheet core-shell composites (Cs@MoS2-Pd NPs). The Cs@MoS2-Pd NPs worked to remedy the shortcomings of MoS2 and exhibited good catalytic activity to QR. The oxidation reaction of QR on Cs@MoS2-Pd NPs/GCE involved two electrons and two protons. Furthermore, the molecular surface for electrostatic potential, Laplacian bond order, and Gibbs free energy were computationally simulated to speculate the order and site of the oxidation of QR. The results showed that the 4′ O–H and 3′ O–H broke successively during the oxidation reaction. When the concentration of QR was within 0.5 to 12 μM, the fabricated sensor could achieve linear detection, and the detection limit was 0.02 μM (S/N = 3). In addition, the sensor possessed good selectivity, repeatability, and stability, which has a broad prospect in practical application.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To restore lost functions while repairing the neuronal structure after spinal cord injury (SCI), pharmacological interventions with multiple therapeutic agents will be a more effective modality given the complex pathophysiology of acute SCI. Toward this end, we prepared electrospun membranes containing aligned core–shell fibers with a polylactic acid (PLA) shell, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or a brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in the core. The controlled release of both pro-regenerative agents is expected to provide combinatory treatment efficacy for effective neurogenesis, while aligned fiber topography is expected to guide directional neurite extension. The in vitro release study indicates that both DHA and BDNF could be released continuously from the electrospun membrane for up to 50 days, while aligned microfibers guide the neurite extension of primary cortical neurons along the fiber axis. Furthermore, the PLA/DHA/BDNF core–shell fibrous membrane (CSFM) provides a significantly higher neurite outgrowth length from the neuron cells than the PLA/DHA CSFM. This is supported by the upregulation of genes associated with neuroprotection and neuroplasticity from RT-PCR analysis. From an in vivo study by implanting a drug-loaded CSFM into the injury site of a rat suffering from SCI with a cervical hemisection, the co-delivery of DHA and BDNF from a PLA/DHA/BDNF CSFM could significantly improve neurological function recovery from behavioral assessment, as well as provide neuroprotection and promote neuroplasticity changes in recovered neuronal tissue from histological analysis.</jats:p>"

The morphology and structure of core–shell hydrogels were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The factors affecting the swelling properties of the hydrogel were studied. The results show that the PVA–CS/SA–Ca2+ hydrogel has obvious core and shell structures. The SA concentration and SA/Ca2+ cross-linking time show a positive correlation with the thickness of the shell structure; the PVA/CS mass ratio affects the structural characteristics of the core structure; and a higher CS content indicates the more obvious three-dimensional network structure of the hydrogel. The optimal experimental conditions for the swelling degree of the core–shell hydrogel were an SA concentration of 5%; an SA/Ca2+ cross-linking time of 90 min; a PVA/CS mass ratio of 1:0.7; and a maximum swelling degree of 50 g/g.</jats:p>"

However, gene regulatory programs governing how initial neuronal injuries lead to neuronal death remain poorly understood. In adult mice, optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, which severs all axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), results in massive death of axotomized RGCs and regenerative failure of survivors. We performed an <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screen of 1893 transcription factors (TFs) to seek repressors of RGC survival and axon regeneration following ONC. In parallel, we profiled the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of injured RGCs by ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify critical injury responsive TFs and their targets. Remarkably, these independent analyses converged on a set of four ATF/CEBP transcription factors – ATF3, ATF4, C/EBPγ and CHOP (Ddit3) – as critical regulators of survival. Further studies indicate that these TFs contribute to two pro-death transcriptional programs: ATF3/CHOP preferentially regulate pathways activated by cytokines and innate immunity, whereas ATF4/C/EBPγ regulate pathways engaged by intrinsic neuronal stressors. Manipulation of these TFs also protects RGCs in an experimental model of glaucoma, a prevalent disease in which RGCs die. Together, our results reveal core transcription programs that transform an initial axonal insult into a degenerative result and suggest novel strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases.</jats:p>"

An attractive alternative to recombinant inbred lines for many traits leverages selecting phenotypically extreme individuals from a segregating population, and subjecting pools of selected and control individuals to sequencing. Under a bulked or extreme segregant analysis paradigm, genomic regions contributing to trait variation are revealed as frequency differences between pools. Here, we describe such an extreme quantitative trait locus, or extreme quantitative trait loci, mapping strategy that builds on an existing multiparental population, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, and involves phenotyping and genotyping a population derived by mixing hundreds of Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource recombinant inbred lines. Simulations demonstrate that challenging, yet experimentally tractable extreme quantitative trait loci designs (≥4 replicates, ≥5,000 individuals/replicate, and selecting the 5–10% most extreme animals) yield at least the same power as traditional recombinant inbred line-based quantitative trait loci mapping and can localize variants with sub-centimorgan resolution. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a 4-fold replicated extreme quantitative trait loci experiment that identifies 7 quantitative trait loci for caffeine resistance. Two mapped extreme quantitative trait loci factors replicate loci previously identified in recombinant inbred lines, 6/7 are associated with excellent candidate genes, and RNAi knock-downs support the involvement of 4 genes in the genetic control of trait variation. For many traits of interest to drosophilists, a bulked phenotyping/genotyping extreme quantitative trait loci design has considerable advantages.</jats:p>",

Their development is challenging, partly because of limited knowledge of the physiological and pathological distal gastrointestinal factors, including colonic chyme fluid distribution and motor function. Recently, non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have started to provide novel important insights. In this feasibility study, we formulated a coated capsule consisting of a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) shell, coated with a synthetic polymer based on polymethacrylate-based copolymer (Eudragit®) that can withstand the upper gastrointestinal tract conditions. The capsule was filled with olive oil as MRI-visible marker fluid. This allowed us to test the ability of MRI to track such a coated capsule in the gastrointestinal tract and to assess whether it is possible to image its loss of integrity by exploiting the ability of MRI to image fat and water separately and in combination. Ten healthy participants were administered capsules with varying amounts of coating and underwent MRI imaging of the gastrointestinal tract at 45 min intervals. The results indicate that it is feasible to track the capsules present in the gastrointestinal tract at different locations, as they were detected in all 10 participants. By the 360 min endpoint of the study, in nine participants the capsules were imaged in the small bowel, in eight participants in the terminal ileum, and in four in the colon. Loss of capsule integrity was observed in eight participants, occurring predominantly in distal intestinal regions. The data indicate that the described approach could be applied to assess performance of oral formulations in undisturbed distal gastrointestinal regions, without the need for ionizing radiation or contrast agents.</jats:p>"

To date, extant neuroscientific studies of schizophrenia have largely investigated dysfunctional speech and gesture in isolation, and no prior research has examined how the two communicative channels may interact in more natural contexts. Here, we tested if patients with schizophrenia show aberrant neural processing of semantically complex story segments, and if speech-associated gestures (co-speech gestures) might modulate this effect. In a functional MRI study, we presented to 34 participants (16 patients and 18 matched-controls) an ecologically-valid retelling of a continuous story, performed via speech and spontaneous gestures. We split the entire story into ten-word segments, and measured the semantic complexity for each segment with idea density, a linguistic measure that is commonly used clinically to evaluate aberrant language dysfunction at the semantic level. Per segment, the presence of numbers of gestures varied (n = 0, 1, +2). Our results suggest that, in comparison to controls, patients showed reduced activation for more complex segments in the bilateral middle frontal and inferior parietal regions. Importantly, this neural aberrance was normalized in segments presented with gestures. Thus, for the first time with a naturalistic multimodal stimulation paradigm, we show that gestures reduced group differences when processing a natural story, probably by facilitating the processing of semantically complex segments of the story in schizophrenia.</jats:p>",

In the present work, we studied two closely related apple varieties, ‘Reinette grise du Canada’ and ‘Reinette blanche du Canada’, which display russeted and non-russeted skin phenotypes, respectively, during fruit development. To better understand the molecular events associated with russeting and the differential triterpene composition, metabolomics data were generated using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and combined with proteomic and transcriptomic data. Our results indicated lower expression of genes linked to cuticle biosynthesis (cutin and wax) in russet apple throughout fruit development, along with an alteration of the specialized metabolism pathways, including triterpene and phenylpropanoid. We identified a lipid transfer protein (LTP3) as a novel player in cuticle formation, possibly involved in the transport of both cutin and wax components in apple skin. Metabolomic data highlighted for the first time a large diversity of triterpene-hydroxycinnamates in russeted tissues, accumulation of which was highly correlated with suberin-related genes, including some enzymes belonging to the BAHD (HXXXD-motif) acyltransferase family. Overall, this study increases our understanding about the crosstalk between triterpene and suberin pathways.</jats:p>"

Two datasets, GSE30529 and GSE47184 from GEO based on diabetic nephropathy tubular samples, were downloaded and merged after batch effect removal.

However, achieving this unique core-shell morphology with smaller size, high specific surface area, and large pore volume is highly challenging. In this study, we report the synthesis of core-shell MSN using a triple surfactant assisted soft-templating approach. We show that the size, morphological and textural properties of the core-shell structures can be easily modified by controlling the amount of fluorocarbon-4 surfactant. The optimised core shell MSN showed the highest surface area of 1496 m2/g that helped in achieving a high drug loading of model drugs doxorubicin (34%) or docetaxel (50%). The small size of core-shell MSN facilitated its rapid uptake within the PC-3 cells within 12 h. The cytotoxicity data using drug loaded MSN showed high cytotoxicity in both PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines suggesting that this versatile platform is efficient in delivering different drugs to various cell types. This unique triple surfactant assisted synthesis of core-shell MSN will open the door for multifaceted applications in imaging and drug delivery.</jats:p>",

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes survival, self-renewal, and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). While genetic deletion of LIF affects hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), the direct effect of LIF protein exposure on HPC survival is not known. Furthermore, post-translational modifications (PTM) of LIF and their effects on its function have not been evaluated. We demonstrate that treatment with recombinant LIF preserves mouse and human HPC numbers in stressed conditions when growth factor addition is delayed ex vivo. We show that Lif is upregulated in response to irradiation-induced stress. We reveal novel PTM of LIF where it is cleaved twice by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) protease so that it loses its 4 N-terminal amino acids. This truncation of LIF down-modulates LIF’s ability to preserve functional HPC numbers ex vivo following delayed growth factor addition. DPP4-truncated LIF blocks the ability of full-length LIF to preserve functional HPC numbers. This LIF role and its novel regulation by DPP4 have important implications for normal and stress hematopoiesis, as well as for other cellular contexts in which LIF and DPP4 are implicated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, we aim to evaluate the diversity of lichens and allied non-lichenised fungi, co-existing in dark-coniferous and broad-leaved forests of the southern taiga in the East European Plain. The Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve (589 km2) was established in 2006 to preserve the last fragments of the unique primeval forests of the southern taiga. The territory of the Kologriv cluster of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve (481 km2) is located in the north of the Kostroma Region (Russia). The main phorophytes in this cluster are Picea abies, Tilia cordata, Betula pubescens, and Abies sibirica. In our time-limited study (four days in May 2021), we selected a 10 000-m2 (hereinafter – 1-ha) plot (a presumed lichen diversity hotspot) in the primeval forest stand in the core of the Kologriv cluster of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve (58.80164° N, 43.98533° E, at altitude ca. 200 m a.s.l.). For a detailed study of the species composition of lichens on this plot, all types of substrates were examined, including trunks and branch surface of various tree species under various conditions, dead and rotting wood of snags, stumps, and fallen logs. In addition, 22 points in various parts of the protected core were examined by the route method in May 2019 and May 2021. This detailed survey in the primeval forest in the core of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve has revealed an unexpectedly high lichen diversity: 230 species recorded in a single 1-ha plot is equal to or much more than the number of species recorded in several Protected Areas of far larger sizes in European Russia. The number of species found on this plot is 73% of the one recorded in the whole protected core (316 species) and 58% of the lichen diversity known in the entire area of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve (398 species). The genus Asterophoma is new for European Russia. The genera Bachmanniomyces and Bryostigma are new for the lichen flora of the middle belt of European Russia. There are 91 species listed for the first time for the lichen flora of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve. Of them, 83 species are new to the Kostroma Region. Two species (Micarea synotheoides and Stigmidium exasperatum) are new to Russia. Rinodina macrospora was found for the first time in Europe. Three species, Asterophoma mazaediicola, Biatora veteranorum, and Biatoropsis minuta, are new to European Russia. 13 species were found for the first time in the middle belt of European Russia: Bachmanniomyces punctum, Bryostigma lapidicola, Heterocephalacria bachmannii, Lepra borealis, Micarea byssacea, M. melaeniza, M. nowakii, M. pseudomicrococca, M. pycnidiophora, Ochrolechia mahluensis, Scoliciosporum perpusillum, Skyttea gregaria, Stigmidium congestum, Trapeliopsis gelatinosa, Xylographa soralifera. Four threatened species (Leptogium burnetiae, Lobaria pulmonaria, Menegazzia terebrata and Nephromopsis laureri) are listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. We have made a comparison of the lichen flora diversity found in the core of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve with previously obtained data in Western and Central Europe. The core of the Kologriv Forest State Nature Reserve meets the criteria of a hotspot of lichen biodiversity on the European level. We would like to emphasise the importance of finding such hotspots of lichen diversity by an inventory of the lichen flora in other Protected Areas.</jats:p>"

Patients from December 2018 to May 2020 were randomly assigned to the CNB group and the FNA group at a ratio of 1:1. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800019370). The feasibility of CNB for high-risk cervical lymph nodes was evaluated by observing and recording the separation success rate (SSR) and technical success rate (TSR) of the CNB group. Safety was evaluated by comparing the incidence of major complications in the two groups. The diagnostic efficacy was evaluated by comparing the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the two groups. A total of 84 patients (84 lymph nodes) were randomized into the CNB (n = 42) and FNA (n = 42) groups. All patients in the CNB group achieved successful hydrodissection and biopsy. The SSR and TSR were both 100% in the CNB group. There were no major complications during or after the process in the two groups. Compared with the FNA group, the CNB group was significantly superior in terms of diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity (100% vs. 81.0%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.009; 100% vs. 79.2%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.035, respectively).

This study investigated whether HP can promote these outcomes independent of carbohydrate (CHO) content. 121 women with obesity (BW: 95.1 ± 13.0 kg, BMI: 35.4 ± 3.9 kg/m2) were randomised to either HP (1.2 g/kg BW) or normal protein (NP, 0.8 g/kg BW) diets, in combination with either LC (28 en%) or normal CHO (NC, 40 en%) diets. A low-energy diet partial diet replacement (LEDpdr) regime was used for 8 weeks, where participants consumed fixed-energy meal replacements plus one ad libitum meal daily. Four-day dietary records showed that daily energy intake (EI) was similar between groups (p = 0.744), but the difference in protein and CHO between groups was lower than expected. Following multiple imputation (completion rate 77%), decrease in mean BW, fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) at Week 8 in all was 7.5 ± 0.7 kg (p &lt; 0.001), 5.7 ± 0.5 kg (p &lt; 0.001), and 1.4 ± 0.7 kg (p = 0.054) respectively, but with no significant difference between diet groups. LC (CHO×Week, p &lt; 0.05), but not HP, significantly promoted postprandial satiety during a preload challenge. Improvements in blood biomarkers were unrelated to LEDpdr macronutrient composition. In conclusion, HP did not promote satiety and BW loss compared to NP LEDpdr, irrespective of CHO content.</jats:p>"

This study describes the development and potential effectiveness of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (BMP‐2) shell‐core microspheres for promoting bone regeneration. Poly(L‐lactic acid)/polylactic‐co‐glycolic acid (PLLA/PLGA) core‐shell microspheres loaded with VEGF and BMP‐2 were prepared by a coaxial electrospray technique, and their surface morphology, core‐shell distribution, and particle size were examined. Different groups of microspheres were prepared with different placement of the growth factors, and the encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release curves were measured. Additionally, the effects of the different groups of microspheres on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and vascular endothelial cells were investigated. The prepared microspheres had a core‐shell structure with good homogeneity and dispersion, a clear boundary, and a smooth surface. On scanning electron microscopy, the mean diameter of the microspheres was similar for all six preparations (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05). During in vitro release, growth factor was initially released via a brief burst release from the outer shell of the microsphere followed by a slower sustained release. The release of growth factors from the inner core remained relatively slow and sustained. Sequential release of different growth factors was achieved through the inconsistent release rates from the microsphere shell and inner core. All groups of microspheres showed no cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility, and the ability to promote osteoblast proliferation. The microspheres loaded with BMP‐2 also promoted osteoblast differentiation, and VEGF‐loaded microspheres promoted the proliferation and differentiation of vascular endothelial cells. The BMP‐2 (core)/VEGF (shell) microsphere group best promoted osteoblast differentiation. The microspheres prepared in this study exhibited slow sequential release of BMP‐2 and VEGF and showed good biocompatibility along with the ability to promote osteoblast differentiation and vascular endothelial cell proliferation.</jats:p>",

As three mechanisms of resistance to aflatoxin in peanut including shell infection resistance, seed infection resistance and aflatoxin production resistance exist among naturally evolved germplasm stocks, it is highly crucial to pyramid these three resistances for promoting peanut industry development and protecting consumers’ health. However, less research effort has been made yet to investigate the differentiation and genetic relationship among the three resistances in diversified peanut germplasm collections.\nResults\n In this study, the Chinese peanut mini-mini core collection selected from a large basic collection was systematically evaluated for the three resistances against <jats:italic>A. flavus</jats:italic> for the first time. The research revealed a wide variation among the diversified peanut accessions for all the three resistances. Totally, 14 resistant accessions were identified, including three with shell infection resistance, seven with seed infection resistance and five with aflatoxin production resistance. A special accession, Zh.h1312, was identified with both seed infection and aflatoxin production resistance. Among the five botanic types of <jats:italic>A. hypogaea</jats:italic>, the <jats:italic>var. vulgaris</jats:italic> (Spanish type) belonging to subspecies <jats:italic>fastigiata</jats:italic> is the only one which possessed all the three resistances. There was no close correlation between shell infection resistance and other two resistances, while there was a significant positive correlation between seed infection and toxin production resistance. All the three resistances had a significant negative correlation with pod or seed size. A total of 16 SNPs/InDels associated with the three resistances were identified through genome-wide association study (GWAS). Through comparative analysis, Zh.h1312 with seed infection resistance and aflatoxin production resistance was also revealed to possess all the resistance alleles of associated loci for seed infection index and aflatoxin content.\nConclusions\n This study provided the first comprehensive understanding of differentiation of aflatoxin resistance in diversified peanut germplasm collection, and would further contribute to the genetic enhancement for resistance to aflatoxin contamination.</jats:p>"

There is a need to develop rodent coils capable of targeted brain stimulation for treating neuropsychiatric disorders and understanding brain mechanisms. We describe a novel rodent coil design to improve the focality for targeted stimulations in small rodent brains.\n            <jats:italic>Introduction</jats:italic>\n            . Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is becoming increasingly important for treating neuropsychiatric disorders and understanding brain mechanisms. Preclinical studies permit invasive manipulations and are essential for the mechanistic understanding of TMS effects and explorations of therapeutic outcomes in disease models. However, existing TMS tools lack focality for targeted stimulations. Notably, there has been limited fundamental research on developing coils capable of focal stimulation at deep brain regions on small animals like rodents.\n            <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>\n            . In this study, ferromagnetic cores are added to a novel angle-tuned coil design to enhance the coil performance regarding penetration depth and focality. Numerical simulations and experimental electric field measurements were conducted to optimize the coil design.\n            <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>\n            . The proposed coil system demonstrated a significantly smaller stimulation spot size and enhanced electric field decay rate in comparison to existing coils. Adding the ferromagnetic core reduces the energy requirements up to 60% for rodent brain stimulation. The simulated results are validated with experimental measurements and demonstration of suprathreshold rodent limb excitation through targeted motor cortex activation.\n            <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>\n            . The newly developed coils are suitable tools for focal stimulations of the rodent brain due to their smaller stimulation spot size and improved electric field decay rate.\n          </jats:p>",

These qualities are desirable in many applications such as photovoltaic cells, photocatalysis, and light sensors. Here, we present hybrid devices that incorporate various CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs, such as seeded quantum dots and asymmetric seeded nanorods (a-sNRs), with a single-wall CNT in a field-effect transistor geometry. We used electrical measurements to probe a light-induced charge transfer (LICT) between the CdSe/CdS NCs and the CNT. We investigate the effect of gate voltage on the LICT magnitude and temporal characteristics. Surprisingly, the measured photo-response depends on the gate voltage, and we observe both electrons and holes transfer from the a-sNRs to the CNT. Furthermore, a comparison between LICT measurements on different devices with different CNTs and NC types reveals that the charge transfer time is directly proportional to the shell-thickness around the CdSe core and inversely correlated with the NCs size. The recovery of the charge trapped inside the CdSe/CdS NCs is characterized by two distinct fast and slow relaxation times, which depend on the NCs size and CNT type. Although, the charge relaxation time is similar between the symmetric QDs and the asymmetric sNRs, the overall percentage of the remaining charge in the QDs is significantly larger than in the sNRs. Understanding both gate voltage and NCs size effect on the LICT processes can optimize the performance of optoelectronic devices.</jats:p>",

Among these substructures we have: (1) a stream connecting NGC 1387 to the central galaxy, NGC 1399, previously reported in the literature; (2) a new giant stream produced by the interaction of NGC 1382 with NGC 1380 and (possibly) NGC 1381; (3) a series of streams kinematically connected to nearby UCDs; and (4) clumps of tracers with no clear kinematical association to close cluster members.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> We show evidence for a variety of cold substructures predicted in simulations. Most of the streams are kinematically connected to UCDs, supporting the scenario that they can be remnants of disrupted dwarf systems. However, we also show the presence of long coherent substructures connecting cluster members and isolated clumps of tracers possibly left behind by their parent systems before these merged into the central galaxy. Unfortunately, the estimated low-surface brightness of these streams does not allow us to find their signatures in the current imaging data and deeper observations are needed to confirm them.</jats:p>",

Fiber lasers are on the verge in the development of such sources, yet widespan spectral tunability of femtosecond pulses remains a pivotal challenge. Dispersive wave generation, also known as Cherenkov radiation, offers untapped potentials to serve these demands. In this work, the concept of quasi‐phase matching for multi‐order dispersive wave formation with record‐high spectral fidelity and femtosecond durations is exploited in selected, partially conventionally unreachable spectral regions. Versatile patterned sputtering is utilized to realize height‐modulated high‐index nano‐films on exposed fiber cores to alter fiber dispersion to an unprecedented degree through spatially localized, induced resonances. Nonlinear optical experiments and simulations, as well as phase‐mismatching considerations based on an effective dispersion, confirm the conversion process and reveal unique emission features, such as almost power‐independent wavelength stability and femtosecond duration. This resonance‐empowered approach is applicable to both fiber and on‐chip photonic systems and paves the way to instrumentalize dispersive wave generation as a unique tool for efficient, coherent femtosecond multi‐frequency conversion for applications in areas such as bioanalytics, life science, quantum technology, or metrology.</jats:p>",

This mechanism significantly reduces the required undercooling necessary to nucleate solid iron. This work also suggests that bcc and hcp iron have similar free energies at pressures near the inner core center.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding the human brain’s perception of different thermal sensations has sparked the interest of many neuroscientists. The identification of distinct brain patterns when processing thermal stimuli has several clinical applications, such as phantom-limb pain prediction, as well as increasing the sense of embodiment when interacting with neurorehabilitation devices. Notwithstanding the remarkable number of studies that have touched upon this research topic, understanding how the human brain processes different thermal stimuli has remained elusive. More importantly, very intense thermal stimuli perception dynamics, their related cortical activations, as well as their decoding using effective features are still not fully understood. In this study, using electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from three healthy human subjects, we identified spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns of brain responses to different thermal stimulations ranging from extremely cold and hot stimuli (very intense), moderately cold and hot stimuli (intense), to a warm stimulus (innocuous). Our results show that very intense thermal stimuli elicit a decrease in alpha power compared to intense and innocuous stimulations. Spatio-temporal analysis reveals that in the first 400 ms post-stimulus, brain activity increases in the prefrontal and central brain areas for very intense stimulations, whereas for intense stimulation, high activity of the parietal area was observed post-500 ms. Based on these identified EEG patterns, we successfully classified the different thermal stimulations with an average test accuracy of 84% across all subjects. En route to understanding the underlying cortical activity, we source localized the EEG signal for each of the five thermal stimuli conditions. Our findings reveal that very intense stimuli were anticipated and induced early activation (before 400 ms) of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, activation of the pre-frontal cortex, somatosensory, central, and parietal areas, was observed in the first 400 ms post-stimulation for very intense conditions and starting 500 ms post-stimuli for intense conditions. Overall, despite the small sample size, this work presents novel findings and a first comprehensive approach to explore, analyze, and classify EEG-brain activity changes evoked by five different thermal stimuli, which could lead to a better understanding of thermal stimuli processing in the brain and could, therefore, pave the way for developing a real-time withdrawal reaction system when interacting with prosthetic limbs. We underpin this last point by benchmarking our EEG results with a demonstration of a real-time withdrawal reaction of a robotic prosthesis using a human-like artificial skin.</jats:p>"

Here, we systematically investigate photoluminescence properties of all-inorganic perovskite microcavity at room temperature and discuss the excited state and the light–matter coupling regime depending on excitation density. Angle-resolved photoluminescence clearly exhibits that the microcavity system shows a transition from weak coupling regime to strong coupling regime, revealing the increase in correlated electron–hole pairs. With pumping fluence above the threshold, the photoluminescence signal shows a lasing behavior with bosonic condensation characteristics, accompanied by long-range phase coherence. The excitation density required for the lasing behavior, however, is found to exceed the Mott density, excluding the exciton as the excited state. These results demonstrate that the polaritonic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer state originates the strong coupling formation and the lasing behavior.</jats:p>"

However, our perception of stimuli is shaped by both stimulus-induced and top-down processes, and it is unclear whether and how reconstructions reflect top-down aspects of perception. Here, we investigate the effect of attention on reconstructions using fMRI activity measured while subjects attend to one of two superimposed images. A state-of-the-art method is used for image reconstruction, in which brain activity is translated (decoded) to deep neural network (DNN) features of hierarchical layers then to an image. Reconstructions resemble the attended rather than unattended images. They can be modeled by superimposed images with biased contrasts, comparable to the appearance during attention. Attentional modulations are found in a broad range of hierarchical visual representations and mirror the brain–DNN correspondence. Our results demonstrate that top-down attention counters stimulus-induced responses, modulating neural representations to render reconstructions in accordance with subjective appearance.</jats:p>"

Herein, we report the transcriptome analysis of gastric cancer single-CTCs. We utilized an antigen-independent strategy for CTC isolation from metastatic gastric cancer patients involving a size-dependent recovery of CTCs and a single cell isolation technique. The transcriptomic profile of single-CTCs revealed that a majority of gastric CTCs had undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and indicated the contribution of platelet adhesion toward EMT progression and acquisition of chemoresistance. Taken together, this study serves to employ CTC characterization to elucidate the mechanisms of chemoresistance and metastasis in gastric cancer.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, the production of these highly desirable biomaterials remains a challenge in modern macromolecular chemistry. The main reason for that is the low polymerizability of ionic glycomonomers originated from their steric congestion and the occurrence of ionic interactions that generally negatively influence the polymerization progress and hinder controllable reaction pathway. In this work, the new ionic sugar monomer was (co)polymerized for the first time via Activator Generated by Electron Transfer Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (AGET ATRP) using a three-arm resveratrol-based core to obtain star-like (co)polymers. The obtained products were examined in terms of their physicochemical properties and morphology. Aside from the synthesis of these new glycopolymers, also a thorough description of their thermal properties, ability to self-assembly, the formation of stable superstructures was studied in detail. It was found that examined (co)polymers did not show any heterogeneities and phase separation, while their variation of glass transition temperature (T<jats:sub>g</jats:sub>) was strictly related to the change in the number of glycomonomer. Also, the stability and shapes of formed superstructures strictly depend on their composition and topology. Finally, we have shown that synthesized carbohydrate-based polymers revealed high antiproliferative activity against several cancer cell lines (i.e., breast, colon, glioma, and lung cancer). The cytotoxic activity was particularly observed for star-shaped polymers that were systematically enhanced with the growing concentration of amine moieties and molecular weight. The results presented herein suggest that synthesized star-shaped glyco(co)polymers are promising as drug or gene carriers in anticancer therapies or anti-tumor agents, depending on their cytotoxicity.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

Although physical powder dusting methods have been frequently employed to develop latent fingerprints and most of them are carried out by using single component powders of micron‐sized fluorescent particles, magnetic powders, or metal particles, there is still an enormous challenge in producing high‐resolution image of latent fingerprints at different backgrounds or substrates. Herein, a novel and effective nanoimpregnation method is developed to synthesize bifunctional magnetic fluorescent mesoporous microspheres for latent fingerprints visualization by growth of mesoporous silica (mesoSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) on magical Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> core and then deposition of fluorescent YVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>:Eu<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup> nanoparticles in the mesopores.

This paper proposes an accurate core point localization method based on spatial domain features of fingerprint images from a completely different viewpoint to improve the fingerprint core point displacement problem of singular point detection. The method first defines new fingerprint features, called furcation and confluence, to represent specific ridge/valley distribution in a core point area, and uses them to extract the innermost Curve of ridges. The summit of this Curve is regarded as the localization result. Furthermore, an approach for removing false Furcation and Confluence based on their correlations is developed to enhance the method robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory core localization accuracy in a large number of samples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) hydrolyze almost all β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems; however, no effective inhibitors are currently clinically available. MBLs are classified into three subclasses: B1, B2, and B3. Although the amino acid sequences of MBLs are varied, their overall scaffold is well conserved. In this study, we systematically studied the primary sequences and crystal structures of all subclasses of MBLs, especially the core scaffold, the zinc-coordinating residues in the active site, and the substrate-binding pocket. We presented the conserved structural features of MBLs in the same subclass and the characteristics of MBLs of each subclass. The catalytic zinc ions are bound with four loops from the two central β-sheets in the conserved αβ/βα sandwich fold of MBLs. The three external loops cover the zinc site(s) from the outside and simultaneously form a substrate-binding pocket. In the overall structure, B1 and B2 MBLs are more closely related to each other than they are to B3 MBLs. However, B1 and B3 MBLs have two zinc ions in the active site, while B2 MBLs have one. The substrate-binding pocket is different among all three subclasses, which is especially important for substrate specificity and drug resistance. Thus far, various classes of β-lactam antibiotics have been developed to have modified ring structures and substituted R groups. Currently available structures of β-lactam-bound MBLs show that the binding of β-lactams is well conserved according to the overall chemical structure in the substrate-binding pocket. Besides β-lactam substrates, B1 and cross-class MBL inhibitors also have distinguished differences in the chemical structure, which fit well to the substrate-binding pocket of MBLs within their inhibitory spectrum. The systematic structural comparison among B1, B2, and B3 MBLs provides in-depth insight into their substrate specificity, which will be useful for developing a clinical inhibitor targeting MBLs.</jats:p>"

Aqueous SWCNT inks containing amphiphilic surfactants are widely used for processing including coatings and composite fabrication. Most practical processes are, however, designed to be compatible with organic solvents, generating a technological mismatch between production and utilization. This work reports on the surfactant‐assisted dispersion of SWCNTs in useful organic solvents, at up to quantitative yields. A feature extraction based on machine learning offers seemingly important, highly intuitive physicochemical factors that lead to efficient dispersion. These elucidated factors are associated not only with solvents–surfactant, but also solvent–SWCNT interactions. The organic SWCNT dispersion as well as its research methodology developed here may find widespread applications ranging from nanofluidics to functional materials design.</jats:p>",

All of them are classified into the corresponding categories.

Many invaders demonstrate rapid evolution of behavioural traits involved in range expansion such as locomotor activity, exploration and risk‐taking. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin these changes are poorly understood. In 86 years, invasive cane toads (<jats:italic>Rhinella marina</jats:italic>) in Australia have drastically expanded their geographic range westward from coastal Queensland to Western Australia. During their range expansion, toads have undergone extensive phenotypic changes, particularly in behaviours that enhance the toads’ dispersal ability. Common‐garden experiments have shown that some changes in behavioural traits related to dispersal are heritable. At the molecular level, it is currently unknown whether these changes in dispersal‐related behaviour are underlain by small or large differences in gene expression, nor is known the biological function of genes showing differential expression. Here, we used RNA‐seq to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying dispersal‐related behavioural changes. We compared the brain transcriptomes of toads from the Hawai'ian source population, as well as three distinct populations from across the Australian invasive range. We found markedly different gene expression profiles between the source population and Australian toads. By contrast, toads from across the Australian invasive range had very similar transcriptomic profiles. Yet, key genes with functions putatively related to dispersal behaviour showed differential expression between populations located at each end of the invasive range. These genes could play an important role in the behavioural changes characteristic of range expansion in Australian cane toads.</jats:p>",

It can optionally combine short and long reads to increase assembly continuity and utilize sample-wise group-information for co-assembly and genome binning. The pipeline is easy to install-all dependencies are provided within containers-portable and reproducible. It is written in Nextflow and developed as part of the nf-core initiative for best-practice pipeline development.

To address the limitation of microscope time, methodologies to more efficiently collect data on a 200 keV Talos Arctica cryo-transmission electron microscope at speeds as fast as 720 movies per hour (∼17 000 per day) were tested. In this study, key parameters were explored to increase data collection speed including: (1) using the beam-image shift method to acquire multiple images per stage position, (2) employing UltrAufoil TEM grids with R0.6/1 hole spacing, (3) collecting hardware-binned data and (4) adjusting the image shift delay factor in <jats:italic>SerialEM</jats:italic>. Here, eight EM maps of mouse apoferritin at 1.8–1.9 Å resolution were obtained in the analysis with data collection times for each dataset ranging from 56 min to 2 h. An EM map of mouse apoferritin at 1.78 Å was obtained from an overnight data collection at a speed of 500 movies per hour and subgroup analysis performed, with no significant variation observed in data quality by image shift distance and image shift delay. The findings and operating procedures detailed herein allow for rapid turnover of single-particle cryo-EM structure determination.</jats:p>",

The waveguide consists of silica-based side claddings and an EO core for increasing the integral of the optical field and the overlap interaction between the optical field and the modulated electric field within the EO polymer. We discuss in detail the volume resistivity dependence of the efficiency of electric poling and modulation for various side-cladding materials.

The convergence of education and information technology produces not only new areas of knowledge, pedagogical tools and teaching methods but also large-scale transformations in social practice. Like any social change, the digitalisation of education has a variety of consequences - from positive to negative ones. It is shown that the digitalisation of education, which meets great hopes not only in Ukraine and Poland, can be productive only if an anthropocentric algorithm is dealt with. Along with the huge and not much-studied possibilities of digitalisation of education, it is proved that many problems and risks are associated with the total introduction of the “digital” in the educational system. These are social, psychological, health, organisational and methodological risks, and some problems with the reduced quality of education. However, the ethics-related risks are perhaps the most dangerous among them. As regards this, it is proved that the humane paradigm, as a paradigm of the integrity of knowledge that provides values and goals of education, is a guarantor of the harmonisation in many processes related to translating information and knowledge into a digital form. The humane paradigm is the basis of the genetic connection of knowledge, skills, digital literacy, moral imperatives, and life values, which in a synergetic algorithm contribute to students’ effective development, systematic thinking, and socialisation. The three most important blocks of educational problems in the discourse on modern cyber-socialisation (transformation of the worldview component of education, reconstruction of the content of education, imbalance of educational and didactic processes) are outlined, and the ways and mechanisms of solving them are suggested. Implementing integrated strategies within the humane paradigm (which is the nourishing source of each of these blocks) might result in the idea of the so-called “new humanism” in education.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The thermal conductivity of individual nanomaterials can vary from sample to sample due to the difference in geometries and internal structures, and thus, concurrent structure observation and thermal conductivity measurement at the nanoscale are highly desired but challenging. Here, we have developed an experimental method that allows concurrently the in situ thermal conductivity measurement and the real-time internal structure observation of a single one-dimensional (1D) material using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in a scanning electron microscope. In this method, the two ends of the 1D nanomaterial are bonded on a tungsten probe and a suspended platinum nanofilm, respectively. The platinum nanofilm serves simultaneously as a heater and a resistance thermometer, ensuring highly sensitive thermal measurements. The platinum nanofilm is fabricated on the edge of the silicon wafer so that the electron beam can transmit through the 1D material and be detected by the STEM detector, which caters for real-time observation of the inner nanostructure. Using this method, we in situ measured the thermal conductivities of two cup-stacked carbon nanotubes and concurrently observed the internal hollow structures. We found that the sample with more structural disorders had a lower thermal conductivity. Our measurement method can pave the way to the sample-by-sample elucidation of the structure–property relationship for 1D materials.</jats:p>",

Specifically, it aimed at early marriage practices and its effect on their socio-economic and religious lives as Mulims. Using descriptive and inferential statistical analyses collected from among 195 research participants, this study found that the spiritual obligations of the participants were not significantly affected by the fact that they married early but the same cannot be concluded in the case of their socio-economic lives. One-sample T-Test result revealed that couples who married early earned significantly lower than the poverty threshold of the province. Regression analysis results revealed that only independent variable husband Islamic educational attainment was found to have a positive and statistically significant influence on the likelihood that they will finish their studies. This study concludes that as marriage is considered as the building block that makes or breaks civilizations, early marriage is shaking its structural integrity.</jats:p>"

The reconstructed temperature exhibits significant decadal variations, which were mainly driven by the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. Decadal temperature variation during the Little Ice Age (LIA) is significantly larger than that during the post‐industrial warming period, possibly due to such external forcing as large fluctuations of solar activity and frequent major volcanic eruptions during the LIA. In addition, our reconstruction shows that the recent warming since the 1980s is moderate, comparable to an earlier warm interval in the mid‐20th century, which may partly explain the relatively stable status of glaciers in this region since 1970s.</jats:p>",

The morphology, structure, phase composition, and magnetic properties of composite scaffolds were studied. Fabrication procedures of PHB/gelatin and PHB/gelatin/Fe3O4 scaffolds resulted in the formation of both core-shell and ribbon-shaped structure of the fibers. In case of hybrid PHB/gelatin/Fe3O4 scaffolds submicron-sized Fe3O4 particles were observed in the surface layers of the fibers. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results allowed the presence of gelatin on the fiber surface (N/C ratio–0.11) to be revealed. Incubation of the composite scaffolds in saline for 3 h decreased the amount of gelatin on the surface by more than ~75%. The differential scanning calorimetry results obtained for pure PHB scaffolds revealed a characteristic melting peak at 177.5 °C. The presence of gelatin in PHB/gelatin and PHB/gelatin/Fe3O4 scaffolds resulted in the decrease in melting temperature to 168–169 °C in comparison with pure PHB scaffolds due to the core-shell structure of the fibers. Hybrid scaffolds also demonstrated a decrease in crystallinity from 52.3% (PHB) to 16.9% (PHB/gelatin) and 9.2% (PHB/gelatin/Fe3O4). All the prepared scaffolds were non-toxic and saturation magnetization of the composite scaffolds with magnetite was 3.27 ± 0.22 emu/g, which makes them prospective candidates for usage in biomedical applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Realization of spiking neural network (SNN) hardware with high energy efficiency and high integration may provide a promising solution to data processing challenges in future internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, design of multi-core reconfigurable SNN chip based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is drawing great attention, owing to the unique properties of RRAM, e.g., high integration density, low power consumption, and processing-in-memory (PIM). Therefore, RRAM-based SNN chip may have further improvements in integration and energy efficiency. The design of such a chip will face the following problems: significant delay in pulse transmission due to complex logic control and inter-core communication; high risk of digital, analog, and RRAM hybrid design; and non-ideal characteristics of analog circuit and RRAM. In order to effectively bridge the gap between device, circuit, algorithm, and architecture, this paper proposes a simulation model—FangTianSim, which covers analog neuron circuit, RRAM model and multi-core architecture and its accuracy is at the clock level. This model can be used to verify the functionalities, delay, and power consumption of SNN chip. This information cannot only be used to verify the rationality of the architecture but also guide the chip design. In order to map different network topologies on the chip, SNN representation format, interpreter, and instruction generator are designed. Finally, the function of FangTianSim is verified on liquid state machine (LSM), fully connected neural network (FCNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN).</jats:p>"

Despite their numerous advantages, the use of optical fibers with high power signals can result in their permanent damage. In recent years, researchers have been studying this undesirable effect in order to develop optical fiber sensors for temperature and strain, but without fully understanding the fused material characteristics. Herein, the fused material in the POF is exhaustively studied by performing material and magnetic characterizations. The thorough material characterization allows to conclude that the fused fiber core is actually a fluorinated graphene oxide. Consequently, the POF fuse is revealed as an extremely easy and straightforward method to fabricate this material. It is also found that the fuse effect in POFs increases the magnetic susceptibility by almost 10 times, presenting a similar behavior to those of other fluorographene materials. Finally, a magnetic field sensor using the fused POF is developed, and a maximum sensitivity of 4.66 pm Oe<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (for the range of 0–400 Oe) is obtained, which is one of the top records among the previous literature.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FT-IR, and XRD were also used to characterize FG@PI particles. The PI intermediate layer increases interaction between particles and films, which is very beneficial for increasing dielectric constant and inhibiting dielectric loss of pI/FG@PI composite. The experimental result shows that the pI/FG@PI composite film with 50wt% filler loading exhibits a high dielectric constant of 83.5 (about 24 times that of pure PI) and low dielectric loss of 0.11 at 1 MHz.

The models are\n   obtained with the MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics)\n   numerical code. The evolution is followed from a double O-type star, through\n   Case A and Case mass transfer, to the formation of a carbon-oxygen (CO)\n   core in the primary. The evolution of the secondary star in each binary\n   system is further modeled with the same numerical code in an approximation\n   of a single star, also to the formation of a carbon-oxygen core. The\n   resulting helium core masses are in the range of 7.94M? - 13.19M? and\n   12.30M? and 19.12M? for primary and secondary stars, respectively. The\n   carbon-oxygen core masses are between 5.26M? and 10M? for primaries and\n   between 8.96M? and 15.32M? for secondaries. A clear influence of the initial\n   orbital period on the resulting helium and CO core masses is demonstrated:\n   primary stars in binary systems with initial orbital periods of 3, 4 and 5\n   days have on average about 15%, 8% and 2.5% smaller CO cores than single\n   stars with the same initial masses. On the other hand, it was found that the\n   correlation between the CO and helium core mass does not depend on the\n   initial orbital period and can be approximated with the same linear fit for\n   all binary systems. The CO/helium core mass ratio is found to be larger in\n   binary systems than for single stars. It is also shown that the black hole\n   formation limit for primary stars depends on the initial orbit and is\n   between 33M? - 34M?, 32M? - 33M? and 30M? - 31M?, for the initial orbital\n   periods of 3, 4 and 5 days, respectively. The resulting double compact\n   objects are of two types: mixed neutron star - black hole systems (6 models)\n   and double black holes (27 models). The resulting black hole masses are\n   estimated to be in the range of 5M? to 17M?.</jats:p>"

Data were extracted from the diarrheal disease surveillance system (DDSS) of Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) from January 2001 to December 2020. Among children under five in DDSS, cholera positive (culture confirmed) malnourished children (WAZ, WL/HZ or L/HAZ ˂ −2) were considered as cases (n = 920) and children with cholera but non-malnourished (WAZ, WL/HZ or L/HAZ ≥−2.00 to ≤+2.00) were controls (n = 586). After adjusting for potential confounders such as maternal illiteracy, day labor fathers, maternal employment, slum dwelling, non-sanitary latrine use, use of untreated water, and history of cough, it was revealed that malnourished cholera children significantly more often presented in hospital during evening hours (6 p.m. to 12 mid-night) (p &lt; 0.05), had illiterate fathers (p &lt; 0.05), &gt;24 h history of diarrheal duration (p &lt; 0.05), dehydrating diarrhea (p &lt; 0.05), and had longer hospitalization (p &lt; 0.05).

For this aim, three distinct waveguides were developed. Each of them is based on a cylindrical sapphire tube, either suspended in free space or coated by a polymer. The waveguides were first studied numerically, using the finite-difference eigenmode method, and experimentally, using the in-house THz pulsed spectrometer. The observed data uncovered the antiresonance regime of their operation, as well as their ability to guide broadband THz pulses over tens of centimeters with a high optical performance. The waveguides were then used to couple and guide (over the considerable distance) of THz radiation from the in-house two-color laser air plasma emitter, that exploits the mJ-energy-level femtosecond pulses of a Ti-sapphire laser. Small dispersion of a THz pulse and low-to-moderate propagation loss in the developed waveguide were observed, along with a considerable narrowing of the THz radiation angular distribution after passing the waveguide. Our findings revealed that such technologically-reliable hollow-core sapphire waveguides can boost the performance of laser air plasma-based THz emitters and make them more suitable for applications in the vigorously-explored THz sensing and exposure technologies.</jats:p>",

The adsorption capacity of FSA-MIPs is 34.7 mg·g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 308 K, which is significantly higher than magnetic non-imprinted polymers profiting from the imprinting effect. The FSA-MIPs have a short equilibrium (20 min) and could be reused more than six times. Moreover, the selectivity coefficients of FSA-MIPs for 4-MMC, 3,4-dimethylmethcathinone, butylone, 4-ethylmethcathinone, acetylfentanyl, and methylene blue are 4.01, 5.65, 7.62, 12.30, and 20.87 respectively, further indicating the markedly enhanced binding selectivity of FSA-MIPs. As an adsorbent, the FSA-MIPs were successfully applied for effective extraction of 4-MMC in three human urine samples with the recovery rates ranging from 85.5–92.6%.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, there is a tendency to increase the depth of gaseous and liquid fossils  extraction. Therefore, prospecting and developing new deposits is promising. There is also a need to  create  new  freshwater  sources  and  implement  relevant  geological  work  based  on  this  need.  It  is  essential to have information about the characteristics of the explored slabs and the geology of the  fields in general. Implementation of engineering and geological core drilling exploration is the most  acceptable and provides the necessary data. Here, the peculiarities of the technological schemes of  the process implementation make it possible to obtain separate sections of structures at a depth of the  drilling  equipment.  It  is  essential  to  use  traditional  equipment,  recommended  for  decades  and  provides the necessary results [1–3]. In the drilling process, you can achieve different diameters and  depths of wells execution, obtain fossil samples etc. Engineering and geological exploration drilling  is now taking on increased use in various industries [3]. Therefore, the problem of providing high- quality drilling tools, the stability of their operating characteristics, and the possibility of usage in  different conditions is an urgent need today.  Modern  drilling  problems  determine  the  usage  of  components  of  the  core  set  with  the  appropriate  physical  and  mechanical  characteristics.  Especially  it  relates  to  elements  close  to  the  drilling  tool  and  the  place  of  fossil;  destruction  –  drill  pipe.  It  is  installed  immediately  after  the  crown core drill and receives almost the same loads and effects during working [1–3].  Conditions for the implementation of the process of core drilling are characterized primarily  by  the  effect  on  the  elements  of  the  significant  axial  and  twisted  core  set  forces.  There  is  the  influence of the corrosive and active environment of the fossil in the washing and lubricating liquids  well, etc. High temperatures are also observed at the drilling sites [3], which negatively affect the  working tool and speed up its operation.  As a result, there is an intensive shock, and abrasive core pipe wear and operation indicators  change  their  constructive  size.  As  a  result,  it  is  necessary  to  replace  the  operated  drill  string  periodically. Considering modern technical and economic factors, it may be decided to repair a pipe  to its original size in many cases. There are tasks for providing the appropriate characteristics of the  core pipe surface. It is possible to model such properties of the new surface that functionally the best  meet the conditions of the drilling process of a given geological formation.  The  peculiarities  of  applying  the  therapeutic  layer  on  the  surface  of  the  core  pipe  are  investigated in work. The experience shows that using electric arc surfacing under the flux layer is  expedient.  This  provides  the  necessary  adhesion  of  the  applied  layer  and  promotes  obtaining resistance to the operation surface of the core pipe. At the same time, there is high-quality protection  and the possibility of additional alloying through the flux-slaggy welding bath.  Using electrode powder type wires creates conditions for flexibility to achieve the established  characteristics  of  functional  layers  [4–6].  The  filling  flux,  located  in  the  cross-section  of  the  electrode wire, can be easily changed by chemical composition. At the same time, it is possible to  make relatively small parties of a wire with the set characteristics.  The technological scheme justification about the core pipe surfacing is performed. It provides  the previous displacement of the electrode butt size from the zenith of the core pipe to prevent the  welding bath from spreading. The structural pipe size , the requirements for residual deformations,  and the conditions of shapping the welded layer show the practicality of welding on a helix.</jats:p>"

We here performed a phase Ia clinical trial of intratumoral GEN0101 administration in six patients with stage IIIC or IV malignant melanoma. The primary aim was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GEN0101, and the secondary aim was to examine the objective tumor response. Patients were separated into two groups (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 3 each) and received a low dose of 30,000 and high dose of 60,000 mNAU of GEN0101. All patients completed a two-week follow-up evaluation without severe adverse events. The overall response rate was 33% (2 of 6), with 2 partial responses in the high-dose group and 2 with stable disease, and 2 with progressive disease in the low-dose group. Local complete or partial responses were observed in 11 of 18 (61%) target lesions. One patient demonstrated shrinkage of lung metastases after the treatment. The activity of NK cells and interferon-γ levels were increased in the circulation, indicating augmentation of antitumor immunity by GEN0101. This trial showed not only the safety and tolerability but also the significant antitumor effect of GEN0101, suggesting that GEN0101 might be a promising new drug for patients with advanced melanoma.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, we construct a powerful model based on the graph network to determine the long-term evolution of the self-driven collective system from the initial position of the particles, without any manual features.

Cultivar identification based on the distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) test is a prerequisite for new cultivar registration. However, DUS testing based on morphological features is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, and can also be influenced by environmental factors. Thus, molecular markers have also been used for the identification of genetic diversity as an effective, accurate, and stable method. Currently, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using next-generation sequencing technology are commonly applied in genetic research on diverse plant species. This study aimed to establish an effective and high-throughput cultivar identification system for lettuce using core sets of SNP markers developed by genotyping by sequencing (GBS). GBS identified 17 877 high-quality SNPs for 90 commercial lettuce cultivars. Genetic differentiation analyses based on the selected SNPs classified the lettuce cultivars into three main groups. Core sets of 192, 96, 48, and 24 markers were further selected and validated using the Fluidigm platform. Phylogenetic analyses based on all core sets of SNPs successfully discriminated individual cultivars that have been currently recognized. These core sets of SNP markers will support the construction of a DNA database of lettuce that can be useful for cultivar identification and purity testing, as well as DUS testing in the plant variety protection system. Additionally, this work will facilitate genetic research to improve breeding in lettuce.</jats:p>",

An overview of specific areas of social activity of the state is given. Special attention is paid to the constitutional duty of the State to protect motherhood, fatherhood and childhood. The article analyzes social payments and other measures to provide material assistance to large families, low-income families, single parents with children, and young families, including regular and one-time benefits and compensation payments, as well as the provision of in-kind benefits. The experience of supporting families with children during the COVID-19 pandemic is considered. The introduction of maternity capital is recognized as the most effective and significant measure in terms of strengthening the property status of families with children. The legislation of the subjects of the Russian Federation in the field of social security of families with children is subjected to a special analysis. It is established that the degree of material security of recipients depends on the socio-economic situation of a particular subject of the Russian Federation. The article substantiates the need to create effective guarantees of the rights of families with children at the federal level on the basis of the highest amount of social benefits provided for by regional legislation. It is concluded that measures for state support of families with children, aimed at stabilizing the demographic situation and overcoming social inequality throughout the country, can be considered as the most important fundamental element of the social function of the state.</jats:p>"

The EFMF, which adopts pure silica elliptical core with a step refractive index profile and trench refractive index, can be used in MIMO-FREE operation. The result using a full-vector finite element method shows that the proposed EFMF breaks the mode degeneracy and achieves modes maintaining function. The EFMF performs five non-degenerate modes operations with the modes LP01, LP11a, LP11b, LP21b, and LP21a for the MIMO-FREE applications. The mode crosstalk of the EFMF is effectively reduced using the optimized ellipticity and the large effective refractive index difference between the modes. If the data rate or capacity is conventionally set to a multiple of 2, the transmission system can be upgraded using the EFMF with four modes operations where the effective refractive index difference between any two modes is more than 2 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. A pure silica core is employed to effectively reduce intrinsic loss. The low bending loss is realized by using the trench refractive index at the cladding. The EFMF can be applied to the good transmission of mode division multiplexing in MIMO-FREE applications while eliminating the difficulty and complexity of the MIMO digital signal processing.</jats:p>"

In the mechanical design, a small piezo-stack is supported at its bottom four vertices on a cone-like hollow, allowing the resonance frequency of the Z-scanner to remain as high as that of the piezo in free vibration. Its maximum displacement, ∼190 nm at 50 V, is large enough for imaging bio-molecules. For imaging bio-molecules in a buffer solution, the upper half of the Z-scanner is wrapped in a thin film resistant to water and chemicals, providing an excellent waterproof and mechanical durability without lowering the resonance frequency. We demonstrate that this Z-scanner can observe actin filaments, fragile biological polymers, for more than five times longer than the conventional Z-scanner at a tip velocity of 800 µm/s.</jats:p>",

Through the oblique loading test (biaxial loading test) on one 1/6 scale steel‐enhanced damping concrete core wall with steel plate bracings, the failure patterns, the load‐bearing capacities, the yield mechanisms, and the strain distributions, etc. were investigated. Comparisons were made with the available test results of the authors’ previously unidirectional tested core walls and the tests completed by other scholars. The oblique tested core walls exhibited lower initial stiffness, but higher yield displacements, loading capacities, and ultimate displacements. A much more serious damage was also found in the wall limbs of oblique tested core walls by comparing with the unidirectional test core walls. Then finite element analysis (FEA) was also carried out to study the axial compression ratio (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>), coupling beam span‐depth ratio (<jats:italic>l</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>h</jats:italic>) on the stress distributions, and effective width of the end wall limbs (<jats:italic>b</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e</jats:italic></jats:sub>).

The energy range of the quantum states to be observed with this scheme has now reached more than 20 eV by resolving the interference fringes with a period of a few hundred attoseconds. This attosecond Ramsey-type interferometry requires the irradiation of a coherent pair of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses, while all the methods used to deliver the coherent XUV pulse pair until now have relied on the division of the source of an XUV pulse in two before the generation. In this paper, we report on a novel technique to perform attosecond Ramsey-type interferometry by splitting an XUV high-order harmonic (HH) pulse of a sub-20 fs laser pulse after its generation. By virtue of the postgeneration splitting of the HH pulse, we demonstrated that the optical interference emerging at the complete temporal overlap of the HH pulse pair seamlessly continued to the Ramsey-type electronic interference in a helium atom. This technique is applicable for studying the femtosecond dephasing dynamics of electronic wavepackets and exploring the ultrafast evolution of a cationic system entangled with an ionized electron with sub-20 fs resolution.</jats:p>",

However, no continuous-wave (CW) fibre lasers beyond 4 μm based on rare-earth-doped fibres have been demonstrated thus far. Here, we report efficient mid-IR laser emission from HBr-filled silica hollow-core fibres (HCFs) for the first time. By pumping with a self-developed thulium-doped fibre amplifier seeded by several diode lasers over the range of 1940–1983 nm, narrow linewidth mid-IR emission from 3810 to 4496 nm has been achieved with a maximum laser power of about 500 mW and a slope efficiency of approximately 18%. To the best of our knowledge, the wavelength of 4496 nm with strong absorption in silica-based fibres is the longest emission wavelength from a CW fibre laser, and the span of 686 nm is also the largest tuning range achieved to date for any CW fibre laser. By further reducing the HCF transmission loss, increasing the pump power, improving the coupling efficiency, and optimizing the fibre length together with the pressure, the laser efficiency and output power are expected to increase significantly. This work opens new opportunities for broadly tunable high-power mid-IR fibre lasers, especially beyond 4 μm.</jats:p>"

Herein, a typical core‐shell structured mesoporous silica‐coated silica (SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) construction was successfully synthesized by using a bi‐phase method. The SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> filled polyethylene (PE) nanocomposite was fabricated through a precisely controlled melt‐mixing approach. Benefiting from the additional mesoporous SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> shell, both the dispersion of SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and the SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐PE matrix interfacial interaction are improved. Moreover, the stress–strain behavior, temperature‐dependent mechanical property, thermal stability, and electrical insulating property of SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/PE composite were studied in detail. It is found that SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> core‐shell nanoparticles are capable of not only making a balance between the strength and toughness of the PE‐based composite, but also improving the thermal stability of the composite. In addition, the SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/PE composite exhibited an enhanced breakdown strength (256.4 MV·m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) when filled with as small as 1 wt% SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@mSiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, which is 108% higher than neat PE. All these optimized features are attributed to the well‐designed core‐shell structure. These experimental results provide a promising way to design and fabricate future advanced composite with excellent structural and functional properties in the future.</jats:p>",

The prepared monometallics, composite, and core‐shell NPs structures were confirmed from the XRD, TEM, and EDX analyses, followed by the FE‐SEM and UV absorptions. Optically, the NPs exhibited an increase in the energy gap from 3.27 eV to 3.75 eV as LASER fluence increased from 30 mJ/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> to 60 mJ/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. The average NPs core size distributions for the core‐shell material ranged at ∼70 nm with the shell thickness around 20 nm. The biggest NPs were of ∼170 nm size which were sparsely distributed. The magnetization behaviors of the NPs were also investigated using the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The NPs showed antimicrobial activities against the pathogenic species: <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>. The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized NPs, synthesized under the influence of magnetic fields, were found to be more potent than the NPs synthesized without the presence of any magnetic field. The NPs prepared under the influence of the magnetic fields also comparatively exhibited higher levels of cytotoxicity against lung cancer cell lines (A549) than the NPs prepared under no magnetic field’s influence by the similar energy level effects of the LASER fluence. The flow cytometry analyses confirmed the NPs’ cytotoxic impacts against the human lung cancer A549 cell lines through the initiation of apoptosis and promotion of the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase of cell division. To further confirm the cytotoxic effects and the mechanism of the anticancer activity of the synthesized NPs against the A549 cell lines, several related parameters (cell viability, membrane permeability, nuclear intensity, and cytochrome‐C release) were analyzed using the high‐content screening (HCS) assay. The study suggested that the prepared NPs have potential as antimicrobial and also as anti‐lung‐cancer agents as tested <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. These NPs can also be part of combined chemotherapy in different oncological interventions, as well as a sonosensitizer in sonomagnetic heating‐based therapy, especially for cancers.</jats:p>",

To address this knowledge gap, we focus on the textural and minero-chemical characteristics of metal-rich magmatic sulfides hosted in amphibole-olivine-pyroxene cumulates in the lowermost crust. We show that in cumulates that were subject to increasing temperature due to prolonged mafic magmatism, which only occurs episodically during the complex evolution of any magmatic arc, Cu-Au-rich sulfide can exist as liquid while Ni-Fe rich sulfide occurs as a solid phase. This scenario occurs within a ‘Goldilocks’ temperature zone at ~1100–1200 °C, typical of the base of the crust in arcs, which permits episodic fractionation and mobilisation of Cu-Au-rich sulfide liquid into permeable melt networks that may ascend through the lithosphere providing metals for porphyry and epithermal ore deposits.</jats:p>"

The polarity and magnitude of magnetoresistance of the (Ga,Fe)Sb/GaSb/(In,Fe)Sb junctions strongly depend on the GaSb spacer thickness (t). Large positive magnetoresistance (MR, 58%) and negative MR (−1.6%) were observed at 3.7 K for the samples with t = 2 and 4 nm, respectively. When the n-type (In,Fe)Sb layer was replaced by the n-type (In,Fe)As, giant MR over 500% was observed, which can be explained by spin-valve and spin-splitting effects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The information on the peculiarities of the manifestations of potentially dangerous thermohydraulic anomalies, that occur unpredictably during the operation of the WWER reactor core, is generalized. Considerable attention is paid to the threat of uncontrolled occurrence of latent pre-emergency and emergency operating states in fuel assemblies during the generation of the vapor phase on the surface of fuel elements, including the heat transfer crisis with subsequent boiling of the coolant. It is noted that under these conditions, heat transfer, which should occur exclusively in the convective mode, is also characterized by the uncontrolled occurrence of the boiling process, from the activation of the first centers of vaporization to the formation of a developed bubble structure of the coolant. The limited possibilities of modern technical means of monitoring the technical condition of WWER, which do not provide detection of these anomalies and preemergency heat transfer regimes, are considered. Given the data on neutron flux fluctuations, it is shown that the noise components at the output of standard electron emission neutron flux meters carry important diagnostic information on thermohydraulic processes in the volume of the core, which is currently lost. With this in mind, it is concluded that it is necessary to immediately develop a methodology for the operational identification of random spectral realizations of neutron noise, which is registered at the outputs of neutron detectors of existing in-reactor control systems. The nature of the necessary reliable data on the spectral structure of the main types of diagnostic images (signatures or patterns) of neutron noise, which is registered at the output of standard neutron flux detectors in accordance with the main types of thermohydraulic anomalies, is determined. The analysis of known data and performed with the participation of authors of reactor experiments on the basis of which it is proved that the spectral structure of auto- and coherent signal density at the output of standard neutron flux detectors contains comprehensive diagnostic information on the type and location of vapor-liquid structures of WWER reactor core. With this in mind, the information characteristics of individual spectral ranges of neutron noise are analyzed and conclusions are made about their direct correspondence to the characteristic thermohydraulic processes as objects of diagnostics.</jats:p>"

The amount of electroplated metal was systematically controlled by varying the electroplating time. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the four different metals (shells) were successfully electroplated on the AgNWs (core), and the nanosize-controlled electroplating process produced metal NWs with varying diameters, conductivities, optical transmittances, and WFs. The metal-electroplated AgNWs were successfully employed as the anode electrodes of the OLEDs.

Traditional methods to improve ion conduction was structure doping to develop electrolyte materials. In this work, the ionic conductor Ce<jats:sub>0.8</jats:sub>Sm<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2‐δ</jats:sub> (SDC) was modified by insulator Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> to enhance ion conduction and apply as electrolytes for the SOFC. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization clearly clarified that a thin Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> layer in the amorphous state coated on SDC to form the SDC@Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> core−shell structure. The SDC@Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> electrolyte with the core−shell structure possesses a super ionic conductivity of 0.096 S cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and results in advanced cell performance of 1190 mW cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> at 550°C. The X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the SDC@Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> core–shell structure significantly improved in comparison with pure SDC, the newly produced oxygen vacancies can promote the oxygen ion transport. Moreover, the interface between SDC and Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> provides a fast channel for the proton transport. In addition, the SDC‐based SOFC was usually suffered from the reduction of the SDC electrolyte and the accompanying generated electron conduction should deteriorate the cell performance, this is the main challenge for the SDC electrolyte application. In our case, the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> shell on the SDC surface not only can avoid the contact between SDC and hydrogen to eliminate the reduction of SDC but also can restrain electron conduction due to the electron insulation characteristic of the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> shell. This work demonstrates an efficient approach to develop the advanced low‐temperature SOFC technology from material fundamentals.</jats:p>",

The coupled configurations, including the diamond-silver (bare) and diamond-silver-diamond (coated) nanoresonators’ geometry parameters as well as the emitters’ azimuthal orientation and distance from the metal, were numerically optimized. An objective function consisting of the total fluorescence enhancement multiplied by the corrected emission quantum efficiency was used to design nanoresonators that promote superradiance. A larger total fluorescence enhancement was achieved via a larger number of emitters in both geometries, in coated spherical and in bare ellipsoidal nanoresonators. The superradiance performance was better in the case of a smaller number of emitters in bare spherical and coated ellipsoidal nanoresonators and in the case of a larger number of emitters in coated spherical and bare ellipsoidal nanoresonators. Ellipsoidal geometry is advantageous independent of composition and seeding. The configurations optimal for non-cooperative fluorescence enhancement and superradiance are coincidental. A radiative rate enhancement proportional to the number of emitters was found in wide spectral regions; therefore, superradiance implies N-fold enhancements coexist at excitation and emission. In ellipsoidal nanoresonators, the better superradiance achieved via a smaller quality-factor is accompanied by larger frequency pulling.</jats:p>"

On one side of the plane, the gold film is deposited for RI measurement, and on the other side, the gold film and polydimethylsiloxane are deposited for temperature measurement. We analyzed its sensing characteristics by using the finite element method. The numerical results show that the two channels for measuring RI and temperature have no mutual interference and the arrangement reduces the complexity of the sensing measurement. The maximum spectral sensitivity of the sensor is 20 000 nm/RIU and 9.2 nm °C<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, when the liquid RI is in the range of 1.36–1.42 and the temperature is in the range of 0 °C–50 °C. The results also show the sensing accuracy was not very sensitive to the change of structural parameters, which makes the sensor very easy to fabricate. Our work is very helpful for implementation of a high sensitivity, easy fabrication and real-time multi-parameter surface plasmon resonance sensor.</jats:p>",

However, extrapulmonary pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-COVID sequelae remain to be understood. Here, we show, using a hamster model, that the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an acute inflammatory response and lung pathologies, while the late phase of infection causes cardiovascular complications (CVCs) characterized by ventricular wall thickening associated with increased ventricular mass/body mass ratio and interstitial coronary fibrosis. Molecular profiling further substantiated our findings of CVC as SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters showed elevated levels of serum cardiac troponin I, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and long-chain fatty acid triglycerides. Serum metabolomics profiling of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters identified N-acetylneuraminate, a functional metabolite found to be associated with CVC, as a metabolic marker was found to be common between SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. Together, we propose hamsters as a suitable animal model to study post-COVID sequelae associated with CVC, which could be extended to therapeutic interventions.</jats:p>"

However, this task proves sometimes to be very challenging, especially in the laparoscopic setting when the tumors are small, have a soft texture, and do not invade the serosa. In this view, our research team has developed a new instrument adapted to minimally-invasive surgery, and manipulated solely by the operating surgeon which has the potential to locate precisely tumors of the digestive tract. It consists of an inductive proximity sensor and an electronic block encapsulated into an autoclavable stainless-steel cage that works in tandem with an endoscopic hemostatic clip whose structure was modified to increase detectability. By scanning the serosal side of the colon or stomach, the instrument is capable to accurately pinpoint the location of the clip placed previously during diagnostic endoscopy on the normal bowel mucosa, adjacent to the tumor. In the current in-vivo experiments performed on large animals, the modified clips were transported without difficulties to the point of interest and attached to the mucosa of the bowel. Using a laparoscopic approach, the detection rate of this system reached 65% when the sensor scanned the bowel at a speed of 0.3 cm/s, and applying slight pressure on the serosa. This value increased to 95% when the sensor was guided directly on the point of clip attachment. The detection rate dropped sharply when the scanning speed exceeded 1 cm/s and when the sensor-clip distance exceeded the cut-off value of 3 mm. In conclusion, the proposed detection system demonstrated its potential to offer a swift and convenient solution for the digestive laparoscopic surgeons, however its detection range still needs to be improved to render it useful for the clinical setting.</jats:p>"

Impact of transition from face-to-face to online based education on students’ learning needs to be studied. This research aims to compare the continuous assessment performance of students in both gmeet-based online and traditional offline classroom methods. Data required for this study was obtained from an academic institution (TCE-Madurai). Three core courses namely Database Management System (IV semester), Web Programming (V semester), and Theory of Computation (III semester) in the Department of Information Technology for both online (2018-2022 batch and 2019-2023 batch) and offline (2017-2021 batch) approach has been compared while considering the same cohort. Each course is designed with Course Outcomes (COs). We did Extrapolative analysis, Descriptive analysis, Correlation analysis, Regression analysis, ANOVA, and MANOVA analysis to find the relationship between internal assessments and terminal examination. The dataset has been collected from 337 students’ from the 2018-22 batch and 134 students from 2017-21 batch in the B.Tech program. Internal assessment includes three continuous assessment tests (CATs) and three assignments marks mapped with respect to corresponding COs. Terminal exam marks were also considered in the study. The dataset contains various features like scores of individual students in both internal assessments and terminal exams. Regression analysis helped to derive the relationship between final exam score which includes a specific course, a specific student, and a specific mode of delivery - Online / Offline. It explained the relationship between final exam score and internal assessment marks. It is observed that the students in online mode had significantly higher scores for the majority of the CourseOutcomes, mainly at the Knowledge level. It is difficult to measure certain areas like students’ skills and attitude level such as students’ peer Engagement, Human Interaction, Communication/Preparation, Critical thinking, and Team skills in online mode.

In this work, a series of NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core-shell (CS) microcrystals doped with different ion concentrations is constructed by using the epitaxial growth technology. The structure and morphology for each of the prepared microcrystals are characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental results show that the prepared CS structures each have a pure hexagonal-phase crystal structure, and exhibit a disk-like shape. Under the excitation of 980 nm laser, the energy transfer characteristics of doped ions in single CS microcrystal are carefully studied by using a confocal microscope spectroscopy test system and changing the excitation position. The study shows that the ions doped in different regions of the CS microdisks exhibit different spectral characteristics when the excitation position is changed, which is mainly due to the different directions of excitation energy transfer in the CS structure. Based on the emission spectra of different positions and power variation spectra, it is proved that the excitation energy of the micron CS is mainly transmitted from outside to inside. Meanwhile, the colorful emission pattern of the CS microdisk is revealed by the corresponding optical waveguide model, which is mainly due to the optical waveguide effect. Therefore, by constructing different micron core-shell structures, the luminescence characteristics of microcrystals can be controlled and adjusted, which can provide important experimental reference for the applications of microcrystals in optoelectronic devices, optical coding and multicolor display.</jats:p>"

Serum and aqueous humor (AH) samples of 75 patients with idiopathic uveitis were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay. Infectious controls consisted of 16 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis all confirmed by intraocular fluid analyses. Noninfectious controls consisted of 7 patients with Behçet disease related uveitis and 15 patients with sarcoidosis related uveitis. The control group consisted of AH and serum samples from 47 noninflammatory control patients with age-related cataract. In each sample, 27 immune mediators ± IL-21 and IL-23 were measured. In idiopathic uveitis, 13 of the 29 mediators, including most proinflammatory and vascular mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF-α and VEGF, were significantly elevated in the aqueous humor when compared to all controls. Moreover, IL-17, IP-10, and IL-21, were significantly elevated in the serum when compared to all controls. We clustered 4 subgroups of idiopathic uveitis using a statistical analysis of hierarchical unsupervised classification, characterized by the order of magnitude of concentrations of intraocular cytokines. The pathogenesis of idiopathic uveitis is characterized by the presence of predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factor with high expression levels as compared to other causes of uveitis. There are indications for obvious Th-1/ IL21-Th17 pathways but also IL9-Th9 and increased IFN-γ-inducing cytokine (IL12) and IFN-γ-inducible CXC chemokine (IP-10). The combined data suggest that immune mediator expression is different among idiopathic uveitis. This study suggests various clusters among the idiopathic uveitis group rather than one specific uveitis entity.</jats:p>"

We had developed a multi-point scanning two-photon excitation microscopy system using a spinning-disk confocal scanning unit. However, its severe color cross-talk has precluded multi-color simultaneous imaging. Therefore, in this study, we introduced a mechanical switching system to select either of two NIR laser light pulses and an image-splitting detection system for 3- or 4-color imaging. As a proof of concept, we performed multi-color fluorescent imaging of actively dividing human HeLa cells and tobacco BY-2 cells. We found that the proposed microscopy system enabled time-lapse multi-color 3D imaging of cell divisions while avoiding photodamage. Moreover, the application of a linear unmixing method to the 5D dataset enabled the precise separation of individual intracellular components in multi-color images. We thus demonstrated the versatility of our new microscopy system in capturing the dynamic processes of cellular components that could have multitudes of application.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Constructing core-shell structures can effectively reduce the surface quenching effect of luminescent materials, which becomes an effective method to enhance upconversion luminescence. In this work, a series of NaLnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaLnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Ln = Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) core-shell microcrystals is successfully synthesized based on epitaxial growth technology, thereby enhancing and regulating the upconversion emission of Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The results of the XRD and SEM indicate that the NaLnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaLnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core-shell microcrystal possesses a pure hexagonal-phase crystal structure with a rod-like shape. Meanwhile, it is found that the epitaxial growth direction of the micro-shell is not affected by the crystal characteristics in the core, but determined by the crystal characteristics of the shell. Under 980 nm near-infrared laser excitation, the upconversion luminescence properties of single microrods with different core-shell structures are investigated via a confocal microscope spectroscopy. It is found that in the NaLnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; micro-crystal, the coated NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inert shell can also effectively reduce the quenching effect on the surface of the micro-crystal for enhancing upconversion emission. When the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are introduced into NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or NaYbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active shell that is coated, the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the shell can effectively transfer excitation energy to Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the core through energy migration, and then establish new energy transfer channels, thereby realizing the Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion luminescence enhancement. For NaHoF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaYbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core-shell microrods, the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the shell can transfer more excitation energy to Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions at the adjacent interface for enhancing the overall luminescence intensity, and its higher red-green ratio is mainly due to the cross-relaxation process occurring between the Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions at high doping concentration of Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the NaHoF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core. Meanwhile, the luminescence process of the micron core-shell system is further confirmed based on the luminescence characteristics of different structures and the dynamic luminescence process. It can be seen that constructing different micron core-shell structures and introducing sensitizing ions, can not only effectively enhance the luminous intensity of the micron materials, but also adjust the output color. Therefore, this research is an important experimental reference for enhancing the luminous intensity of the micron system and the precise adjustment of luminescence, and can effectively expand the applications of micron crystals in the fields of displays, micron lasers and anti-counterfeiting.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Owing to the unique characteristics of the hollow core fiber(HCF), more and more researchers pay attention to its application. Because the mode field is mainly limited to the core region of the fiber, which results in low non-linearity, ultra-low group velocity dispersion, low temperature sensitivity, and high material damage threshold. Based on the above, the HCF possesses some attractive nonlinear applications such as in transmission of high-power laser beams, sensing, ultra-wide band low-loss transmission, pulse compression and super-continuum generation. Besides, the HCFs can be further divided into the transmitting band-gap photonic crystal fiber(PBG-PCF) and the hollow-core anti-resonant fiber(HC-ARF). Compared with the PBG-PCF, the latter has wide light guiding characteristics caused by leaking modes. According to the research in the recent year, the HC-ARF has gradually approached to the performance of the PBG-PCF in its transmission loss, showing that it has potential applications in communications, sensing, aerospace, high-power laser transmission and other fields in the future. In addition, the HC-ARF with the special light-guiding properties has also become the important photonic device in the fields of fiber filters, mode conversion, etc. In this paper, a hollow-core anti-resonance fiber is studied and its light transmission performance in the spectral range of 500–1500 nm is verified. The optical loss measured at 980 nm wavelength is about 0.32 dB/m. It is found that a 980 nm multi-mode laser beam can be converted into a single-mode one after transmitting through the hollow core fiber we designed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The number of pollen grains varies within and between species. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this quantitative trait, in contrast with the many studies available on cell differentiation in the stamen. Recently, the first gene responsible for pollen number variation, <jats:italic>REDUCED POLLEN NUMBER1</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>RDP1</jats:italic>), was isolated by genome-wide association studies of <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> and exhibited the signature of natural selection. This gene encodes a homolog of yeast Mrt4 (mRNA turnover4), which is an assembly factor of the large ribosomal subunit. However, no further data were available to link ribosome function to pollen development. Here, we characterized the <jats:italic>RDP1</jats:italic> gene using the standard <jats:italic>A. thaliana</jats:italic> accession Col-0. The frameshift mutant, <jats:italic>rdp1-3</jats:italic> generated by CRISPR/Cas9 revealed the pleiotropic effect of <jats:italic>RDP1</jats:italic> in flowering, thus demonstrating that this gene is required for a broad range of processes other than pollen development. We found that the natural Col-0 allele conferred a reduced pollen number against the Bor-4 allele, as assessed using the quantitative complementation test, which is more sensitive than transgenic experiments. Together with a historical recombination event in Col-0, which was identified by sequence alignment, these results suggest that the coding sequence of <jats:italic>RDP1</jats:italic> is the candidate region responsible for the natural phenotypic variation. To elucidate the biological processes in which <jats:italic>RDP1</jats:italic> is involved, we conducted a transcriptome analysis. We found that genes responsible for ribosomal large subunit assembly/biogenesis were enriched among the differentially regulated genes, which supported the hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis is disturbed in the <jats:italic>rdp1-3</jats:italic> mutant. Among the pollen-development genes, three key genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (<jats:italic>ABORTED MICROSPORES</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>AMS</jats:italic>), <jats:italic>bHLH010</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>bHLH089</jats:italic>), as well as direct downstream genes of <jats:italic>AMS</jats:italic>, were downregulated in the <jats:italic>rdp1-3</jats:italic> mutant. In summary, our results suggest a specialized function of ribosomes in pollen development through <jats:italic>RDP1</jats:italic>, which harbors natural variants under selection.</jats:p>"

Implementation scientists distinguish an intervention’s essential components (thought to cause clinical change) and adaptable periphery (recommended, but not necessary). While implementing core components with fidelity may be essential for effectiveness, requiring fidelity to the adaptable periphery may stifle innovation critical for personalizing care and achieving successful community implementation. No systematic method exists for defining essential components a priori. We present the CORE (COmponents &amp; Rationales for Effectiveness) Fidelity Method—a novel method for defining key components of evidence-based interventions—and apply it to a case example of reciprocal imitation teaching, a parent-implemented social communication intervention. The CORE Fidelity Method involves three steps: (1) gathering information from published and unpublished materials; (2) synthesizing information, including empirical and hypothesized causal explanations of component effectiveness; and (3) drafting a CORE model and ensuring its ongoing use in implementation efforts. Benefits of this method include: (1) ensuring alignment between intervention and fidelity materials; (2) clarifying the scope of the adaptable periphery to optimize implementation; and (3) hypothesizing—and later, empirically validating—the intervention’s active ingredients and their associated mechanisms of change. </jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Lay abstract</jats:title><jats:p> Interventions that support social communication include several “components,” or parts (e.g. strategies for working with children and families, targeting specific skills). Some of these components may be essential for the intervention to work, while others may be recommended or viewed as helpful but not necessary for the intervention to work. “Recommended” components are often described as “adaptable” because they can be changed to improve fit in different settings where interventions are offered or with different individuals. We need to understand which parts of an intervention are essential (and which are adaptable) when translating interventions from research to community settings, but it is challenging to do this before studying an intervention in the community. This article presents the CORE (COmponents &amp; Rationales for Effectiveness) Fidelity Method—a new method for defining the essential components of evidence-based interventions—and applies it to a case example of Reciprocal Imitation Teaching, an intervention that parents are taught to deliver with their young children with social communication delays. The CORE Fidelity Method involves three steps: (1) gathering information from multiple sources; (2) integrating information from previous research and theory; and (3) drafting a CORE model for ongoing use. The benefits of using the CORE Fidelity Method may include: (1) improving consistency in intervention and research materials to help all providers emphasize the most important skills or strategies; (2) clarifying which parts of the intervention can be adapted; and (3) supporting future research that evaluates which intervention components work and how they work. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

The influences of the joint height, joint stirrup ratio, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips spacing, steel ratio and CST length on the failure mode, ultimate strength, and strain behavior of specimens are analyzed and discussed. Test results indicate that the failure mode of specimens is distinguished by the cracking of PVC tube, fracture of CFRP strips, yielding of stirrups, and longitudinal steel bars in the PFCC columns. Both the longitudinal steel bars and CST yield at the joint area, while there is no obvious damage on the joint. The ultimate stress of specimens decreases with the increment of CFRP strips spacing, while the other studied variables have little impact on the ultimate stress. As the CFRP strips spacing increases, the ultimate strain of specimens decreases, and the strain development accelerates. Considering the effect of joint dimension, a modified prediction model for the stress–strain relationship of axially loaded weak PFCC column-strong RC beam joints reinforced with CST is proposed and verified with good accuracy. </jats:p>",

Our most successful design encodes I358F, Y365W, T430I, and I513L receptor binding domain mutations, maintains recognition by the receptor ACE2 and a panel of different anti-receptor binding domain monoclonal antibodies, is between 1 and 2°C more thermally stable than the original receptor binding domain using a thermal shift assay, and is less proteolytically sensitive to chymotrypsin and thermolysin than the original receptor binding domain. Our approach could be applied to the computational stabilization of a wide range of proteins without requiring detailed knowledge of active sites or binding epitopes.

The fabricated APTAP yarn has respectable piezoelectric performance whose voltage output and current output reached 1650 mV and 70 nA when the silver‐plated concentration is 2%. In addition, the composite piezoelectric yarn shows good mechanical properties that tensile strength and elongation at break of the piezoelectric yarn with a silver‐plated concentration of 3% reach 284.37 MPa and 61.80%. A fabric is woven based on this yarn and it has a respectable signal output and shows satisfactory sensitivity that can be used to detect subtle signals. Therefore, this fiber‐based sensor provides an idea for monitoring the subtle physiological signals of the human body and shows broad potential in the extended application of medical care and clinical diagnosis in the future.</jats:p>",

The results show that the addition of fumed silica will alter the pore structure of the glass fibre core material, and reduce the average pore size, pore volume and porosity of the core material. Moreover, addition of fumed silica can increase the tensile strength of the core material to a certain extent, but it will diminish the uniformity. Further investigation conclusively shows that the addition of fumed silica has little effect on the thermal conductivity of VIP in low vacuum, but the thermal conductivity of VIP is significantly reduced with the increase of fumed silica content in high vacuum. Compared to glass fibre core VIP, the thermal conductivity of fiber/powder composite core VIP is more stable and the service life would be longer.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An effective vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis is urgently needed as infection rates continue to rise and C. trachomatis causes reproductive morbidity. An obligate intracellular pathogen, C. trachomatis employs a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) for host cell entry. The tip of the injectosome is composed of the protein CT584, which represents a potential target for neutralization with vaccine-induced antibody. Here, we investigate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a vaccine made of CT584 epitopes coupled to a bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP), a novel platform for Chlamydia vaccines modeled on the success of HPV vaccines. Female mice were immunized intramuscularly, challenged transcervically with C. trachomatis, and assessed for systemic and local antibody responses and bacterial burden in the upper genital tract. Immunization resulted in a 3-log increase in epitope-specific IgG in serum and uterine homogenates and in the detection of epitope-specific IgG in uterine lavage at low levels. By contrast, sera from women infected with C. trachomatis and virgin controls had similarly low titers to CT584 epitopes, suggesting these epitopes are not systemically immunogenic during natural infection but can be rendered immunogenic by the VLP platform. C. trachomatis burden in the upper genital tract of mice varied after active immunization, yet passive protection was achieved when immune sera were pre-incubated with C. trachomatis prior to inoculation into the genital tract. These data demonstrate the potential for antibody against the T3SS to contribute to protection against C. trachomatis and the value of VLPs as a novel platform for C. trachomatis vaccines.</jats:p>"

Accumulation of fatty acids (FA) metabolites was associated with a low survival rate in high-grade glioma patients. The diversity of brain lipids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is greater than in all other organs and several classes of proteins, such as FA transport proteins (FATPs), and FA translocases are considered principal candidates for PUFAs transport through BBB and delivery of PUFAs to brain cells. Among these, the CD36 FA translocase promotes long-chain FA uptake as well as oxidated lipoproteins. Moreover, CD36 binds and recognizes thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein that was shown to play a multifaceted role in cancer as part of the tumor microenvironment. Effects on tumor cells are mediated by TSP-1 through the interaction with CD36 as well as CD47, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. TSP-1/CD47 interactions have an important role in the modulation of glioma cell invasion and angiogenesis in GBM. Separately, FA, the two membrane receptors CD36, CD47, and their joint ligand TSP-1 all play a part in GBM pathogenesis. The last research has put in light their interconnection/interrelationship in order to exert a cumulative effect in the modulation of the GBM molecular network.</jats:p>"

Opn5 is categorized in an independent opsin group and functions for various non-visual photoreceptions. Among vertebrate Opn5 subgroups (Opn5m, Opn5L1 and Opn5L2), Opn5m and Opn5L2 bind 11-<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic> retinal to form a UV-sensitive resting state, which is inter-convertible with the all-<jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> retinal bound active state by photoreception. Thus, these opsins are characterized as bistable opsins. To assess the molecular basis of the UV-sensitive bistable property, we introduced comprehensive mutations at Thr188, which is well conserved among these opsins. The mutations in Opn5m drastically hampered 11-<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic> retinal incorporation and the bistable photoreaction. Moreover, T188C mutant Opn5m exclusively bound all-<jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> retinal and thermally self-regenerated to the original form after photoreception, which is similar to the photocyclic property of Opn5L1 bearing Cys188.

The magnitude of the spin accumulation signal is well understood as a barometer for characterizing spin current devices. Here, we develop a novel fabrication method for lateral spin valves based on ferromagnetic nanopillar structures using a multi-angle deposition technique. We demonstrate that the spin-accumulation signal is effectively enhanced by reducing the lateral dimension of the nonmagnetic spin channel. The obtained results can be quantitatively explained by the confinement of the spin reservoir by considering spin diffusion into the leads. The temperature dependence of the spin accumulation signal and the influence of the thermal spin injection under a high bias current are also discussed.</jats:p>",

Elucidating the mechanisms of prion-like transmission of α-synuclein is important for the development of therapies for these diseases, but little is known about the details. Here, we injected α-synuclein fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice and examined the early phase of the induction of phosphorylated α-synuclein accumulation. We found that phosphorylated α-synuclein appeared within a few days after the intracerebral injection. It was observed initially in presynaptic regions and subsequently extended its localization to axons and cell bodies.　These results suggest that extracellular α-synuclein fibrils are taken up into the presynaptic region and seed-dependently convert the endogenous normal α-synuclein that is abundant there to an abnormal phosphorylated form, which is then transported through the axon to the cell body.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The rapid growth of the demand for optical communication capacity promotes optical fiber communication technology. As a method to break through the capacity limitation of conventional single-mode fiber, multi-core fiber based on space division multiplexing technology has attracted extensive attention. In order to respond to the capacity of traditional single-mode fiber positively, we design a scheme of single-mode multi-core fiber combining the arrangement of heterogeneous fiber cores with secondary structure of low refractive index trench. The scheme consists of nineteen fiber cores arranged in a hexagonal closed-packed structure. Heterogeneous trench-assisted multi-core fiber (Hetero-TA-MCF) has low inter-core crosstalk and excellent anti-bending performance. Compared with conventional single-mode fiber, the Hetero-TA-MCF has the large transmission capacity and average effective area of each core of about 80 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The transmission capacity of 19 cores is equivalent to the sum of the transmission capacities of 19 single-core single-mode fibers. We use COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the fiber structure, finding the parameters that affect the properties of the fiber, selecting parameters and structures for optimal performance. Then we calculate the transmission characteristics by the finite element method,and the results of substantive simulating compute are as follows. The Hetero-TA-MCF achieves a low inter-core crosstalk (XT) of about –39 dB/100 km so that each core can be transmitted as a separate channe. It meets the standard of multi-core fiber long distance transmission. The XT of the heterogeneous 19-core single-mode fiber is suitable for multi-core fiber long distance transmission standards. The bending loss of the outermost fiber core is –7.7×10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt; dB/m when the bending radius is 10 cm, which reflects the low loss characteristics of the structure. The nonlinear coefficients of three kinds of core are 1.28 W&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;·km&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.31 W&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;·km&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1.30 W&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;·km&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, reducing the nonlinear effect of optical fiber effectively; the dispersions of three kinds of cores are less than 24 ps/(nm·km). In addition, the steady single-mode transmission is achieved in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; band. Compared with traditional single-mode fiber and single-trench homogeneous fiber, the proposed fiber in this work has low crosstalk, good bending resistance and large mode field area, which is suitable for long distance and large capacity transmission in space division multiplexing system.</jats:p>"

By optimizing geometric parameters, the splitting length of the circular beam splitter can be as short as 72.43 μm, and the extinction ratio can reach −151.42 dB. The high extinction ratio makes the circular polarization beam splitter have a good beam splitting function.

Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1galt1), an enzyme that synthesizes the core 1 structure, requires Cosmc, a C1galt1-specific molecular chaperone, for its enzymatic activity. Since Cosmc-knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality, the biological role of core 1-derived O-glycans in the adult stage is not fully understood. We generated ubiquitous and inducible CAGCre-ERTM/Cosmc-knockout (iCAG-Cos) mice to investigate the physiological function of core 1-derived O-glycans. The iCAG-Cos mice exhibited a global loss of core 1-derived O-glycans, high mortality, and showed a drastic reduction in weights of the thymus, adipose tissue, and pancreas 10 days after Cosmc deletion. They also exhibited leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, severe acute pancreatitis, and atrophy of white and brown adipose tissue, as well as spontaneous gastric ulcers and severe renal dysfunction, which were considered the causes underlying the high mortality of the iCAG-Cos mice. Serological analysis indicated the iCAG-Cos mice have lower blood glucose and total blood protein levels and higher triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol levels than the controls. These data demonstrate the importance of core 1-derived O-glycans for homeostatic maintenance in adult mice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Regular physical activity provides a variety of health benefits and is proven to treat and prevent several non-communicable diseases. Specifically, physical activity enhances muscular and osseous strength, improves cardiorespiratory fitness, and reduces the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, cognitive decline and several cancers. Despite these well-known benefits, physical activity promotion in clinical practice is underused due to insufficient training during medical education. Medical trainees in the USA receive relatively few hours of instruction in sports and exercise medicine (SEM). One reason for this shortage of instruction is a lack of curricular resources at each level of medical education. To address this need, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) assembled a group of SEM experts to develop curricular guidance for exercise medicine and physical activity promotion at the medical school, residency and sports medicine fellowship levels of training. After an evidence review of existing curricular examples, we performed a modified Delphi process to create curricula for medical students, residents and sports medicine fellows. Three training level-specific curricula emerged, each containing Domains, General Learning Areas, and Specific Learning Areas; options for additional training and suggestions for assessment and evaluation were also provided. Review and comment on the initial curricula were conducted by three groups: a second set of experts in exercise medicine and physical activity promotion, sports medicine fellowship directors representing a variety of fellowship settings and the AMSSM Board of Directors. The final curricula for each training level were prepared based on input from the review groups. We believe enhanced medical education will enable clinicians to better integrate exercise medicine and physical activity promotion in their clinical practice and result in healthier, more physically active patients.</jats:p>",

The fiber core is divided into two cores through two groups of circumscribed small clad tubes symmetrical up and down. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is used to analyze its guide mode properties. The effects of various structural parameters on its beam splitting characteristics are investigated in detail, and the extinction ratio (ER), bandwidth and transmission loss of the PBS are analyzed.

However, an important prerequisite for their consideration is their reproducibility. While the reliability of resting‐state (RS) measurements has often been studied at standard field strengths, they have rarely been investigated using ultrahigh‐field (UHF) <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">magnetic resonance imaging (</jats:styled-content>MRI) systems.

Our investigation at individual subject space revealed a strong stability for ALFF, ReHo, and DC in all three networks, and a moderate level of stability in fALFF. Furthermore, the internetwork connectivity between each network pair was strongly stable between CEN/SN and moderately stable between DMN/SN and DMN/SN.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) influences many soil properties including nutrient and water holding capacity, nutrient cycling and stability, improved water infiltration and aeration. It also is an essential parameter in the assessment of soil quality, especially for agricultural production. However, SOC mapping is a complicated process that is costly and time-consuming due to the physical challenges of the natural conditions that is being surveyed. The best model for SOC mapping is still in debate among many researchers. Recently, the development of machine learning and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has provided the potential for more accurate spatial prediction of SOC content. This research was conducted in a relatively small-scale capacity in the Central Vietnam region. The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Random Forest (RF) methods for SOC interpolation, with a dataset of 47 soil samples for an area of 145 hectares. Three environmental variables including elevation, slope, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used for the RF model. In the RF model, the values of the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, (mtry), and the number of bootstrap replicates, (ntree), were determined in terms of 1 and 1,000 respectively The results at our research site showed that using IDW is the most accurate method for SOC mapping, followed by the methods of RF and OK respectively. Concerning SOC mapping based-on auxiliary variables, in areas where there is human activity, the selection of auxiliary variables should be carefully considered because the variation in the SOC may not only be due to environmental variables but also by farming technologies. </jats:p>",

At-risk (LM n = 70; non-LM n = 89) and not-at-risk (LM n = 44; non-LM n = 114) students were evaluated on foundational academic (word reading, calculation), behavioral (behavioral attention), cognitive (working memory, processing speed, nonverbal reasoning), and language (vocabulary, listening comprehension) measures in English. Results indicated listening comprehension was the only shared risk factor for higher order comorbidity. Furthermore, LM learners were 3 times more likely to be identified as at risk compared with non-LM learners. Finally, among at-risk learners, no differences were found on cognitive dimensions by language status, but LM learners had lower reading and listening comprehension skills than non-LM learners, with a relative advantage in behavioral attention. Results have implications for understanding higher order comorbidity and for developing methods to identify and intervene with higher order comorbidity among the growing population of LM learners. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lentil (<jats:italic>Lens culinaris</jats:italic> Medik.) is one of the major cool-season pulse crops worldwide. Its increasing demand as a staple pulse has led to the unlocking of diverse germplasm collections conserved in the genebanks to develop its superior varieties. The Indian National Genebank, housed at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, India, currently has 2,324 accessions comprising 1,796 indigenous and 528 exotic collections. This study was conducted to unveil the potential of lentil germplasm by assessing its agro-morphological characteristics and diversity, identifying trait-specific germplasm, and developing a core set. The complete germplasm set was characterized for two years, i.e., 2017–2018 and 2018–2019, and data were recorded on 26 agro-morphological traits. High phenotypic variability was observed for nine quantitative and 17 qualitative traits. A core set comprising 170 accessions (137 Indian and 33 exotic) was derived based on the characterization data as well as geographical origin using a heuristic method and PowerCore software. This core set was found to be sufficiently diverse and representative of the entire collection based on the comparison made using Shannon–Weaver diversity indices and χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> test. These results were further validated by summary statistics. The core set displayed high genetic diversity as evident from a higher coefficient of variance in comparison to the entire set for individual traits and overall Shannon–Weaver diversity indices (entire: 1.054; core: 1.361). In addition, the total variation explained by the first three principal components was higher in the core set (70.69%) than in the entire collection (68.03%). Further, the conservation of pairwise correlation values among descriptors in the entire and core set reflected the maintenance of the structure of the whole set. Based on the results, this core set is believed to represent the entire collection, completely. Therefore, it constitutes a potential set of germplasm that can be used in the genetic enhancement of lentils.</jats:p>"

Multiple additional genomic characteristics are associated with anti-PD1 responses, but the combined predictive value of these features and the added informativeness of each respective feature remains unknown. We evaluated whether machine learning (ML) approaches using proposed determinants of anti-PD1 response derived from whole exome sequencing (WES) could improve prediction of anti-PD1 responders over TMB alone. Random forest classifiers were trained on publicly available anti-PD1 data (n = 104), and subsequently tested on an independent anti-PD1 cohort (n = 69). Both the training and test datasets included a range of cancer types such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), melanoma, and smaller numbers of patients from other tumor types. Features used include summaries such as TMB and number of frameshift mutations, as well as more gene-level features such as counts of mutations associated with immune checkpoint response and resistance. Both ML algorithms demonstrated area under the receiver-operator curves (AUC) that exceeded TMB alone (AUC 0.63 “human-guided,” 0.64 “cluster,” and 0.58 TMB alone). Mutations within oncogenes disproportionately modulate anti-PD1 responses relative to their overall contribution to tumor neoepitope burden. The use of a ML algorithm evaluating multiple proposed genomic determinants of anti-PD1 responses modestly improves performance over TMB alone, highlighting the need to integrate other biomarkers to further improve model performance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Cosmic rays entering the Earth’s atmosphere produce showers of secondary particles such as neutrons and muons. The interaction of these neutrons and muons with oxygen-16 (16O) in minerals such as ice and quartz can produce carbon-14 (14C). Analyses of in situ produced cosmogenic 14C in quartz are commonly used to investigate the Earth’s landscape evolution. In glacial ice, 14C is also incorporated through trapping of 14C-containing atmospheric gases (14CO2, 14CO, and 14CH4). Understanding the production rates of in situ cosmogenic 14C is important to deconvolve the in situ cosmogenic and atmospheric 14C signals in ice, both of which contain valuable paleoenvironmental information. Unfortunately, the in situ 14C production rates by muons (which are the dominant production mechanism at depths of &gt; 6 m solid ice equivalent) are uncertain. In this study, we use measurements of in situ 14C in ancient ice (&gt; 50 kilo-annum before present, ka BP) from the Taylor Glacier ablation site, Antarctica in combination with a 2D ice flow model to better constrain the rates of 14C production by muons. We find that the commonly used values for muogenic 14C production rates (Heisinger et al., 2002a, 2002b) in ice are too high by factors of 5.7 (3.6–13.9, 95 % confidence interval) and 3.7 (2.0–11.9 95 % confidence interval) for negative muon capture and fast muon interactions, respectively. Our constraints on muogenic 14C production rates in ice allow for future measurements of 14C in ice cores to be used for other applications and imply that muogenic 14C production rates in quartz are overestimated as well.\n                        </jats:p>"

Different from the inertial thinking of focusing on the scalar field dominated by helical phase light, we have revealed a vectorial Doppler effect in our previous work, which is based on the spatially variant polarized light fields to simultaneously acquire the speed and direction of a target. Here, further, we propose a method to construct a flexible and robust velocimeter based on that novel effect by employing an air-core fiber with kilometer-length scale for remotely measuring the vectorial information of angular velocity in situ. In addition, we experimentally substantiate that the measurement system still has commendable accuracy in determining the direction of movement even when the air-core fiber is interfered by the external environment. The demonstrations prove the potential of vectorial Doppler effect in practical scenarios and remote measurements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>New World arenaviruses are rodent-transmitted viruses and include a number of pathogens that are responsible for causing severe human disease. This includes Junín virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. The wild nature and mobility of the rodent reservoir host makes it difficult to control the disease, and currently passive immunization with high-titer neutralizing antibody-containing plasma from convalescent patients is the only specific therapy. However, dwindling supplies of naturally available convalescent plasma, and challenges in developing similar resources for other closely related viruses, have made the development of alternative antibody-based therapeutic approaches of critical importance. In this study, we sought to induce a neutralizing antibody response in rabbits against the receptor-binding subunit of the viral glycoprotein, GP1, and the specific peptide sequences in GP1 involved in cellular receptor contacts. While these specific receptor-interacting peptides did not efficiently induce the production of neutralizing antibodies when delivered as a particulate antigen (as part of hepatitis B virus core-like particles), we showed that recombinant JUNV GP1 purified from transfected mammalian cells induced virus-neutralizing antibodies at high titers in rabbits. Further, neutralization was observed across a range of unrelated JUNV strains, a feature that is critical for effectiveness in the field. These results underscore the potential of GP1 alone to induce a potent neutralizing antibody response and highlight the importance of epitope presentation. In addition, effective virus neutralization by rabbit antibodies supports the potential applicability of this species for the future development of immunotherapeutics (e.g., based on humanized monoclonal antibodies). Such information can be applied in the design of vaccines and immunogens for both prevention and specific therapies against this and likely also other closely related pathogenic New World arenaviruses.</jats:p>"

However, despite the rapidly growing body of data on regulatory interactions in several eukaryotes, no databases exist to provide curated high-quality information on transcription factor–target gene interactions for multiple species. Here, we address this gap by introducing the TFLink gateway, which uniquely provides experimentally explored and highly accurate information on transcription factor–target gene interactions (∼12 million), nucleotide sequences and genomic locations of transcription factor binding sites (∼9 million) for human and six model organisms: mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm and yeast by integrating 10 resources. TFLink provides user-friendly access to data on transcription factor–target gene interactions, interactive network visualizations and transcription factor binding sites, with cross-links to several other databases. Besides containing accurate information on transcription factors, with a clear labelling of the type/volume of the experiments (small-scale or high-throughput), the source database and the original publications, TFLink also provides a wealth of standardized regulatory data available for download in multiple formats. The database offers easy access to high-quality data for wet-lab researchers, supplies data for gene set enrichment analyses and facilitates systems biology and comparative gene regulation studies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Database URL https://tflink.net/</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although submarine landslides have been studied for decades, a persistent challenge is the integration of diverse geoscientific datasets to characterize failure processes. We present a core‐log‐seismic integration study of the Tuaheni Landslide Complex to investigate intact sediments beneath the undeformed seafloor as well as post‐failure landslide deposits. Beneath the undeformed seafloor are coherent reflections underlain by a weakly‐reflective and chaotic seismic unit. This chaotic unit is characterized by variable shear strength that correlates with density fluctuations. The basal shear zone of the Tuaheni landslide likely exploited one (or more) of the low shear strength intervals. Within the landslide deposits is a widespread “Intra‐debris Reflector”, previously interpreted as the landslide's basal shear zone. This reflector is a subtle impedance drop around the boundary between upper and lower landslide units. However, there is no pronounced shear strength change across this horizon. Rather, there is a pronounced reduction in shear strength ∼10–15 m above the Intra‐debris Reflector that presumably represents an induced weak layer that developed during failure. Free gas accumulates beneath some regions of the landslide and is widespread deeper in the sedimentary sequence, suggesting that free gas may have played a role in pre‐conditioning the slope to failure. Additional pre‐conditioning or failure triggers could have been seismic shaking and associated transient fluid pressure. Our study underscores the importance of detailed core‐log‐seismic integration approaches for investigating basal shear zone development in submarine landslides.</jats:p>",

Here, we found that a cellular ensemble in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) that is activated during past experience mediates an interaction between past and current information to update memory through a PPC-anterior cingulate cortex circuit in mice. Moreover, optogenetic silencing of the PPC ensemble immediately after retrieval dissociated the interaction without affecting individual memories stored in the hippocampus and amygdala. Thus, a specific subpopulation of PPC cells represents past information and instructs downstream brain regions to update previous memories.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Iron oxides are potential electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacities, low cost, rich resources, and their non-polluting properties. However, iron oxides demonstrate large volume expansion during the lithium intercalation process, resulting in the electrode material being crushed, which always results in poor cycle performance. In this paper, to solve the above problem, iron oxide/carbon nanocomposites with a hollow core–shell structure were designed. Firstly, an Fe2O3@polydopamine nanocomposite was prepared using an Fe2O3 nanocube and dopamine hydrochloride as precursors. Secondly, an Fe3O4@N-doped C composite was obtained by means of further carbonization treatment. Finally, Fe3O4@void@N-Doped C-x composites with core–shell structures with different void sizes were obtained by means of Fe3O4 etching. The effect of the etching time on the void size was studied. The electrochemical properties of the composites when used as lithium-ion battery materials were studied in more detail. The results showed that the sample that was obtained via etching for 5 h using 2 mol L−1 HCl solution at 30 °C demonstrated better electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity of the Fe3O4@void@N-Doped C-5 was able to reach up to 1222 mA g h−1 under 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles.</jats:p>"

Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the brain regions associated with the core skills of LMI (calculations, logical reasoning and game strategies) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Method: This study used a cross- case design. From 28 male and female volunteers aged 18 years and over who visited the Brain Mapping Laboratory in 2020, one with very a high Logicalmathematical intelligence was selected through purposive sampling and using the Multiple Intelligence Developmental Assessment Scale (MIDAS). The tools used in this study were Computational Assignments, Chess and Logical Reasoning. FMRI was also utilized to examine the brain regions. Data were preprocessed and statistically analyzed in SPM-12. Results: The results demonstrated similar neural activation involved in computational skills, logical reasoning, and chess game in the frontal and parietal lobes. They also showed significant activity in the cerebellum, insula, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, pre-and post-central gyri, fusiform gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus in all three skills. Conclusion: The results revealed that the neural activation patterns in each skill have unique neural bases, but have common patterns with other skills of Logical-mathematical intelligence. These common and unique patterns present a unique neural architecture in support of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences as a scientific model of human intelligence.</jats:p>"

Study findings illustrate the intersectionality of contextual influences on the experience of low-income older adults. Study participants demonstrated remarkable resilience and coping strategies developed in response to the challenges they experienced throughout their lifetime which benefited them when faced with the pandemic, social unrest, and political events that took place in 2020. This study highlights the importance of understanding the larger context of COVID-19 which has significant implications for policy makers and public health leaders. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Pancreatic islet transplantation into the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) has been shown to improve glycemic control and metabolic parameters of diabetes in both murine and primate models. This novel transplantation site also allows the delivery of therapeutic agents, such as immunosuppressive drugs, locally to prevent islet graft rejection and circumvent unwanted systemic side effects. Local intravitreal administration of micronized dexamethasone implant was performed prior to allogeneic islet transplantation into the ACEs of non-human primates. Two study groups were observed namely allogeneic graft without immunosuppression (n = 4 eyes) and allogeneic graft with local immunosuppression (n = 8 eyes). Survival of islet grafts and dexamethasone concentration in the ACE were assessed in parallel for 24 weeks. Allogeneic islet grafts with local dexamethasone treatment showed significantly better survival than those with no immunosuppression (median survival time- 15 weeks vs 3 weeks, log-rank test p&lt;0.0001). Around 73% of the grafts still survived at week 10 with a single local dexamethasone implant, where the control group showed no graft survival. Dexamethasone treated islet grafts revealed a good functional response to high glucose stimulation despite there was a transient suppression of insulin secretion from week 8 to 12. Our findings show a significant improvement of allografts survival in the ACE with local dexamethasone treatment. These results highlight the feasibility of local administration of pharmacological compounds in the ACE to improve islet graft survival and function. By eliminating the need for systemic immunosuppression, these findings may impact clinical islet transplantation in the treatment of diabetes, and the ACE may serve as a novel therapeutic islet transplantation site with high potential for local pharmacological intervention. </jats:p>",

The terahertz absorption of electric-field-induced hole carriers increases with decreasing frequency down to 150 cm−1 (4.5 THz). However, it is not reproduced by the simple Drude model but tends to be suppressed with decreasing frequency. The spectral shape of the absorption and the mobility value were simultaneously reproduced by the Drude–Anderson model, which incorporates carrier scattering due to thermal molecular fluctuations. The frequency of the intermolecular vibration that dominates carrier scattering is estimated to be approximately 8 cm−1, which is in good agreement with the theoretically predicted value. Moreover, analyses of the absorption spectra at low temperatures reveal that the mobility increases to 14 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 240 K. These results demonstrate that thermal molecular fluctuations limit the mobility.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The most common technology for the manufacture of aluminum parts and blanks is casting in a chill mold. To determine ways to improve casting technology, it is necessary to analyze the possibility of changing the parameters that affect the reduction of production costs (reduction of energy consumption, material consumption, increase productivity) and improve the quality of casting. The thermal regime of the metal form determines the productivity of the process, the duration of curing of the casting, its quality, durability of the chill mold. The analysis of the work of the chill mold for the manufacture of castings Pump Housing showed that when the forms are filled, the most heated new portions of metal meet on their way to the central core. That is, when pouring the mold, the central core is heated the most, especially in the lower part. This circumstance hinders the process of directed curing and can lead to shrinkage defects. In addition, the higher the temperature of the mold, the slower the casting will crystallize and the worse its structure and mechanical properties will be. Based on the analysis of structures and methods of cooling molds, the method of controlled cooling of the central core by air is substantiated. A new design of the core has been developed, which provides adjustable air cooling of the chill mold by connecting the central core through a valve to the pneumatic system of the shop. 3D-models of details and assembly drawings of the central core of a new design are developed. A computer study of the air flow in the core channels in SolidWorks Flow Simulation was performed. The results of parametric modeling of air flow in the channels of the Central core showed the maximum air flow rate during cooling 0.371 kg / s, the heat content of air when cooled 25081 J / s. Evaluation of the cooling efficiency of the developed chill mold design showed that when using air cooling of the central core with cooling air at its maximum consumption, 41% of heat is removed. Thus, the developed design of the cooled central core allows to increase the productivity of the casting process, improve the quality of casting by improving the structure and mechanical properties of the casting, as well as increase the life of the chill mold. But the obtained research results are of a recommendatory nature and require practical verification in the production environment. In addition, the simulation did not take into account the change in core temperature due to its heat exchange with the melt. Given all this, there is a need for further study of the effect of regulated air cooling on the thermal regime of the chill mold.</jats:p>",

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the reactivity and melting points of aryl halides in solid-state Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions and the effect of reaction temperature on these processes. We found that aryl halides with high melting points showed significantly low reactivity in the solid-state cross-coupling near room temperature, but the reactions were notably accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature. Given that the reaction temperature is much lower than the melting points of these substrates, the acceleration effect is most likely ascribed to the weakening of the intermolecular interactions between the substrate molecules in the solid state. The present study provides important perspectives for the rational design of efficient solid-state organic transformations using ball milling.</jats:p>",

However, both the chlorine evolution reaction and chloride corrosion are intractable issues in seawater splitting. Here, a porous electrode based on a phosphate-intercalated NiFe (oxy)hydroxide shell coated on a nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) micropillar core (denoted as P-NiFe@NiMoO4) is synthesized through an electrochemical oxidation strategy. During the electrochemical oxidation process, the etching of MoO2 promotes the reconstruction of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide and the formation of porous structures in an alkaline solution. The optimized P-NiFe@NiMoO4 electrocatalysts afford a low overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 in alkaline seawater. By pairing the anode with a cathode of as-synthesized P-NiMoO, the electrolyzer presents a low voltage of 1.63 V at 100 mA/cm2 in alkaline seawater with excellent stability. Moreover, the remarkable stability of the anode seems to be attributed to the in-situ phosphate formed during the electrochemical oxidation process to passivate chloride corrosion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">A broadband mode-division multiplexer based on asymmetric three-core photonic crystal fiber is proposed in this paper. The device is mainly composed of a central core, which can provide the transmission of fundamental mode and higher-order mode, and two side cores providing fundamental mode transmission. According to the theory of optical coupling, the LP&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; mode light is input to the three fiber cores at the initial port separately, and in the transmission process the LP&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; mode on the left side core will be coupled and converted into the LP&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; mode light in the central core gradually. Similarly, the LP&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; mode of the right side core is transformed into the LP&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; mode of the center core. By optimizing the structural design and selecting the length of optical fiber, the best conversion from side core into central core can be completed at the output end simultaneously, thereby realizing the multiplexing of LP&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;, LP&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; and LP&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; modes in the central core. In the opposite direction, if the output end of the device is used as the initial port, the demultiplexing of three modes of light from the central core to the three cores can be realized. In thiswork, the finite element method and beam propagation method are used to optimize the simulation, and the optical coupling theory and supermode theory are combined to conduct analysis and calculation. The results show that at wavelength band from 1.49 μm to 1.63 μm, the maximum insertion loss of the device is 0.72 dB, and the lowest insertion loss is 0.543 dB at 1.55 μm, which is far lower than the general evaluation standard of 1 dB insertion loss. The low insertion loss also makes it possible to design cascaded multi-core photonic-crystal-fiber mode-division multiplexer. Compared with the existing mode-division multiplexing scheme, the device is more integrated and less affected by the external environment. When it is used with multi-core space division multiplexing fiber, it can better improve the mode-conversion efficiency and mode purity, reduce the coupling complexity and expand the communication capacity.</jats:p>"

However, previous research has mainly focused on cancer information overload and the corresponding consequence, and failed to examine its adverse effects in the context of major public health events. Based on the Frustrate Aggression Theory and the Scapegoat Theory, the present study established a moderated mediation model to investigate the emotional and behavioral outcomes of COVID-19 information overload. The mediating role of depression/anxiety in the association between COVID-19 information overload and cyber aggression, as well as the moderating role of Confucian responsibility thinking, were tested. This model was examined with 1005 Chinese people (mean age = 26.91 years, SD = 9.94) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mediation analyses revealed that COVID-19 information overload was positively related to cyber aggression, depression, and anxiety, parallelly and partially mediated this relationship. Moderated mediation analyses further indicated that Confucian responsibility thinking not only moderated the direct link between COVID-19 information overload and cyber aggression, with the effect being significant only for people with a low level of Confucian responsibility thinking, but also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 information overload and depression/anxiety respectively, with the associations being much more potent for individuals with low levels of Confucian responsibility thinking. These findings have the potential to inform the development of prevention and intervention programs designed to reduce the negative emotions and cyber aggression associated with information overload in public health events.</jats:p>"

Since all the elements in the soft magnetic alloys are transition metals, dense oxide layer is easily formed on their surfaces, which can affect the regulation of soft magnetic properties. In order to solve the problems, in this work, an innovative high-temperature pretreatment process in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ar mixture is adopted to pretreat FeNiMo raw powders. We confirm that the high temperature treatment in reducing atmosphere can effectively remove metal oxides from the FeNiMo material surface and increase the content of elemental states, thereby further significantly improving the effective permeability of FeNiMo raw powders. The pretreated FeNiMo powder is evenly coated with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers, forming the FeNiMo/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; soft magnetic composites. Compared with the untreated FeNiMo powder coated with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the FeNiMo/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pretreated with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ar mixture gas at high temperatures has high effective permeability and low loss.

Therefore, the insulation coating after being pretreated at high temperature in reducing atmosphere can greatly improve the permeability and reduce the core loss of soft magnetic composites. This will provide a new strategy for enhancing the soft magnetic properties of the composite cores.</jats:p>"

Here, we show that oral supplementation with the polyphenol-rich berry camu-camu (CC; Myrciaria dubia) in mice shifted gut microbial composition, which translated into antitumor activity and a stronger anti–PD-1 response. We identified castalagin, an ellagitannin, as the active compound in CC. Oral administration of castalagin enriched for bacteria associated with efficient immunotherapeutic responses (Ruminococcaceae and Alistipes) and improved the CD8+/FOXP3+CD4+ ratio within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, castalagin induced metabolic changes, resulting in an increase in taurine-conjugated bile acids. Oral supplementation of castalagin following fecal microbiota transplantation from ICI-refractory patients into mice supported anti–PD-1 activity. Finally, we found that castalagin binds to Ruminococcus bromii and promoted an anticancer response. Altogether, our results identify castalagin as a polyphenol that acts as a prebiotic to circumvent anti–PD-1 resistance.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The polyphenol castalagin isolated from a berry has an antitumor effect through direct interactions with commensal bacteria, thus reprogramming the tumor microenvironment.

Here, we investigate differences in RT-qPCR Ct values across Qatar’s national cohorts of primary infections, reinfections, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) breakthrough infections, and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) breakthrough infections. Our matched-cohort analyses of the randomly diagnosed infections show higher mean Ct value in all cohorts of breakthrough infections compared to the cohort of primary infections in unvaccinated individuals.

Since Ct value correlates inversely with SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, these differences imply that vaccine breakthrough infections and reinfections are less infectious than primary infections in unvaccinated individuals.

Biomarker evaluation included two independent cohorts of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from a protocol biopsy program and used subgroup comparisons according to BANFF-classifications. Plasma, urine and biopsy lysate samples were analyzed with a Luminex-based multiplex assay. The CXCL9-specific hybrid-LFA was developed based upon a specific rat antibody immobilized on a nitrocellulose-membrane and the coupling of a CXCL9-binding aptamer to gold nanoparticles. LFA performance was assessed according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Among 15 high-scored biomarkers according to a neural network analysis, significantly higher levels of CXCL9 were found in plasma and urine and biopsy lysates of KTRs with biopsy-proven AMR. The newly developed hybrid-LFA reached a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and an AUC of 0.79 for CXCL9. This point-of-care-test (POCT) improves early diagnosis-making in AMR after Ktx, especially in KTRs with undetermined status of donor-specific HLA-antibodies.</jats:p>"

Our study validates the role of the ERK MAPK effector pathway in mediating RAS dependency in a panel of H/NRASQ61X mutant RMS cells and correlates in vivo efficacy of the MEK inhibitor trametinib with pharmacodynamics of ERK activity. A screen is used to identify trametinib-sensitizing targets, and combinations are evaluated in cells and tumor xenografts. We find that the ERK MAPK pathway is central to H/NRASQ61X dependency in RMS cells; however, there is poor in vivo response to clinically relevant exposures with trametinib, which correlates with inefficient suppression of ERK activity. CRISPR screening points to vertical inhibition of the RAF–MEK–ERK cascade by cosuppression of MEK and either CRAF or ERK. CRAF is central to rebound pathway activation following MEK or ERK inhibition. Concurrent CRAF suppression and MEK or ERK inhibition, or concurrent pan-RAF and MEK/ERK inhibition (pan-RAFi + MEKi/ERKi), or concurrent MEK and ERK inhibition (MEKi + ERKi) all synergistically block ERK activity and induce myogenic differentiation and apoptosis. In vivo assessment of pan-RAFi + ERKi or MEKi + ERKi potently suppress growth of H/NRASQ61X RMS tumor xenografts, with pan-RAFi + ERKi being more effective and better tolerated. We conclude that CRAF reactivation limits the activity of single-agent MEK/ERK inhibitors in FN-RMS. Vertical targeting of the RAF–MEK–ERK cascade and particularly cotargeting of CRAF and MEK or ERK, or the combination of pan-RAF inhibitors with MEK or ERK inhibitors, have synergistic activity and potently suppress H/NRASQ61X mutant RMS tumor growth.</jats:p>",

Present-day Moho discontinuities only partially coincide with petrological estimates of a change from felsic-basic rocks (that belong to the continental crust) by predominantly ultramafic rocks (that represent the continental mantle lithosphere) and often lie much deeper than the PZСMT. Depths of such zones change over time. For a garnet-free assemblage of deep-seated nodules ejected by basaltic melts about 13 Ma ago from the root of a granulite terrane exposed in the eastern part of the Tunka Valley, two PT trends were obtained, one of which corresponds to a high (up to 120 mW/m2) rift conductive geotherm, another one crosses low conductive geotherms (drops below 60 mW/m2 one). The PZСMT shows here a temperature approximately 200°C lower than the PZСMT of granulite terranes in Eastern Australia, China, and Svalbard. Deep-seated nodules characterize the development of hot transtension under the rift valley in the cold root part of the East Tunka block with the accumulation and release of elastic stresses accompanied by significant synkinematic (metasomatic and magmatic) processes in the time interval 18–12 Ma ago. The transtension was followed by a crustal transpression with inversional uplift of an area and a probable relative increase in the depth of the Moho discontinuity, determined from the both P- and S-wave velocities for the modern crust and lithospheric part of the mantle.</jats:p>"

Strongly correlating with dose, MN are also suggested to indicate radiation quality, differentiating between particle and photon irradiation. The “gold standard” for measuring MN formation is Fenech’s cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay, which uses the cytokinesis blocking agent cytochalasin-B. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the literature investigating MN induction trends in vitro, collating 193 publications, with 2476 data points. Data were collected from original studies that used the CBMN assay to quantify MN in response to ionizing radiation in vitro. Overall, the meta-analysis showed that individual studies mostly have a linear increase of MN with dose [85% of MN per cell (MNPC) datasets and 89% of percentage containing MN (PCMN) datasets had an R2 greater than 0.90]. However, there is high variation between studies, resulting in a low R2 when data are combined (0.47 for MNPC datasets and 0.60 for PCMN datasets). Particle type, species, cell type, and cytochalasin-B concentration were suggested to influence MN frequency. However, variation in the data meant that the effects could not be strongly correlated with the experimental parameters investigated. There is less variation between studies when comparing the PCMN rather than the number of MNPC. Deviation from CBMN protocol specified timings did not have a large effect on MN induction. However, further analysis showed less variation between studies following Fenech’s protocol closely, which provided more reliable results. By limiting the cell type and species as well as only selecting studies following the Fenech protocol, R2 was increased to 0.64 for both measures. We therefore determine that due to variation between studies, MN are currently a poor predictor of radiation-induced DNA damage and make recommendations for futures studies assessing MN to improve consistency between datasets.</jats:p>",

The approach facilitated the development and delivery of comprehensive and earlier care for the fetus, and the family living with this complex, congenital condition, with perinatology, endocrinology, genetic counseling, psychology, and urology involvement. As well, the addition of fetal MRI to standard ultrasound revealed significant deficits in the biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, and total intracranial volume of the fetal CAH brain.

We analyzed the whole genomes of 70 plants collected throughout the island of Hawaii, which is the youngest island with the highest altitude in the archipelago and encompasses a wide range of environments. The continuous<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>.<jats:italic>polymorpha</jats:italic>forest stands on the island of Hawaii were differentiated into three genetic clusters, each of which grows in a distinctive environment and includes substantial genetic and phenotypic diversity. The three genetic clusters showed signatures of selection in genomic regions encompassing genes relevant to environmental adaptations, including genes associated with light utilization, oxidative stress, and leaf senescence, which are likely associated with the ecological differentiation of the species. Our demographic modeling suggested that the glaberrima cluster in wet environments maintained a relatively large population size and two clusters split: polymorpha in the subalpine zone and incana in dry and hot conditions. This ecological divergence possibly began before the species colonized the island of Hawaii. Interestingly, the three clusters recovered genetic connectivity coincidentally with a recent population bottleneck, in line with the weak reproductive isolation observed in the species. This study highlights that the degree of genetic differentiation between ecologically-diverged populations can vary depending on the strength of natural selection in the very early phases of speciation.</jats:p>"

First, based on the complex modulus method, the Jolly theory and the pre-defined magnetic coefficients, the dynamic moduli, and loss factors of MRE are assumed as a function of magnetic induction intensity. Furthermore, a theoretical model of the MRE sandwich plates (MRESPs) is proposed, which considers the internal magnetic field excitation and four types of panel materials, namely fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), fiber-reinforced polymer with carbon nanotubes (CNT-FRP), metal and fiber-metal hybrid (FMH) panels. After the deformation and energy equations are derived to solve the static bearing stiffness, dynamic stiffness, and damping parameters, some literature results are employed to provide the initial validation of the model developed. Subsequently, four MRESP specimens with the FRP, CNT-FRP, metal, and FMH panels are fabricated and measured to further verify the model as well as to evaluate the mechanical performance. The influence of critical geometric and material parameters related to MRE on static and dynamic properties is also discussed to summarize some practical conclusions for engineering applications. </jats:p>",

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 63.5% (450/709; 95% CI 59.8%-67.0%) using the BioMedomics assay and 71.9% (510/709; 95% CI 68.5%-75.2%) using the Elecsys assay. There were 60 discordant results between the two assays, all of which were seropositive in the Elecsys assay, but seronegative in the BioMedomics assay. Overall, positive, and negative percent agreements between the two assays were 91.5% (95% CI 89.2%-93.5%), 88.2% (95% CI 85.1%-90.9%), and 100% (95% CI 98.2%-100%), respectively, with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.84).

Subset analyses of targeted tumor sequencing and IHC data revealed that Cluster 1 tumors showed TP53 mutation and abnormal p53 expression, and Cluster 2 tumors showed aneuploidy and ARID1A/PIK3CA mutation (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Cluster-defining CpGs included 1,388 CpGs residing within 200 bp of the transcription start sites of 977 genes; 38% of these genes (N = 369 genes) were differentially expressed across cluster in transcriptomic subset analysis (P &amp;lt; 10−4). Differentially expressed genes were enriched for six immune-related pathways, including IFNα and IFNγ responses (P &amp;lt; 10−6).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>DNA methylation clusters in OCCC correlate with disease features and gene expression patterns among immune pathways.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Impact:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This work serves as a foundation for integrative analyses that better understand the complex biology of OCCC in an effort to improve potential for development of targeted therapeutics.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Using an iterative graded freezing approach we obtained viable cells after cooling in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 6% hydroxyethyl starch at 1°C/min to –40°C, storage in liquid nitrogen, rapid thaw, and removal of cryoprotectants by serial dilution. The expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule declined immediately after thaw, but recovered after overnight incubation, while that of an endocrine cell marker (HPi2) remained high after cryopreservation. Patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed differences in channel activities and exocytosis of various islet cell types; however, exocytotic responses, and the biophysical properties of voltage-gated Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>and Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>channels, are sustained after cryopreservation. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicates that overall transcriptome and crucial exocytosis genes are comparable between fresh and cryopreserved dispersed human islet cells. Thus, we report an optimized procedure for cryopreserving dispersed islet cells that maintained their membrane integrity, along with their molecular and functional phenotypes. Our findings will not only provide a ready source of cells for investigating cellular mechanisms in diabetes but also for bio-engineering pseudo-islets and islet sheets for modeling studies and potential transplant applications.</jats:p>"

Risks for cause-specific outcomes were higher in COVID-19 survivors than in general population controls and largely similar or lower in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients.

In this study, the malignant transition of residual tumors after IRFA was explored. Then, arsenic-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 nanoparticles (As@ZIF-8 NPs) were constructed, and their therapeutic effect on residual tumors was studied.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our data showed that IRFA can dramatically promote the proliferation, induce the metastasis, activate the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and accelerate the angiogenesis of residual tumors. Interestingly, we found, for the first time, that extensive angiogenesis after IRFA can augment the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and enhance the enrichment of ZIF-8 nanocarriers in residual tumors. Encouraged by this unique finding, we successfully prepared As@ZIF-8 NPs with good biocompatibility and confirmed that they were more effective than free arsenic trioxide (ATO) in sublethal heat-induced cell proliferation suppression, apoptosis induction, cell migration and invasion inhibition, and EMT reversal in vitro. Furthermore, compared with free ATO, As@ZIF-8 NPs exhibited remarkably increased therapeutic effects by repressing residual tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This work provides a new paradigm for the treatment of residual HCC after IRFA.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Graphical Abstract</jats:title>\n                \n              </jats:sec>"

Evidence from randomized trials can be difficult to interpret and of limited ability to inform clinical practice for numerous reasons. These may include complex issues, such as variation in outcome measures and outcome reporting bias, as well as failure to consider the perspectives of men and their partners with lived experience of fertility problems. Previously, the Core Outcome Measure for Infertility Trials (COMMIT) initiative, an international consortium of researchers, healthcare professionals and people with fertility problems, has developed a core outcome set for general infertility research. Now, a bespoke core outcome set for male infertility is required to address the unique challenges pertinent to male infertility research.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, allied healthcare professionals, scientists, researchers and people with fertility problems, will be invited to participate.

Possible core outcomes will be identified by undertaking a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating potential treatments for male factor infertility. These outcomes will be entered into a modified Delphi method. Repeated reflection and re-scoring should promote convergence towards consensus outcomes, which will be prioritized during a consensus development meeting to identify a final core outcome set. We will establish standardized definitions and recommend high-quality measurement instruments for individual core outcomes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This work has been supported by the Urology Foundation small project award, 2021.

Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

The Lung Biological Network of the HCA aims to generate the Human Lung Cell Atlas as a reference for the cellular repertoire, molecular cell states and phenotypes, and cell–cell interactions that characterise normal lung homeostasis in healthy lung tissue. Such a reference atlas of the healthy human lung will facilitate mapping the changes in the cellular landscape in disease. The discovAIR project is one of six pilot actions for the HCA funded by the European Commission in the context of the H2020 framework programme. discovAIR aims to establish the first draft of an integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas, combining single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic profiling with spatially resolving techniques on matched tissue samples, as well as including a number of chronic and infectious diseases of the lung. The integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas will be available as a resource for the wider respiratory community, including basic and translational scientists, clinical medicine, and the private sector, as well as for patients with lung disease and the interested lay public. We anticipate that the Human Lung Cell Atlas will be the founding stone for a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of lung diseases, guiding the design of novel diagnostics and preventive or curative interventions.</jats:p>",

Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample (Generation Scotland; n = 9537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 130 EpiScore-disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors, and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.</jats:p>"
