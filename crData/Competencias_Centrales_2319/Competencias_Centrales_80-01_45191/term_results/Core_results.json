      "abstract": "<jats:p>Please let me for fifteen minutes completely ignore all gas in the cores of galaxies. Clearly the core gas exhibits fascinating, varied and consequential phenomena. Still it would seem to me a plausible assumption that while the gas might be decisively affected by the stars, this gas might not have major effects on the stars, at least in their dynamical behavior. Accordingly I shall here consider purely stellar systems.</jats:p><jats:p>Obviously in the core of a galaxy, for dynamical consideration we have to distinguish sharply between the nucleus of a galaxy and the larger components of the galaxy co-occupying the core. Following Baade’s usage the nucleus is a stellar system of at most a few parsecs in radius and of a density substantially higher than the central densities of the other components. That the nucleus of a galaxy, at least in its equilibrium state -though not necessarily in its origin- is a distinct, self-contained stellar system seems to me strongly indicated by the rotation velocity measurements in the nucleus of the Andromeda Nebula (Lallemand et al. 1960; Walker, 1974) as well as by the photometric profile determination of the same nucleus (Light et al. 1974). For a nucleus of 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> stars the relaxation time for stellar encounters is, according to Spitzer (1971), comparable to a Hubble time while stellar collisions are ignorable. On the other hand, for a nucleus containing 10<jats:sup>10</jats:sup> stars, which may be the right order of magnitude for more pronounced nuclei, the relaxation time may be comfortably long enough so that encounters may be ignored, but the frequency of collisions is not ignorable. In both cases therefore it would seem that in the centermost portions of nuclei of galaxies either encounters or collisions play a decisive dynamical role but the same may not be true in the outer portions of these nuclei. For the larger subsystems occupying the core of a galaxy, obviously neither encounters nor collisions play a significant role. To stay within the limits of my knowledge, I shall limit myself here to encounterless and collisionless stellar systems, a marginal approximation for the nuclei proper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Simultaneous observation of the J,K=1,1 and 2,2 inversion transitions of ammonia (NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) with high spatial resolution (≲1 arc min) offers a powerful method of probing the core region of interstellar clouds for evidence of molecular clumping and of prevailing physical conditions which could lead to star formation. We have therefore used the Effelsberg 100-m radiotelescope to make an extensive study of the central region of the nearby dark dust cloud L183 (also known as L134N) in the NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (1,1) transition; the spatial resolution was 40 arcsec. The core region as mapped in the NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (1,1) transition with a velocity resolution of 0.08 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> consists of two elongated condensations separated by about 2 arcmin in north-south direction (see Fig. 1). The central part of the NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> cloud has an approximate dimension of 6′ (N-S) by 2′ (E-W) corresponding to a linear extent of 0.17 × 0.06 pc at an assumed distance of 100 pc. The measured velocity structure of the NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> cloud seems to reflect the double peaked nature of the cloud in that it increases from 2.30 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> in the south to about 2.5 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> at the northern end of the southern NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> peak, and then decreases again to 2.3 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> towards the north. The intrinsic linewidths of NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (corrected for hyperfine blending) do not vary significantly with position and are between 0.2 and 0.3 km s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. The two ammonia peaks are part of a central molecular ridge from which we have observed NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (2,2) emission at 9 positions (see Fig. 1). The rotation temperature T<jats:sub>21</jats:sub> as determined from the optical depths of the (1,1) and (2,2) transitions is ∼9K for all positions, and hence the kinetic temperature T<jats:sub>kin</jats:sub> seems close to this value as well, i.e. ∼10K throughout the central part of L183. A more detailed account is being publsihed elsewhere (Ungerechts, Walmsley and Winnewisser).</jats:p>"

Measurements on samples from very cold accumulation regions show that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is occluded not only in air bubbles, but also in the ice lattice.

By melting the samples and extracting the evolving gases in two fractions, it is possible to estimate CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration in the bubbles and the ice lattice. Enrichment or depletion of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in the bubbles by exchange with the ice is difficult to estimate.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently theories of the Earth's rotation based on models with an elastic mantle and fluid core have achieved considerable success. It was assumed in these models that the dissipative (electro-magnetic and viscous) couplings between the fluid core and the mantle have negligible effects. The discrepancies between the theories and the observations were much reduced. It seems, however, that these theories are not sufficiently successful in explaining the observed phenomena concerning the Chandler wobble. For example, we had a very small polar radius in the decade around 1930, and the phase of the polar wobble was much advanced in this decade compared with the mean period of revolution. The apparent period of the polar wobble maintained an almost constant value of 1.16 yr during 1930-1942 (Sugawa 1969; Guinot 1972; Stoyko 1972). The present author (Sekiguchi 1975) found from the latitude observations between 1830 and 1860 that the amplitude was also diminished and the period had an almost constant value of 1.16 yr. The common behaviour of the polar wobble in both periods is difficult to explain as an accidental happening.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>According to the respective restoring forces of self-gravitation, Coriolis force, and inertial coupling at the boundaries, the free oscillations of a contained fluid can be classified into gravitational, inertial, and toroidal oscillations. For the outer core of the Earth, however, due to the interplay of rotation, elasticity, and self-gravitation, the gravitational undertones and inertial oscillations are not distinguishable. Both have eigenfunctions consisting of spheroidal and toroidal parts of about equal amplitude, and exist in alternating allowed and forbidden zones depending on the gravitational stability of the outer core. The forbidden zones for a stable core correspond to the allowed zones for an unstable core, while for a neutrally stratified core there appear to be no forbidden zones. The eigenfunction of a toroidal mode consists essentially of a primary toroidal field and a secondary spheroidal component of the order of ellipticity, coupled at the outer core-mantle or outer core-inner core boundary. Therefore, in general, toroidal core modes appear in doublets S<jats:sub>n+1</jats:sub><jats:sup>m</jats:sup> T<jats:sub>n</jats:sub><jats:sup>m</jats:sup> and S<jats:sub>n−1</jats:sub><jats:sup>m</jats:sup> T<jats:sub>n−1</jats:sub><jats:sup>m</jats:sup> with degenerate frequency equal to 2m/n(n+1) times the angular frequency of rotation of the Earth. The ellipticities of the outer core boundaries are responsible for the removal of the degeneracy. It is shown that the primary toroidal and secondary spheroidal fields constitute the “generalized Poincare motion” which, for the fundamental mode S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub><jats:sup>1</jats:sup>T<jats:sub>1</jats:sub><jats:sup>1</jats:sup>, reduces to the “simple motion” defined by Poincare in 1910. Numerical solutions have been obtained for all three types of free core modes. While those for gravitational undertones and inertial oscillations are obtained by arbitrarily truncating the hydrodynamic equations, it is shown that the eigensolutions for toroidal modes are correct to first order in ellipticity due to the particular geometry of the outer core of the Earth.</jats:p>"

The central 40’ × 40’ region of the Perseus cluster around NGC 1275 displays an interesting temperature and surface brightness distribution. Simple hydrostatic isothermal sphere models do not well describe the cluster emission. The surface brightness of the high resolution image of NGC 1275 can be fit with a constant-pressure but centrally-cooling (i.e., temperature increases with radius) gas which suggests a radiative cooling accretion flow onto NGC 1275.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In both physical and mathematical models of the Earth's core it has been difficult, so far, to discuss all the terms in the magneto-hydrodynamic energy equation under one unifying theory and to relate all the physical mechanisms involved in a specific model. The reason for this is mainly the uncertainty about the energy sources, or, when they could be accounted for, with uncertainty about their location. In the following article we deduce and examine a model of the Earth's core which can be regarded as a sequel to theories of the formation of a fluid core in the course of the Earth's thermal evolution.General cooling and pressure-freezing cause the formation of solid phases at the boundaries of the fluid core, leading to a solid inner core (IC) and a lower mantle shell (Bullen's D″ layer) from slow overgrowth at the mantle–core (MC) boundary. For simplicity, the core fluid is assumed to consist of two major phases, one conducive to solid metallic core formation, and the other to crystallization of a lower mantle phase from \"solution\" in a metal \"solvent.\" The presence of a third, minor constituent, by selective partitioning between phases, acts as a solid phase growth regulator.On the basis of this model the energy available for fluid core motion and thereby for maintenance of the magnetic field, is related directly to the time rate of change of the growth of the solid phases at the IC and MC boundaries. Most of the available energy is gravitational and is associated with density and concentration currents which offset density inhomogeneities caused by selective acceptance and rejection of the fluid core constituents by the two solid phases.A very conservative estimate of the net gain per second in gravitational potential energy resulting from the mass redistribution via density currents and solid phase formation is 2.6 × 10<jats:sup>13</jats:sup> W which may become available in different forms. The fraction which is converted into kinetic energy associated with differential circulatory motion around the rotation axis amounts to 3.4 × 10<jats:sup>11</jats:sup> W, based on radial interchange with respect to the Earth's centre. The heat liberated as a result of IC solidification is 2.7 × 10<jats:sup>11</jats:sup> W, assuming that the metallic phase is mainly iron. Since our ideas of other constituents of the core fluid are less definite we can draw only very general conclusions about the MC boundary. If silicates and oxides are likely candidates, it is possible that in the crystallization of the mantle phase from the core fluid, heat is being absorbed, thus creating a heat sink at the MC boundary. An estimate of the net strain energy associated with compression of IC material by about 1.4% and expansion of MC material by, on the average, 0.4% gives 1.5 × 10<jats:sup>11</jats:sup> W.Magnetic polarity reversals might be explained as due to epochs during which the solid phase growth rate which dominates the fluid motion shifts from the IC to the MC boundary and vice versa. Intensity changes might be due to significant variations in the ratio of the radial and horizontal velocity components of the fluid motion. </jats:p>",

The products of inertia are characterized by four parameters which are easily computed for every Earth model by the usual Earth tide equations. A reciprocity relation exists between two of the parameters. The Adams-Wiliamson condition is not a necessary premise of the theory. Amplitudes of nutations and tidal gravity factors are computed for three Earth models. A dissipative core-mantle coupling is introduced into the theory qualitatively. The resulting equations are expressed in the same form as those of Sasao, Okamoto and Sakai (1977). Formulae for secular changes in the Earth-Moon system due to the core-mantle friction are derived as evidences of internal consistency of the theory.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            A new technique has been developed for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of lunar core samples. According to this technique, the core sample is heated radiatively from the outside at a known rate, the temperature is measured at the surface of the coretube, and the thermal conductivity of the sample is determined by comparing the measured temperature with the theory. The technique conforms with the aims of lunar sample preservation in that the sample remains intact after the measurements. The solution, as obtained in this paper, of a thermal conduction equation for a composite circular cylinder, with zero initial temperature and a constant heat-flux at its outer boundary, provides a theoretical basis for the present technique. Because of their mathematical similarity, the corresponding problems for a composite slab or sphere were also solved and the solutions are presented for possible future application to the thermal conductivity measurements. Testing demonstrated the feasibility of the new technique. The thermal conductivity of a simulant lunar soil sample, as determined by the present technique under vacuum conditions at about 300 K for sample densities of 1.47-1.67 g cm\n            <jats:sup>-3</jats:sup>\n            , is 2.05-2.65 x 10\n            <jats:sup>-3</jats:sup>\n            W m\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            K\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            , which compares favourably with that of the same sample, 1.61-2.89 x 10\n            <jats:sup>-3</jats:sup>\n            W m\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            K\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            at sample densities of 1.50-1.75 g cm\n            <jats:sup>-3</jats:sup>\n            , as measured under similar conditions by the standard line heat source technique. We describe in detail the experimental apparatus construction and procedure; in particular, the number of precautions taken to preserve the samples from disturbances and to improve the measurement results.

Calculated spectroscopic properties (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>e</jats:sub> and ω<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>) of the diatomic hydrides are in close agreement with experiment except for the calculated harmonic force constant in PdH. This latter discrepancy is attributed to inaccuracies in the relative energies of the metal atom in the dissociation limit. The calculated M–M and M–H bond strengths follow the expected trend of the Pt atom forming stronger such bonds than Pd. The metal–hydrogen bonding interaction involves primarily the metal <jats:italic>nd</jats:italic> orbitals for both Pd and Pt, in contrast to NiH where the main metal bonding orbital has been found to be the 4<jats:italic>s</jats:italic>. On the other hand, as in Ni<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, the Pd–Pd bond is essentially a (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> + 1)<jats:italic>s</jats:italic> electron pair bond, while the Pt–Pt bond has a substantial 5<jats:italic>d</jats:italic> orbital contribution. This quantitative difference between M–M and M–H bonding interactions found for the group VIII transition metals is supported by experimental photoemission energy distribution and difference spectra for the clean metal and hydrogen chemisorbed metal surfaces.</jats:p>",
