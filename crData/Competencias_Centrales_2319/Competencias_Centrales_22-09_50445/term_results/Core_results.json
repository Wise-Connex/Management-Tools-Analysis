      "abstract": "<jats:p>For stochastic models with intractable likelihood functions, approximate Bayesian computation offers a way of approximating the true posterior through repeated comparisons of observations with simulated model outputs in terms of a small set of summary statistics. These statistics need to retain the information that is relevant for constraining the parameters but cancel out the noise. \nThey can thus be seen as thermodynamic state variables, for general stochastic models.\nFor many scientific applications, we need strictly more summary statistics than model parameters to reach a satisfactory approximation of the posterior. \nTherefore, we propose to use a latent representation of deep neural networks based on Autoencoders as summary statistics.\nTo create an incentive for the encoder to encode all the parameter-related information but not the noise, we give the decoder access to explicit or implicit information on the noise that has been used to generate the training data.\nWe validate the approach empirically on two types of stochastic models. </jats:p>"

In p53-deficient cancers with structurally altered p63 and p73, interfering with tumor cell metabolism using Pramlintide (an FDA-approved drug for type 2 diabetes) results in tumor regression. Pramlintide response is mediated through upregulation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Here, we showed that osteosarcoma cells have altered p63, p73, and p53, and decreased IAPP expression but have the two main IAPP receptors, CalcR and RAMP3, which inhibit glycolysis and induce apoptosis. We showed that in osteosarcoma cells with high- or mid-range glycolytic activity, Pramlintide decreased cell glycolysis, resulting in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro. In contrast, Pramlintide had no effect in osteosarcoma cells with low glycolytic activity. Using a subcutaneous osteosarcoma mouse model, we showed that intratumoral injection of Pramlintide-induced tumor regression. Tumor sections showed increased apoptosis and a decrease in Ki-67 and HIF-1α. These data suggest that in osteosarcoma cells with altered p53, p63, and p73 and a high glycolytic function, Pramlintide therapy can modulate metabolic programming and inhibit tumor growth.</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In August 2021, the first seismological determination of the core radius of Mars was published by the InSight team (St&amp;amp;#228;hler et al., 2021). We take this opportunity to take a mental step backwards and assume a historical perspective on the scientific investigation of planetary cores, and how our knowledge about them, especially in terms of their size, evolved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first thoughts about the Earth's interior that we would place into the history of science or rather into that of religion originate in the 17th century. Descartes suggested that the Earth is a former star which produced so many sunspots that it became encrusted in them, and that later processing of sunspot-material resulted in the surface we have today. The innermost part of the Earth, however, is still unaltered solar matter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Isaac Newton, in the posthumously published &amp;quot;System of the World&amp;quot;, suggested that the gravity of a single, isolated mountain could be used to determine the density ratio between the surface and the interior of the Earth. Respective experiments were conducted by Bouguer and, later, by Maskelyne and Hutton - the latter concluded from the result, that the presence of a heavy, metallic core could explain the overall mass of the Earth as well as the density contrast resulting from Newton's experiment. A metallic core was also suggested by Wiechert, by the end of the 19th century. When Oldham demonstrated the S wave core shadow in 1906, he did not make any suggestions about the nature of the central region.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the early 20th century, it was however doubted that any material could withstand the conditions of the deep interior, or that a segregation of metals could take place. One alternative approach was indeed solar matter, another one a metallic high pressure state of silicate rock: The possibility that the core mantle boundary is a phase boundary like the 410 and 660 km discontinuities was long supported by some.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The consequence of the phase boundary model was that neither the Moon nor Mars could have cores, for the simple reasons that they are too small to provide the necessary internal pressures. This claim fit well with the moment of inertia factors as they were observed back then: Until the mid-1960s it was assumed that the MoIF of the Moon exceeds 0.4, and that of Mars is too close to 0.4 to indicate much differentiation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In both cases, the space age led to a revision: Having spacecraft near or at the respective bodies turned out to be crucial for a sufficiently precise determination of the MoIF.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the case of Mars, the Mariner IV mission greatly improved the knowledge of radius, mass, and moment of inertia factor of the planet (because of the atmosphere, even the radius was rather uncertain and observational results depended on the optical wavelength used in photography). After Mariner IV, an iron core suddenly became feasible, if not necessary, again. Mariner VI and VII showed that Mars is neither a small Earth nor a big Moon, but something different - and the global photographic map resulting from the Mariner IX mission showed all the now familiar surface structures for the first time. With Mariner IX it also became possible to map the surface gravity, and the gravity anomaly of Tharsis was discovered - which is so enormous that it biases the J&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; gravity coefficient, and invalidates the previously used hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium. Several methods to compensate for this were suggested in the following. A replacement for the hydrostatic assumption became available with precession measurements using Viking radio signals, later augmented by Pathfinder and other missions. It became finally possible to determine the MoIF, which turned out to be significantly below that of the homogeneous sphere. The most significant progress in terms of the estimation of the core radius was however Mariner IX: After this mission, core radii below 1000 km were no longer discussed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Viking missions produced important clues for the identification of the SNC meteorites as of martian origin, and thus for improved models of the chemical composition of Mars. This provided better contraints for the densities of core and mantle. A comparison of the core radii discussed in the literature after Viking however shows that none of these models could constrain the core radius with a sufficient precision. Different models were developed, but in the long run, the range of uncertainty of the core radius proved rather stable for more than 40 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The results obtained by InSight still build upon the knowledge of geodetic and gravity measurements as well as on geochemistry, but they add seismic data as constraints that are more sensitive to the sought-after structural parameters than to density.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Listing all references relevant for the above text would require much more space than is available here.

However, the composite structures are vulnerable to impact loadings because of their exposure to, for instance, loading field carriages, flying debris, and bird strikes. This may lead to crack propagation and ultimately the structural failure. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanical behavior of sandwich composite structures under low-velocity impact. In this research, carbon fiber fabric reinforced 3D-printed thermoplastic composite of hexagonal honeycomb cores structures were fabricated with different unit cells (6, 8, and 10 mm) and varying materials (polylactic acid (PLA), PLA-Wood and PLA-Carbon). A drop weight impact test was performed under impact energies (5, 8, and 11 J) to determine the energy absorption performance of the structures whereas the surface morphology was analyzed using a high-intensity optical microscope. Comparing unit cells of materials used, it is observed that the unit cell of 8 mm is the best configuration for lightweight materials with impressive energy absorption capabilities. Under an impact energy of 11 J, the PLA-Wood of unit cell 8 mm shows 9.22 J higher in energy absorption than unit cell 10 mm which is 7.44 J due to intermediate stiffness that resists further deformation. While the filled PLA shows the PLA-Wood material offers better performance in energy absorption capability compared to PLA-Carbon. The PLA-Wood demonstrates 9.22 J more energy absorption for an unit cell 8 mm under an impact energy of 11 J than the PLA-Carbon, which is 8.49 J. This is due to the good compatibility between the hydroxyl groups of the polymer matrix and lignocellulose filler, which translates to better stiffness.</jats:p>",

The dramatic effect of the attraction of iron by lodestone (primarily magnetite, Fe3O4 with inclusions of maghemite, cubic Fe2O3) is perhaps the historic beginning of magnetism. Even though great insights into magnetism, its relation to electricity (electromagnetism) and the quantum theoretical formulation have been achieved over the last two centuries, a rigorous understanding of the microscopic origin of the magnetic field and the question of magnetic monopoles continue to pose challenges. After a brief overview of the different kinds of magnetic materials, this chapter provides a closer look at the fundamental aspects of dia- and paramagnetism, followed by a discussion of cooperative magnetic phenomena and notes on the experimental measurement of magnetic susceptibility.</jats:p>",

Development of band theory led to a deeper understanding of the distinction between metals and semiconductors and many related properties. Discussion of metals and semiconductors is followed by a brief introduction to superconductivity that involves unique electrical conduction (zero resistance) coupled with magnetic properties (perfect diamagnetism).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As mentioned in Section 1.1, solids can be classified based on various criteria such as their elemental composition, the nature of the interactions present, and their types of applications. Materials in general can also be grouped into various classes such as solids, colloids, ultrathin films, etc., based on their physical state and assembly. A wide range of techniques are used to prepare different classes of materials and even specific members of these classes. This chapter presents several key concepts that guide the synthesis and fabrication of materials; it may be noted however, that the list presented here is by no means exhaustive, in view of the emergence and continuing evolution of several specialized techniques for materials synthesis. The term ‘synthesis’ is generally used to describe the formation of new chemical entities, often through the formation of covalent bonds; it could also be used to denote the formation of ionic materials. ‘Fabrication’ is a more general term used to describe assemblies of molecular units, organization of layers or subunits of materials, construction of device structures etc. Together, these terms can be used to discuss the formation of materials with different compositions, structures, and functions.</jats:p>",

Integrating enteroblasts must generate a new apical domain and break through the septate junctions between neighbouring enterocytes, while maintaining barrier function. We observe that enteroblasts form an apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) when they reach the septate junction between the enterocytes. Cadherin clears from the apical surface and an apical space appears between above the enteroblast. New septate junctions then form laterally with the enterocytes and the AMIS develops into an apical domain below the enterocyte septate junction. The enteroblast therefore forms a pre-assembled apical compartment before it has a free apical surface in contact with the gut lumen. Finally, the enterocyte septate junction disassembles and the enteroblast/pre-enterocyte reaches the gut lumen with a fully formed brush border. The process of enteroblast integration resembles lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cysts, highlighting the similarities between the fly midgut and mammalian epithelia.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to examine how math textbooks reflect the core values stated in the curriculum. Selected by homogeneous sampling technique, the data sources of this qualitative study consisted of two (one official and one private) fifth-grade math textbooks. All elements (e.g., text, visuals, exercises, questions) in the textbooks were analyzed through content analysis technique, employing the core values as a preliminary outline. Findings revealed that the both textbooks included all the core values in the curriculum with varying frequencies across values. The most frequently reflected values were patriotism and responsibility while the least was honesty. The values of friendship, patience, justice, love, helpfulness, and respect were represented in moderate frequencies in both textbooks. The frequencies of representations regarding values were mostly parallel in official and private publications. Teachers must play a complementary role for the underrepresented values during teaching.</p>"

The construction of a fully optimized device architecture is crucial in accordance with developing high-performance materials because highly efficient electroluminescence cannot be realized without balancing both carrier injection and transport with decreasing several exciton loss processes. Thus, the detailed mechanism of carrier injection, transport, and recombination in emitting layers has to be clarified. In this study, various device architectures for a recently emerged blue TADF molecular system based on multiple donors and acceptors were systematically investigated, especially by focusing on the interlayers. This work also aims to offer guidelines for improving device stabilities.

The main purpose of the study is to reveal how chiral core shapes and sizes affect the energy absorbed by the panel, the contact force and the displacement of the impactor with a constant energy of 90 joule. Numerical studies have been carried out on square sandwich panels with three different core structures: tetrachiral, anti-tetrachiral and hexachiral. Dimensions of all panels, node diameters and ligament thicknesses of chiral structures were kept constant. Finite element models were established for core structures, panels with cell configurations of 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 for each chiral structure by changing ligament length. Johnson-Cook material model was used for the aluminum sandwich panel, and rigid and isotropic material model was used for the impactor. The effects of auxetic cell structures and cell configurations on the impact behavior of sandwich panels were discussed as a result of the analysis. The highest impact performance emerged in the hexachiral structure with 7x7 cell configuration. As a result of the study, it has been revealed that auxetic chiral structures are materials that can absorb impact energy and have an important place in the mass-performance relationship. This research will be a preliminary study for the understanding of next generation auxetic sandwich panel behaviors.</jats:p>"

The confinement of charge carriers in CSSQD with two finite confinement potentials models of the barrier materials are studied. Within the effective mass and parabolic band approximation, the 3D time-independent Schrödinger equation has been resolved. To obtain the ground state quasiparticles energies, we have used the variational technique. Our results show that the donor atom and exciton binding energy, as well as the electron energy, strongly depend on the core radius, first shell thickness, confinement potentials of the barrier materials, and their structures (A and B). Moreover, the confinement potential effect of the first material on the energies is more pronounced when their thickness is large and the core radius is small. So, the external potential effect is more significant when the first shell thickness and potential are small. Also, The binding energy of an on-center (off-center) donor atom is greater (weaker) than that of the exciton, whatever the structure of the confinement potential. In addition, the transition from a type-A to a type-B confinement system has been observed. The findings might be used to modify the electronic and excitonic properties in nanomaterials science.</jats:p>"

In this work, we report on the density functional study of its atomic-scale configurations, electronic and magnetic properties, and adsorption mechanism, which have not been well understood in previous experimental studies. We propose various atomic-scale models, including simple nontwisted and low-strain twisted interfaces, and analyze their energetical stability by performing structural optimizations using the van der Waals interactions of both DFT-D2 and optB86b-vdW functionals. The binding energy of the most stable structure reached EB=−0.22 eV/atom for DFT-D2 (EB=−0.19 eV/atom for optB86b-vdW). The calculated FePd-graphene spacing distance was approximately 2 Å, which successfully reproduced the experimental value. We also find out characteristic behaviors: the modulation of π-bands, the suppression of the site-dependence of adsorption energy, and the rise of moiré-like corrugated buckling. In addition, our atomic structure is expected to help build low-cost computational models for investigating the physical properties of L10 alloys/two-dimensional interfaces.</jats:p>",

The heat removal feature (e.g., thermal conduction) of a transformer is complex because there exist multiple loss centers. The bulk of total power loss is concentrated around a small segment of the core assembly where windings are overlaid. The primary winding is most constrained thermally. For superior use of core and copper, the temperature rise in different segments of the transformer should be well below their respective safe operating limits. In practice, cores of same soft-magnetic materials are traditionally used. To achieve superior temperature profile and for better long-term performance, this article proposes to use the mixed-core configuration. The new core(s) would replace the parent ones from the segment where windings are laid. The characteristic features of new cores would share increased burden of heat removal from the transformer. To obtain the qualitative insight of magnetic and thermal performance, the proposed mixed-core transformer would be thoroughly validated practically in two different high-power applications. In the first case, the core is always energized to its rated value, and in the second one, windings are always energized at respective rated current capacity.</jats:p>"

Mechanisms for sporophyte branching are well known in Arabidopsis, where branch initiation and plastic branch outgrowth require directional auxin transport by PIN proteins. However, no broadly applicable genetic mechanisms for branching in vascular plants are known. We have used a combination of surgical and pharmacological treatments and <jats:italic>PIN</jats:italic> expression analyses in the lycophyte <jats:italic>Selaginella kraussiana</jats:italic> to identify PIN-mediated auxin transport as the ancestral mechanism for branching within vascular plants. We show that shortrange auxin transport out of the shoot tips promotes branching, and that branch dominance is coordinated by long-range auxin transport throughout the shoot system. Moreover, the plastic outgrowth of a branch from a unique organ system innovated in lycophytes (the rhizophore) is regulated by long-range auxin transport and associated with a transitory drop in <jats:italic>PIN</jats:italic> expression. We conclude that an ancestral mechanism for branching was independently recruited into plastic branch outgrowth in lycophytes and seed plants. Considered in conjunction with data from other species, our results highlight a pivotal role for the co-option of PINs into the evolution of branching in diverse plant forms.</jats:p>"

However, geophysical inferences have been challenging due to the lack of seismological probes sensitive to the Earth’s center. Here, by stacking waveforms recorded by a growing number of global seismic stations, we observe up-to-fivefold reverberating waves from selected earthquakes along the Earth's diameter. Differential travel times of these “exotic” arrival pairs, hitherto unreported in seismological literature, complement and improve currently available information. The inferred transversely isotropic inner-core model contains a ~ 650-km thick innermost ball with P-wave speeds ~ 4% slower at ~ 50° from the Earth’s rotation axis. In contrast, the inner core’s outer shell displays much weaker anisotropy with the slowest direction in the equatorial plane. Our findings strengthen the evidence for an anisotropically-distinctive innermost inner core and its transition to a weakly anisotropic outer shell, which could be a fossilized record of a significant global event from the past.</jats:p>"

However, thermal phonons—the primary heat carriers in dielectric nanomaterials—dissipate the thermal energy after just a few hundred nanometers. Theory predicts that the mean free path of surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs) can be hundreds of micrometers, which may improve the overall dissipation of heat in nanomaterials. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such long-distance heat transport by SPhPs. Using the 3ω technique, we measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN nanomembranes for different heater-sensor distances, membrane thicknesses, and temperatures. We find that thin nanomembranes support heat transport by SPhPs, as evidenced by an increase in the thermal conductivity with temperature. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity measured 200 μm away from the heater is consistently higher than that measured 100 μm closer. This result suggests that heat conduction by SPhPs is quasi-ballistically over at least hundreds of micrometers. Our findings pave the way for coherent heat manipulations above room temperature over macroscopic distances, which impacts the applications in thermal management and polaritonics.</jats:p>",

It is however unclear whether the policy can reduce banking risk in the midst of easing or relaxation policies. This research employed secondary data taken from the Indonesian banking statistics published by OJK. Indicators of bank performance used in the study referred to the policies of the OJK and comprised: capital adequacy ratio, core capital ratio to riskweighted asset, return on assets ratio, operational efficiency ratio, net interest margin ratio, loans to deposits ratio, and liquid assets ratio. The performance index analysis was divided into two periods: January 2017- February 2020 and March 2020 - February 2021. The period was divided to determine the quality of bank performance before and after the stipulation of restructuring policy. The index calculation was carried out by determining the weight based on the dimensions (bank performance indicators). The weight given to each of these indicators was conformed to all indicators. The analysis of the bank performance used the composite index of development calculation. Based on the results, the availability of bank capital affected financial performance. The implementation of countercyclical policies had an impact on bank performance in banks that had greater availability of capital. Banks can evaluate and improve strategies in countercyclical implementation to support national economic recovery.\r\nKeywords: core capital, CAR, CCR to RWA, ROA, OER, NIMR, LDR</jats:p>"

Unnecessary treatments from overdiagnosis are a significant concern, particularly low-grade disease. Active surveillance has being considered as a risk management strategy to avoid potential side effects by unnecessary radical treatment. In 2016, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) endorsed the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Clinical Practice Guideline on active surveillance for the management of localized prostate cancer. Based on this guideline, we developed a deep learning model to classify prostate adenocarcinoma into indolent (applicable for active surveillance) and aggressive (necessary for definitive therapy) on core needle biopsy whole slide images (WSIs). In this study, we trained deep learning models using a combination of transfer, weakly supervised, and fully supervised learning approaches using a dataset of core needle biopsy WSIs (n=1300). We evaluated the models on a test set (n=645), achieving ROC-AUCs 0.846 (indolent) and 0.980 (aggressive).

Nonetheless, finding microbes with profound impacts on fish’s performance out of thousands of candidate species remains a major challenge. We here show that time-series analyses of microbial population dynamics illuminate core components and structure of fish-associated microbiomes. By targeting eel aquaculture microbiomes as model systems, we reconstructed the population dynamics of 9,605 bacterial and 303 archaeal species/strains across 128 days. Due to the remarkable increase/decrease of constituent microbial populations, the taxonomic compositions of microbiomes changed drastically through time. We then found that some specific microbial taxa showed positive relationship with eels’ activity level even after excluding cofounding effects of environmental parameters (pH and dissolved oxygen level) on population dynamics. In particular, a vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>-producing bacteria,<jats:italic>Cetobacterium somerae</jats:italic>, consistently showed strong positive associations with eels’ activity level across the replicate time-series of the five aquaculture tanks. Network theoretical and metabolic modeling analyses further suggested that the highlighted bacterium formed compartments of close microbe-to-microbe interactions with some other bacterial taxa, forming potential core microbiomes with positive impacts on eels. Overall, these results suggest that integration of microbiology, ecological theory, and network science allows us to explore core species and interactions embedded within complex dynamics of fish-associated microbiomes.</jats:p>"

One of the main barriers preventing outflow of corium into the environment is a melt localization device or a melt trap.  The  melt  trap  must  accept  and  prevent  the  corium  parameters  from  exceeding  critical  values,  ensuring  its retention  in  a  controlled  volume  and  cooling.  For  this  reason,  melt  traps  are  subject  to  serious  requirements regarding  cooling  methods  to  ensure  effective  containment  of  the  melt  in  the  core  of  a  nuclear  reactor.  In  the presented  article,  experimental  studies  of  the  interaction  between  corium  and  water,  which was  supplied  to  the surface of the corium in a melt trap for its cooling, were analyzed. As a result of the work, a number of significant problems associated with the low efficiency of this cooling method were identified, and possible ways to eliminate them were considered. A solution is proposed for optimizing the method of corium cooling in a melt trap, as well as for the scope of research on the possibility of implementing the proposed method in practice and analyzing its effectiveness using the VCG-135 test-bench and the Lava-B facility.</jats:p>",

Several real-time protocols have been proposed, for both static and dynamic scheduling approaches in single and multi-core processors. One of the main factors for performance efficiency in such protocols is the way they are implement within a real-time operating system (RTOS). \nIn this paper we present an object-oriented design of real-time access protocols considering single and multi-core systems and also suspension- and spin-based protocols (7 protocols in total). Our design aims at reducing the run-time overhead and increasingcode re-usability. By implementing the proposed design in an RTOS and running the protocols in a modern multi-core processor, we provide an analysis regarding the memory footprint, run-time overhead, and the impact of the overhead into the schedulability analysis of synthetically generated task sets. Our results indicate that proper implementation provides low run-time overhead (up to 6.1 us) and impact on the schedulability of real-time tasks.</jats:p>"

Findings revealed that the both textbooks included all the core values in the curriculum with varying frequencies across values. The most frequently reflected values were patriotism and responsibility while the least was honesty. The values of friendship, patience, justice, love, helpfulness, and respect were represented in moderate frequencies in both textbooks. The frequencies of representations regarding values were mostly parallel in official and private publications.

The Goedecker, Teter and Hutter (GTH) formalism is adopted with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE). The 4f-in-core pseudopotentials are built through attributing 4f-subconfiguration 4fn (n = 1 – 14) for Ln (Ln = Ce – Lu) into the atomic core region, making it possible to circumvent the difficulty of description of open 4fn valence shell. A wide variety of computational benchmarks and tests have been carried out on lanthanide systems including Ln3+-containing molecular complexes, aqueous solutions, and bulk solids, to validate the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the optimized 4f-in-core GTH pseudopotentials and basis sets. The 4f-in-core GTH pseudopotentials successfully replicate main features of lanthanide structural chemistry and reaction energetics, particularly for non-redox reactions. The chemical bonding features of selected lanthanide systems are also discussed in details by utilizing these new 4f-in-core GTH pseudopotentials. This work bridges the idea of keeping highly localized 4f electrons in atomic core and efficient pseudopotential formalism of GTH, thus providing a highly efficient approach for studying lanthanide chemistry in multi-scale modeling of constituent-wise and structurally complicated systems, including electronic structures of condensed phase and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations.</jats:p>"

Recently, more states of media beyond gas (e.g., atomic cluster and liquid) via photo-ionization have brought new experimental observations of THz radiation, which can no longer be simply attributed to the mainstream model of the transition-Cherenkov radiation (TCR), thus making the whole picture unclear. Here, we revisited the mechanism of this dynamic process in a new view of the traveling-wave antenna (TWA) model. By successfully reproducing the reported far-field THz radiation profiles from various plasma filament arrangements, the wide applicability of the TWA theory has been revealed. On the other hand in the microscopic view, we investigated the plasma oscillation during filamentation aiming at further bridging the plasma filament and the antenna. Accordingly, THz-plasma resonance has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated as the elementary THz emitter, paving the way towards fully understanding this important single-color plasma based THz source.</jats:p>"

In this research, a magnetostrictive device with pure nickel conical core with cone angle of 30 degrees was constructed. The observed sound pressure level was used as a measure of transducer performance. Also the ability of the device to reduce the residual pesticide on cucumber surface due to cavitation was evaluated. The results showed that the sound pressure from simulation by JMAG-Designer software is almost the same as the sound pressure produced in the constructed transducer. To assess the performance of the device in removing residual pesticide from cucumber surface and evaluate the changes in peel texture of cucumber, the GC and SEM methods were used, respectively. The GC results showed that with 20 min treatment, the removal of pesticide based on height and chromatogram area were 75% and 83%, respectively. The SEM results showed that by increasing the treatment time, the stomatal pore area reduced from 144.74 \\({\\mu m}^{2}\\) (reference) to 30.56 \\({\\mu m}^{2}\\) (20 min treatment). This results are promising, hence further research is suggested towards enhancing the device for commercial use in biomaterials processing operations such as cleaning and removing pesticides from fruits and vegetables.</jats:p>"

The sensing performance of the proposed sensor in the visible to near infrared (800–1300 nm) region for detecting low refractive index analytes is numerically investigated. The finite element method (FEM) is used to design and study the influence of different structure parameters by the optical loss spectrum on the sensing performance of the sensor. The chemically stable plasmonic material tantalum (Ta) is used to produce excitation between the core and plasmonic modes. On a pure silica (SiO2) substrate, a rectangular structured dual core is used to facilitate the coupling strength between the cores and the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode and thus improves the sensing performance. By tuning the geometric parameters, simulation results show a maximum wavelength sensitivity of 10400 nm/RIU (Refractive Index Unit) for analyte refractive indices ranging from 1.25 to 1.39. The sensor also attains a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 35.25 /RIU and fine refractive index resolution of 9.615 × 10 −6 RIU. Owing to Ta chemical stability, low cost, simple structure, high sensitivity, relatively high FOM and improved sensing resolution, the proposed sensor is suited for real-time, inexpensive and accurate detection of biomedical and biological analytes, bimolecular, and hazardous corrosive gases.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Psychology suffers from the absence of mathematically-formalized primitives. As a result, conceptual and quantitative studies lack an ontological basis that would situate them in the company of natural sciences. The article addresses this problem by describing a minimal psychic structure, expressed in the algebra of quantum theory. The structure is demarcated into categories of emotion and color, renowned as elementary psychological phenomena. This is achieved by means of quantum-theoretic qubit state space, isomorphic to emotion and color experiences both in meaning and math. In particular, colors are mapped to the qubit states through geometric affinity between the HSL-RGB color solids and the Bloch sphere, widely used in physics. The resulting correspondence aligns with the recent model of subjective experience, producing a unified spherical map of emotions and colors. This structure is identified as a semantic atom of natural thinking—a unit of affectively-colored personal meaning, involved in elementary acts of a binary decision. The model contributes to finding a unified ontology of both inert and living Nature, bridging previously disconnected fields of research. In particular, it enables theory-based coordination of emotion, decision, and cybernetic sciences, needed to achieve new levels of practical impact.</jats:p>"

There are no medications approved for the treatment of these symptoms, and medications used to treat non-specific symptoms have serious side effects. To identify potential drugs for repurposing to effectively treat ASD core symptoms, we studied ASD risk genes within networks of protein-protein interactions of gene products. We first defined an ASD network from network-based analyses, and identified approved drugs known to interact with proteins within this network. Thereafter, we evaluated if these drugs can change ASD-associated gene expression perturbations in genes in the ASD network. This was done by analyses of drug-induced versus ASD-associated gene expression, where opposite gene expression perturbations in drug versus ASD indicate that the drug could counteract ASD-associated perturbations. Four drugs showing significant (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05) opposite gene expression perturbations in drug versus ASD were identified: Loperamide, bromocriptine, drospirenone, and progesterone. These drugs act on ASD-related biological systems, indicating that these drugs could effectively treat ASD core symptoms.

The article illustrates the application of the method to construct a scale with a larger range of latent abilities, using fewer additional comparisons compared to the standard method of pairwise comparisons.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A flight-proven electrical bus system for the 1U CubeSat platform was designed in the BIRDS satellite program at the Kyushu Institute of Technology. The bus utilizes a backplane board as the mechanical and electrical interface between the subsystems and the payloads. The electrical routes on the backplane are configured by software using a complex programmable logic device (CPLD). It allows for reusability in multiple CubeSat projects while lowering costs and development time; as a result, resources can be directed toward developing the mission payloads. Lastly, it provides more time for integration and system-level verification, which are critical for a reliable and successful mission. The current trend of CubeSat launches is focused on 3U and 6U platforms due to their capability to accommodate multiple and complex payloads. Hence, a demonstration of the electrical bus system to adapt to larger platforms is necessary. This study demonstrates the configurable electrical interface board’s scalability in two cases: the capability to accommodate (1) multiple missions and (2) complex payload requirements. In the first case, a 3U-size configurable backplane prototype was designed to handle 13 mission payloads. Four CPLDs were used to manage the limited number of digital interfaces between the existing bus system and the mission payloads. The measured transmission delay was up to 20 ns, which is acceptable for simple serial communications such as UART and SPI. Furthermore, the measured energy consumption of the backplane per ISS orbit was only 28 mWh. Lastly, the designed backplane was proven to be highly reliable as no bit errors were detected throughout the functionality tests. In the second case, a configurable backplane was implemented in a 6U CubeSat with complex payload requirements compared to the 1U CubeSat platform. The CubeSat was deployed in ISS orbit, and the initial on-orbit results indicated that the designed backplane supported missions without issues.</jats:p>"

SAL is being developed in preparation to receive samples from sample return missions such as JAXA Hayabusa 2 and MMX missions, the Chinese Chang-E 5 and 6 missions as well as the NASA Osiris-REX mission. SAL will be focusing on spectroscopic, geochemical, mineralogical analyses at microscopic level with the ultimate aim to derive information on the formation and evolution of planetary bodies and surfaces, search for traces of organic materials or even traces of extinct or extant life and presence of water.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SAL will be set up in a cleanroom environment, and equipped with a vis-IR-microscope (Bruker Hyperion 2000), a Malvern Panalytical Empyrean X-ray diffraction (XRD) system with Bragg-Brentano geometry which can be switched to parallel beam geometry, equipped with a Cu K&amp;amp;#945; source, 1Der detector and automated incident beam optics, a Field Emission &amp;amp;#8211; scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), a JEOL iHP200F Field Emission &amp;amp;#8211; electron microprobe analyzer (FE-EMPA), petrographic and stereo microscopes, and a glovebox. All samples will be stored under nitrogen gas and dedicated nitrogen filled shuttles will be used for transporting samples between the instruments to avoid them to enter in contact with the external environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In collaboration with the Natural History Museum in Berlin, SAL will also have the expertise and facilities for carrying out curation of sample return material which will be made available for the whole European scientific community. DLR is already curating a 0.45 mg of Lunar regolith collected from the Luna 24 Soviet mission and the first analyses of the material are being planned. SAL will be a distributed European sample analysis and curation facility as discussed in the preliminary recommendation of EuroCares. Like other laboratory facilities at the DLR Institute of Planetary Research (such PSL and RMBL) which are part of the Europlanet RI, the new SAL will be from the start open to the scientific community. Our goal is to establish, also thanks to the support from the Geo.X research network, an excellence centre for sample analysis in Berlin within the next 5-10 years building on our collaborations with the Natural History Museum in Berlin, the Helmholtz Centre Berlin and local universities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

To further explore these differences, in a cooperative game theory context, we experiment to compare the outcomes resulting from human participants’ behavior to those generated by a cooperative game theory solution mechanism called the core partition. Our experiment uses an interactive simulation of a glove game, a particular type of cooperative game, to collect the participant’s decision choices and their resultant outcomes. Two different glove games are considered, and the outputs from 62 trial games are analyzed. The experiment’s outcomes show that core coalitions, which are coalitions in a core partition, are found in about 42% of games. Though this number may seem low, a trial’s outcome is more complex than whether the human player finds a core coalition or not. Finding the core coalition depends on factors such as the other possible feasible solutions and the payoffs available from these solutions. These factors, and the complexity they generate, are discussed in the paper.</jats:p>"

In a stenosed artery, the fluid flow going through two regions (specifically, the Peripheral and Core) is considered to be most illustrated by a two-layered model. The fluid in the peripheral layer is a Newtonian fluid, whereas the micropolar fluid containing nanoparti-cles in the core region performs as a non-Newtonian fluid. The closed expressions of flow characteristics, like axial velocity profile, flow resistance , shear stress, temperature profile and concentration distribution. Effect of Permeability on Micropolar Fluid with Nanoparticles are found to determine the governing equations using Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM) with the assumption of mild stenosis. The significance of flow properties on flow conformation, wall shear stress and velocity profiles are discussed graphically. A remarkable conclusion is that, the axial velocity profile with the increase of local nanopar-ticle Grashof number (Br) is found increasing in the region −0.5 to 0.5 and decreasing in the other region. To investigate the properties and fluid flow pattern of momentum transfer, streamlines are drawn.MSC Classification: 92C10 , 76Z05</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since becoming a national user facility in 2007, the type of irradiation campaigns the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) supports has become much more diverse and complex. In prior years, test complexity was limited by the computational ability to analyze the tests’ influence on the fuel. Large volume tests are irradiated in flux traps which are designed to receive excess neutrons from the surrounding fuel elements. Typically, fuel elements drive the test conditions, not vice versa. The computational tool, PDQ, was used for core physics analysis for decades. The PDQ code was adequate so long as the diffusion approximation between test and fuel element remained valid. This paradigm changed with the introduction of the Ki-Jang Research Reactor—Fuel Assembly Irradiation (KJRR-FAI) in 2015. The KJRR-FAI was a prototypic fuel element for the KJRR research reactor project in the Republic of Korea. The KJRR-FAI irradiation presented multiple modeling and simulation challenges for which PDQ was ill suited. To demonstrate that the KJRR-FAI could be irradiated and meet safety requirements, the modern neutron transport codes, HELIOS and MCNP, were extensively verified and validated to replace PDQ. The hybrid 3D/2D methodology devised with these codes made analysis of the ATR with KJRR-FAI possible. The KJRR-FAI was irradiated in 2015-2016.</jats:p>"

Understanding the role of metallic core dissipation is key to understanding the habitability of Europa and Ganymede, the potential for a magma ocean on Io, and the history of Callisto. Future measurements by NASA&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Europa Clipper&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and ESA&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;JUICE&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; spacecraft will help to unravel the contributions of core dissipation to these global heat budgets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DISSIPATIVE CORE PLAUSIBILITY&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Observations of Io indicate a metal-rich core (e.g. Van Hoolst et al., 2020). At Europa, Schubert et al. (2009) infer that a metallic core is both permitted and likely, though a core is not uniquely required (Bills et al., 2009). Ganymede&amp;amp;#8217;s intrinsic magnetic field provides strong evidence for a metallic core (Schubert et al., 1996). Callisto, however, is likely only partially differentiated, with a dense rocky/metal core and a lighter silicate mantle (e.g. Bagenal et al., 2007). &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 1&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; shows constraints on core state for Europa.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;472&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;338&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 1: &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;For an example Europa,&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;Bulk density (thick) and Moment of Inertia (thin, dashed) constraints (Casajus et al., 2020).

Newtonian creep likely dominates at the low pressures of the Galilean satellites cores (Van Orman, 2004), and pure iron viscosities (Birch, 1952) are in the range of 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8211;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;20 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Pa s, depending on temperature and grain size (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 2&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;366&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;308&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 2&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Pure iron rheology (Birch, 1952) as a function of temperature and grain size.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We estimate dissipated power from the tidal response of Io, Europa, and Ganymede using a Maxwell rheology (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 3&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). We find that core dissipation at Io and Europa can exceed that of their outer viscoelastic layers. At Ganymede, the heat flux contribution from the iron core is less than the radiogenic contribution. However, concentrated at the core-mantle boundary, the heat flux is likely sufficient to sustain continued or episodic melting of the metallic core.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;779&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;778&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 3: &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;(Left) contours of surface-averaged tidal heat flux as a function of layer viscosity.

However, these values are many orders of magnitude lower than the lowest inferred for Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s partially molten asthenosphere (~10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;19 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Pa s; e.g. Dixon et al., 2004) and cannot support the mantle convection associated with high magma eruption temperatures (Moore et al., 2003). The presence of a pervasive &amp;amp;#8220;magma ocean&amp;amp;#8221; has been proposed to explain discrepancies (e.g. Khurana et al., 2011).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If Io experiences significant core heating, then a rock viscosity consistent with that of Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s mantle (10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;19 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Pa s) and core viscosity of ~10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Pa s can explain the observed heat flux without requiring a magma ocean or low-viscosity mantle (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 3&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Periodic Resurfacing and Dynamos at Europa and Ganymede: &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;Europa&amp;amp;#8217;s young surface and Ganymede&amp;amp;#8217;s terrain dichotomy reflect episodic resurfacing. While dissipation within ice shell would allow rapid changes within those layers, heat conductively diffuses from the core slowly (~10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8211;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Gyr). Rapid transport may occur through solid-state mantle convection and/or rock melting and ascent from the CMB &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(Figure 4)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Additionally, core melting causes the tidal response to decouple from the solid body (Henning and Hurford, 2014), decimating dissipation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The timescales for core melting and freezing, the onset and cessation of thermal convection, and the onset and ascent of melting at depth may compete to create an episodicity in seafloor heat flux, and may modulate the response to episodic changes to the orbital configurations of the satellites. Changes in heat flux may drive resurfacing through induced changes in the ice shell thickness and geodynamic state (Nimmo, 2004), and rotational coupling to the interior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Callisto&amp;amp;#8217;s lack of evidence for resurfacing and sustained (un-forced) orbital eccentricity may reflect the absence of a dissipative iron core, and inefficiency of icy dissipation within the satellite.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Observational Predictions:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If core dissipation is meaningful today, it may be observable in the phase lag difference between &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 1&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;). In the absence of a phase lag offset, we predict that the present-day core may be partially molten, decoupling it from the solid body and decreasing dissipation, potentially producing an intrinsic magnetic field. If an iron core is responsible for Io&amp;amp;#8217;s observed high heat flux, we expect the real part of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to reflect a solid body (~0.09) rather than a body with an internal fluid layer (~0.5) per Bierson and Nimmo (2016).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;396&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;480&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 4: &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;Europa&amp;amp;#8217;s (surface-averaged) seafloor heat flux (orange dashed line) responds to periodic changes in core dissipation (solid orange line).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since the era of Messenger, many observational constraints on Mercury&amp;amp;#8217;s thermal evolution and magnetic field have strengthened the idea that the outermost layer of Mercury&amp;amp;#8217;s fluid core is stably stratified. The presence of such a stably stratified zone can significantly alter the core flow compared to the flow in a completely homogeneous fluid core. This is on the one hand because stratified layers can impede fluid motions that are parallel to the density gradient, which in the case of Mercury would mean that radial flows are strongly suppressed. On the other hand this is because a stably stratified layer can support different types of waves that are affected by the buoyancy force.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study we have created a numerical model to investigate flow in Mercury&amp;amp;#8217;s fluid outer core that includes a radial background stratification. The exact structure of the density profile in the planet&amp;amp;#8217;s core is unknown, and we assume profiles based on recent findings of the interior evolution of the planet. We studied core flow that is excited by Mercury&amp;amp;#8217;s librations, oscillations of the mean rotation rate due to the solar gravitational torque acting on Mercury&amp;amp;#8217;s triaxial shape. Based on the work by Rekier et. al. (2019) we represent the librational forcing by the superposition of three different decoupled motions: a horizontal component, which represents the viscous drag of the core fluid by the librating mantle and spherical inner core, and two radial components that are representing the radial push that the core flow would experience due to the librating triaxial boundaries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We show that especially the second component has a profound effect, inducing a large non-axisymmetric flow close to the core-mantle boundary. It turns out that even though the origin of said flow is radial, the horizontal component of the flow is far larger than it&amp;amp;#8217;s radial counterpart. This indicates that the stratified layer acts to convert radial motions into strong horizontal motions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We show how the strength and existence of this flow depend on the strength of the stratification of the layer and discuss implications of this flow for the magnetic field.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rekier, J., Trinh, A., Triana, S.

This method is used to consider the effects of teethes on both the rotor and stator with mathematical method based on integration moreover saturation effect is neglected. This analytical method is implemented for magnetic field calculations in E-core FSPMBM with outer rotor with any combination of rotor-and stator-pole number at no load. To calculate distribution of flux density, initially, the stator and rotor iron is assumed to be infinitely permeable and Maxwell equations are provided then use the boundary conditions at intersection of two sub-regions to find the unknown coefficients for extracting changes of flux density in airgap with respect to each angle and radios. In order to validate the extracted results, the proposed model results are compared with those obtained from finite element method (FEM).</jats:p>"

Though core values may appear to be simple and obvious, supporting them at work can be more complex and difficult than expected. These values are not only ethical and moral, but also social and cultural; they are intrinsically related to the same factors that promote health across the globe, including family, community, and work. Three seminars outlined the nature and importance of core values within occupational health and well-being; these sessions were held during the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) conferences between 2015 and 2020. A non-exhaustive, literature review explored these findings further. Perspectives from international, national, and local occupational health programs have begun to demonstrate how core values underpin workers’ well-being. These essential core values impact worker health positively when they are included and respected, and negatively when they are missing or corrupted. Within occupational safety and health (OSH), people’s awareness of these values and their importance at work is now clearly emerging, offering opportunities to honor and protect each worker and help them to experience their core values through their work.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A method is proposed which aims at reducing the numbers of look-up table (LUT) elements in logic circuits of Mealy finite state machines (FSMs). The FSMs with twofold state assignment are discussed. The reduction is achieved due to using two cores of LUTs for generating partial Boolean functions. One core is based on maximum binary state codes. The second core uses extended state codes. Such an approach allows reducing the number of LUTs in the block of state codes’ transformation. The proposed approach leads to LUT-based Mealy FSM circuits having three levels of logic blocks. Each partial function for any core is represented by a single-LUT circuit. A formal method is proposed for redistribution of states between these cores. An example of synthesis is shown to explain peculiarities of the proposed method. An example of state redistribution is given. The results of experiments conducted with standard benchmarks show that the double-core approach produces LUT-based FSM circuits with better area-temporal characteristics than they are for circuits produced by other investigated methods (Auto and One-hot of Vivado, JEDI, and twofold state assignment). Both the LUT counts and maximum operating frequencies are improved. The gain in LUT counts varies from 5.74% to 36.92%, and the gain in frequency varies from 5.42% to 12.4%. These improvements are connected with a very small growth of the power consumption (less than 1%). The advantages of the proposed approach increase as the number of FSM inputs and states increases.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (EP) has improved significantly in the last few decades, and RCTs remain the mainstay of assessing the effectiveness and safety of treatments. The pooling of individual RCT data is likely to provide the best evidence to inform clinical practice. However, currently published data in ectopic pregnancy has reported many different outcomes, which are themselves often defined and measured in distinct ways. </jats:p><jats:p> The lack of consensus and level of variation results in an inability to compare the results of individual RCTs, and consequently directly impacts the usefulness of research to inform patients and clinicians in clinical practice. </jats:p><jats:p> Aim: The development of a core outcome set to ensure outcomes important to key stakeholders are collected consistently will guide future research in ectopic pregnancy. </jats:p><jats:p> Methods and Analysis: We have established an international steering group of stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals with lived experience with EP. We have identified potential outcomes from a comprehensive literature review of published randomised controlled trials. We have utilised a modified Delphi method to prioritize outcomes. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: Key stakeholders have been invited to score potential core outcomes on a nine-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not important) to 9 (critical). 424 enrolled participants, with 86% completing round 1, comprising of 117 (32%) healthcare professionals, 237(64%) individuals with lived experience, 14(4%) researchers. Highly rates outcomes included the resolution of EP, psychological impact, and future fertility outcomes. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusion: Repeated reflection and rescoring should promote whole and individual stakeholder group convergence towards consensus ‘core’ outcomes over 3 rounds. Implementation of a core outcome set will enable collection and reporting of data in a standardised fashion. This will allow standardisation of research to guide and inform clinical practice and enhance patient centred care. </jats:p>",

We analyzed the association of sniffing with the timing of urine spraying and scraping, and differences in these behaviors based on sex, age, and captive environment to understand the olfactory communication among cheetahs. Both scent-markings were strongly associated with sniffing, especially scraping, and the presence or absence of scent was thought to be a trigger. Both behaviors were observed only in adults; scraping was observed only in males. To our knowledge, this study was first to confirm the discharge of secretions from the anal glands during scraping. The frequencies of both behaviors were significantly higher in males kept in shared enclosures containing other individuals than in males kept in monopolized enclosures, while there was no difference in the frequencies among females. Female cheetahs are solitary and have non-exclusive home range, whereas male cheetahs are either solitary or live in coalition groups and there are territorial and non-territorial males. Our results could be attributed to the differences in sociality between the sexes and effect of the living environment.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we used ∼48 fluorescent oligonucleotide probes that can bind to an individual <jats:italic>Clock</jats:italic> mRNA molecule, which can then be detected as a diffraction-limited spot. Further, we developed a machine learning-based approach for 3-D cell segmentation, based on a pretrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, to automatically identify the cytoplasm and nuclei of clock neurons. We combined our segmentation model with a spot counting algorithm to detect <jats:italic>Clock</jats:italic> mRNA spots in individual clock neurons. Our results demonstrate that the number of <jats:italic>Clock</jats:italic> mRNA molecules cycle in large ventral lateral clock neurons (lLNvs) with peak levels at ZT4 (4 hours after lights are turned on) with ~80 molecules/neuron and trough levels at ZT16 with ∼30 molecules/neuron.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Observations from the Cassini spacecraft imply the presence of a global salty ocean underneath Enceladus&amp;amp;#8217; ice shell, with ongoing hydrothermal activity at its seafloor. Previous numerical simulations showed that convection in Enceladus&amp;amp;#8217; unconsolidated core generates enough dissipation to sustain the ocean and produces a strongly heterogeneous heat flow pattern at the seafloor that looks promising for explaining the surface ice topography. Yet, how the ocean in-between connects the deeper core to the surface ice shell is unknown. The dynamics of the ocean is thus the missing piece of the Enceladus puzzle towards a fully self-consistent model of the heat transfer in this moon. We fill this gap by performing 3D numerical simulations of the buried ocean of Enceladus. We show that, for the strongly heterogeneous heat flow pattern expected at the seafloor from the unconsolidated core model, azimuthal deflection of strongly localised plumes by the Coriolis force inhibits the heat transfer at low latitudes. The resulting heat flow pattern at the ocean/ice interface is qualitatively consistent with the surface ice topography and in decent quantitative agreement with an ice shell model derived from observations. Using passively advected tracers particles, we predict rising times for hydrothermal products of the order of 1-2 months, in line with previous observations-based predictions. We are thus now able to draw a complete self-consistent model of the heat transfer in Enceladus, explaining the global characteristics of this moon: global ocean, strong dissipation, reduced ice-shell thickness at the south pole and seafloor activity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Such a strong heterogeneity of rocks makes it difficult to estimate the effective moduli by traditional models in theory. In the present study, a Mori-Tanaka (MT) model considering the shape and orientation of inclusion minerals obtained by the micro-CT is established, and then it is applied to evaluate the anisotropic parameters of shales. In the MT model, the principal radii and Eulerian angles of the ellipsoidal inclusion are obtained by solving its inertia matrix through the micro-CT. According to these inclusion information, we make statistics on the ratio of average principal radii and the distribution of Eulerian angles of inclusions with different minerals. In what follows, the effective elastic stiffness matrix of shale samples is predicted by the MT model, and the corresponding digital core is input for finite element method (FEM) analysis to verify the accuracy of the theoretical results. It is shown that the anisotropy of the elastic stiffness matrix predicted by the MT model and FEM is consistent under two sizes of representative volume elements. These findings are potential for applications in rock mechanics, civil engineering and oil exploitation, etc.</jats:p>"

Applications of sandwich-structured composites have attracted increasing interest in modern lightweight design and in the construction of dynamic loading regimes due to their high resistance against blast and ballistic impacts. The functional properties of such composites are determined by the interplay of their face sheet material and the employed core topology. The core topology is the most important parameter affecting the structural behavior of sandwich composites. Therefore, this contribution presents a thorough numerical investigation of different core topologies in sandwich-structured composites subjected to blast loading. Special emphasis is put on prismatic and lattice core topologies displaying auxetic and classical non-auxetic deformation characteristics in order to illustrate the beneficial properties of auxetic core topologies. Their dynamic responses, elastic and plastic deformations, failure mechanisms, and energy absorption capabilities are numerically analyzed and compared. The numerical studies are performed by means of the commercial finite element code ABAQUS/Explicit, including a model for structural failure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Research on best practices in theory assessment highlights that testing theories is challenging because they inherit a new set of auxiliary assumptions as soon as they are linked to a specific methodology. In this article, we integrate and build on this line of work by demonstrating the breadth of these challenges. In particular, we show that tracking auxiliary assumptions is difficult because they are made at different stages of theory testing and at multiple levels of a theory. We focus on these issues in a reanalysis of a seminal study and its replications, both of which use a simple working-memory paradigm and a mainstream computational modeling approach. These studies provide the main evidence for ‘discrete-slot’ recognition models of visual working-memory, and are still used as the basis for how to measure performance in popular visual working-memory tasks. In our reanalysis, we find that core practical auxiliary assumptions were unchecked and violated; the original model comparison metrics and data were not diagnostic in several experiments. Furthermore, we find that models were not matched on their ‘theory-general’ auxiliary assumptions, indicating that the tested models were restricted, and not matched in theoretical scope. After testing these auxiliary assumptions and identifying diagnostic testing conditions, we find evidence for the opposite conclusion. That is, continuous resource models outperform discrete-slot models. Together, our work demonstrates why tracking and testing auxiliary assumptions remains a fundamental challenge, even in prominent studies led by careful, computationally-minded researchers. Our work also serves as a conceptual guide on how to identify and test the gamut of auxiliary assumptions in theory assessment, and we discuss these ideas in the context of contemporary approaches to scientific discovery.</p>"

This paper offers a comprehensive assessment of the interpretation of core-supporter targeting. Empirical evidence shows that the underlying patterns of partisan targeting do not accord with standard accounts of party-building activities nor electoral considerations that are evidence of presidential particularism. Instead, this paper argues that presidential policy priority better explains core-state targeting. Presidents use agencies that are ideologically aligned with them or associated with their policy priorities to enhance the largesse they bestow on core constituencies, and this is the consequence of presidents pursuing ideological and policy goals. Collectively, it indicates a less cynical point of view on the orientation of the American presidency. </jats:p>",

Findings indicate 95.00% of Michigan teachers responding to the survey offered some form of core academic credit through their AFNR coursework. Additionally, findings suggest science is the most obtained core academic credit and the predominance of core academic credit is being offered in introductory course types within AFNR programs.

Bending tests using the FBDs showed that the piezoresistive effect of the SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-coated NW was almost the same as that of the as-grown 3C-SiC NW reported previously, regardless of the gate voltage, whereas that of the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-coated NW was considerably enhanced at negative gate voltages. The enhancement of the piezoresistive effect was attributed to the piezo-pinch effect, which was more pronounced in the NW, where the carrier density at the core–shell interface is enhanced by the electric field of the dielectric.</jats:p>",

In order to capture these types of interactions and subsetting, we need to be able to handle the hierarchical structuring of these data.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In an attempt to resolve these issues, a data model in line with the Darwin Core standard was initially developed for wildlife host population data (Enetwild Consortium et al. 2020). Here, we propose a new data model for data on the hosts’ pathogens, and use both data models to demonstrate the model efficacy for complex hierarchical data structures. The epidemiology data model is structured around the existence of a primary occurrence of the host species observation, which may consist of one or many individuals. In order to associate the presence (or absence) of the pathogen to the host, or to provide details on the host group composition, the data model allows child occurrences to relate to the primary, or parent, occurrence at a particular event (Table 1). We propose the implementation of a hierarchical structure of the occurrence extension to allow these two phenomena to be effectively modelled. This hierarchical structuring relies on the adoption of a new term, the ‘parentOccurrenceID’, whereby each 'parent' observation of the host species can be associated with multiple 'child' observations. To this end, we propose the introduction of the parentOccurrenceID term (currently under discussion on GitHub).</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Using the Darwin Core standard, we propose a data model that would allow effective harmonisation of zoonotic disease data, demonstrating that harmonisation of disease surveillance data in Europe is possible. Finding solutions to capturing complex hierarchical biotic interactions in Darwin Core is currently underway at GBIF*2, 3, although relying on a separate relationship table. However, we advocate for the introduction of the new parentOccurrenceID thanks to its simplicity and very general applicability, being adaptable to any group occurrence where detailed or partial information is available, or to hierarchical interaction relationships such as between hosts and pathogens. We believe the employment of the new term would be complementary to the current GBIF developments, and of benefit to many Darwin Core users where details apply to differing levels of hierarchical occurrences.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Living Atlases (living-atlases.gbif.org) is a community of developers and organizations built around the software platform developed by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, ala.org.au). ALA includes a number of open source reusable modules designed to assemble biodiversity data portals. Nowadays, more than 25 institutional and national biodiversity portals around the world have been implemented with the ALA tools (living-atlases.gbif.org/participants). The community organizes workshops and prepares training materials to present ALA modules to other institutions that want to implement it, to improve already existing portals and to learn from each other’s achievements (living-atlases.gbif.org/about). ALA based portals integrate data from multiple sources using biodiversity data standards ruled by TDWG, such as Darwin Core for species occurrences. The Living Atlases community is working in the integration of other data types, like species records and sampling events.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Plinian Core (PliC) is a generalistic specification, oriented to share descriptions and nomenclature, as well as many other aspects (e.g. legal, conservation, and management details) of species level information from local and regional sources (Pando 2018). Following several years of development and earlier versions, PliC version 3.1 was made publicly available in 2012. The following year, after the approval of the “Species Information Interest Group'' by the TDWG Executive, a TDWG Task Group was created to start aligning Plinian Core with the TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS). Several full-fledged implementations of Plinian Core were produced, between 2014 and 2019, including the Atlas of Living Costa Rica (CRBio.cr), the Cross-Nature Project (datos.iepnb.es), the Vasque Country (Spain) Official Nature Information System (ivap.euskadi.eus), the Colombian Biodiversity Catalog (catalogo.biodiversidad.co) and Enciclovida (Mexican Species Catalog, enciclovida.mx). These last three years, the Plinian Core Task Group has reviewed definitions of terms and formal declarations, assisted by the TDWG Technical Architecture Group (TAG), with the objective of ratifying PliC as a TDWG Standard.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>One of the most used tools to share standardized biodiversity data is the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT, gbif.org/en/ipt). The IPT is an open source web application that allows institutions to standardize, to publish and share biodiversity data sets through Living Atlases, GBIF, and other biodiversity networks. The toolkit simplifies the process of publishing core data types (e.g. taxon occurrence, taxon checklists, sampling event) and, by means of extensions, it is possible to associate additional data with records of the core type. As part of our project, the extensions of PliC, accessible in the IPT Sandbox, were validated to show how they can be used by institutions to publish species pages through the IPT.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In order to fully integrate Plinian Core based species pages into the ALA architecture, the Biodiversity Informatics Research Center (CRBio) has been working on the adoption of the Biodiversity Information Explorer (BIE), an ALA module which manages taxonomic and species contents by integrating global resources like EOL or Wikipedia. This adoption includes the required modifications of the Portal codebase to use the data model of the Plinian Core (github.com/tdwg/PlinianCore) to display a much richer content. This year, with assistance from the Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) from GBIF, we have revisited the integration of species pages information and expanded the content and type of information provided by the Atlas of Living Costa Rica.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We present here the updated ALA Species Pages (ALA-BIE) and Index (BIE-Index) Modules and general documentation that could be applied to any ALA installation in order to prepare species records using the IPT and PliC standard, index and display them through the ALA-BIE Module.</jats:p>"

Although these studies provided partial improvement on the mechanical strength of the part, the bond strength between the layers was not significantly improved. In this study, we aimed to reduce the negative effect of the weakness in the interlayer bond strength on the strength of the final part. Therefore, a composite laminate was applied on a polylactic acid (PLA) core produced by the FDM method. Weight measurement, tensile test, three-point bending test and weight drop test were performed on the produced test samples. Tensile and bending test results indicates that the composite layer applied on the core produced by the FDM method has a positive effect on the mechanical strength and bending properties. It is concluded that the study will be a source for future research on moldless composite production.</jats:p>"

Despite the fact that the architectural elements have been the main sources of data for the conservation of the historic part of cities, seemingly, the cognitive map based on the perceptions of the inhabitants could enhance the level of the reliability of the outputs. The methods of the research were designed based on the survey and interview to collect both physical and nonphysical data. The physical was included the current historical elements such as mosque, school, and water storage, and the nonphysical was included the destroyed elements such as the wall, gates, towers that have been part of the memories of the inhabitants. ArcGIS was applied for overlaying the data. The findings of the research identified that despite the architectural elements located in a specific location, perception of the people referred to the broader areas in terms of the historic area. As a conclusion, both historical areas of the city include a different pattern of the development. The physical and nonphysical elements played a significant role to highlight the historic core of the city. However, the cognitive map based on the perception of users is not fitted exactly with the geo-reference data, and it is more flexible in terms of conceptual forms. The result of the study represented the map of the historic cores of the city for conservation activity.</jats:p>"

Here, we propose and test a new decision-making theory under uncertainty that combines these highly influential theories. Collecting many gambling decisions from laboratory monkeys allowed for reliable testing of our hybrid model and revealed a systematic violation of prospect theory’s assumption that probability weighting is static. Using the same experimental paradigm in humans, substantial similarities between monkey and human behavior were described by our hybrid model, which incorporates decision-by-decision learning dynamics of prediction errors into static prospect theory. Our new model provides a single unified theoretical framework for exploring the neurobiological model of economic choice in human and nonhuman primates.</jats:p>"

Building on the resource-based view, this research evaluates three questions: (1) Can using sustainability as a differentiator lead to consumers choosing sustainable products? (2) Does product sustainability appeal more to environmentally concerned consumers? (3) Does product sustainability appeal more when paired with innovation? To test the hypotheses, an online survey of 344 US respondents was conducted. Consumers were given a hypothetical budget for an office chair and asked to choose between two products at a time. Hypotheses were tested with frequency and Chi-square tests and logistic regression. Findings indicate that the innovative product was preferred over the undifferentiated one, but the sustainable product was preferred over both innovative and undifferentiated products. The sustainability–innovativeness bundle was not preferred over the sustainable product. Environmental concern increased preference for the sustainable product over the innovative product, but not over the undifferentiated one. These findings suggest that sustainability is a stronger differentiator than innovation, but that bundling both features does not further enhance product choice. Attitude toward the environment may not predict behavior. Instead, preference for the sustainable product may originate in variety-seeking behavior, with sustainability seen as an innovation.</jats:p>"

One promising method for decreasing production waste and enhancing flexural stress is to employ Additive Manufacture (AM) technologies for sandwich structure manufacturing. In this study, polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) sandwich structures with reentrant and honeycomb cores were designed and then a finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to compare the stress distributions in these sandwich composites. According to the findings, higher flexure stresses and specific energy absorption were obtained in the reentrant sandwich structures compared to honeycomb sandwich structures. A minimum equivalent stress value was found in the ABS material, while a maximum equivalent stress value was found in the PLA material.</jats:p>"

The output signal at the fixed resonance wavelength is directly intensity modulated by changing theextinction ratio (ER) of the IM-MRM. Thanks to the intensity-modulated approach, the proposed photonic processing unit isless sensitive to the inter-channel crosstalk. Simulation results reveal that the proposed design offers a maximum of 17-foldincrease in wavelength channel density compared to its wavelength-modulated counterpart. Therefore, a photonic tensor coreof size 512 × 512 can be realized by current foundry lines. A convolutional neural network (CNN) simulator with 6-bit precisionis built for handwritten digit recognition task using the proposed modulator. Simulation results show an overall accuracy of 96.76%, when the wavelength channel spacing suffers a 3-dB power penalty. To experimentally validate the system, 1000 dotproduct operations are carried out with a 4-bit signed system on a co-packaged photonic chip, where optical and electrical I/Osare realized using photonic and electrical wire bonding techniques. Study of the measurement results show a mean squarederror (MSE) of 3.09 × 10^−3 for dot product calculations. The proposed IM-MRM, therefore, renders the crosstalk issue tractableand provides a solution for the development of large-scale optical information processing systems with multiple wavelengths.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nuclear thermal propulsion is an enabling technology for future space missions, such as crew-operated Mars missions. Nuclear thermal propulsion technology provides a performance benefit over chemical propulsion systems by operating with light propellants (e.g., hydrogen) at elevated engine chamber conditions. Therefore, nuclear thermal propulsion reactor cores exhibit high propellant velocities and elevated propellant and fuel temperatures, subsequently leading to relatively high thermal stresses and geometrical deformation. This paper details the numerical approach to solve the thermo-elastic equations, which was implemented into the recently developed ntpThermo code. In addition, this paper demonstrates the extension of the Basilisk multiphysics framework to perform full-core coupled neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, and thermo-mechanical analysis of nuclear thermal propulsion reactors. The analyses demonstrate and quantify thermo-mechanical feedback, which for the investigated cases, acted to reduce maximum fuel temperatures and pressure drop across the fuel element channels. Thermo-mechanical feedback had a significant impact on the mass flow distribution within the reactor core and, thus, a substantial impact on solid-material temperatures and stresses, but only a minor impact on reactivity and local power distributions. Sensitivity studies revealed that the friction factor correlation applied to perform the analysis has a significant impact on the pressure drop across the fuel element channels. The most important observation of this research is the importance of incorporating the thermo-mechanical feedback within an integrated multiphysics solution sequence to enable the consistent design of future nuclear thermal propulsion systems.</jats:p>"

The morphology, structure, magnetic, and optoelectronic properties of the catalyst were investigated comprehensively, and the degradation performance of the catalyst was explored through the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under UV light. The concentration of RhB was 10 mg/L, and the catalyst concentration was 0.3 g/L. ZT-1.2 showed the best photocatalytic degradation activity, and the degradation rate of RhB reached 97.3% within 60 min. The degradation ability of the catalyst was further evaluated by Methylene blue (MB), Methyl orange (MO), Phenol, and Ofloxacin (OFX). ZT-1.2 also exhibited excellent stability. The improved catalyst degradation performance was attributed to constructing a Z-type heterojunction. Moreover, the low-efficiency degradation of ZTM-1.2 was caused by catalyst agglomeration and low TiO2 loading, confirming the superiority of the ultrasonic method and providing a new method for the preparation of magnetically recoverable TiO2-based core-shell photocatalyst.</jats:p>"

This study aims to explore the implementation of Corporate Waqf Core Principles (CWCP), a set of sharia principles for corporate waqf implemented in the growth of waqf in Indonesia. This study uses qualitative research with a specific focus on comparative analysis of the advantages of waqf management at two different institutions that develop corporate waqf, Waqf Board Foundation of Universitas Islam Indonesia (YBW UII) Yogyakarta and Pesantren Tebuireng in Jombang. YBW UII Yogyakarta has developed productive waqf assets and immovable objects through professional and profitable multi-company institutions, ensuring that the waqf’s results expand and the benefits fly. Pesantren Tebuireng, on the other hand, understands the implementation of CWCP in the framework of productive waqf administration and management by conceptualizing the productivity of waqf assets through corporate and institutional management. The two models of waqf management methods ensure that waqf management within the corporate institutional framework is more productive and produces long-term outcomes and benefits. However, there are certain deviations in the implementation of the CWCP which has not used shares as waqf assets. The development of this waqf model in Indonesia can accelerate community economic development.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nReceived: 6 June 2022 / Accepted: 20 August 2022 / Published: 2 September 2022</jats:p>"

The experimental program comprised casting and testing of eleven reinforced concrete beams of dimensions 200x100x2000mm.These beams are organized in four groups. Group one is the control group in which beams are cast using ordinary formwork and ferrocement. The beams in this group were reinforced with two steel bars of 10 mm at the top and12mm bottom of the beams.  The beams in the other three groups were cast using Ferrocement beams. The core of these beams was reinforced with two steel bars of 10 mm diameter at the top and12 mm bottom of the beam. Two types of steel mesh used to reinforce the ferrocement beams namely expanded steel mesh, and welded wires mesh. Single mesh and double layers consisting of mesh together with a strip steel mesh were studied. Three types of core material were investigated:  light brick, foam, and light weight concrete admixture with perlite. The test specimens were cast and tested until they failed under flexure load. The performance of the test beams in terms of strength, cracking behavior, ductility, and energy absorption properties was investigated. The use double layer of expanded steel mesh as the additional reinforcement of the main steel can achieved the best performance of the Light weight of ferrocement beams.

Accurate estimation of Petrophysical properties and detection of rock types are critical for the assessment of key aspects of CCS projects in geological formations such as storage capacity, injectivity, trapping mechanisms, and containment. The objectives of this paper are (a) to use whole-core computed tomography (CT) scan images and core photos, conventional well logs, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs, and core-measured properties for automated rock classification, (b) to develop class-based rock physics models for enhanced petrophysical properties estimation, and (c) to provide a method to expedite the detection of quantitative image-based rock classes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>First, we conducted conventional formation evaluation for initial assessment of petrophysical properties. Then, we employed image analysis techniques to remove non-core material visual elements from the available image data (i.e., CT-scan images and core photos). Afterwards, we extracted rock-fabric related features from the available image data. We characterized the pore structure of the evaluated interval using NMR logs. We integrated conventional well logs and routine core analysis (RCA) data with image-based features and NMR pore structure parameters to automatically detected rock classes by means of a physics-based cost function. Finally, we updated the estimated petrophysical properties employing class-based rock physics models and compared the obtained result against conventional formation evaluation estimates.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We applied the proposed workflow to the pilot well drilled in a saline water aquifer formation that will be used for CO2 injection and storage in the Northern Lights CCS project. The extracted image-based rock fabric features were in agreement with the visual aspect of the evaluated depth intervals. The detected rock classes captured the fluid-flow behavior using a permeability-based cost function, the variation in petrophysical and compositional properties trough well logs, and quantitative rock fabric of the evaluated depth interval through the core image data. Finally, the use of class-based rock physics models improved permeability estimates decreasing the mean relative error by 27% compared to formation-based permeability estimates from a conventional method (formation-based porosity-permeability correlations).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the key contributions of the proposed workflow is that it integrates conventional well logs, core-measured properties, NMR logs, and high-resolution image data. As a result, the obtained integrated rock classes capture key petrophysical and geological parameters of the evaluated depth intervals that are typically not included in rock classification efforts. The obtained integrated rock classes can potentially improve the development of accurate geological models, which are employed in simulation efforts as a screening tool for selection of geological formations for CO2 storage as well as for storage capacity, selection of CO2 injection intervals, and containment forecasting.</jats:p>",

We show that there is neither a correlation between the velocity groups and the spatial location of the stars, nor their locus on optical color–magnitude diagrams, which makes the stellar velocity a key parameter to separate individual stellar components in such a young star cluster. Velocity group 2 shows clear rotation with Ω<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> =(−0.4 ± 0.1) Myr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, corresponding to (−4.9 ± 0.7) km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at radial distance of 10 pc from the center, a possible remnant of the formation process of NGC 346 through the hierarchical collapse of the giant molecular cloud. The ionizing gas has lost any natal kinematic imprint and shows clear expansion, driven by far-ultraviolet fluxes and stellar winds of the numerous OB stars in the cluster center. The size of this expanding bubble and its expansion velocity of 7.9 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> are in excellent agreement with the estimate that the latest star formation episode occurred about two million years ago.</jats:p>",

No changes in dot size and density with either P- or B-doping were confirmed by AFM topographic images. Under photoexcitation of undoped QDs with a 976-nm line from a semiconductor laser, broad PL spectra consisting of four Gaussian components originating from radiative recombination through quantized states in QDs were observed in the energy range from 0.62 to 0.85 eV without impurity doping even at room temperature. In the doped QDs, relatively-narrow components peaked at ~0.68 eV and ~0.64eV were observed with P-doping and with B-doping to Ge-core, respectively, in addition to the four components seen in undoped QDs. It is interesting noted that, with an increase in B<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> pulse injection from 1 to 4 times, the integrated PL intensity was enhanced by a factor of 1.4 to 2.4 compared to that of the undoped QDs while no significant change in spectral shape was observable. This can be interpreted in terms of an increase in the number of holes with B-doping to the Ge core since the carrier recombination rates is proportional to the product of the number of electrons and holes confined in QD under weak photoexcitation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. While a significant influence of volcanic activity on Holocene climate is well-established, an equally prominent role of major eruptions in the climate variability and regime shifts during the Quaternary glacial cycles has been suggested. Previous statistical assessments of this were challenged by inaccurate synchronization of large volcanic eruptions to changes in past climate. Here, this is alleviated by combining a new record of bipolar volcanism from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores with records of abrupt climate change derived from the same ice cores. We show that bipolar volcanic eruptions occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance just before the onset of Dansgaard–Oeschger events, which are the most prominent large-scale abrupt climate changes in the last glacial period. Out of 20 abrupt warming events in the 12–60 ka period, 5 (7) occur within 20 (50) years after a bipolar eruption. We hypothesize that this may be a result of the direct influence of volcanic cooling on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which is widely regarded as the main climate subsystem involved in Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles. Transitions from a weak to a strong circulation mode may be triggered by cooling in the North Atlantic given that the circulation is close to a stability threshold. We illustrate this suggestion by simulations with an ocean-only general circulation model forced by short-term volcanic cooling. The analysis presented suggests that large eruptions may act as short-term triggers for large-scale abrupt climate change and may explain some of the variability of Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles.\nWhile we argue that the bipolar catalogue used here covers a sufficiently large portion of the eruptions with the strongest global climate impact, volcanic events restricted to either the Northern or Southern Hemisphere may likewise contribute to abrupt climate change.\n                    </jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two types of therapeutic exercise: core stability exercises and movement control exercises in pain and function. Methods. Thirty-five patients were diagnosed and referred to physiotherapy as CMLBP, their age ranged from 25–40 years old, patients divided randomly into two groups and assessed for their current level of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) and for disability using Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after the study. Both groups received a well-documented fully supervised exercise program as group I movement control exercise, and group II received core stability exercises. Results. Showed significant effect of both exercise approaches on reducing pain level and restoring function. Although the group I exercises showed to be more effective in reducing pain than group II, their difference regarding improving function was non-significant. Conclusion. Conservative forms of treatment (therapeutic exercises) still prove it is a successful, cost-effective treatment of choice in patients with chronic mechanical low back pain. Movement control exercises are superior in reducing pain to core stability exercises.</jats:p>",

Problems such as insufficiency of form and content of teaching materials, uneven level of teachers' informatization, the lack of classroom ecology and the lack of students' comprehensive quality, make teaching unable to meet the requirements of cultivating inter-disciplinary talents in the big data era.   Efforts should be made to improve the effectiveness of English classroom teaching in primary school and to transform the classroom to adapt to the social development. According to the requirements of English core literacy, strategies will be proposed for the transformation of primary English classrooms in four aspects: building an ecological classroom, optimizing the content and form of teaching materials, establishing students' awareness of deep learning, and improving teachers' professional level, in order to provide references for classroom transformation as the request of times as well as promote the implementation of English core literacy.</jats:p>"

However, how the diversity of acidogenic microorganisms and environmental factors affect their generation are still poorly understood. In this study, 18 different inocula and 42 sludges from acidogenic lab-scale reactors were collected to analyze the microbial communities and their metabolic potential using 16S rRNA genes high throughput sequencing coupled with PICRUSt2. 23 out of 30732 distinctive amplicon sequence variants were identified as the core features and 34.8% of them (e.g., <jats:italic>Clostridium spp</jats:italic>.) were positively correlated with the generation of the most common product acetate. PICRUSt2 shows that an average of 27% of predicted fermentation-pathway genes was assigned to the core features, suggesting their crucial roles in acidogenesis. From the network aspect, the acidogenic network had a slightly higher number of nodes (12%), but significantly lower numbers of edges (109%) and neighbors (132%) compared with the inoculum network. A total of 28 independent subnetworks from large to small scales were extracted from the acidogenic network. The decentralized distribution of core features in these subnetworks emphasized their non-co-occurring relationships. The electrode potential was the most significant environmental variable (48.2–49.3% of the explanation), positively affecting the distribution of more than 50% of the core features and fermentation pathways. Results of this study emphasized the importance of core features rather than microbial diversity in acidogenic performance and highlighted the response of the core microbial community to environmental changes, which may be applied in practical applications to optimize acidogenic performance.</jats:p>"

Establishment of its productive infection and progression of disease pathologies depend largely on successful release of virions from the virus-producing cells. HSV-1 is known to exploit many host factors for its release. Recent studies have shown that heparanase (HPSE) is one such host enzyme that is recruited for this purpose. It is an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) from the surface of infected cells. HS is a virus attachment coreceptor that is commonly found on cell surfaces as HS proteoglycans e.g., syndecan-1 (SDC-1). The current model suggests that HSV-1 during the late stage of infection upregulates HPSE, which in turn enhances viral release by removing the virus-trapping HS moieties. In addition to its role in directly enabling viral release, HPSE accelerates the shedding of HS-containing ectodomains of SDC-1, which enhances HSV-1 release via a similar mechanism by upregulating CREB3 and COPII proteins. This review outlines the role of HPSE and SDC-1 as newly assigned host factors that facilitate HSV-1 release during a lytic infection cycle.</jats:p>"

Such a controller is implemented within a highly realistic simulation environment that includes physics motors, showing an almost identical behavior to that of a real UAV. The controller was tested for flying under normal conditions and in the presence of different types of disturbances, showing successful results.

However, the effectiveness of the core enterprises’ investment efficiency is limited by insufficient environmental knowledge. Although cooperating with the knowledge-advantaged environmental non-governmental organization (ENGO) may be an effective solution, we observe from the recent examples that not all core enterprises are willing to cooperate in a competitive market. Within this context, we develop a theoretical model to investigate whether competitive core enterprises can benefit from cooperating with the knowledge-advantaged ENGO to motivate the supplier’s environmental responsibility. Our results show that cooperation incentivizes core enterprises’ investments in the supplier’s environmental responsibility, which in turn motivates better environmental responsibility of the supplier. However, we illustrate that cooperation is not necessarily the optimal strategy for core enterprises in the duopoly scenario. Specifically, as the knowledge absorption ability increases, a core enterprise may free-ride on another’s investment, shifting its strategic preference from cooperating to not cooperating. In addition, competition may stimulate the core enterprises’ investments and cooperation motivation, thus improving the total environmental effort and supply chain members’ profits. Our findings provide insights into the competitive core enterprises’ strategic choice regarding suppliers’ environmental responsibility management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimizing sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) is challenging due to the non-uniform distribution of the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix. The best-performing SpMV format changes depending on the input matrix and the underlying architecture, and there is no “one-size-fit-for-all” format. A hybrid scheme combining multiple SpMV storage formats allows one to choose an appropriate format to use for the target matrix and hardware. However, existing hybrid approaches are inadequate for utilizing the SIMD cores of modern multi-core CPUs with SIMDs, and it remains unclear how to best mix different SpMV formats for a given matrix. This paper presents a new hybrid storage format for sparse matrices, specifically targeting multi-core CPUs with SIMDs. Our approach partitions the target sparse matrix into two segmentations based on the regularities of the memory access pattern, where each segmentation is stored in a format suitable for its memory access patterns. Unlike prior hybrid storage schemes that rely on the user to determine the data partition among storage formats, we employ machine learning to build a predictive model to automatically determine the partition threshold on a per matrix basis. Our predictive model is first trained off line, and the trained model can be applied to any new, unseen sparse matrix. We apply our approach to 956 matrices and evaluate its performance on three distinct multi-core CPU platforms: a 72-core Intel Knights Landing (KNL) CPU, a 128-core AMD EPYC CPU, and a 64-core Phytium ARMv8 CPU. Experimental results show that our hybrid scheme, combined with the predictive model, outperforms the best-performing alternative by 2.9%, 17.5% and 16% on average on KNL, AMD, and Phytium, respectively.</jats:p>"

In this study, we analyzed a comprehensive canister desorption data set on 230 core samples from nine exploration wells drilled into the Montney Formation in northeastern British Columbia part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The purpose of the study was to illustrate the desorption characteristics of tight rocks and the relationship to reservoir properties and operational parameters. Based on the measured core properties (e.g., porosity, fluid saturation, permeability, total organic carbon (TOC) content, and adsorption isotherms) of canister samples and adjacent core samples, non-isothermal gas transport in cores was modeled to quantify the lost gas during core recovery and lost gas time at the surface. Gas volumes were measured and subsampled by canister desorption tests. The results show that the gas contents measured by on-site canister desorption only accounts for a minor (but significant) portion (about 2 to 25%) of the total gas-in-place in the Montney Formation cores, with the lower percentages being associated with samples of better reservoir qualities (e.g., higher porosity). Over 60–90% (mainly free gas) of the total gas-in-place can be lost during core recovery, and up to 10% can be lost at surface, prior to canister desorption. The measured canister desorption gas is mainly from adsorbed gas, and hence shows strong positive correlation to TOC content. The study shows that the current canister desorption test method severely underestimates in-situ gas content because it fails to correctly estimate the total lost gas content, limiting the successful application of the desorption technique. Nevertheless, the bulk properties and molecular compositions of the desorption gases are strongly correlated to those of the gases produced in the same area, exhibiting distinctive gas composition profiles throughout core desorption for different reservoir types or thermal maturity, and thus can provide invaluable information for the initial evaluation of unconventional plays. A workflow of EOS-based PVT property and compositional modeling is proposed to integrate the core desorption gas test results with core analysis data and mud gas and/or produced gas data for improved characterization of in situ reservoir fluids, and hence, better assessments of hydrocarbons-in-place and evaluations of tight and shale reservoirs.</jats:p>"

The angular diameter of the Earth as seen from the Moon surface is 1.9° ± 0.1°(the angular size varies due to the change in the distance between the Earth and the Moon). The libration of the Moon in latitude reaches an amplitude of 6.68° and has a main period of 27.21 days (or 653.1 hours). The libration of the Moon in longitude, reaching 7.9°, has a period of 27.55 days (or 661.3 hours). This causes the center of the Earth move in the Moon’s sky in a rectangle measuring 13.4°× 15.8°. The trajectory of the Earth's motion in this rectangle changes its shape with a period of 6 years. This apparent librational movement of the Earth in the Moon’s sky complicates observations of the Earth. The paper proposes to turn this disadvantage into an advantage and place a multi-slit spectrometer on the Moon surface on a fixed platform. The libration motion and the daily rotation of the Earth will act as a natural replacement for the scanning mechanism.\n                        </jats:p>"

Whereas, the mixture rule is utilized to calculate mass density, Poisson’s ratio and electric and magnetic properties of both upper and lower layers of the sandwich plate. The governing motion equations of the lightweight sandwich plate are obtained by refined higher-order shear deformation plate theory and Hamilton’s principle. These equations are solved analytically to obtain wave dispersion relations.

Acrylic resin can be easily fabricated via conventional emulsion polymerization, but how to prepare large particle size with self-matting effect has always been a challenge. In this paper, a continuous three-stage polymerization method: seed-polymerization coupled core-polymerization and shell polymerization was employed to prepare large particle size self-matting acrylic resin emulsion. Simultaneously, the effect of feeding methods on particles size and the effects of latex particle size, shell structure and cross-linking degree on the morphology and gloss of coating were investigated. The Z-average size of PBA seed latex particles was 213.4 nm for semi-continuous feeding method but 82.3nm for batch feeding method. After three-time continuous growth, the seed emulsion turned into core emulsion, and the particle size of core latex reached about 700nm. In third stages ofshell polymerization, the core emulsion was changed into core-shell emulsion, and the latex particle size increased further to 804nm. The latex particle size, core-shell structure and cross-linking degree of shell layer were found to influence the gloss of the coating. Large latex particle size imparted the film spherical micro-rough surface, soft-core combined with hard-shell structure led to deformation resistant during film formation and cross-linking of shell layer increased the densification of shell layer, all contributed to the coating rough surface, as a result, increasing the matting effect of the coating. Finally, the leather gloss was reduced from 5.8° to 1.2°.</jats:p>"

Previously, we used a mouse model of non-anaphylactic cow’s milk allergy (CMA) and investigated sex- and strain-dependent differences in immunological, neurological, and behavioral sequelae. We showed that male C57BL/6J mice sensitized to a bovine whey protein, β-lactoglobulin (BLG; Bos d 5), exhibited anxiety- and depression-like behavior upon acute allergen challenge. Systemic levels of BLG-specific immunoglobulins, cytokines and chemokines were also elevated in the sensitized mice. Furthermore, neuroinflammation and intestinal dysbiosis were evident as the possible causes of the altered behavior. To assess whether frequent allergen exposure influences CMA-associated pathologies over an extended period in this subclinical model, we placed BLG-sensitized mice on a whey protein (WP)-containing or whey-free control (CTL) diet for 3 months. As expected, allergen-specific IgE was significantly elevated in the plasma after completing the 5-week sensitization phase. However, the IgE levels declined in both diet groups after 3 months. In contrast, allergen-specific IgG1 stayed elevated in sensitized mice with the CTL diet, and the WP diet to a lesser extent. Interestingly, BLG-sensitized mice on the WP diet exhibited anxiety-like behavior and a trend toward spatial memory decline compared to the sham or the sensitized mice on the CTL diet. Moreover, increased immunoreactivities for GFAP and Iba1 and elevated levels of CXCL13 and CCL12, the chemokines involved in central leukocyte recruitment and other neurological diseases, were also observed in the brain. We demonstrated that sensitization to the whey protein, particularly with continuous allergen exposure, resulted in persistent neuroinflammation and associated behavioral changes despite lowered allergen-specific immunoglobulin levels. These results suggested that continuous consumption of the offending allergen may lead to adverse consequences in the brain even after desensitization.</jats:p>"

Here, room-temperature synthesis of polycrystalline nanographene was achieved by CO2RR over the electrodeposited Bi on Sn substrate prepared with various bismuth concentrations (0.01 M, 0.05 M, and 0.1 M). The solid carbon products were solely produced on all the prepared electrodes at the applied potential −1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl and were characterized as polycrystalline nanographene with an average domain size of ca. 3–4 nm. The morphology of the electrodeposited Bi/Sn electrocatalysts did not have much effect on the final structure of the solid carbon products formed but rather affected the CO2 electroreduction activity. The optimized negative potential for the formation of nanographene products on the 0.05Bi/Sn was ca. −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Increasing the negative value of the applied potential accelerated the agglomeration of the highly reactive nascent Bi clusters in situ formed under the reaction conditions, which, as a consequence, resulted in a slight deviation of the product selectivity toward gaseous CO and H2 evolution reaction. The Bi–graphene composites produced by this method show high potential as an additive for working electrode modification in electrochemical sensor-related applications.</jats:p>"

The need to re-evaluate the role of teachers in providing appropriate education and support to children who will be living in the age of artificial intelligence as the main subjects is raised.\r\nMethods: In this article, the desired images and core competencies of early childhood teachers have been reconstructed through a literature review.\r\nResults: The eight competencies were as follows; “professional emotionality, passion, ethics, curriculum execution, communication-based collaboration skills, extended sense of community, artificial intelligence literacy, and reflective thinking.” The images of teachers equipped with all of the above competencies were categorized into four branches, ‘teachers with healthy character qualities, teachers with practical knowledges, teachers with solidarity and execution skills, and teachers with innovative perspectives.’\r\nConclusion: The eight core competencies necessary for the era of artificial intelligence should be considered along with the practical issues early childhood education is facing: the continuity of education between pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and elementary school, the integration of public and private kindergartens, curriculum, and restructuring of curriculums for teacher training institution, and other areas. By examining the images and core competencies of early childhood teachers in the era of artificial intelligence, we hope to contribute to the establishment of a clear direction for teachers to hold fast even in times of uncertainty.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Personality Traits are one of the most important aspects of human behaviour analysis that can be widely used in a plethora of scientific fields. Nowadays, a variety of industries use self-assessment techniques to evaluate their employees or candidates to form effective teams based on the relationships between the personnel. The Big Five personality traits, also known as the OCEAN Five model, encompass an individual’s behaviour on five factors: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Currently, the evaluation is based on questionnaires, which are prone to subjectivity and can be biased. In this paper, we analyse the behaviours on which each trait is based, in a series of 3D Escape Rooms with the aim of collecting metrics in a number of settings/situations to effectively assess them, with the use of gamification. Each Escape Room has unique features and simulates special occasions to monitor the player's reactions as well as gameplay style to generate specific models that calculate the level of each personality trait. The final profiling, however, is based on a combination of metrics from the different rooms since the behaviours are common and overlap with each other but can be evaluated in different situations. Results validate the mathematical models of metrics for each behaviour and crystallise the nature of the situations in which these behaviours can be modelled. Therefore, through gamification, a new generic model for categorising players, based on the Ocean five personality trait model, is generated.</jats:p>"

Both diseases are currently treated with a small number of chemotherapeutics, which are hampered by a variety of limitations reaching from efficacy and toxicity complications to drug‐resistance problems. Here, we explore the forward design of a new class of synthetic trypanocides based on nanostructured, core‐shell DNA‐lipid particles. In aqueous solution, the particles self‐assemble into micelle‐type structures consisting of a solvent‐exposed, hydrophilic DNA shell and a hydrophobic lipid core. DNA‐lipid nanoparticles have membrane‐adhesive qualities and can permeabilize lipid membranes. We report the synthesis of DNA‐cholesterol nanoparticles, which specifically subvert the membrane integrity of the <jats:italic>T. brucei</jats:italic> lysosome, killing the parasite with nanomolar potencies. Furthermore, we provide an example of the programmability of the nanoparticles. By functionalizing the DNA shell with a spliced leader (SL)‐RNA‐specific DNAzyme, we target a second trypanosome‐specific pathway (dual‐target approach). The DNAzyme provides a backup to counteract the recovery of compromised parasites, which reduces the risk of developing drug resistance.</jats:p>",

A need analysis was carried out to obtain the data through semi-structured interviews. The data was collected and analyzed through coding and categorizing techniques based on the questions category. The study found that there were several core aspects needed by the teachers that should be included in a teacher’s book content, namely appearance design/layout, procedures in teaching, material explanation, teaching aids, teaching and learning assessment, time allocation, example of classroom language, and key answers. These aspects are purely based on the analysis on teachers' needs and expectations. The researchers point out that this investigation is fruitful to carry out since it synchronizes the content of the teacher’s book and the needs of the teachers which provide a set of ready-made procedures or proper steps in teaching.

The physical experiment method and numerical modeling method are common modeling methods. With the development of deep learning technology, a variety of deep learning algorithms have been applied to digital core modeling. The digital core modeling method based on generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) has attracted wide attention due to its good quality and simple generation process. The disadvantage of this method is that the network needs thousands of trainings to achieve acceptable results. For this reason, this paper proposes to use the pretrained GANs for digital core modeling training, which can greatly reduce the number of network training while ensuring the core modeling effect. We can use the presented method to quickly complete the training and use the trained generator model to obtain multiple digital cores. By analyzing the quality of the generated cores from multiple aspects, it is revealed that the properties of the generated cores are in good agreement with the ones of the real core samples. The results indicate the reliability of the pretrained GAN method.</jats:p>",

The perfect core-shell structure of nanocrystalline Cu-Cu2O was confirmed by using high resolution TEM. The presence of pure Cu and Cu2O was further confirmed from optical absorbance spectrum and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The tailoring of position of optical absorption peaks, originating from Cu or Cu2O nanoparticles, is possible by modulating the oil to water ratio, which controls the size of the composite particles and thickness of Cu2O. Drastic change of electrical resistivity with change in thickness of shell, has been observed. Variation of resistivity with temperature delineates a semiconducting nature with two distinct activation processes. Results demonstrate that the activation energies for the core-shell nanostructure composites were found to be smaller than the bulk Cu2O. Photoluminescence spectrum further confirms the semiconducting nature of the composite. In addition, the kinetic of core-shell morphology formation is also discussed briefly.\n</jats:p>"

However, how this process affects the anti-inflammatory effects of rice bran and the bioactive compounds that might participate in this function is yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to isolate bioactive compounds in fermented rice bran that play a key role in its anti-inflammatory function. The fermented rice bran was fractionated using a succession of solvent and solid-phase extractions. The fermented rice bran fractions were then applied to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophages to evaluate their anti-inflammatory activity. The hot water fractions (FRBA), 50% ethanol fractions (FRBB), and n-hexane fractions (FRBC) were all shown to be able to suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Subsequent fractions from the hot water fraction (FRBF and FRBE) were also able to reduce the inflammatory response of these cells to LPS. Further investigation revealed that tryptamine, a bacterial metabolite of tryptophan, was abundantly present in these extracts. These results indicate that tryptamine may play an important role in the anti-inflammatory effects of fermented rice bran. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of FRBE and tryptamine may depend on the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.</jats:p>"

In this work, we aimed to evaluate whether the immunomodulatory 090104 strain was able to enhance the resistance against the respiratory infection induced by hypermucoviscous carbapenemase-producing (KPC-2) Klebsiella pneumoniae strains belonging to the sequence type (ST) 25. The nasal treatment of mice with C. pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 before the challenge with multiresistant K. pneumoniae ST25 strains significantly reduced lung bacterial cell counts and lung tissue damage. The protective effect of the 090104 strain was related to its ability to regulate the respiratory innate immune response triggered by K. pneumoniae challenge. C. pseudifteriticum 090104 differentially modulated the recruitment of leukocytes into the lung and the production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-10 levels in the respiratory tract and serum. Our results make an advance in the positioning of C. pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 as a next-generation probiotic for the respiratory tract and encourage further research of this bacterium as a promising alternative to develop non-antibiotic therapeutical approaches to enhance the prevention of infections produced by microorganisms with multiple resistance to antimicrobials such as KPC-2-producing hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae strains belonging to ST25.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The incidence of prostatic cancer in the United Kingdom has increased over 40% in the past 30 years. The majority of these cancers are diagnosed by core biopsy, posing a considerable strain on a service that struggles to recruit sufficient histopathologists. The current methodology for tissue diagnosis has a significant false-negative rate, small false-positive rate, and a proportion of indeterminate diagnoses. Therefore, this area presents an opportunity both to improve diagnostic quality and to reduce the burden on resources. We investigated streamlining tissue pathways by increasing the utilization of readily available resources to reduce the burden on scarce resources and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. This involved applying prospective multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) using 4 different markers (CK5, p63, racemase, and Ki-67) and 2 chromogens. We conducted a prospective study using over 8000 cores and 3 consultant histopathologists. The pathologists assessed each core using either conventional stains (hematoxylin and eosin) only or multiplex IHC only. The results of this assessment were later compared with the overall assessment made for the final histologic diagnosis. Results show that IHC alone has a positive predictive value of 98.97% and a negative predictive value of 99.91%, while hematoxylin and eosin alone has a positive predictive value of 94.21% and negative predictive value of 99.07%, demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy. When assessed against the use of on-demand IHC, prospective IHC improves turn-around-times, reduces indeterminate diagnoses, improves pathologist’s accuracy and efficiency and, in overall terms, is cost-effective. In addition, it is possible to structure these tests within the routine of a diagnostic service with little impact on the overall capacity of the laboratory.</jats:p>",

GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using DAVID. The PPI network of the DEGs was analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database and visualized by Cytoscape software. Hub genes were identified through the PPI network and a robust rank aggregation method. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Oncomine database were used to validate the hub genes. In addition, a survival curve analysis was conducted to verify the correlation between the expression of hub genes and patient prognosis. Human glioblastoma cells and normal cells were collected, and then RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were conducted to validate the expression of the <jats:italic>NDC80</jats:italic> gene. A cell proliferation assay was used to detect the proliferation of glioma cells. The effects of <jats:italic>NDC80</jats:italic> expression on migration and invasion of GBM cell lines were evaluated by conducting scratch and transwell assays.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A total of 716 DEGs were common to all three microarray datasets, which included 188 upregulated DEGs and 528 downregulated DEGs. Furthermore, we found that among the common DEGs, 10 hub genes showed a high degree of connectivity. The expression of the 10 hub genes in TCGA and the Oncomine database was significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma compared with normal genes. Additionally, the survival analysis showed that the patients with low expression of six genes (<jats:italic>BIR5C</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>CDC20</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>NDC80</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>CDK1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>TOP2A</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>MELK</jats:italic>) had a significantly favorable prognosis (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.01).

Each module performs one round of precursor extension and optional modification, followed by directed transfer of the intermediate to the next module. While enzymatic domains and even modules of PKSs are well understood, the higher-order modular architecture of PKS assembly lines remains elusive. Here, we visualize a PKS bimodule core using cryo–electron microscopy and resolve a two-dimensional meshwork of the bimodule core formed by homotypic interactions between modules. The sheet-like organization provides the framework for efficient substrate transfer and for sequestration of trans-acting enzymes required for polyketide production.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, most previous studies on community mining in temporal networks ignore the bursting patterns of communities. In this paper, we study the problem of seeking bursting communities in a temporal graph. We propose a novel model, called the (\n            <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>\n            , δ)-maximal bursting core, to represent a bursting community in a temporal graph. Specifically, an (\n            <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>\n            , δ)-maximal bursting core is a temporal subgraph in which each node has an average degree no less than δ in a time segment with length no less than\n            <jats:italic>l.</jats:italic>\n            To compute the (\n            <jats:italic>l</jats:italic>\n            , δ)-maximal bursting core, we first develop a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can reduce time complexity of calculating the segment density from\n            <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>\n            (|\n            <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n            |)\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            to\n            <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>\n            (|\n            <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n            |).

The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou’s UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen–Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai–Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.</jats:p>"

Top veterinarian concerns for vaccinating a healthy adult dog were anaphylaxis, soreness at injection site, and lethargy; for cats, these concerns included vaccine-associated sarcoma, lethargy, and soreness at injection site. Veterinarians reported that the most common concerns mentioned by owners included that the pet does not go outside, that vaccinations are unnecessary, that vaccinations can lead to chronic or severe illness, and cost. Veterinarians reported an increased number of dog and cat owners reluctant about or resistant to the idea of rabies vaccines and core vaccines since the time that COVID-19 vaccines became widely available. There was an association between veterinarians’ perceptions of local COVID-19 antivaccination sentiments and the increase in the number of vaccine-resistant or -concerned clients.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>CLINICAL RELEVANCE</jats:title>\n<jats:p>There appears to be little overlap between veterinarians’ primary concerns related to vaccinations and their perception of dog and cat owners’ primary concerns. The fact that the number of resistant clients is positively associated with the presence of veterinarians’ perceptions of a local COVID-19 antivaccination sentiment suggests that human antivaccination sentiments impact pet owners’ views of companion animal vaccinations. A better understanding of the cognitive biases that impact owners’ vaccine decisions can help veterinarians better communicate with vaccine-reluctant clients and increase vaccination compliance rates.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Social media is one of the prominently used channels for health communication during the recent pandemic, COVID-19. The identification of the key players of a communication network can play a crucial role in the success of health communication. Different studies identify the key players using social network analysis methods. However, most of them focused on trending hashtags generated by the users, not on a hashtag launched officially by a health organization. This research aims to conduct a social network analysis on an organized health awareness campaign launched on Twitter by the Saudi Ministry of Health called \"Natawan ma Natahawan\", meaning cooperating not neglecting, that is, this health message campaign aims at encouraging people to cooperate and not relax in implementing preventive measures. 40108 tweets from the hashtag were collected using Twitter API. Two types of analysis were conducted: network property analysis and core-periphery detection. As a result, we found that the users of the network are closely connected but have much fewer connections than expected. Moreover, only four users were identified as key players on the network. All four nodes are trusted parties, as two of them are the campaign launchers, and the other two are official accounts that support them. This structure, i.e., the leadership of the network by trusted parties, enabled the control of the health message communication and limited the spread of the misinformation within social media users during the campaign.</jats:p>"

Results showed that children with ASD, though they were delayed in chronological age and expressive language (including significantly lower vocabulary production scores), acquired various grammatical constructions similarly to their typically developing peers. Moreover, Mandarin-acquiring preschoolers with ASD demonstrated similar acquisition patterns of these three core grammatical structures, as has been reported in previous IPL studies among English-acquiring children with ASD (<jats:xref>Naigles &amp; Fein, 2017</jats:xref>). Thus, the results testify that universal underlying mechanisms are playing vital roles in grammatical acquisition of children with ASD across languages (e.g., the setting of word order parameters, the preservation of functional morphemes, the universal operation of WH-Movement), despite their pervasive social cognition impairments. These findings suggest that core grammatical knowledge may be preserved in children with ASD, even in the face of radical differences in language environment and social/communicative deficits, supporting the contribution of the language faculty in autistic language acquisition. The results shed light on the sharp contrast between linguistic competence (governed by the internal computational system of the language faculty) vs. linguistic performance (affected by loci of impairment in the sensory-motor and the conceptual-intentional interfaces) in ASD. Furthermore, the results highlight the dissociation between the lexical vs. the grammatical modules in ASD, supporting a modular view of the diverse language domains in the language faculty.</jats:p>",

DLR approaches also require determining the AC resistance of the power line conductors, which is a key parameter that enables it to determine Joule and core losses. This paper presents an approach for an on-line alternating current (AC) resistance estimation of aluminum conductor steel-reinforced (ACSR) conductors to determine the DLR capability of such conductors from real-time conductor and meteorological parameter measurements. For this purpose, conductors with one, two and three layers of aluminum strands are analyzed in detail.

To analyze many cosmetic samples, a rapid analysis method is required for efficiency. In this study, we developed a rapid method for the simultaneous determination of 11 regulated preservatives in cosmetics using a core–shell column by high-performance liquid chromatography. In this method, the 11 preservatives were separated within 17 min, which was approximately half the time reported in the previous study. The peak resolution for each preservative was &amp;gt;2.6, the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were &amp;gt;0.9988, the percent recoveries were 92.0–111.9% and the relative standard deviations were &amp;lt;3.5% (n = 3). The relative standard deviations among 6 researchers were &amp;lt;4.7%. Thus, it is an effective rapid determination method for the analysis of preservatives in cosmetics.</jats:p>",

Banana microbiomes may provide novel solutions to these constraints but are difficult to manage due to their high diversity and variability between locations. Hence ‘common core’ taxa, which are a subset of the microbiome that frequent all, or most, individuals of a host species, represent logical targets for the development of microbiome management approaches. Here, we first performed a pot experiment to characterise the effects of two factors that are likely to differ between farms (viz. edaphic conditions and host genotype) on bacterial diversity in bulk soil and seven plant compartments. From this experiment, we created shortlisted core ‘candidates’ that were then refined using a survey of 52 field-grown <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. We confirmed the importance of the core through network analysis and by comparing the sequences of our core taxa with those reported in 22 previous studies.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Diversity was found to differ between plant compartments and soils, but not genotypes. Therefore, we identified populations that were frequent across most plants irrespective of the soil in which they were grown. This led to the selection of 36 ‘common core’ bacteria, that represented 65–95% of the dominant taxa in field-grown plants and were identified as highly interconnected ‘hubs’ using network analysis – a characteristic shown to be indicative of microbes that influence host fitness in studies of other plants. Lastly, we demonstrated that the core taxa are closely related to banana-associated bacteria observed on five other continents.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our study provides a robust list of common core bacterial taxa for <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. Further research may now focus on how changes in the frequencies and activities of these most persistent taxa influence host fitness.

We demonstrate that this theory applies in post‐conflict Iraq where green innovation performance was conditional on commitment to sustainable management and development of green technology and skills. Data from 238 Iraqi executives showed that green product and process innovation performance increased with green core competence, but only when the firm invested in people and R&amp;D or, in the case of green process innovation, top management demonstrated authentic commitment to sustainable practices. The moderation effects of R&amp;D investment and top management commitment reflect the national context in Iraq, where R&amp;D investment is low and management is often constrained by inflexible bureaucracy. As countries emerge from conflict, investment in modernization of companies' internal structure, management, and capacity for continuous improvement is required if core competence is to be translated into innovation performance.</jats:p>",

This concept is devoted by ILO to promote or establish social justice and labour rights to recognise labours peace which is the most crucial part of the economic prosperity. The implementation of these measures ensures the benefits of the majority workers, rather than the rich only. This study has been prepared to examine the key challenges in implementing the international labour standards in Bangladesh garments sectors. The fundamental labour laws of Bangladesh are designed in accordance with principles of ILO, but non-enforcement of domestic regulations indicates disobedience with international core labour standards and ILO conventions too. The qualitative method has been used in the gathering and the analysing of data of this research. This study has found that most of the rules and regulations of labour laws of Bangladesh are followed by ILO standards. However, their practical approaches show an indication of dismay. Thus, it is submitted that the local jurisdiction of Bangladesh has a poor application of international core labour standards and the ILO conventions which causes uncountable dilemmas to the humanity and the peaceful garments industries. This study has suggested that the government must take necessary steps to implement core international labour standards effectively in domestic legal system and carry out a proper observation to establish social justice and peaceful garments industries in Bangladesh.  </jats:p>"

In this study, the correlation between the refractive index and dispersion value of the optical glass material and the performance of optical lens module is explained by minimizing the chromatic aberration of various wavelength.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Kenya today majority of the youth are out of school and not employed in the formal economy and private sector jobs are also scarce. Acknowledging this reality, the Kenyan government and other youth service organizations are learning that proper strategies need to be put in place to help youth penetrate into the formal economy. The strategies should further assist and accelerate this process while improving the short-term well-being of youth and their households. When appropriately engaged and adequately prepared for roles in the worlds of work, family life, and society, youth can be definite assets for sustainable development. However, if governments and communities disregard the huge numbers of youth with miniÂ­mal attachment to the formal sector, youth can also become a profoundly de-stabilizing force. Specifically, the absence of livelihood developÂ­ment opportunities for youth can impede a nationâ€™s development in the form of increased crime, violence, extremÂ­ism, and both social and political instability. This paper examines the self-reliance projects as a future core driver of rural youth livelihood development outcomes in Kenya. The paper is based on a study conducted to determine the effects of self-reliance projects on the livelihoods of youth in selected rural areas of Nakuru County. A descriptive survey research design was used for the study. Data was collected using interviews and questionnaires. Data collected was analyzed using SPSS where frequencies and percentages were derived. Descriptive statistics was used in providing relevant information. Findings indicate that successful rural self-reliance projects have to integrate important basic services such as entrepreneurial training; infrastructure as well as financing. The study further established that development partners enhancing youth participation in self-reliance projects should ensure substantive dialogue or the involvement of youth from the rural areas. The recommendation is that interventions designed for youth self-reliance projects must engage and support youth. Most of the youth are already economically active and focused on the imÂ­mediate needs of their households, and the rural youth desire is to realize more sustainable and socially construcÂ­tive livelihood means.</jats:p>"

A characteristic time was introduced, required to achieve blowing agent uniformity or, equivalently, required to cancel the mass transport‐mediated memory of the system.

The case of a facing resting on an infinite core is examined, but the validity of such a simplification has been discussed in detail. An energy approach is used to solve the problem. The general procedure for considering the influence of the core parameter variability on the value of stress causing the facing instability is presented. Expressions allowing us to calculate the wrinkling stress were derived, which was the main aim of the research. The heterogeneity of the core material is taken into account by using continuous functions describing the variability of the core material parameters. In the examples illustrating the theory, the exponential and polynomial functions were used. The examples are based on the actually measured elastic modules of the core. The presented considerations were extended to the analysis of strain energies, which confirmed that the properties of the layer adjacent to the facing (up to 2 cm thick) determine the value of the wrinkling stress. The paper presents an example of the optimization of core material parameters in which a change in the distribution of the core parameters led to an approximately threefold increase in the wrinkling strength of the sandwich panel.</jats:p>"

The RA spectra were analyzed with particular emphasis on the assignment of the participator and spectator states. The states are of special relevance for investigating how distinct electronic configurations influence selective bond breaking. The electron–ion coincidence measurements provided branching fractions of the produced ion fragments as a function of electron binding energy. They explicitly demonstrate how the final electronic states created after photoionization and RA decay influence fragmentation. In particular, we observed a significantly different branching fraction for spectator states compared with participator states.

Data quality control and differential gene screening were performed based on R language (P &lt; 0.01; log<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>FC ≥ 2). Gene function enrichment analysis was conducted on differentially expressed genes. Then, genes related to immunoregulation interactions were selected for protein interaction analysis using STRING to screen out potential core targets, and the data in the public dataset GSE65682 were used to explore the prognostic relevance of potential core genes. Public datasets were collected, and a meta-analysis was used to verify the expression trends of core genes in the sepsis group. Then, 5 PBMC samples (NC = 2; SIRS = 1; SEPSIS = 2) were collected, and their core genes underwent cell line localization analysis using 10X single-cell sequencing.\n<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>\nCompared with the normal group, there were a total of 1128 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood cells of the sepsis group, of which 721 were upregulated and 407 downregulated. These differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in leukocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, cell killing regulation, adaptive immune response regulation, lymphocyte-mediated immune regulation, and negative regulation of adaptive immune response. In this study, PPI interaction network analysis was performed on immunoregulation-related genes to screen several genes, such as CD160, KLRG1, S1PR5, and RGS16, in the core area, which are related to adaptive immune regulation, signal transduction, and intracellular components. The above four genes in the core area were found to be related to the prognosis of patients with sepsis, of which RGS16 was negatively correlated with the survival rate, and CD160, KLRG1, and S1PR5 were positively correlated. However, several public datasets showed that CD160, KLRG1, and S1PR5 were all downregulated in the peripheral blood of patients with sepsis, while RGS16 was upregulated in the sepsis group. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that they were mainly expressed in NK-T cells.\n<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>\nCompared with the normal group, CD160, KLRG1, and S1PR5 were downregulated in the sepsis group and positively correlated with survival, whereas RGS16 was upregulated in the sepsis group and negatively correlated with survival. These four genes were mainly located in human peripheral blood NK-T-cells and might be targets for potential immunoregulation research.</jats:p>"

The previous studies focus on a low‐index dielectric core without its own optical resonances. Here, optical resonances of a core–shell nanosphere with a high refractive index (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> ≈ 4) core with the lowest order Mie resonances in the visible range are investigated theoretically and experimentally. Scattering and absorption spectra of a core–shell nanosphere for different values of the core refractive index are first analyzed, and there is a transition of the hybridization scheme around <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> ≈ 2. Above the value, a characteristic hybridized mode with strong absorption and weak scattering emerges in the near‐infrared range. A core–shell nanosphere composed of a silicon core and a gold shell is prepared, and the resonance modes are studied by single particle scattering spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a transmission electron microscope. The core–shell nanospheres exhibit the hybridized modes depending on the core diameter. The hybridized mode as well as the higher order one that is not observable in the scattering spectroscopy is observed in the EELS.</jats:p>",

By doing this, we aim to put focus on the gap between a certain European Union ideology – “united in diversity” – which is at the very heart of the EU project, and the everyday practices at technical universities, where linguistic and cultural competency education are often considered as marginal activities or elective add-ons compared to the hard core of technical subjects. The paper is based on European University Alliance documents and the observations and experiences made within one alliance’s working group on cultural and linguistic training during 2020-2022. We suggest that the gap between the rhetoric of multilingualism and multiculturalism and the reality of teaching and learning within the alliance has at least two sources: a tendency to engage in magical thinking where global competence develops “spontaneously” in international settings and a tendency to avoid addressing difficult questions, e.g., what multilingualism and multiculturalism actually mean in contemporary engineering education. This paper will provide some of the crucial questions that need addressing if we want to move beyond the empty rhetoric, as well as some practical suggestions for a systematic integration of cultural and linguistic competency education into engineering education.</jats:p>"

Even in small groups, students are responsible for much of their learning. Split classrooms are ones where pupils from two or more grade levels are placed in the same classroom. Values taught in the classroom may aid students in distinguishing between right and wrong, influencing their attitudes and behaviours as adults. Some of the problems are students’ lack of cooperation, empathy, and support for one another, insufficient financing for classroom resources and equipment, and students’ unable to keep up with education because teachers are held more responsible than they should be to increase meaningful academic learning and facilitate social and emotional growth. Video editing programs provide a more satisfying sensory experience than just reading from printed information. Deep learning (DL) allows pupils to think critically and successfully collaborate with others in all academic areas. Deep learning is a strategy and attitude to learning using complex mental talents such as the ability to analyze, create, solve issues, and think the state of play to build long-term comprehension. Using this method, EC-DL decent employment is becoming more cognitively demanding, and advanced skills are essential for students to cope with this reality. Due to this programmer, students become interested, autonomous learners, and active citizens in a democratic society. Classrooms were successful because they incorporated exploratory learning through guided inquiry-based activities, which increased students’ curiosity and encouraged them to develop higher-order thinking skills. In-class learning activities must be purposefully designed. According to one study, classes positively influenced student learning and success.</jats:p>",

Parallel programming was incorporated into the previous generation of the Raspberry Pi Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC). However, it yielded poor computing performance due to the processing power limits of the time. This research focuses on utilising two Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with increased processing capability compared to its previous generation to tackle fluid flow problems using numerical analysis and CFD. Parallel computing elements such as Secure Shell (SSH) and the Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol were implemented for Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processors. The parallel network was then validated by a processor call attempt and core execution test. Parallelisation of the processors enables the study of fluid flow and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems, such as validation of the NACA 0012 airfoil and an additional case of the Laplace equation for computing the temperature distribution via the parallel system. The experimental NACA 0012 data was validated using the parallel system, which can simulate the airfoil's physics. Each core was enabled and tested to determine the system's performance in parallelising the execution of various programming algorithms such as pi calculation. A comparison of the execution time for the NACA 0012 validation case yielded a parallelisation efficiency above 50%. The case studies confirmed the Raspberry Pi 3 B+'s successful parallelisation independent of external software and machines, making it a self-sustaining compact demonstration cluster of parallel computers for CFD.</jats:p>"

This unique synthesis method does not require any template or reducing gas. The synthesized multicore-shell structure has a shell of about 500 nm and multiple nuclei of several tens of nanometers. Subsequently, extensive experiments were conducted to adjust the material composition of the nanospheres by adjusting the amount of resorcinol and formaldehyde. The results showed that the obtained material performed best when resorcinol and formaldehyde were added to 0.2 g MnCo2O4 at 0.3 g and 0.42 mL, respectively. The efficient absorption bandwidth (EAB) value reaches 3.3 GHz when the absorber thickness is 3 mm. The reflection loss (RL) is up to −23.8 dB when the frequency is at 8.6 GHz. The unique yolk core-shell structure gives the material a heterogeneous interface, and the enhanced interfacial polarization loss causes the enhanced dielectric loss. The carbon layer with microporosity also causes conduction loss and multiple reflections. The composite structure formed by metallic Co, MnO, and carbon has better impedance matching and improved microwave absorption capability.</jats:p>"

They are sources of both thermal and non-thermal radiation, and are effective cosmic ray accelerators. We present the 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the plasma flows in a young compact cluster at the evolutionary stage comprising multiple interacting supersonic winds of massive OB and WR stars. The modelling allows studying the partitioning of the mechanical energy injected by the winds between the bulk motions, thermal heating, and magnetic fields. Cluster-scale magnetic fields reaching the magnitudes of ∼300 $\\mu$G show the filamentary structures spreading throughout the cluster core. The filaments with the high magnetic fields are produced by the Axford–Cranfill-type effect in the downstream of the wind termination shocks, which is amplified by a compression of the fields with the hot plasma thermal pressure in the central part of the cluster core. The hot (∼a few keV) plasma is heated at the termination shocks of the stellar winds and compressed in the colliding post-shock flows. We also discuss a possible role of the thermal conduction effects on the plasma flow, and analyse temperature maps in the cluster core and the diffuse thermal X-ray emission spectra. The presence of high cluster-scale magnetic fields supports the possibility of high-energy cosmic ray acceleration in clusters at the given evolutionary stage.</jats:p>",

Inefficient and unsustainable construction approaches for migrant shelters have resulted from improper planning and design systems regarding lifespan, materials and techniques, and socio-cultural aspects. Therefore, the study aim has an incentive to assess the impact of the morphological, siting, and layout of zones and shelters for the long-term displacement prototypes considering sustainability concepts from social context, affordability, adaptability, low-impact construction materials, and techniques. Furthermore, applying the dynamic simulation IDA ICE 4.8 tool was cardinal to justify the comprehensive reported outcomes based on the bottom-up construction method after assessing energy and thermal comfort performance in seven cases. The energy performance assessment regarding heating reveals the superiority of the compact layout plan system, while the open-layout plan system is superior for electric cooling assessment. Concerning thermal comfort performance for the number of accepted hours category, the open-layout plan system is superior. Fanger indicators for thermal comfort assessment demonstrated the superiority of the horizontal-compact layout plan scheme. The carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration level assessment shows that the open-yard layout cases have better results than other systems. To conclude, sustainable prototypes for displaced people should involve several aspects such as lifespan, socio-cultural and affordability, thermal performance and energy-efficient, and environmental impact. The beneficiaries from the methods and the results of this study would be firstly the Syrian refugees in the Middle East context, then various places and involved people affected by the displacement issue globally.</jats:p>"

Usually, a histological diagnosis of breast carcinoma is made by a pathologist through a biopsy, which is then confirmed through a surgical specimen: it is rare for the two to differ, particularly when there are pathognomonic morphological markers, such as osteoclast-like giant cells. Herein, we report a case of a 45-year-old pre-menopausal woman, who was found to have a single solid mass in her right breast on screening mammogram. She underwent a core biopsy, which showed a malignant epithelial lesion arranged in tubules, glands, and papillae, intermingled with numerous stromal osteoclast-like giant cells. Therefore, a diagnosis of breast cancer with osteoclast-like giant cells was rendered. Curiously, these cells were no longer detectable in the surgical specimen.</jats:p>"

Postimmunobiotics derived from the most remarkable strains were also evaluated in their capacity to modulate the immune response triggered by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in alveolar macrophages and to differentially regulate TLR3-mediated antiviral respiratory immunity in infant mice. We provide evidence that porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/31 cells) are a useful in vitro tool for the screening of new antiviral immunobiotics and postimmunobiotics by assessing their ability to modulate the expression IFN-β, IFN-λ1, RNAseL, Mx2, and IL-6, which can be used as prospective biomarkers. We also demonstrate that the postimmunobiotics derived from the Lactobacillus gasseri TMT36, TMT39 and TMT40 (HK36, HK39 or HK40) strains modulate the innate antiviral immune response of alveolar macrophages and reduce lung inflammatory damage triggered by TLR3 activation in vivo.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examined the transient or dynamic response of sandwich plates with a functionally graded porous core under the action of time-dependent loads. The plates had two isotropic faces at the top and bottom layers, and the middle layer was made of an open-cell material with functionally graded internal pores. By using the first-order shear deformation theory, the equations of motion used to describe the dynamic behavior of the plates were applied to generate accurate results with less computational effort. To solve the equations of motion, the Ritz method based on the Jacobi polynomials for the admissible displacements, cooperating with the time integration of Newmark, was used to find out the dynamic response of the plates. The results of the numerical experiments revealed that the plates carrying a larger number of internal pores at the middle zone of the core had a great improvement in flexural stiffness, providing less deflection under dynamic loads. The observed results of the plates’ dynamic behavior related to the effects of the porosity coefficient, plate’s geometrical ratio, dynamic loading types, porous distributions of the core, etc. are shown in the form of graphs and tables, which can be used as a benchmark for future research. </jats:p>",

Dispersed wires are then contacted by electron beam induced deposition for fabrication of single wire UV-LED devices. Rectifying diode-like behavior is first demonstrated for both GaN and GaN/AlGaN p-n junctions without a MQW active region. A weak leakage current in the GaN/AlGaN core-shell heterostructure is attributed to an additional conduction path along wire sidewalls. Electroluminescence at 340 nm in UV-A is demonstrated using a GaN (2.6 nm)/Al0.3Ga0.7N (3 nm) heterostructure embedded in a GaN/Al0.3Ga0.7N p–n junction. This value is even decreased to 310 nm by reducing the well thickness to 0.9 nm and increasing the Al-content of barriers (up to 60%) integrated in the GaN/Al0.3Ga0.7N p–n junction. This work demonstrates UV-B emission based on single wire core-shell UV-LEDs.</jats:p>",

Gently to moderately dipping mylonitic foliations in the complex are strongly lineated, with a lineation-azimuth average of 064–244° and dominantly top-southwest shear sense over the entire 115-km-long mylonite belt. Reconstruction of detachment fault displacement based on a variety of features indicates 40–60 km of displacement, with greater displacement in more southern areas. Widespread 26–28 Ma volcanism during early extensional basin genesis was followed by 24–26 Ma granitoid magmatism. Cooling of footwall mylonites continued until 22–24 Ma, as indicated by 40Ar/39Ar mica dates. Lower temperature thermochronometers suggest that footwall exhumation was still underway at ca. 20 Ma. Tectonic reconstruction places a variety of unmetamorphosed supracrustal units in the Tucson and Silver Bell Mountains above equivalent units that were metamorphosed and penetratively deformed in the Tortolita and Santa Catalina Mountains. This restored juxtaposition is interpreted as a consequence of older Laramide thrust burial of the deformed units, with northeast-directed thrusting occurring along the Wildhorse Mountain thrust in the Rincon Mountains and related but largely concealed thrusts to the northwest. Effective extensional exhumation of lower plate rocks resulted from a general lack of internal extension of the upper plate wedge. This is attributed to a stable sliding regime during the entire period of extension, with metamorphic core complex inflation by deep crustal flow leading to maintenance of wedge surface slope and detachment fault dip that favored stable sliding rather than internal wedge extension.</jats:p>",

The time-independent power flow equation (TI PFE) is used to explore the effect of the width of the distribution of the Gaussian launch beam on power flow in each of the seven cores. We show that the optical fiber length at which the equilibrium mode distribution (EMD) and steady-state distribution (SSD) are obtained is greatly influenced by the width of the Gaussian launch beam distribution. We further show that when the width of the Gaussian launch beam distribution widens, the optical fiber length at which angular division multiplexing (ADM) in each of the seven cores can be realized with minimal crosstalk between neighboring angular optical channels decreases. We demonstrate that, for increasing the capacity of an optical fiber transmission system, an SDM system with two- and three-channel ADM and multicore optical fiber multiplexing can be implemented with the proposed seven-core MM MC SOF at optical fiber lengths up to ≈1 km (2 ADM channels × 7 cores) and ≈200 m (3 ADM channels × 7 cores), respectively. Such characterization of MM MC SOFs under various launch conditions is important for building a multicore optical fiber SDM transmission system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Study Aim. The increase in the popularity of sports dances recently has been confirmed. Dancing combines sports and aesthetic components. Dances are used for sports, recreational and rehabilitation purposes. The study aim is an analytical analysis of publications devoted to sports dances and the determination of priority scientific areas in this field. Material and Methods. The bibliometric database Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) is analyzed. For the primary analysis, 618 sources were selected which met the search criteria for 2018–2022. We used bibliometric methods for processing the information received in the context of sports dances for 173 sources. The VOSviewer 1.6.18 program was used: keyword analysis method and direct citation analysis with the construction of bibliometric maps, visualization of cluster density, weights – citations. Results. The constructed bibliometric maps made it possible to identify the leading thematic areas of research, current areas of research in this field. They can be divided into sports, recreational, medical and rehabilitation areas. The sports context is aimed at studying the performance of technical elements, the development of the physical qualities of athletes, the assessment of physical fitness, the dynamics of the morphofunctional state. Psychophysiological studies are aimed at analyzing balance and equilibrium. Publications of a recreational orientation study the health-improving use of dances, their impact on health. The medical and rehabilitation direction explores the features of sports injuries in dancing, injury prevention and the possibility of using dances in the complex rehabilitation. The use of the VOSviewer program, version 1.6.18, made it possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the problem, to determine the priority scientific directions in this area. Conclusions. The conducted bibliometric analysis of publications confirms the relevance of the problem of sports dances. A constant research interest in this problem has been determined. Research in this area has a pronounced sports and medical focus. Bibliometric analysis of publications allows identification the three following areas: sports, recreation and rehabilitation. Dancing is being explored as a sport, a form of physical activity, and a form of rehabilitation. A fairly high level of sports injuries has led to interest in the analysis of the prevalence and prevention of injuries. Its characteristic feature is the intersection of these directions. The study of athletes’ state confirmed the lack of works devoted to a comprehensive study of athletes, predicting success and skill growth. There are not enough works studying the physical state of sports dancers. There are practically no studies aimed at studying the psychophysiological state. These types of studies should be assessed as relevant.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to develop and assess a novel nomogram model for predicting the probability of pCR based on the core biopsy.\n<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>\nIt was a retrospective study involving 769 BC patients administrated NAC between January 2012 and December 2017. After converting continuous variables to categorical variables, variables entering the model were sequentially identified by univariate analysis, multicollinearity test, and binary logistic regression analysis, and then a nomogram model was developed. The performance of the model was assessed concerning its discrimination, accuracy, and clinical utility. Internal validation was performed by the Bootstrap method.\n<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>\nThe optimal predictive threshold for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki67, and p53 were 22.5% (95%CI: 0.603-0.718), 6.5% (95%CI: 0.578-0.693), 32.5% (95%CI: 0.610-0.731), and 37.5% (95%CI: 0.586-0.716), respectively (all P &lt;0.001). Five variables were selected to develop the model, clinical T staging (cT), clinical nodal status (cN), ER status, Ki67 status, and p53 status (all P ≤0.001). The nomogram showed good discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.804 (95% CI: 0.756-0.853; P &lt;0.001) and good calibration. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the model had practical clinical value.\n<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>\nThis study constructed a novel nomogram model based on cT, cN, ER status, Ki67 status, and p53 status, which could be applied to personalize the prediction of pCR in BC patients treated with NAC.</jats:p>"

Using a multiple-case study, we analyse the partner selection process related to the firm’s non-core offerings. The analysis suggests that partner selection is a multiple-stage process rather than a single-stage process. Partners are evaluated against the first set of criteria comprising value offering and technological complexity, generating possible decision sets through trade-off. Once the first stage decision is favourable, partners are assessed against another set of criteria at the next stage. For low technological complexity, the criteria are propensity to scale up and competitive advantage, whereas for high technological complexity, the criteria are organisational compatibility and technological sophistication. The decision sets from the final stage conclude partner selection and possible on boarding. </jats:p>",

Several parameters, i.e., boundary conditions, explosive charge weight and asymmetrical loading, that can affect structural response under blast loads, are considered. The material and geometric nonlinearities and strain-rate effects are also taken into account in the modeling. Obtained results are compared with available experimental data to verify the developed finite element model and good agreement is observed. According to the results, sandwich panels with drilled I-core allow more plastic deformation and energy dissipation and less midpoint displacement compared with equivalent structures, i.e., conventional I-core sandwich panels and also solid plate with same weight and material.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis is typically focused on the involved lower extremity. There is a gap in the literature concerning the effectiveness of core stabilization training on the treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis. This investigation aimed to determine whether core stabilization improved the gait and functional ability of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Eighteen participants with knee osteoarthritis completed the six-week core stabilization intervention. Participants completed the gait motion analysis and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score to assess self-perceived function, pre- and post-intervention. Gait speed improved (p = 0.006, d = 0.59), while the external knee adduction moment decreased (p = 0.034, d = −0.90). Moreover, self-reported function improved (p &lt; 0.001, d = 1.26). The gait speed and external knee adduction moment changes met minimal detectable change thresholds, while gait speed also met the minimal clinically important difference. A six-week core stabilization program can thus improve gait speed and reduce the external knee adduction moment, which is tied to disease progression. Increased functional scores post-intervention indicate an important clinical improvement. Core stabilization training is a safe and potentially effective treatment option for this population.</jats:p>"

Upon continuous feeding with water, the central axial region experiences local low pressure across the height yielding the formation of an air-core, which executes meandering motion similar to the oscillation of an elastic string. We investigated the vortical flow and the induced oscillating behavior of an air column submerged in a water flow field inside a hydrocyclone. Through a series of experiments in a transparent hydrocyclone and subsequent full scale multiphase flow simulations with the Reynolds stress model, we analyzed the morphological characteristics of the air-core (mean and fluctuating properties). Air-core oscillations are characterized in terms of spatial wavelength and frequency. We show that hydrodynamics driven oscillating behavior of the air-core shares an analogy with the vibration of an elastic beam. Following this analogy, we obtain a scaling relationship between the wavelength and air-core radius, which is in good agreement with our experimental data and numerical results.</jats:p>",

In total, 27,953 SSRs were detected from all the unigenes, and 17,517 SSR primer pairs were successfully designed. Furthermore, we re-evaluated the genetic diversity of the germplasm bank of <jats:italic>C. oleifera</jats:italic> using 22 SSR markers. The number of alleles (<jats:italic>Na</jats:italic>) ranged from 4 to 25, with an average of 11.41; the effective number of alleles (<jats:italic>Ne</jats:italic>) ranged from 2.014 to 9.284, with an average of 4.800; the Shannon index (<jats:italic>I</jats:italic>) ranged from 0.716 to 2.471, with an average of 1.682; and the polymorphic information index (<jats:italic>PIC</jats:italic>) ranged from 0.380 to 0.883, with an average of 0.717. Finally, a core collection consisting of 45 samples (15% of the 300 trees in the entire germplasm bank) was developed, the genetic diversity parameters of which showed nonsignificant differences from the entire germplasm bank. Genomic SSR development, the re-evaluation of genetic diversity and the development of a core collection from the germplasm bank in this study provided useful tools, abundant genetic resources and an effective collection for the utilization and deep exploration of <jats:italic>C. oleifera</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

This study surveyed 941 secondary school students in Wenchuan using the posttraumatic growth inventory, adolescent academic burnout inventory, core beliefs inventory, and a self-designed demographic questionnaire. The results showed that: (1) Five months after the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the level of PTG among adolescents in the Wenchuan area was high and its prevalence was 32.3%. Among them, the dimension of perceived changes in self was the highest, and the PTG level of junior high school students was higher than that of high school students. The academic burnout level of adolescents, particularly emotional exhaustion, was also high. The academic burnout level of the high school students was higher than that of junior high school students. (2) There was a significant negative correlation between PTG and academic burnout among adolescents. (3) Core belief challenge moderated the relationship between PTG and academic burnout. PTG had a significant negative predictive effect on adolescents’ academic burnout only when the core belief challenge was above a moderate level. These results showed the uniqueness of PTG and psychological behavioral problems of adolescents in ethnic minority areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also emphasized the key role of core belief challenge in the process of PTG in reducing adolescents’ academic burnout. Based on these results, recommendations are provided to alleviate academic burnout among adolescents in Wenchuan against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. While providing full play to ethnic minority cultural characteristics to promote posttraumatic growth, guiding adolescents’ value reflection and cognitive reconstruction should be focused on.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To address the need for more responsible research and innovation, there is a growing call to integrate ethics education across the science and engineering curriculum. Accordingly, ethics education must not be limited to the avoidance of scientific misconduct but rather be oriented toward addressing the complexity of planetary challenges and realizing social good. Designing curricula to accommodate the ambition of integrated ethics, however, remains a great institutional and epistemic challenge. In this paper, we introduce the Berlin Ethics Certificate (BEC) at the Technical University of Berlin, to demonstrate how this challenge can be addressed by using interdisciplinarity as a core building block of integrated ethics education. The BEC’s unique approach to ethics education enables the positioning of ethical issues in all study programs within the university by designing futureoriented interdisciplinary courses open to all students, be they from the humanities, natural or engineering sciences. The paper outlines the BEC’s conceptualization of interdisciplinarity, ultimately arguing that interdisciplinary ethics education must be built upon the epistemic practice of situating knowledge. Methodologically, we show how the BEC approaches integrated ethics education through three iterative steps: 1) situating disciplinary knowledge in relation to other forms of knowledge, values and experiences (by focusing on multidisciplinary learning experiences), 2) establishing a common epistemic practice of collaboration (by focusing on interdisciplinary learning experiences), and 3) actively engaging with non-academic stakeholders to create responsible technology and take ethical action beyond the university (by focusing on transdisciplinary learning experiences). Examples of how the BEC implements this methodology are shown, which may serve as suggestions of best practices in integrated ethics education.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fissility is the ability of some rocks to split along relatively smooth surfaces parallel to the bedding. This property observed mostly in fine-grained rocks is particularly expressed in outcrops, where rocks are subjected to weathering processes. Most authors associate the fissility to the abundance of clay minerals and their orientation parallel to the bedding. The horizontal fabric can be promoted by depositional conditions such as sediment composition, quantity of total organic carbon content (TOC) and depositional mechanisms, giving rise to a primary fissility. Alternatively, the alignment of platy minerals can be linked to the burial history of the rock, by processes such as mechanical compaction or secondary mineral growth, resulting in a secondary fissility. The present study aims to identify the main controls of fissility development at the micro- and macroscopic scale in rocks of the Vaca Muerta Formation exposed in the Cerro Mulichinco area and in a 121-meter-long core extracted from a well within the Neuquén Basin. In outcrops, fissility is related to fine-grained laminated facies with low carbonate content, revealing the strong control exerted by lithology. The TOC measurements allow establishing a positive correlation between organic matter content and fissility intensity. Moreover, the analysis of the transgressive-regressive cycles shows that fissility is higher around the maximum flooding surfaces. Regarding their mechanical characteristics, the different interfaces observed in core are classified into first and second-order, the last one including fissility planes. Some of these interfaces evolve from potential (partially open) to effective (totally open) discontinuities in response to changes of stress conditions during the core extraction and due to the stress relaxation through time: weeks (T1), months (T2) and years (T3) after extraction. The time evolution of the effective core discontinuities points out rock intervals that are variably broken and core segments that remain intact. The Drying Alcohol Discontinuities (DAD) methodology reveals potential discontinuities within apparently intact core segments. By using this technique, a 4-class index is established as a proxy for fissility degree. When integrated with geological, petrophysical and geomechanical data, this index enables characterizing the main mechanisms controlling rock fissility that express through discontinuities promoting the loss of competence of a rock. Consequently, this mechanical property is considered to influence the efficiency of hydraulic fracture in shale reservoir completion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hollow-core anti-resonant fibers (HC-ARFs) are en route to compete with and surpass the transmission performance of standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs). Recently, nested cladding elements emerged as a key enabler in reaching ultra-low transmission losses over a wide bandwidth. However, implementing nested geometry features poses a great challenge even in the current state-of-the-art fiber fabrication technology, often leading to structural imperfections, which ultimately worsen overall fiber performance. This article provides insights into the impact of fabrication-based perturbations of the cladding elements on the transmission performance and identifies areas of highest susceptibility. The impact of random outer and nested cladding tube misalignments as well as their anisotropic deformation on the propagation loss is analyzed based on observations of experimentally fabricated fibers. A dominance of the deformation effect over the misalignment effect is observed, with higher-order modes (HOMs) being affected one order of magnitude stronger than the fundamental mode (FM). The impact on propagation loss by structural perturbations is highly wavelength dependent, ranging from negligibly small values up to loss increases of 65% and 850% for FM and HOM propagation, respectively. The investigations are directly linked to fabrication metrics and therefore pave the way for assessing, predicting, and improving the transmission quality of fabricated hollow-core fibers.</jats:p>",

Utilizing a ultrahigh‐vacuum based multi‐tip scanning tunneling microscope, this work reveals inadvertent conductivity channels between the nanowire (NW) base and the substrate, when measuring individual vertical core‐shell III‐V‐semiconductor NWs. For that, four‐terminal probing is applied on freestanding, epitaxially grown coaxial p‐GaAs/i‐GaInP/n‐GaInP NWs without the need of nanoscale lithography or deposition of electrical contacts. This advanced analysis, carried out after composition‐selective wet chemical etching, reveals a substantially degraded electrical performance of the freestanding NWs compared to detached ones. In an electron beam induced current mode of the nanosensor, charge separation at the substrate‐to‐NW base junction is demonstrated. An energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopic linescan shows an unintended compositional change of the epitaxially grown NW toward the planar layers caused by different incorporation mechanisms of Ga and In at the NW base. This approach provides direct insight into the NW‐substrate transition area and leads to a model of the conductivity channels at the NW base, which should, in principle, be considered in the fabrication of all NW heterostructures grown bottom‐up on heterogeneous substrate materials.</jats:p>",

Negatively charged latex nanoparticles (NPs) with nominal diameters of 20, 40, and 100 nm are also studied as surrogates for bioparticles. Protein binding and its trends with respect to salt concentration depend on the protein size and are different for the two agarose‐based multimodal resins. For the smaller proteins, the amount of protein bound over practical time scales is limited by the resin surface area and is larger for Capto Core 400 compared with Capto Core 700. For the larger proteins, diffusion is severely restricted in Capto Core 400, resulting in lower binding capacities than those observed for Capto Core 700 despite the larger surface area. Adding 500 mM NaCl reduces the local bound protein concentration and diffusional hindrance resulting in higher binding capacities for the large proteins in Capto Core 400 compared with low ionic strength conditions. The NPs are essentially completely excluded from the Capto Core 400 pores. However, 20 and 40 nm NPs bind significantly to Capto Core 700, further hindering protein diffusion.

Establishing the reliability is needed before it can be used in practice. OBJECTIVE: Examine the intra-observer reliability of a trunk isokinetic dynamometer. METHODS: 31 participants were recruited. Tests were performed twice with an interval of 5–9 days by the same observer. Testing included rotation, flexion/extension and lateral flexion at speeds of 90∘/s and 60∘/s. The main outcome measure was peak torque (PT). The secondary outcomes included peak torque angle (PTA), time to peak torque (TTPT) and compensatory torques (CompTQ). The intra-observer reliability was investigated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: Peak torque reliability was good to excellent (ICC = 0.70–0.91), whereas the reliability of the PTA (ICC =-0.04–0.56) and TTPT (ICC = 0.01–0.68) were poor to moderate. CompTQ reliability was moderate to good (ICC = 0.20–0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The intra-observer reliability of the isokinetic measurement of core strength peak torque was good. The secondary outcomes peak torque angle and time to peak torque were less reliable and the compensatory torques showed moderate to good reliability. This isokinetic dynamometer could have useful applications in the field of sports medicine and rehabilitation.</jats:p>",

A major challenge in liver tissue engineering is to mimic the tissue-level complexity: besides the selection of suitable biomaterial(s) replacing the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell sources, the three-dimensional (3D) microarchitecture defined by the fabrication method is a critical factor to achieve functional constructs. In this study, coaxial extrusion-based 3D bioprinting has been applied to develop a liver sinusoid-like model that consists of a core compartment containing pre-vascular structures and a shell compartment containing hepatocytes. The shell ink was composed of alginate and methylcellulose (algMC), dissolved in human fresh frozen plasma. The algMC blend conferred high printing fidelity and stability to the core–shell constructs and the plasma as biologically active component enhanced viability and supported cluster formation and biomarker expression of HepG2 embedded in the shell. For the core, a natural ECM-like ink based on angiogenesis-supporting collagen-fibrin (CF) matrices was developed; the addition of gelatin (G) enabled 3D printing in combination with the plasma-algMC shell ink. Human endothelial cells, laden in the CFG core ink together with human fibroblasts as supportive cells, formed a pre-vascular network in the core in the absence and presence of HepG2 in the shell. The cellular interactions occurring in the triple culture model enhanced the albumin secretion. In conclusion, core–shell bioprinting was shown to be a valuable tool to study cell–cell-interactions and to develop complex tissue-like models.</jats:p>",

Utilizing δ18O we identified two climate regimes during the satellite era. During the 1979–1998 positive interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) phase, a low-pressure system north of the Weddell Sea drove southeasterly winds that are associated with an increase in warm air mass intrusion onto the Larsen shelves, which melted and a decreased sea ice concentration in the Weddell Sea/increase in the Bellingshausen Sea. This climate setting is associated with anomaly low δ18O values (compared with the latter IPO period). There is significantly more melt along the northern AP ice shelf margins and on the Larsen D and southern Larsen C during the 1979–1998 IPO positive phase. The IPO positive climatic setting was coincidental with the Larsen A ice shelf collapse. In contrast, during the IPO negative phase (1999–2011), northerly winds caused a reduction in sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea/Drake Passage region. Moreover, a Southern Ocean north of the Weddell Sea high-pressure system caused low-latitude warm humid air over the tip and east of the AP, a setting that is associated with increased northern AP snowfall, a high δ18O anomaly, and less prone to Larsen ice shelf melt.</jats:p>"

The heterostructure and the individual materials were characterized by various microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy and correspondingly the density of states spectra, we locate the band edges to infer the nature of the individual semiconductors. The energy level diagram of the heterostructure shows the type‐II band alignment at the interface, which facilitates charge separation upon illumination. In consequence, the heterostructure reveals a better degradation yield (82.5 %) of methylene blue under sunlight and photovoltaic response compared to the individual semiconductors. The ZnO nanoparticle shell plays an important role in enhancing catalytically active sites including photogenerated charge carriers to disintegrate chemical disposal from the wastewater. All oxide heterostructures thus provide a perfect combination to maximize solar light absorption, including improved charge carrier separation at the junction by appropriate core‐shell interface band alignment.</jats:p>",

As such, data can be stored by an entity that is not necessarily trusted to enforce access control, or an entity that is not even trusted to have access to the plaintext data at all. Instead, access control can be externally enforced by a trusted entity. Additionally, some multi-authority variants of ABE—which do not have a central authority—can effectively and securely implement access control in multiple-domain settings. Furthermore, ABE is the only cryptographic approach to fine-grained access control that does not require an online trusted third party during access requests, and thus provides better availability properties. The actual realization of these theoretical advantages in practice depends on whether current state-of-the-art ABE schemes support the necessary core properties. Much progress has been made in the last two decades in pairing-based ABE schemes, owing to their versatility and efficiency. In fact, it is possible to support most core properties under strong security guarantees, while incurring acceptable storage and computational costs. It is therefore a good time to ask ourselves whether pairing-based ABE has reached its full practical potential. To answer this question, we provide a comprehensive systematized overview of various existing pairing-based ABE schemes and their core properties. We also investigate the relationship between these core properties and real-world access control requirements. We show that a few challenges remain, that must be overcome for ABE to reach its full potential as a mechanism to implement efficient and secure access control in practice.</jats:p>",

Their textual profiles, as well as profiles of the indexes that characterize the secondary structure and the mechanical and physicochemical properties, were analyzed. The evolutionarily stable, extremely heterogeneous special secondary structure of POL II core promoters was revealed, which includes two singular regions—hexanucleotide “INR” around TSS and octanucleotide “TATA element” of about −28 bp upstream. Such structures may have developed at some stage of evolution. It turned out to be so well matched for the pre-initiation complex formation and the subsequent initiation of transcription for POL II machinery that in the course of evolution there were selected only those nucleotide sequences that were able to reproduce these structural properties. The individual features of specific sequences representing the singular region of the promoter of each gene can affect the kinetics of DNA-protein complex formation and facilitate strand separation in double-stranded DNA at the TSS position.</jats:p>"

However, the scientific debate about its efficacy for improving individual and team sports performance is still open. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effects of circuit training with a core exercise program on physical performance in competitive amateur soccer players. The training was conducted during the off-season period, two times per week for 8 weeks. Pre- and post-evaluations were conducted using the following tests: Y-Balance Test (YB), standing long jump (SLJ), medicine ball chest press (MBC), curl-up (CU), and Illinois Agility Test (IAT). A total of 19 adults were divided into an experimental group (EG, n = 11, age 22 years, weight 71.2 ± 4.8 kg, height 174 ± 5.8 cm) and a control group (CG, n = 8, age 22 years, weight 73.2 ± 4.1 Kg, height 176 ± 6.3 cm). The EG showed significant improvements in lower and upper body strength, core endurance and balance, whereas the CG did not report significant changes in the pre- and post-test comparison. Despite study limitations, our positive results show that circuit training with core exercises appears to be a good strategy for performance improvement in adult soccer players.</jats:p>"

Such a multi-proxy approach provides a sensitive record of changing lake level and depositional conditions in Lake Salda during the mid-to-late Holocene. The low water level during the middle Holocene is followed by subsequent lake level decrease until 1690 cal year BP due to a drier climate. This prominent climate deterioration induced the coastal regression in the lake as inferred from the progradational deltaic sequences in the high-resolution seismic record. During the same period of a dry climate, oligotrophic lake conditions gave rise to the formation of stromatolite in the lake, timely coinciding with the Roman Warm Period. The following period of the late Holocene is represented by considerable lake level drop due to the enhanced dry climate that is earmarked by prominent erosional truncation surface and channel-incisions in the seismic profiles. This aridification phase is subsequently followed by transgressive lake level during 1690-1050 cal year BP, giving rise to a retreat of the deltaic deposit further inland as documented in the high-resolution seismic profile. The further deepening of the lake by contributions of both climate and tectonics during the last 650 cal year BP produced a transgressive unit with typical of onlapping architecture in the seismic reflection profiles and the formation of Gilbert-type fan deltas along the shoreline.</jats:p>"

This has led to data providers putting these data in fields where they cannot easily be found by users, which impedes the reuse and improvement of these data by other researchers. Here we describe the development of the Chronometric Age Extension to Darwin Core, a ratified, community-developed extension that enables the reporting of ages of specimens from deeper time and the evidence supporting these estimates. The extension standardizes reporting about the methods or assays used to determine an age and other critical information like uncertainty. It gives data providers flexibility about the level of detail reported, focusing on the minimum information needed for reuse while still allowing for significant detail if providers have it. Providing a standardized format for reporting these data will make them easier to find and search and enable researchers to pinpoint specimens of interest for data improvement or accumulate more data for broad temporal studies. The Chronometric Age Extension was also the first community-managed vocabulary to undergo the new Biodiversity Informatics Standards (TDWG) review and ratification process, thus providing a blueprint for future Darwin Core extension development.</jats:p>"

This condition captures the vast majority of the behaviour of the one hundred 2D state-of-the-art models we performed to gauge its usefulness. The goal is to predict, without resort to detailed simulation, the explodability of a given massive star. We find that the simple maximum fractional ram pressure jump discriminant we define works well ∼90 per cent of the time and we speculate on the origin of the few false positives and false negatives we witness. The maximum ram pressure jump generally occurs at the time of accretion of the silicon/oxygen interface, but not always. Our results depend upon the fidelity with which the current implementation of our code F ornax adheres to Nature and issues concerning the neutrino–matter interaction, the nuclear equation of state, the possible effects of neutrino oscillations, grid resolution, the possible role of rotation and magnetic fields, and the accuracy of the numerical algorithms employed remain to be resolved. Nevertheless, the explodability condition we obtain is simple to implement, shows promise that it might be further generalized while still employing data from only the unstable Chandrasekhar progenitors, and is a more credible and robust simple explosion predictor than can currently be found in the literature.</jats:p>",

The captured polarization images contain considerable object information because the illuminating polarized light beams are affected by many of the Mueller matrix elements. By assembling the polarization camera using two liquid crystal retarders and a polarization grating, the PPPI system offers the potential to measure the Stokes parameters fully with a high extinction ratio, even in the NIR region. The PPPI system’s feasibility was demonstrated experimentally. Its dependence on the state of polarization (SoP) of the illuminating polarized light was discussed. The polarization image acquired by the PPPI system is strongly dependent on the illuminating light’s SoP, so the appropriate SoP must be selected for each object to enhance the polarization image contrast. This PPPI system should expand the range of polarization imaging applications, including LiDAR, product inspection, and bio-imaging.</jats:p>"

Understanding the processes that influence bromine preservation in the ice is crucial to achieve a reliable interpretation of ice core signals and to potentially relate them to past sea-ice variability. Here, we present a 210-years bromine record that sheds light on the main processes controlling bromine preservation in the snow and ice at Dome C, East Antarctic plateau. Using observations alongside a modelling approach, we demonstrate that the bromine signal is preserved at Dome C, and it is not affected by the strong variations in ultraviolet radiation reaching the Antarctic plateau due to the stratospheric ozone hole. Based on this, we investigate whether the Dome C Brenr record can be used as an effective tracer of past Antarctic sea-ice. Due to the limited time window covered by satellite measurements and the low sea-ice variability observed during the last 30 years in East Antarctica, at this stage we cannot fully validate Brenr as an effective proxy for past sea-ice reconstructions at Dome C.\n                        </jats:p>"

Accurately predicting the trends of key thermal hydraulic parameters under various working conditions can greatly improve reactor safety, thereby effectively preventing the occurrence of nuclear power plant accidents. The thermal hydraulic characteristic parameters in the reactor are affected by many factors, in order to preliminarily study whose forecasting methods and determine the feasibility of neural network forecasting, the China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) is selected as the research target in this study, and the maximum surface temperature of fuel rod sheath and mass flow rate are used as predictive variables. After data samples are generated through the reactor sub channel analysis code (named SUBCHANFLOW), two widely used adaptive neural networks are used to perform the thermal hydraulic parameter forecast analysis of CEFR fuel assembly under steady-state conditions. The 1/2 core model of CEFR is used to perform a single-step predictive analysis of thermal hydraulic parameters under transient conditions. The results show that the adaptive radial basis function (RBF) neural network exhibits a better fitting ability and higher forecasting accuracy than that of the adaptive back propagation neural network, and the maximum error under steady-state conditions is 0.5%. Under transient conditions, poor forecasting accuracy is observed for some local points; however, the adaptive RBF neural network is generally excellent at predicting temperature and mass flow. The mean relative error of temperature does not exceed 1%, and the mean relative error of flow does not exceed 6.5%. The proposed RBF neural network model can provide real-time forecasting in a short time under unstable flow conditions, and its forecasting results have a certain reference value.</jats:p>"

Their catalytic capability can be greatly boosted by the rational design and construction of complex PBA hybrid nanostructures. However, present‐day structure engineering inevitably involves additional etchant or procedure. Herein, a facile, yet controllable one‐pot self‐assembly strategy is introduced to prepare hierarchical core‐shell polymetallic PBAs (featuring bimetallic FeMn PBAs cores and CoNi PBAs shells) with hollow nano‐cages/solid nano‐cube architectures. The detailed characterization of material morphology/composition, assisted with theoretical simulations, reveals the underlying formation mechanism where the key factor is the control of the nucleation rate via the use of chelating agent (citrates) and reaction kinetics. The resulting FeMn@CoNi–H compound is found to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential (236 mV at a current density 10 mA cm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>) as well as a low Tafel slope (58.4 mV dec<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Such an impressive performance is endowed by the rational compositional and structural design with optimized electronic structures as well as an increase in exposed active sites.

How to design homework scientifically, reasonably and effectively according to the teaching contents and learning conditions is the key exploration of junior high school science teaching under the background of “double reduction”. Based on the understanding of the core literacy of science and the analysis of the current status of science homework in junior high schools, we combined with the teaching practice of science homework design, and considered the improvement path for the design of junior high school science homework that points to the core literacy under the \"double reduction\" policy. Teachers can proceed with the following four aspects to improve the quality of homework design: designing conceptual homework from science concepts to consolidate basic knowledge; designing improving homework from science thinking to enhance the quality of assignments; designing practice-based homework from inquiry and practice to enrich the form of assignments; designing value-oriented homework from attitude and responsibility to bring out the value of educating people, so as to truly help students achieve \"quality improvement, efficiency increase, and burden reduction\" in learning, and cultivate students' core literacy.</jats:p>"

Based on this, this paper takes symbiosis theory as the perspective of analysis and explores the optimization of the rural revitalization path and the construction of a symbiosis model under the logic of “common construction, common governance and sharing”. Taking Zhoutian village in China, which has significant endogenous resource advantages but is difficult to develop, this paper uses quantitative analysis and qualitative interviews to analyze the logic of ancient villages that are difficult to form sustainable development paths in and explore the conditions for the formation of symbiotic relationships. The results show the following: (1) The current symbiosis model of ancient villages is an asymmetric reciprocal symbiosis model, resulting in short-term behavior for each symbiotic unit, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of ancient villages. (2) The core stakeholders are closely related to each other and have partly common goals. (3) The symbiotic relationship of ancient villages should evolve toward a symmetrical and reciprocal integrated symbiosis model, which should coordinate the relationship between the various interests and build a symbiotic path. To this end, this paper tries to build a symbiotic development model of “co-construction, co-rule and sharing” and refine the development mechanism based on the case of resource co-construction, joint governance and benefit sharing, hoping to provide reference for the rural revitalization and sustainable development of other villages.</jats:p>"

The recent literature indicated that both, embryonic thermal manipulation (ETM) and in ovo feeding (IOF) of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can mitigate the deleterious effects of heat stress (HS) in young broiler chicks. Therefore, this study intended to assess the effects of cyclic HS (32 ± 1 °C, 4 h/day from day 29 to 35) on rectal temperatures (RTs) and survival in broiler chickens after ETM and in IOF of GABA. A total of 275 RT data points and survival data were collected from chicks assigned to the following five treatments: chicks hatched from control eggs (CON); chicks hatched from control eggs but exposed to HS (CON + HS); chicks hatched from eggs injected at 17.5 days of incubation with 0.6 mL of 10% GABA and exposed to HS (G10 + HS); chicks hatched from thermally manipulated eggs (39.6 °C, 6 h/day from embryonic days 10 to 18) and exposed to HS (TM + HS); chicks hatched from eggs that received both previous treatments during incubation and exposed to HS (G10 + TM + HS). Under thermoneutral conditions, RTs increased quadratically from 39.9 ± 0.2 °C at hatching to 41.4 ± 0.1 °C at 8 days of age. When exposed to cyclic HS during the last week of rearing, the birds’ RTs tended to decrease at the end of the heat stress challenge (from 43.0 ± 0.2 °C on day 29 to 42.4 ± 0.1 °C on day 35). A stepwise Cox regression indicated that treatment was predictive of birds’ survival. Hazard ratios (HR) and their confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the likelihood of death during the trial. The birds, belonging to the G10 + TM + HS group, were less likely to die under HS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.91, P = 0.041) compared to the CON + HS birds. Taken together, the combination of ETM and GABA IOF may help mitigate the drawbacks of cyclic HS by improving the survival of broilers.</jats:p>"

In its first phase, WEST plasmas were mostly heated by lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) and ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH). In this publication, the collapsing pulses are analysed to understand the key actuators at play. Experimentally, an initial slow reduction of central electron temperature due to a density increase is observed, while the central tungsten profile is flat and constant in time. Then, radiative collapse occurs: the core tungsten profile peaks rapidly, at the same time, the central hard x-ray channel measurement decreases indicating a change in core LHCD absorption. Integrated modelling is used to explore the causality chain. To capture the collapse speed, both, tungsten core peaking and reduction of central LHCD absorption are required. When central LHCD power absorption is reduced, core electron and ion temperature profiles flatten which reduces the tungsten neoclassical thermal screening and leads to the observed core tungsten accumulation.</jats:p>",

The moment-based loss function is convex and differentiable and can easily incorporate clinical dose volume histogram (DVH) domain knowledge in any deep learning (DL) framework without computational overhead. <jats:italic>Approach.</jats:italic> We used a large dataset of 360 (240 for training, 50 for validation and 70 for testing) conventional lung patients with 2 Gy × 30 fractions to train the DL model using clinically treated plans at our institution. We trained a UNet like convolutional neural network architecture using computed tomography, planning target volume and organ-at-risk contours as input to infer corresponding voxel-wise 3D dose distribution. We evaluated three different loss functions: (1) the popular mean absolute error (MAE) loss, (2) the recently developed MAE + DVH loss, and (3) the proposed MAE + moments loss. The quality of the predictions was compared using different DVH metrics as well as dose-score and DVH-score, recently introduced by the <jats:italic>AAPM knowledge-based planning grand challenge. Main results.</jats:italic> Model with (MAE + moment) loss function outperformed the model with MAE loss by significantly improving the DVH-score (11%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) while having similar computational cost. It also outperformed the model trained with (MAE + DVH) by significantly improving the computational cost (48%) and the DVH-score (8%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). <jats:italic>Significance.</jats:italic> DVH metrics are widely accepted evaluation criteria in the clinic. However, incorporating them into the 3D dose prediction model is challenging due to their non-convexity and non-differentiability. Moments provide a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient way to incorporate DVH information in any DL architecture.

Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for managing ankle OA. One of the current challenges to establishing guidelines is the lack of a widely agreed-upon set of outcome measures that are consistently used in ankle OA research. Without a set of agreed-upon outcome measures, it is difficult to synthesise clinical trial outcomes through meta-analysis—an essential element of evidence-informed practice. In order to develop an appropriate set of outcome measures for ankle OA, it is important first to develop a core domain set. In this protocol, we describe the methodological approach that we will use to develop such a core domain set for ankle OA.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We established an international steering committee to guide the development of a core domain set for ankle OA. The core domain set development will follow a multi-staged approach consisting of three phases, involving participation by patients and clinicians/healthcare professionals. In phase 1, a list of candidate domains will be gleaned from (a) a scoping review of outcome measures used in ankle OA research, (b) qualitative interviews with individuals with ankle OA, and (c) qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals with expertise in ankle OA. In phase 2, the steering committee will review and generate a list of candidate domains from those gleaned in phase 1. In phase 3, this list of candidate domains will be considered in a Delphi process to reach a consensus on a core domain set. We anticipated this will involve 3 rounds of surveys.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This protocol describes the methods that will be used to develop a core domain set of health-related aspects for ankle OA.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex interweb of cells and mediators balancing carcinogenesis, inflammation, and the immune response. However, cytokines are not only secreted within the TME but also released by a variety of other cells that do not comprise the TME; therefore, a thorough assessment of humoral changes in OSCC should include the measurement of serum cytokines. Methods: We assessed the role of various serum cytokines in the evolution of OSCC, before and after treatment, versus a control group. We measured the serum concentrations of MIP-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. Results: Significantly higher values (p &lt; 0.01) were noted for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α in the OSCC group before treatment (n = 13) compared with the control group (n = 14), and the increased concentrations persisted after treatment (n = 11). Furthermore, the variations in the values of MIP-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α are correlated both before and after treatment (p &lt; 0.01). In the pretherapeutic group, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations also correlate with IL-1β and IL-10 serum levels (p &lt; 0.01), while in the posttherapeutic group, IL-4 varies with MIP-1α and TNF-α (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: In OSCC patients, serum cytokine levels are significantly higher compared with control, but they are not significantly altered by treatment, therefore implying that they are also influenced by systemic factors. The interactions between all involved cytokines and the various pathways they regulate warrant further studies to clarify their definitive roles.</jats:p>"

Combining these two advanced processes facilitates the fabrication of near-net shape components leading to optimized designs. This study introduces the joining of flow-formed seamless tubes of MLX®19 maraging steel using the IFW process to fabricate a near-net shape component used in landing gears and missile parts. The as-received material was initially provided ≈30% reduction in thickness from the flow forming trials and then welded at four varying weld energies while maintaining constant friction and forge pressures. The mechanical behavior of the weldments was characterized, and the optimized weld parameters were determined. The concomitant microstructural evolution of the optimized weld was also examined to comprehend the underlying deformation mechanisms. The weld strength, axial shortening, and width of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) displayed an increasing trend with an increase in the weld energy. The weld-zone (WZ) and thermomechanical affected zone (TMAZ) showed the presence of martensite, whereas in the HAZ presence of intermetallic precipitates and reverted austenite was confirmed along with tempered martensite. Based on microstructural evidence, it was concluded that the peak temperature attained in the WZ was above Ac3, whereas in the TMAZ it was in-between Ac1 and Ac3. The evolution of crystallographic texture implied that WZ was subjected to pure shear deformation during the welding whereas the TMAZ experienced a combined shear and compressive deformation.</jats:p>",

Historically, these cell types have been conflated and studied as a single population of ‘tumour-associated macrophages’. Recent advances in single-cell omics have allowed population delineation, suggesting microglia and BMDMs may play different roles within the tumour and subsequently differentially affect tumour progression. Despite building evidence for the unique functions of these cells within glioblastoma, the inherent heterogeneity of the tumour landscape has complicated such studies. Indeed, macrophages exist as phenotypically and functionally diverse populations that are polarised in a context-dependent manner. Hence, to understand the differences between microglia and BMDMs within glioblastoma, both ontogeny and spatial location must be considered.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Material and Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To elucidate the functional roles of microglia and BMDMs across the tumour landscape, a publicly available RNAseq dataset was utilised to classify myeloid cells into four populations based on spatial location and ontogeny. These were tumour core BMDMs and microglia, or tumour periphery BMDMs and microglia. Differential gene analysis was then performed to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between classified myeloid populations. Tumour core DEGs were then compared against the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas to define their expression across anatomical tumour regions. Finally, myeloid DEGs were validated at the protein level on human glioblastoma tissue through immunohistochemistry.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Microglia and BMDMs showed different spatial distributions across the tumour landscape and displayed distinct functional expression profiles. Microglia held a more chemotactic and pro-inflammatory profile, whereas BMDMs held a more pro-tumoural profile. However, a comparison of microglia between the tumour core and periphery revealed that tumour microglia upregulate many pro-tumoural genes, including multiple genes that have previously been defined as ‘BMDM-enriched’. Moreover, we found myeloid DEGs identified within the tumour core cluster to distinct spatial tumour regions such as the vascular or hypoxic niche. Immunohistochemical staining reflected these spatial expression profiles, identifying a distinct population of phagocytic macrophages within the hypoxic niche.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Although microglia and BMDMs represent two ontogenetically distinct myeloid populations within glioblastoma, both cell types can adopt similar functional expression profiles within the tumour core, particularly within tumour niches. This indicates that myeloid cell function is strongly influenced by the tumour microenvironment, rather than ontogeny alone.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Despite their distinctive functions, rod and cone visual pigments utilize the same vitamin A-derived chromophore. To sustain vision, vitamin A precursors must be acquired in the gut, metabolized, and distributed to the eyes. Deficiencies in this pathway in inherited ocular disease states deplete cone photoreceptors from chromophore and eventually lead to cell death, whereas the more abundant rod photoreceptors are less affected. However, pathways that support cone function and survival under such conditions are largely unknown. Using biochemical, histological, and physiological approaches, we herein show that intervention with β-carotene in STRA6-deficient mice improved chromophore supply to cone photoreceptors. Relieving the inherent negative feedback regulation of β-carotene oxygenase-1 activity in the intestine by genetic means further bolstered cone photoreceptor functioning in the STRA6-deficient eyes. A vitamin A-rich diet, however, did not improve cone photoreceptor function in STRA6-deficiency. We provide evidence that the beneficial effect of β-carotene on cones results from favorable serum kinetics of retinyl esters in lipoproteins. The respective alterations in lipoprotein metabolism maintained a steady supply of retinoids to the STRA6-deficient eyes, which ameliorated the competition for chromophore between rod and cone photoreceptors. Together, our study elucidates a cone photoreceptor-survival pathway and unravels an unexpected metabolic connection between the gut and the retina.</jats:p>"

The fabricated DSSC shows an enhanced light scattering, improved dye absorption capability, and reduced electron recombination rate despite the thinner photoelectrode film. The synthesized elongated nanoparticle structure provides a larger surface area for anchoring more dye molecules.

However, the SERS effect only exists directly in the surface of MNP or restricted around the plasmonic MNP surface. Consequently, the nanoscale control of the thickness of MOF shell in hybrid core-shell substrates is highly desirable. Despite the great effects which have been made to integrate various MOF matrices with MNP for the purpose of improving the SERS activity, the nanoscale thickness control of MOF shell remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a facile regulation method that enables the Au NP to be encapsulated by a zirconium-based MOF (BUT-17) with different thickness through the controlling of synthesis parameters. This method provides a promising strategy for optimizing the activity of core-shell SERS substrates for potential trace detection.</jats:p>"

Objective: In this cross-sectional, explorative study we investigated possible associations of vitamin D in CSF with biomarkers for AD, amyloid-β, tau protein/phosphorylated tau protein in CSF, and with the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in CSF in patients with cognitive impairment and cognitively healthy controls. Methods: We included 100 outpatients ≥65 years referred for assessment of cognitive impairment and 76 age- and sex-matched cognitively healthy controls. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), amyloid-β, tau protein and phosphorylated tau protein, as well as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, were analyzed in CSF in both groups. Results: Higher levels of 25(OH)D in CSF in all groups together were associated with lower levels of tau protein (p = 0.01) and phosphorylated tau protein (p = 0.005). We found no association between 25(OH)D levels in CSF and pathological levels of amyloid-β in CSF nor levels of IL-6 or TNF-α in CSF. Higher levels of 25(OH)D in CSF were associated with higher levels of IL-8 in CSF (p = 0.002). However, vitamin D explained only 6% of variance in IL-8. There was no significant difference between the patient groups and the control group regarding the association between 25(OH)D in CSF and any of the three cytokines in CSF. Conclusion: Participants with higher CSF levels of 25(OH)D exhibited reduced CSF levels of tau protein and phosphorylated tau protein.</jats:p>",

Alternatively, dimensional transdiagnostic studies have provided a promising pathway toward realizing personalized medicine and improved treatment outcomes. One factor that may influence response to psychiatric treatments is cognitive function, which is reflected in one’s intellectual capacity. Intellectual capacity is also reflected in the organization and structure of intrinsic brain networks. Using a large transdiagnostic cohort (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1721), we sought to discover neuroimaging biomarkers by developing a resting-state functional connectome-based prediction model for a key intellectual capacity measure, Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), across the diagnostic spectrum.

The robustness and generalizability of our model was further validated on three independent cohorts (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 2641). We identified key transdiagnostic connectome signatures underlying FSIQ capacity involving the dorsal-attention, frontoparietal and default-mode networks. Meanwhile, diagnosis groups showed disorder-specific biomarker patterns.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objectives. To analyze the tissue heterogeneity of hormone-sensitive and drug-resistant nephrotic syndrome genes using a bioinformatics approach and to analyze gene-related functional pathways. Methods. The limma package of R software was used to screen differential genes from the nephropathy datasets GSE145969 and GSE189734. The differential genes were analyzed for functional and pathway enrichment in terms of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. The Metascape tool was used to construct protein networks for the differential genes, and the results were imported into Cytoscape software for visualization. The genes were identified as key modules and genes using the MCODE plug-in. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for the HALLMARK analysis of the two microarray key genes to obtain the relevant pathways. Results. GSE145969 screened 351 differential genes, 168 upregulated genes, and 183 downregulated genes. The differential genes were enriched in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, such as myocardial contraction, intracellular nonmembrane organelles, and structural molecular activities. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network contained 140 nodes, with the highest-scoring module containing seven genes, and the MCODE plug-in calculated the downseed. The key gene was KIAA0101, whose HALLMARK pathway was significantly enriched in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. A total of 263 differential genes were screened by GSE189734, and they were enriched in biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, such as immune system processes, signaling receptor binding, and the cytoplasmic matrix. The PPI network contained 253 nodes, with the highest-scoring module containing 37 genes. The seed gene obtained through the MCODE plug-in calculation was IL2RA, whose HALLMARK pathway was significantly enriched in the KRAS signaling pathway. Conclusion. By analyzing the gene sets of different tissues in nephropathy, two key genes, namely KIAA0101 and IL2RA, were obtained. Their gene function enrichment is related to cell growth, development, and reproduction. Therefore, IL2RA and KIAA0101 can be used as diagnostic markers for hormone-resistant nephropathy.</jats:p>",

How the elastic scattering (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>SC</jats:sub>) originating from kilometer‐scale inner core heterogeneities relates to large‐scale apparent <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> variations remains elusive. Such inner core scattered (ICS) energy is characterized by emergent, long‐lasting, high‐frequency (1–4 Hz) coda immediately following pre‐critical reflections (<jats:italic>PKiKP</jats:italic>) from the inner core boundary (ICB). In this study, we develop a framework to systematically investigate ICS and examine its hemispherical pattern using data from two arrays that sample opposing sides of the Pacific quasi‐hemispherical boundary. We use all the viable data from earthquakes (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub> ≥ 5.8) within the past 2–3 decades recorded at distances of 50°–75° by YKA and ILAR—small‐aperture (∼10–20 km) seismic arrays situated in northwestern North America. Two independent waveform stripping methods are applied to extract ICS from the background energy, and various stacks are performed to identify ICS and its spatial pattern. We found that individual beams lacking clear evidence of <jats:italic>PKiKP</jats:italic> coda waves reveal ICS characteristics when stacked together, implying that ICS is ubiquitous. We used a modified phonon‐based simulation to reinforce the idea that ICS is primarily created by volumetric heterogeneity within the inner core as opposed to ICB topography. With simplified two‐layer ICS models, our results suggest that ICS within the eastern quasi‐hemisphere is slightly stronger than in the western quasi‐hemisphere, although intra‐hemispherical variations are as significant, and our sampling is limited to patches of the northern hemisphere.</jats:p>",

We employ dissipative particle dynamics with soft-core forcefield tested against experimental data on micellization of surfactants in water, and the previous results are reproduced in this work. We consider three different nonionic surfactants: hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E6), 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]ethanol) known as Triton X-100 (TX-100), and two alkyl glucoside surfactants (CnG1) with n-alkane tail fragments and a saccharide hydrophilic head at decane–water and toluene–water interfaces. For TX-100, we composed a model based on the literature forcefield and found good agreement with the experimental critical micelle concentrations (CMCs). The head–head interactions are of different origins for different surfactant groups: entropic repulsion between ethylene oxide chains of C12E6 and TX-100, and more chemically specific and complex interactions between the maltose heads of alkyl glucosides. We interpret our results with the Redlich–Peterson equation of monolayer adsorption in order to relate the adsorption to the bulk concentration of the surfactant and the interfacial tension. The densities of the adsorbed monolayer at CMC mostly agree with the experimental data, and a reasonable agreement was obtained for the interfacial tension at CMC. At the same time, we found significant discrepancies between the simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms. We explain them by the oversimplified forcefield: when the parameters are fitted to the free energies of bulk solutions, they may not correctly reproduce the interfacial free energies.</jats:p>",

To investigate differences in X-ray and SZE selection, we compare to the local X-ray-selected REXCESS sample. Using <jats:italic>XMM-Newton</jats:italic> observations, we derive an average intra-cluster medium (ICM) density profile for the SZE-selected systems and determine its scaling with mass and redshift. This average profile exhibits an evolution that is slightly stronger than self-similar (<jats:italic>α</jats:italic><jats:sub>z</jats:sub> = 2.09 ± 0.02), and a significant dependence on mass (<jats:italic>α</jats:italic><jats:sub>M</jats:sub> = 0.22 ± 0.01). Deviations from this average scaling with radius, which we quantify, indicate different evolution for the core regions as compared to the bulk. We measure the radial variation of the intrinsic scatter in scaled density profiles, finding a minimum of ∼20% at <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> ∼ [0.5−0.7] <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>500</jats:sub> and a value of ∼40% at <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>500</jats:sub>; moreover, the scatter evolves slightly with redshift. The average profile of the SZE-selected systems adequately describes the X-ray-selected systems and their intrinsic scatter at low redshift, except in the very central regions. We examine the evolution of the scaled core properties over time, which are positively skewed at later times, suggesting an increased incidence of centrally peaked objects at lower redshifts. The relation between core-excised luminosity, <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>Xc</jats:sub>, and mass is extremely tight, with a measured logarithmic intrinsic scatter of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic><jats:sub>ln<jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>Xc</jats:sub>|<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>Yx</jats:sub></jats:sub> ∼ 0.13. Using extensive simulations, we investigate the impact of selection effects, intrinsic scatter, and covariance between quantities on this relation. The slope is insensitive to selection and intrinsic scatter between quantities; however, the scatter is very dependent on the covariance between <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>Xc</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>Y</jats:italic><jats:sub>X</jats:sub>. Accounting for our use of the <jats:italic>Y</jats:italic><jats:sub>X</jats:sub> proxy to determine the mass, for observationally motivated values of covariance we estimate an upper limit to the logarithmic intrinsic scatter with respect to the true mass of <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic><jats:sub>ln<jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>Xc</jats:sub>|<jats:italic>M</jats:italic></jats:sub> ∼ 0.22.

Our results are consistent with the overall conclusion that the ICM bulk evolves approximately self-similarly, with the core regions evolving separately. They indicate a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. They also suggest that the core-excised X-ray luminosity, <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>Xc</jats:sub>, has a tight and well-understood relation to the underlying mass.</jats:p>",

A parametrized runner crown design working as a passive flow control device is derived. This control device aims for shifting the bifurcation point of the PVC to lower flow rates. To determine the most influential design parameters and derive an optimized runner crown design, a design of experiments (DoE) approach is used. This DoE approach is based on data obtained from differential pressure sensors inside the draft tube wall of a generic hydro turbine test rig using air as working fluid. By means of stochastic modeling, the growth rate of the PVC mode is derived from the statistics of the measured pressure signals. The growth rate is used to estimate the bifurcation point of the PVC characterized by a certain normalized flow rate. It is shown that the stable part load operation regime is extended by up to 25% due to the passive impact of the modified runner crown. Moreover, the operational range featuring considerable PVC-induced pressure oscillations is diminished and the pressure recovery of the draft tube is improved compared to the baseline case.</jats:p>",

Sophisticated quantitative models of extreme extension predicted upward transport of ductile middle-lower crust through time. Here we develop a general model for metamorphic core complexes formation and demonstrate that they result from the collapse of a mountain belt supported by a thickened crustal root. We show that gravitational body forces generated by topography and crustal root cause an upward flow pattern of the ductile lower-middle crust, facilitated by a detachment surface evolving into low-angle normal fault. This detachment surface acquires large amounts of finite strain, consistent with thick mylonite zones found in metamorphic core complexes. Isostatic rebound exposes the detachment in a domed upwarp, while the final Moho discontinuity across the extended region relaxes to a flat geometry. This work suggests that belts of metamorphic core complexes are a fossil signature of collapsed highlands.</jats:p>"

We applied X-ray computed microtomography (CT) to obtain high-resolution data (Δx=50 µm) of the composition of a 164 cm long permafrost core drilled in a Yedoma upland in north-eastern Siberia. The CT analysis allowed the microstructures to be directly mapped and volumetric contents of excess ice, gas inclusions, and two distinct sediment types to be quantified. Using laboratory measurements of coarsely resolved core samples, we statistically estimated the composition of the sediment types and used it to indirectly quantify volumetric contents of pore ice, organic matter, and mineral material along the core. We conclude that CT is a promising method for obtaining physical properties of permafrost cores which opens novel research potentials.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Brown amphibole is a minor but common mineral component in lower oceanic crust. It is generally interpreted as products of migrating SiO2 and H2O-rich fluids or melts, which can be either residual melts from advanced magmatic differentiation of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB), or hydrothermal fluids including a seawater component. Within the lower oceanic crust exhumed at the Atlantis Bank Oceanic Core Complex, along the ultraslow Southwest Indian Ridge, brown amphibole is ubiquitous in all lithologies from olivine- to oxide-gabbros and diorites, including both undeformed and plastically deformed varieties. We here show the results of a systematic petrological study conceived to unravel the nature of the H2O-rich component recorded in brown amphiboles and document: (i) the evolution of migrating melts during the magmatic stage and (ii) different extents of melt-bearing deformation events recorded throughout the entire crustal transect. The low Cl contents and the light over heavy rare earth elements (LREE/HREE) ratios and high Ti contents in brown amphiboles indicate they crystallized from melts with a magmatic hydrous component. Consistently, their δ18O values are in equilibrium with Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) composition, except for diorite amphiboles that possibly record the local assimilation of altered minerals. In undeformed olivine gabbros, interstitial pargasite crystallized at hypersolidus conditions (~1000°C) from the melt residual after late stages of MORB differentiation. We speculate that before the olivine gabbro crystal mush reached fully solid state, some aliquots of residual melts were extracted and accumulated within discrete intervals. There, ferrobasaltic melts differentiated through the early crystallization of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene as liquidus phases, ultimately forming the oxide gabbros. This process promoted rapid Si enrichment and depletion in Fe, Ti, V in the residual melt, later extracted to form the crosscutting diorite veins. The mylonitic olivine gabbros record high-temperature plastic deformation (~900°C ± 50°C) under hypersolidus conditions, involving melts residual from previous crystallization of the gabbroic rock. Further solid-state plastic deformation led to substantial grain size reduction and, consequently, to an increase in porosity. This created pathways for subsequent melt focusing, which likely represent late-stage differentiated melts migrating throughout the lower crustal section. This study shows that brown amphibole in the Atlantis Bank lower oceanic crust is the crystallization product of melts residual from advanced magmatic differentiation, which are also locally involved in the plastic deformation events during crustal accretion.</jats:p>",

We observed 3487 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) across all plants and identified 43 ASVs which may make up a potential core microbiome.

The state governments and big private stakeholders determine the key narratives for the urban upgrades. Loss of patrimonial stock of indigenous buildings and communal cohesion in these enclaves after upgrading often lead to a complete loss of the socio-cultural heritage. The promotion of urban tourism, which is ideal for cities with heritage values, is thus made more challenging for these cities. This study examines the sensitive nature of upgrade programmes as it affects historic city centres. A review of instances in the area is concluded with a case study of the Abeokuta city core. The study was carried out using literature about upgrades in Southwest Nigeria and field studies that involved interviews and questionnaires in Abeokuta city core. The research discovered that while residents are aware of the programmes, they had no input in the planning and implementation, whereas, they appreciate heritage preservation and prefer to be carried along in the planning. The research concluded that more inclusive policy planning and project participation would have entrenched heritage preservation, stemmed the rate of gentrification, and produce more acceptable outcomes.</jats:p>",

The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a major role in the survival and drug resistance of cancer cells. It was suggested that the JNK pathway was implicated in the response to Dox by regulating EMT. DUSP4/or MKP-2 is a well-known regulator of the JNK pathway and was found to be highly expressed in BC. However, its functional significance is not yet fully understood. In the present study, the possible involvement of MKP-2 in Dox-induced EMT was investigated in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry for tissues obtained from BC patients (n = 108) revealed 71.3% of tissues stained positively for MKP-2 while only 28.7% stained negatively. However, MKP-2 protein expression exhibited no significant relationship between BC prognostic factors, such as histological grade, histological type, hormonal status, and Ki-67 marker, its expression was significantly correlated with age 40 or below. In MDA-MB-231 cells, Dox-induced phosphorylation of JNK was sufficiently enhanced in MKP-2 silenced cells. This resulted in the attenuation of Dox-induced EMT, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately accelerated apoptosis. It was confirmed that the acquisition of Dox sensitivity by MKP-2 silencing largely depends on the stimulation of the JNK pathway. Indeed, results showed that overexpressing MKP-2 in non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cells dramatically inhibited Dox-induced JNK activation and, subsequently, cell death. The present study, to our knowledge, is the first to provide evidence for the potential role of MKP-2 in chemoresistance to Dox through modulating the JNK pathway and enhancing EMT.</jats:p>"

The proposed model is also used to evaluate to which extent realistic variables such as core diameter and shell thickness affect the electric output. Results prove that α<jats:sub>ME</jats:sub> of 80 nm cobalt ferrite-barium titanate (CFO-BTO) nanoparticles with a 60:40 ratio is equal to about 0.28 V/cm∙Oe corresponding to electric fields up to about 1000 V/cm when a strong DC bias is applied. However, the same electric output can be obtained even in absence of DC field with very low AC fields, by exploiting the hysteretic characteristics of the same composites. The analysis of core and shell dimension is as such to indicate that, to maximize α<jats:sub>ME,</jats:sub> larger core diameter and thinner shell nanoparticles should be preferred. These results, taken together, suggest that it is possible to tune magnetoelectric nanoparticles electric responses by controlling their composition and their size, thus opening the opportunity to adapt their structure on the specific application to pursue.</jats:p>"

The addition of STF enables the sandwich beam to have a tuning stiffness and damping capacity under dynamic deformation. Here, the constitutive model of STF is described by a complex shear modulus related to the shear rate. The transverse moving beam is modeled based on Newtonian law and derived nonlinear equations are solved by finite difference method. It is found that the resonant frequency of the beam increases with the amplitude of the external excitation by a power law. In addition, the initial damping ratio decreases first and then increases with the increase of the amplitude of the initial excitation for the STF with shear thinning zone. The minimum value of the initial damping ratio should be avoided, which is caused by initial shear thinning. This work can be used to guide the designing of structures with enhanced damping and the preparation of STF materials for application to such structures. </jats:p>",

Low-back pain (LBP) has increasingly been the leading cause affecting work performance, daily activities, and rising the cost of healthcare services. Currently, sitting time increases and walking activity lessens among people. The purpose of this study - identify the effect of Core Stabilization Exercise (CSE) with walking on pain perception and LBP disability among people who suffered from non-specific low-back pain (NSLBP).\r\nMaterial and Methods. In this study, a total of 36 active people (18-42 years old) with BMI≥24.9 kg.m-2 voluntarily participated and were divided randomly into three groups. Intervention groups included CSE group (CSEG; n=12), CSE with walking (CSEWG; n=12), and control group (CG; n=12). The intervention groups carried out the exercise programs (CSE with and without 30 minutes of walking), three times a week for six weeks. In this study, the pain perception was assessed via the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and LBP disability was measured by using a modified Oswestry Disability (ODI) questionnaire.\r\nResults. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) displayed significant effectiveness of CSEG and CSEWG on pain perception as the interaction between time and group [f (2, 33) = 4.95, p=0.032]. The pain perception significantly decreased in CSEG (p=0.021) and CSEWG (p=0.003) after six weeks of the intervention programs compare to CG. The results also showed a significant effect on LBP disability for the interaction between time and group after six weeks of both intervention programs (f (2, 33) =6.52, p=0.015). Disability function (ODI score) significantly improved in CSEG (p=0.031) and CSEWG (p=0.007). Even though the results revealed no significant difference between CSEG and CSEWG, and both groups proved to reduce pain perception and LBP disability, the disability index improvement was greatest in CSEWG.\r\nConclusions. In conclusion, CSE with 30 minutes of walking, as an intervention program, has shown greater improvement with a larger effect size in pain perception and LBP disability among people who suffered from NSLBP.</jats:p>"

In the present study, we compiled data from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, which contains the demographic and detailed phenotype information of 11,961 individuals. Notably, the whole-genome sequencing data available from MSSNG and iHART for 3833 individuals in this dataset was used to perform an endophenotype-wide association study. Using a linear mixed model, genome-wide association analyses were performed for 29 endophenotype scores and 0.58 million common variants with variant allele frequency ≥ 5%. We discovered significant associations between 9 genetic variants and 6 endophenotype scores comprising neurocognitive development and severity scores for core symptoms of ASD at a significance threshold of <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 5 × 10<jats:sup>–7</jats:sup>. Of note, the Stereotyped Behaviors and Restricted Interests total score in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Module 3 was significantly associated with multiple variants in the <jats:italic>VPS13B</jats:italic> gene, a causal gene for Cohen syndrome and a candidate gene for syndromic ASD. Our findings yielded loci with small effect sizes due to the moderate sample size and, thus, require validation in another cohort. Nonetheless, our endophenotype-wide association analysis extends previous candidate gene discovery in the context of genotype and endophenotype association. As a result, these candidate genes may be responsible for specific traits that constitute core symptoms and neurocognitive function of ASD rather than the disorder itself.</jats:p>"

The rigid‐body rotation component of the super‐rotation intensifies as the diffusion strengthens, and the fluid dynamic similarity of the nondimensional winds is found among the different diffusions. In the experiments with weak diffusion, the super‐rotation is weak in the presence of strong poleward eddy heat flux, enhancing the downward angular momentum transport by the Eliassen–Palm (E–P) flux. In contrast, the strong super‐rotation is developed, and both the poleward eddy heat and vertical E–P fluxes are weak in the strong horizontal diffusion experiments. Because the waves with high zonal wave numbers and poleward heat fluxes are strongly dissipated, the vertical E–P fluxes become weak and the contribution of subgrid‐scale vertical diffusion becomes large in the momentum budget. As the horizontal diffusion strengthens, the phase velocities of the equatorial waves increase due to the faster background zonal flow (i.e., mean zonal flow). Although strong empirical diffusion produces strong super‐rotation, it is still unknown whether it is valid. Thus, we must carefully assess the robustness of the super‐rotation in the long‐term simulation based on the sensitivity test of horizontal diffusion.</jats:p>",

Separately controlled pressure lines are connected to different holes or sets of holes in the cane to control the microstructure of the fiber being drawn, often relying on glues or other sealants to isolate the differently-pressured regions. We show that the selective fusion and collapse of the elements of the stack, before it is drawn to cane or fiber, allows the stack to be drawn directly under differential pressure without introducing a sealant. Three applications illustrate the advantages of this approach. First, we draw antiresonant hollow-core fiber directly from the stack without making a cane, allowing a significantly longer length of fiber to be drawn. Second, we fabricate canes under pressure, such that they are structurally more similar to the final fiber. Finally, we use the method to fabricate new types of microstructured resonators with a non-circular cross-section.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>(1) Background: The amount of physical activity most adults perform is less than the recommended amount, and the resulting decrease in physical strength makes them vulnerable to various diseases. A decrease in muscle size and strength due to damage caused by disease or aging negatively affects functional strength. Muscle evaluation in adults can yield results that are predictive indicators of aging and unexpected disability. In addition, balance ability is essential to prevent falls and injuries in daily life and maintain functional activities. It is important to develop and strengthen balance in the lower extremities and core muscles to maintain and enhance overall body balance. This study aimed to analyze the effects of core balance training on muscle tone and balance ability in adults. (2) Methods: The participants of this study were 32 adult male and female university students (male: mean age = 21.3 ± 1.9 years, weight = 74.2 ± 12.6 kg, BMI = 23.4 + 2.5, n = 14; female: mean age = 21.0 ± 1.4 years, weight = 64.6 + 1.2 kg, BMI = 22.4 ± 2.4, n =18). Thirty-two adults (training group: 16, control group: 16; male: 16, female: 16) participated in the Myoton PRO (gastrocnemius lateral/medial, tibialis anterior), Pedalo balance system, and Y-balance test. (3) Results: The following results were obtained for muscle elasticity, stiffness, and dynamic/static balance ability after 10 weeks of core balance training. 1. There was no significant difference in muscle elasticity (gastrocnemius lateral/medial, tibialis anterior) (p &lt; 0.05). 2. Muscle stiffness (gastrocnemius lateral/medial, tibialis anterior) significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). 3. Dynamic/static balance ability significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). (4) Conclusions: In future, data for the age and sex of various participants, should be accumulated by recruiting participants to study muscle characteristics, such as muscle elasticity and stiffness. Estimating the appropriate injury range and optimal exercise capacity is possible through follow-up studies. The findings can then be used as a basis for predicting injuries or determining and confirming the best time to resume exercise.</jats:p>"

The diagnosis and clinical outcome of AML and CML are complicated by genetic heterogeneity of disease; therefore, the identification of novel molecular biomarkers and pharmacological targets is of paramount importance. Methods: RNA-seq-based transcriptome data from a total of five studies were extracted from NCBI GEO repository and subjected to an in-depth bioinformatics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AML and CML. A systemic literature survey and functional gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed for the top 100 DEGs to identify novel candidate genes and biological processes associated with AML and CML. Results: LINC01554, PTMAP12, LOC644936, RPS27AP20 and FAM133CP were identified as novel risk genes for AML and CML. GO enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were significantly associated with pre-RNA splicing, reactive oxygen species and glycoprotein metabolism, the cellular endomembrane system, neutrophil migration and antimicrobial immune response. Conclusions: Our study revealed novel biomarkers and specific biological processes associated with AML and CML. Further studies are required to evaluate their value as molecular targets for managing and treating the myeloid malignancies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Structurally ordered intermetallic nanocrystals (NCs) and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are two emerging catalytic motifs for sustainable chemical production and energy conversion. Yet, both have limitations in enhancing performance and expanding the materials design space. For example, intermetallic NCs require high-temperature annealing (&gt; 500 °C) to promote atom rearrangement and <jats:italic>d-d </jats:italic>orbital hybridization, leading to potential aggregation or sintering, while SACs are typically limited by a low metal-atom loading (&lt; 1 wt%) to avoid aggregation of metal atoms. Here, we report a facile, direct solution-phase synthesis of Cu/CuAu core/shell NCs with tunable single-atom alloy (SAA) layers. This synthesis can be extended to other Cu/CuM (M = Pt, Pd) systems, in which M atoms are isolated in the Cu host and can be considered the highest density of single-atom sites. We controlled the density of single-sites and the number of atomic layers and investigated the ligand and strain effects of Cu/CuAu for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>RR). The Cu/CuAu densely packed SAAs demonstrated a high selectivity toward NH<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>from NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>RR with an 85.5% Faradaic efficiency (FE) while maintaining an exceedingly high yield rate of 8.47 mol h<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. This work advances the design of atomically precise catalytic sites by creating a new paradigm of core/shell NCs with SAA atomic layers, opening an avenue for broad catalytic applications in achieving a sustainable energy future.</jats:p>"

Eleven full-scale assemblies of HCS reinforcing bar connections to steel beams were tested to failure under monotonic in-plane loading (compression, tension, or shear). Test results revealed that connections tested under compression failed by bar buckling without yielding. Under tension, the connection bar reached close-to-yielding or yielding strains at the unrestrained portion of the bar, followed by grout splitting in the shear key or the grouted core.

Recent developments in flowable and restorative composite resins have resulted in a greater total depth of cure—between 4 and 5 mm for some materials. Materials and Methods: study was conducted in the department of prosthodontics and crown and bridge, including implantology along with external laboratory support and molds for tensile and compressive strength were made. Result- Based on strength, Photocore and Multicore HB may be used as alternatives to Kerr Herculite Precise; however, other physical qualities should also be considered.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is considered to be a transitional stage between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and normal cognitive state because it has the same clinical symptoms as AD but with lower severity. Studies have confirmed that patients with aMCI are more likely to develop to AD. Although studies on resting state functional connectivity have revealed the abnormal organization of brain networks, the dynamic changes of the functional connectivity across the scans have been ignored. Objective: Dynamic functional connectivity is a novel method to reveal the temporal variation of brain networks. This paper aimed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of brain functional connectivity in the early and late phases of aMCI. Methods: Based on the “triple network” model, we used the sliding time window approach to construct dynamical functional networks and then analyzed the dynamic characteristics of the functional connectivity across the entire scan. Results: The results showed that patients with aMCI had longer dwell times in weaker network connection than in the strong network. The transitions between different states become more frequent, and the stability of the patient’s brain core network deteriorates. This study also found the correlation between the altered dynamic properties of the core functional networks and the patient’s clinical Mini-Mental State Examination assessment scale sores. Conclusion: This study revealed that the characteristics of dynamic functional networks constructed by the core cognitive networks varied in distinct ways at different stages of aMCI, which could provide a new idea for exploring the neuro-mechanisms of neurological disorders.</jats:p>",

However, bare aromatic polymer backbones tend to strongly aggregate, rendering them essentially insoluble in organic solvent. While the typical solution is to install many solubilizing substituents on the backbones, this often provokes undesired property changes. Herein, we report the synthesis of bare aromatic polymers enabled by a dendrimer support. An initiator arene containing a diterpenoid-based dendrimer undergoes Pd-catalyzed polymerization with monomers bearing no solubilizing substituents to furnish bare aromatic polymers such as polythiophenes and poly(<jats:italic>para</jats:italic>-phenylene)s. The high solubility of dendrimer-ligated polymers allows not only the unveiling of the properties of unsubstituted π-conjugated backbone, but also mild release of dendrimer-free aromatic polymers and even transfer of aromatic polymers to other materials, such as silica gel and protein, which may accelerate the creation of hybrid materials nowadays challenging to access.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The largest floating tongue of Greenland’s ice sheet, Nioghalvfjerdsbræ, has so far been relatively stable with respect to areal retreat. Curiously, it experienced significant less thinning and ice flow acceleration than its neighbour Zacharias Isbræ. Draining more than 6 % of the ice sheet, Nioghalvfjerdsbræ might become a large contributor to sea level rise in the future. Therefore, the stability of the floating tongue is a focus of this study. We employ a suite of observational methods to detect recent changes. We found that the calving style has changed at the southern part of the eastern calving front from normal tongue-type calving to a crack evolution initiated at frontal ice rises reaching 5–7 km and progressing further upstream compared to 2010. The calving front area is further weakened by a substantial increase of a zone of fragments and open water at the tongue’s southern margin, leading to the formation of a narrow ice bridge. These geometric and mechanical changes are a precursor of instability of the floating tongue. We complement our study by numerical ice flow simulations to estimate the impact of future break-up or disintegration events on the ice discharge. These idealised scenarios reveal that a loss of the south-eastern area would lead to 1 % of increase of ice discharge at the grounding line, while a sudden collapse of the frontal area (46 % of the floating tongue area) will enhance the ice discharge by 8.3 % due to loss in buttressing.\n                        </jats:p>"

Given that the issues of both the moral import of pejoratives and the practical effects of their utterance are not settled by the proof, we then highlight unwelcome moral and pragmatic implications for some of the pejorative sentences under scrutiny, thereby showing that the view, broadly understood, is not as morally and semantically innocuous as it is meant to be.</jats:p>"

Because the negative, non-consumptive effects of predators could also modulate the behaviour and underlying mechanisms of the prey, this study aimed to examine the different effects of predator-induced stress experienced in the early life compared with later life of the prey.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: Previous research has demonstrated that an isocaloric diet rich in trans-fatty acid (TFA), saturated fatty acid (SFA), and cholesterol (Chol) promoted steatosis-derived hepatic tumorigenesis in hepatitis C virus core gene transgenic (HCVcpTg) mice in different manners. Growth factor signaling and ensuing angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis are key factors in hepatic tumorigenesis that have become recent therapeutic targets for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the influence of dietary fat composition on these factors remains unclear. This study investigated whether the type of dietary fat would have a specific impact on hepatic angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis in HCVcpTg mice. Methods: Male HCVcpTg mice were treated with a control diet, an isocaloric diet containing 1.5% cholesterol (Chol diet), or a diet replacing soybean oil with hydrogenated coconut oil (SFA diet) for a period of 15 months or with shortening (TFA diet) for 5 months. The degree of angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis and the expression of growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), were evaluated in non-tumorous liver tissues using quantitative mRNA measurement, immunoblot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Long-term feeding of SFA and TFA diets to HCVcpTg mice increased the expressions of vascular endothelial cell indicators, such as CD31 and TEK receptor tyrosine kinase, in addition to lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, indicating that angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis were upregulated only by these fatty acid-enriched diets. This promoting effect correlated with elevated VEGF-C and FGF receptor 2 and 3 levels in the liver. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α, both key regulators of VEGF-C expression, were enhanced in the SFA- and TFA-rich diet groups as well. The Chol diet significantly increased the expressions of such growth factors as FGF2 and PDGF subunit B, without any detectable impact on angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis. Conclusion: This study revealed that diets rich in SFA and TFA, but not Chol, might stimulate hepatic angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis mainly through the JNK-HIF1α-VEGF-C axis. Our observations indicate the importance of dietary fat species for preventing hepatic tumorigenesis. </jats:p>"

Methodology: Five three-dimensional simulations of the central incisor in the maxilla were created with ANSYS (Canonsburg, PA) version 10. MODEL 1 represented a normal morphologic simulation of the incisor. MODEL 2 depicted the incisor with a pre-fabricated fiber-reinforced dowel with a glass ionomer core. The incisor of MODEL 3 consisted of the same pre-fabricated fiber post and composite core. MODEL 4 and MODEL 5 had pre-fabricated light-transmitting posts with a glass ionomer and a composite core, respectively. Each of these simulations was loaded in horizontal, vertical, and oblique directions with a load of 10N, 100N, and 50N, respectively. The resulting Von Mises stress and strain were determined. Results: Maximum stresses and strains were focused at the apex of the glass fiber reinforced post and were minimal in the middle section of the post, whereas maximum stresses and strains were mainly concentrated in the coronal region and were minimal in the middle portion of light-transmitting post. Conclusion: Pre-fabricated optical-transmitting dowel and composite core enhanced dentin stress and strain dispersion throughout various loading parameters.</jats:p>"

In this study, we demonstrated optical trapping of photochromic microcrystals in a double fiber optical tweezers system combined with two external lights for photoisomerization and observed changes in the trapping force by photoisomerization. In situ photoisomerizations of the single crystal trapped in the system were performed thrice revealing a reversible change in the trapping force. The trapping stiffness for the colored crystal was one-third of that for the decolorized crystal in the axial direction, whereas almost no difference was observed in the transverse direction. Furthermore, based on the intermittent motion and asymmetry of the positional distribution of the trapped crystals, we inferred that the motion includes transitions through multiple stable sites, and the ease of the transition is related to the isomerization state of the crystals. Such switching of optical trapping indicates the possibility of revealing the physical properties of trapped materials through trapping schemes, and the nonlinearity in the trapping is also expected to be applied to advanced computing with physical phenomena.</jats:p>",

The temperature profiles span a range of 80–300 K with power-law indices from −0.4 to −0.8, which is in agreement with expectations of protostellar heating of an envelope with optically thick dust. Column density and abundance profiles reflect a similar trend as seen in the morphology. While abundances of N-bearing COMs peak only at the highest temperatures, those of most O-bearing COMs peak at lower temperatures and remain constant or decrease towards higher temperatures. Many abundance profiles show a steep increase at ~100 K. To a great extent, the observed results agree with results of astrochemical models that, besides the co-desorption with water, predict that O-bearing COMs are mainly formed on dust-grain surfaces at low temperatures, while at least some N-bearing COMs and CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>CHO are substantially formed in the gas phase at higher temperatures.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> Our observational results, in comparison with model predictions, suggest that COMs that are exclusively or, to a great extent, formed on dust grains desorb thermally at ~100 K from the grain surface, likely alongside water. A dependence on the COM binding energy is not evident from our observations. Non-zero abundance values below ~100 K suggest that another desorption process of COMs is at work at these low temperatures: either non-thermal desorption or partial thermal desorption related to the lower binding energies experienced by COMs in the outer, water-poor ice layers. In either case, this is the first time that the transition between two regimes of COM desorption has been resolved in a hot core.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the powders had high circularity, excellent thermal stability (ΔT = 59 K), and high saturation magnetization (0.83 T), which could provide raw powders for high-performance MPCs. With increasing phosphoric acid concentrations, despite the increase in DC-bias%, the uniformity of the insulation layers deteriorated, which led to a decrease in permeability and an increase in core loss. With increasing compaction pressures, the core loss increased continuously, and the permeability and DC-bias% first increased and then decreased. When annealing below the crystallization temperature, with increasing annealing temperatures, the permeability increased, and the core loss and DC-bias% decreased continuously. Under the optimized process of 0.4 wt.% phosphating concentration, 550 MPa pressure, and 773 K annealing temperature, the MPCs had a permeability of 21.54 ± 1.21, DC-bias% of 90.3 ± 0.2, and a core loss (Bm = 50 mT, f = 100 kHz) of 103.0 ± 26.3 mW cm−3.

The face sheet and honeycomb core of the proposed all-composite sandwich structure in this work are composed of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. The mechanical response and damage mechanism of the all-composite sandwich structure under out-of-plane quasi-static compression and out-of-plane impact are studied by numerical methods. The refined finite element models of the sandwich structures are built on the ABAQUS/Explicit platform. The micromechanics of failure (MMF) theory based on physical component failure is used to describe the intralaminar damage mechanism of the face sheet and honeycomb core, and the mixed-mode exponential cohesive zone model (ECZM) is utilized to simulate the initiation and evolution of interlayer damage. In addition, the cohesive contact approach is adopted to capture the debonding failure at the face-sheet/core. The numerical results show that the all-composite sandwich structure has the characteristics of large structural stiffness and strong energy absorption ability. The failure mechanism of the all-composite sandwich structure under compression is mainly matrix damage and delamination of the honeycomb core, with buckling and folding in appearance. Under out-of-plane impact, matrix damage and delamination arise on the upper sheet, little damage is observed on the lower sheet, and the delamination damage morphology tends to be circular with increasing impact energy. In addition, the interface failure of the upper-sheet/core is more than that of the lower-sheet/core. In addition, the matrix damage near the impact center of the honeycomb core tends to be consistent with the delamination contour, and a small amount of fiber failure is also observed, which manifests as a collapse morphology of the impact area. The research results enrich the understanding of the mechanical behavior of all-composite sandwich structures with honeycomb cores and provide theoretical support for their potential applications.</jats:p>"

However, the optical performance of blue‐emitting NPLs is deteriorated by trap states, currently exhibiting tainted emissions and inferior photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Here, near trap‐free blue‐emitting NPLs are achieved by the controlled growth of the core/crown. Deep trap states in NPLs can be partially suppressed with the asymmetrical crown growth and are further suppressed with the growth of the small core and the alloyed symmetrical crown, yielding NPLs with pure blue emissions and near‐unity PLQYs. Exciton dynamic research based on these NPLs indicates that the trap emission stems from surface traps. Besides, light‐emitting diodes exhibiting ultranarrow emission centered around 461 nm with full‐width‐at‐half‐maximums down to 11 nm are fabricated using these NPLs.</jats:p>",

It is based on the hardness of the multivariate quadratic polynomial (MQ) problem, which is a problem of finding a solution to a system of quadratic equations over a finite field. In this paper, we survey some recent progress in the security analysis of MPKC. Among various existing multivariate schemes, the most important one is the Rainbow signature scheme proposed by Ding et al. in 2005, which was later selected as a finalist in the third round of the PQC standardization project by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Under the circumstances, some recent research studies in MPKC have focussed on the security analysis of the Rainbow scheme. In this paper, the authors first explain efficient algorithms for solving the MQ problem and the research methodology for estimating their complexity in MPKC. Then, the authors survey some recent results related to the security analysis of the Rainbow scheme. In particular, the authors provide a detailed description of the complexity analysis for solving the bi‐graded polynomial systems studied independently by Nakamura et al. and Smith‐Tone et al., and then expound the rectangular MinRank attack against Rainbow proposed by Beullens.</jats:p>",

This study contributes to the leaf classification method by rapidly recognizing the varieties of wild chrysanthemums through a support vector machine (SVM). The principal contributions of this article are: (1) an assembled collection method and verified chrysanthemum leaf dataset that has been achieved and improved; (2) an adjusted SVM model that is offered to deal with the complex backgrounds presented by smartphone pictures by using color and shape classification results to be more attractive than the original process.

By the authors, the quantitative damage evaluation of concrete has been proposed by applying acoustic emission and damage mechanics in core concrete.  In this study, detection of cracking damage distribution in concrete-core by decision tree method.  Prior to the machine learning analysis, distribution of micro-cracks in a concrete-core sample is inspected by helical X-ray computer tomography (CT).  Two feature values are set as explanatory variables: luminance value and pixel value after DoG (Difference of Gaussian) filter.  The evaluation values converged from the sample size of 12,000 or more.  This suggests that one cross section can be estimated with about 50% of the X-ray CT image data by using machine learning.  The accuracy rate is 0.723 for the threshold processing and 0.793 for the decision tree method, which is higher for the decision tree method.  These results suggest that the proposed method is useful for identifying cracks in concrete by X-ray CT image.\n</jats:p>"

Methods: Data collection included surveying investigators and community advisory board members and monitoring traffic to videos and social media posts. Results: On a Likert scale survey of investigators (4 = “agree” and 5 = “strongly agree”), the mean rating for a prompt expressing satisfaction with services received was 4.67 (SD = 0.52; N = 6).

DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein in the retina and RPE that has been shown to protect cells from oxidative stress in several cell types robustly. Oxidation of DJ-1 cysteine (C) residues is important for its function under oxidative conditions. The present study was conducted to analyze the impact of DJ-1 expression changes and oxidation of its C residues on RPE function. Monolayers of the ARPE-19 cell line and primary human fetal RPE (hfRPE) cultures were infected with replication-deficient adenoviruses to investigate the effects of increased levels of DJ-1 in these monolayers. Adenoviruses carried the full-length human DJ-1 cDNA (hDJ) and mutant constructs of DJ-1, which had all or each of its three C residues individually mutated to serine (S). Alternatively, endogenous DJ-1 levels were decreased by transfection and transduction with shPARK7 lentivirus. These monolayers were then assayed under baseline and low oxidative stress conditions. The results were analyzed by immunofluorescence, Western blot, RT-PCR, mitochondrial membrane potential, and viability assays. We determined that decreased levels of endogenous DJ-1 levels resulted in increased levels of ROS. Furthermore, we observed morphological changes in the mitochondria structure of all the RPE monolayers transduced with all the DJ-1 constructs. The mitochondrial membrane potential of ARPE-19 monolayers overexpressing all DJ-1 constructs displayed a significant decrease, while hfRPE monolayers only displayed a significant decrease in their ΔΨm when overexpressing the C2S mutation. Viability significantly decreased in ARPE-19 cells transduced with the C53S construct. Our data suggest that the oxidation of C53 is crucial for regulating endogenous levels of ROS and viability in RPE cells.</jats:p>"

Assuming Henry's or rectangular isotherm, the average concentration inside adsorbents as well as transient bulk concentration were also obtained for the particles with or without the inert core. Computations were performed to compare the results according to the shape of adsorbents by adjusting adsorbent loading, Biot number (Bi), and inert core thickness. Regardless of particle morphologies, steady‐state bulk concentration was only affected by adsorbent loading and inert core thickness, whereas the effect of Bi was confirmed from the decreasing reduction rate of adsorbate concentration with decreasing Bi. When diffusivity was dependent on time, time‐decaying diffusivity caused the increase in steady‐state concentration that was predicted by eigenfunction expansion. Experimental results using porous fibres by electrospinning were compared with the mathematical solution of a cylindrical adsorbent for the estimation of intra‐particle diffusivity. Using the solutions of the diffusion equation model, novel core–shell cylindrical adsorbents can be designed and synthesized as core–shell fibres by electrospinning with a coaxial nozzle to save the cost of the active shell layer. Such core–shell structured fibres can be adopted as adsorbents for novel batch adsorption processes and the present modelling results can be extended to other processes like fixed bed adsorbers.</jats:p>",

Lorentz magnetic force is derived by using Maxwell’s relations. The face layers are made of multi-nanocomposite sheets. Each sheet is composed of an Al matrix reinforced with graphene platelets (GPLs) that are uniformly distributed through the sheet thickness. The effective material properties of the face layers of the spinning sandwich cylindrical shells are derived employing the modified Halpin–Tsai model. The honeycomb core layer is made of hexagonal aluminum cells. According to the first-order shear deformation theory and Hamilton’s principle, five governing equations are obtained involving Lorentz force. Frequencies of the present model are analytically derived from the equations of motion. The present outcomes are examined by introducing some comparison examples. The effects of the geometric parameters, magnetic field parameter, GPLs weight fraction, core-to-face thickness ratio, circumferential wave number, axial wave number and spinning speed on the vibration of spinning sandwich honeycomb cylindrical shells are numerically discussed. </jats:p>",

Therefore, in this study, by facilitating communication <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> Zoom call, we established a system that allows two people to visit the museum together through the Google Arts and Culture (GA&amp;amp;C) website. To reduce the psychological distance between online visitors and help increase user engagement, we designed and developed a media device based on moiré pattern visualization of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The participants were divided into two groups to visit the online museum, communicating remotely through Zoom. The objective of this study was to test whether a real-time EEG signal visualization device could help close the psychological distance between participants and whether it could increase user engagement with the online exhibition. Participants were randomly assigned to either the normal online exhibition experience (NOEE) group or EEG signal visualization device (ESVD) group. Participants in the NOEE group experienced four online exhibitions (Task1, Task2, Task3, and Task4) together (two participants per test unit). The conditions for participants in the ESVD group remained the same, apart from adding a media device to enable them to visualize EEG signals. A total of 40 university students participated in this study. Independent samples <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-tests revealed that participants in the ESVD group perceived a significantly closer psychological distance between themselves and the participants on the opposite side than those in the NOEE group (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic> = −2.699; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.008 &amp;lt; 0.05).

This has become known more broadly as the software productivity gap. With the end of Moore's Law driving forward rapid specialization of hardware architectures, building simulation codes on a low-level language with hardware specific optimizations is a significant risk. As a solution, we present Pace, an implementation of the nonhydrostatic FV3 dynamical core which is entirely Python-based. In order to achieve high performance on a diverse set of hardware architectures, Pace is written using the GT4Py domain-specific language. We demonstrate that with this approach we can achieve portability and performance, while significantly improving the readability and maintainability of the code as compared to the Fortran reference implementation. We show that Pace can run at scale on leadership-class supercomputers and achieve performance speeds 3.5–4 times faster than the Fortran code on GPU-accelerated supercomputers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a Python-based simulation code facilitates existing or enables entirely new use-cases and workflows. Pace demonstrates how a high-level language can insulate us from disruptive changes, provide a more productive development environment, and facilitate the integration with new technologies such as machine learning.\n                        </jats:p>"

The alignment of the micro-lens mold with the fiber core receiving the lens is done optically, which allows high precision. Using the proposed technique, different micro-lenses are fabricated. Then the output beams of two different micro-lenses on single-mode fibers are characterized. Fiber micro-lenses with curvature as small as 5 µm are achieved.

Herein, a concept is proposed for constructing fluorescent core–shell structures based on the components and properties of LMs, and metal halides. The metal halides endow LMs with polychromatic and stable fluorescence characteristics. As a proof‐of‐concept, LMs‐Al obtained by mixing of LMs with aluminum (Al) is reported. The surface of LMs‐Al is transformed directly from Al to a multi‐phase metal halide of K<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>AlCl<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> with double perovskites structure, via redox reactions with KCl + HCl solution in a natural environment. The formation of core–shell structure from the K<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>AlCl<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and LMs is achieved, and the shell with different phases can emit a cyan light by the superimposition of the polychromatic spectrum. Furthermore, the LMs can be directly converted into a fluorescent shell without affecting their original features. In particular, the luminescence properties of shells can be regulated by the components in LMs. This study provides a new direction for research in spontaneous interfacial modification and fluorescent functionalization of LMs and promises potential applications, such as lighting and displays, anti‐counterfeiting measures, sensing, and chameleon robots.</jats:p>",

The added PMMA could reduce the crystal size of PVDF. Owing to fine cellular structure and small crystal sizes, the injection‐molded blend microcellular foams exhibited superior mechanical properties. Especially, the elongation at break and specific breaking energy of the blend foam with 40% void fraction were separately increased by 184% and 297% compared to that of the PVDF foam. These findings revealed that the lightweight microcellular PVDF foams with improved toughness could be manufactured by the scale‐up and efficient FIM technology, which showed a promising future in automotive and other structural applications.</jats:p>",

While feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is thought to be the dominant mechanism by which a cooling flow is suppressed, the<jats:italic>Chandra</jats:italic>imaging observations surprisingly do not reveal the bi-lateral X-ray cavities one might expect to see in the intracluster medium (ICM) of an extreme cool core hosting a powerful radio source, though cavities commonly appear in many similar sources. We discuss the limits on the properties of putative radio bubbles associated with any undetected X-ray cavities. We place upper limits on any significant X-ray AGN in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and show that the X-ray peak is offset from the central radio source, which exhibits a steep low-frequency radio spectrum indicative of electron ageing. The imaging and spectroscopy provided by SOAR reveal an extended, luminous optical emission-line source. From our narrow-band H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>imaging of the BCG, the central H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>peak is coincident with the radio observations, yet offset from the X-ray peak, consistent with sloshing found previously in this cluster. ALMA observations of the CO(1−0) emission reveal a large reservoir of molecular gas that traces the extended H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>emission in the direction of the cool core. We conclude either that the radio source and its cavities in the X-ray gas are nearly aligned along the line of sight, or that ram pressure induced by sloshing has significantly displaced the cool molecular gas feeding it, perhaps preempting the AGN feedback cycle. We argue that the sloshing near the core is likely subsonic, as expected, given the co-location of the H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>, CO(1−0), radio continuum, and stellar emission peaks and their proximity to the X-ray peak. Further, the X-ray emission from the core is strongly concentrated, as is the distribution of metals, indicating the cool core remains largely intact. Deeper<jats:italic>Chandra</jats:italic>observations will be crucial for definitively establishing the presence or lack of X-ray cavities, while X-ray micro-calorimetric observations from<jats:italic>Athena</jats:italic>could establish if the motion of the cold and warm gas is dominated by large-scale motions of the surrounding ICM.</jats:p>",

Exposure to oil has been shown to be lethal to most phytoplankton species, but some are able to survive and grow at unaffected or reduced growth rates, which appears to be independent of the class and phylum of the phytoplankton and their ability to consume components of oil heterotrophically. The goal of this article is to test the role of core metabolism plasticity in the oil‐resisting ability of phytoplankton. Experiments were performed on the oil‐ resistant chlorophyte, <jats:italic>Dunaliella tertiolecta</jats:italic>, in control and water accommodated fractions of oil, with and without metabolic inhibitors targeting the core metabolic pathways. We observed that inhibiting pathways such as photosynthetic electron transport (PET) and pentose‐phosphate pathway were lethal; however, inhibition of pathways such as mitochondrial electron transport and cyclic electron transport caused growth to be arrested. Pathways such as photorespiration and Kreb's cycle appear to play a critical role in the oil‐tolerating ability of <jats:italic>D. tertiolecta</jats:italic>. Analysis of photo‐physiology revealed reduced PET under inhibition of photorespiration but not Kreb's cycle. Further studies showed enhanced flux through Kreb's cycle suggesting increased energy production and photorespiration counteract oxidative stress. Lastly, reduced extracellular carbohydrate secretion under oil exposure indicated carbon and energy conservation, which together with enhanced flux through Kreb's cycle played a major role in the survival of <jats:italic>D. tertiolecta</jats:italic> under oil exposure by meeting the additional energy demands. Overall, we present data that suggest the role of phenotypic plasticity of multiple core metabolic pathways in accounting for the oxidative stress tolerating ability of certain phytoplankton species.</jats:p>",

Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and lncRNAs were screened between 9 PAOD and 10 control samples. Then, the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed on the basis of the interactions generated from the miRcode, TargetScan, miRDB, and miRTarBase databases. The functional enrichment and protein–protein interaction analyses of mRNAs in the ceRNA network were performed. Immune-related core mRNAs were screened out through the Venn method. The compositional patterns of the 22 types of immune cell fraction in PAOD were estimated through the CIBERSORT algorithm. The final ceRNA network and immune infiltration were validated using clinical tissue samples. Finally, the correlation between immune cells and mRNAs in the final ceRNA network was analyzed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Totally, 67 DE_lncRNAs and 1197 DE_mRNAs were identified, of which 130 DE_mRNAs (91 downregulated and 39 upregulated) were lncRNA-related. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that those down- and upregulated genes were involved in dephosphorylation and regulation of translation, respectively.

To study the complex structure more conveniently and quickly, a variational asymptotic method-based equivalent two-dimensional model (2D-EPM) was developed. The accuracy and efficiency of 2D-EPM were verified by the three-point bending experiment data and the 3D FE model results under different boundary and load conditions. The effects of the geometric parameters on the equivalent stiffness, buckling, natural frequency and NPR effect were also investigated. To increase the NPR of SP-PSC, the material of facesheet was changed from isotropic material to unidirectional CFPR material, and the influence of the material anisotropy on the NPR effect of SP-PSC was investigated. It is found that the NPR of SP-PSC increased first and then decreased with the increase in the fiber angle, reaching the maximum value at 40–50∘. At the same time, this law is applicable to SP-PSC with different material or geometric parameters. Finally, two improved cores, petal star-triangular core with X-shaped ligaments (PSC-X) and double-arc star-shaped core (DSC), were proposed and compared with SP-PSC in equivalent stiffness and recovered local fields to demonstrate their advantages.

On the basis of the detailed simulation program above, the filling and impoundment process of Pubugou high core wall rockfill dam is simulated, and it is found that the influence of simulation accuracy on the core wall zone is greater than that on the rockfill zone. Compared with the dam construction process, the detailed simulation of the impoundment process is more necessary. When simulating the impoundment process, there is a significant effect of simulation accuracy on the simulation result of the upstream side of the core wall and the upstream filtration zone. So, it is necessary to simulate the impoundment process of the earth rockfill dam in detail.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>13°N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is regarded as a type site for oceanic core complexes (OCCs). Within ∼70 km along the spreading centre, it hosts four OCCs in different stages of their life cycle making this an ideal location to determine how OCCs are formed, and what drives the hydrothermal circulation that sustains the vent fields associated with them. Here we describe the results of S-wave seismic tomographic modelling within a 60 × 60 km footprint containing several OCCs, the spreading centre and both flanks. A grid of 17 wide-angle seismic refraction profiles was shot within this footprint and recorded by a network of 46 ocean-bottom seismographs (OBS). Approximately 6200 S-wave arrival travel times have been modelled, constraining primarily the velocity–depth structure of the upper-to-mid crust. Depth slices through the resulting 3-D S-wave velocity (Vs) model reveal the OCCs located at 13°20′N and 13°30′N to each have a region of relatively low Vs (&amp;lt;3 km s–1) beneath its detachment, and a higher Vs (&amp;gt;3 km s–1) in the inter-OCC basin and regions surrounding the detachments. Using the equivalent 3-D P-wave velocity (Vp) model of Simão et al. (2020), the corresponding Vp/Vs model is calculated to investigate lithology, permeability and the existence of any off-axis magmatic intrusions that may drive fluid flow. The Vp/Vs model clearly shows that the crust beneath the deep lava-floored inter-OCC basin is characteristically oceanic (Vp/Vs ratio of &amp;lt;1.85) in velocity–depth structure, in contrast to the OCCs themselves which have a Vp/Vs ratio of &amp;gt;1.85, suggesting that they formed under magma poor (tectonic) conditions. The Vp/Vs model also shows that the OCCs are not connected, at least to mid-crustal level. Alternatively, if the OCCs lie on the same detachment surface, that surface would have to undulate &amp;gt;3km in amplitude over a distance of &amp;lt;20 km for these OCCs to appear to be unconnected. Our 3-D S-wave and Vp/Vs models thus support MacLeod et al.’s (2009) model of localized OCC evolution. Our S-wave velocity model also suggests that the Irinovskoe (13°20′N) and Semyenov (13°30′N) vent fields have different hydrothermal circulation drivers, with the Semyenov field being driven by magma intrusion(s) and the Irinovskoe field being driven by the spreading centre thermal gradient and pervasive flow along open permeability within the detachment footwall, perhaps further opened by roll-over to lower dip angle as it exhumes at the seabed.</jats:p>",

But the reactivity of SMR is more susceptible to disturbance than that of large commercial reactors, which may cause the core power to deviate from the set value, and the limited internal space makes it difficult for SMR to compensate or adjust for reactivity disturbance by setting a sufficient number of control rods as in large commercial reactors. Therefore, in order to improve the operational stability of SMR, a method is proposed to indirectly change the nuclear fuel temperature by adjusting the coolant flow rate and thus compensate the reactivity disturbance by the Doppler effect of nuclear fuel resonance absorption. Simulation experiments show that the method can effectively eliminate reactive disturbances that cannot be completely eliminated by control rods under the conditions of restricted SMR space and limited number of control rod sets, thus providing operational stability of SMR.</jats:p>"

Responses provided are assumed to reflect both the participants’ information interpretation strategies as well as their information search strategies. Following a previous study investigating the association between causal illusion and the presence of paranormal beliefs, we expected that the association between causal illusion and pseudoscientific beliefs would disappear when controlling for the information search strategy (i.e., the proportion of trials in which the participants decided to present the potential cause). Volunteers with higher pseudoscientific beliefs also developed stronger causal illusions in active contingency detection tasks. This association appeared irrespective of the participants with more pseudoscientific beliefs showing (Experiment 2) or not (Experiment 1) differential search strategies. Our results suggest that both information interpretation and search strategies could be significantly associated to the development of pseudoscientific (and paranormal) beliefs.</jats:p>"

However, physical and mechanical properties of the proposed Elium® based thermoplastic composites must be comparable to existing epoxy (thermoset) based composites using manufacturing processes relevant for large wind turbine blades. A 13-meter-long demonstration blade was manufactured for that purpose and sandwich samples were obtained from that project for a detailed study. This paper details three-point flexural properties of unidirectional E-glass fiber reinforced acrylic and epoxy based sandwich panels with identical balsa wood core materials. In addition, to evaluate the relative merit considering debond failure mode, the interfacial critical strain energy release rate, predominantly in mode-1, was compared via single cantilever beam testing. In sandwich composites constructed with balsa wood core material, resin uptake by the balsa core is traditionally impeded via the insertion of a scrim material at the facesheet to core interface. Results revealed that inclusion of scrim mesh layer at the facesheet to core interface reduced flexural properties and strain energy release rates in panels infused with acrylic resin but did not significantly reduce these properties in epoxy infused facesheets. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent studies suggest that the maintenance of cognitive function in the later life of older people is an essential factor contributing to mental wellbeing and physical health. Particularly, the risk of depression, sleep disorders, and Alzheimer's disease significantly increases in patients with mild cognitive impairment. To develop early treatment and prevention strategies for cognitive decline, it is necessary to individually identify the current state of cognitive function since the progression of cognitive decline varies among individuals. Therefore, the development of biomarkers that allow easier measurement of cognitive function in older individuals is relevant for hyperaged societies. One of the methods used to estimate cognitive function focuses on the temporal complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The characteristics of temporal complexity depend on the time scale, which reflects the range of neuron functional interactions. To capture the dynamics, composed of multiple time scales, multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis is effective for comprehensively assessing the neural activity underlying cognitive function in the brain. Thus, we hypothesized that EEG complexity analysis could serve to assess a wide range of cognitive functions in older adults. To validate our hypothesis, we divided older participants into two groups based on their cognitive function test scores: a high cognitive function group and a low cognitive function group, and applied MSE analysis to the measured EEG data of all participants. The results of the repeated-measures analysis of covariance using age and sex as a covariate in the MSE profile showed a significant difference between the high and low cognitive function groups (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic> = 10.18, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.003) and the interaction of the group × electrodes (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic> = 3.93, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.002). Subsequently, the results of the <jats:italic>post-hoc</jats:italic><jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-test showed high complexity on a slower time scale in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in the high cognitive function group. This high complexity on a slow time scale reflects the activation of long-distance neural interactions among various brain regions to achieve high cognitive functions. This finding could facilitate the development of a tool for diagnosis of cognitive decline in older individuals.</jats:p>"

In this study, three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked electromagnetic wave absorbing composites with the carbon nanofiber/Fe3O4 (CNF/Fe3O4) core–shell structure were synthesized by expanding the interface of the heterogeneous structure with Fe3O4 nanocrystals uniformly modified on the surface of the carbon nanofiber. The 3D cross-linked structure of the composites contributes to the generation of conductive loss and macroscopic eddy current loss. The heterogeneous interface formed by graphite nanocrystals and amorphous carbon in the carbon nanofiber is identified by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy as having a strong electromagnetic wave absorption capacity for boundary-type defects. The Fe3O4 nanocrystal particles on the surface of the carbon nanofiber not only have the strong magnetic loss capability of magnetic materials but also form a new heterogeneous interface with the carbon nanofiber surface, which further enhances the interfacial polarization of the composite and improves the electromagnetic wave absorption properties. With the synergistic effects of interfacial polarization, macroscopic and microscopic eddy current losses, conductive losses, and magnetic losses, the electromagnetic wave absorption performance of the composites is further enhanced based on the carbon nanofiber. The reflection loss reaches −51.11, −42.99, and −55.98 dB at 9, 12 (X-band), and 17 GHz (Ku-band), respectively, corresponding to the thicknesses of 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 mm.

Notwithstanding, in-depth scholarly analyses of deepfakes’ political impact are rare, and do not consider theories of democracy. This contribution helps close this research gap, drawing on Warren’s problem-oriented democracy theory, as well as theories of deliberative democracy and contributions on the role of trust in democracies. I identify three core functions of democratic systems and their normative foundations, namely empowered inclusion, collective agenda and will formation (supported by deliberation), and collective decision-making. Based on a literature and media analysis, I systematize different types of deepfakes serving either disinformation or hate speech and outline how they weaken core democratic functions and norms: Deepfakes impede citizens’ empowered inclusion in debates and decisions that affect them, e.g. by hampering efforts to hold political representatives accountable or further marginalizing certain societal groups such as women or ethnic minorities. Deepfakes also undermine collective agenda and will formation by threatening the epistemic quality of deliberation as well as citizens’ mutual empathy and respect. This culminates in a decreased legitimacy of collective decisions taken, which is additionally threatened by pervasive (but mostly speculative) fears of deepfake election manipulation. My analysis has implications for (future) governance efforts addressing deepfakes. Such efforts are increasing, e.g. on the part of social media platforms, but also (supra-)national regulatory bodies.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the Seebeck coefficient shows a remarkable magnetic field hysteresis with the differential magnitude reaching as large as 110 μV/K, as the conductive magnetic domain walls are generated/annihilated by the external field. For x = 0.5, the Nernst signal increases rapidly across the field-induced metal–insulator transitions, exceeding the values reported in existing ferromagnetic oxides. These findings indicate that the thermoelectric effects increase significantly near the topological electronic phase transitions in strongly correlated systems, providing a new guideline for thermoelectric material design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper study the influence of roughness of the tank base in the formation of air core vortex when liquid inside the cylindrical tank is rotated and subsequently drained. The vortex air core formation in drain tanks can lead to the blockage of drain port and can result in reduced discharge of draining liquid as an immediate consequence. The formation of such a vortex in propellant tanks of spacecraft and rockets will lead to underutilization of propellants and can adversely affect the performance of rocket engines. Ingestion of air core vortex in metal casting process can affect the mechanical properties of casted metal. Hence, suppression of air core vortex is inevitable in the fields of aerospace, metal casting and other hydraulic engineering systems. Current study makes use of roughness of the tank base to suppress vortexing which is the first of its kind and therefore, novel. Experimental investigations have been carried out at several values of roughness height and initial fluid rotation to study the characteristics of air core vortex. It is found that at the highest value of initial rotation provided to the liquid, air core vortexing can be subdued up to 25% by making use of base roughness. Current study also recommends drain tank manufacturers not to smoothen the tank base surface spending time at extra cost. In addition, applying roughness on the tank base will further weaken the formation of air core vortex, in the light of this study. </jats:p>",

However, because of the high uncertainty and complexity of traffic data, it is challenging that doing traffic flow prediction. Most of the existing methods have achieved good results in traffic flow prediction, but are not accurate enough to capture the dynamic temporal and spatial relationship of data by using the structural information of traffic flow. In this study, we propose a traffic flow prediction method with temporal attention mechanism and spatial attention mechanism based on neural architecture search (TS-NAS). Firstly, based on temporal and spatial attention mechanisms, we design a new attention mechanism. Secondly, we define a novel model to learn temporal flow and space flow in traffic network. Finally, the proposed method uses different modules about time, space and convolution and neural architecture search to be used for optimizing the model. We use two datasets to test the method. Experimental results show that the performance of the method is better than that of the existing method.</jats:p>"

However, standard approaches require large sample volumes or analyse only a small fraction of the sample. Here we use optofluidic hollow-core photonic crystal fibres to detect and quantify sub-microlitre volumes of unmodified bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein down to 100 nM concentrations. The optofluidic fibre’s waveguiding properties are optimised for guidance at the (auto)fluorescence emission wavelength, enabling fluorescence collection from a 10 cm long excitation region, increasing sensitivity. The observed spectra agree with spectra taken from a conventional cuvette-based fluorimeter, corrected for the guidance properties of the fibre. The BSA fluorescence depended linearly on BSA concentration, while only a small hysteresis effect was observed, suggesting limited biofouling of the fibre sensor. Finally, we briefly discuss how this method could be used to study aggregation kinetics. With small sample volumes, the ability to use unlabelled proteins, and continuous flow, the method will be of interest to a broad range of protein-related research.</jats:p>",

Although mathematical models of gas‐phase concentration in the workplace are essential for predicting exposure concentrations at the design stage, practical models have not yet been fully established. We previously proposed practical numerical models to assess indoor gas‐phase concentration distributions after the accidental leakage of liquid chemicals using liquid toluene as a representative hazardous chemical. In this study, the leakage of liquid ethyl acetate, a commonly used organic solvent, into mortar flooring was reproduced in a small test chamber, and numerical analysis was performed. The results showed that the time history of the chamber exhaust concentration had a sharp peak and differed significantly from that of toluene. Three‐dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis incorporating practical ethyl acetate emission models reproduced the external and internal emission characteristics of leaked ethyl acetate on the mortar material.

The physical and heat limits of semiconductor technology\nrequire the adaptation of heterogeneous architectures in supercomputers,\nsuch as graphics processing units (GPUs) with many-core accelerators and\nmany-core processors with management and computing cores, to maintain a\ncontinuous increase in computing performance. The transition from\nhomogeneous multi-core architectures to heterogeneous many-core\narchitectures can produce non-bit-for-bit reproducibility that leads to\nnumerical perturbations and uncertainties in simulation results, which could\nblend with errors due to coding bugs. The development of a methodology to\nidentify computational perturbations and secure model correctness is\na critically important step in model development on computer systems with\nnew architectures. Thus, we have developed a methodology to characterize the\nuncertainties in the heterogeneous many-core computing environment.

In 2020, one sediment core was collected within the oyster farming area of the Pom–Atasta lagoon system and the Terminos lagoon. A total of 16 PAH compounds were analyzed to identify the historical patterns of PAH inputs and the relationship with sediment materials. The core was classified into three strata at depths of 0.0–0.2 m, 0.2–0.6 m, and 0.6–1.1 m, in which the high content of silt–sand, organic matter, and carbonates indicates a system of high energy and productivity. The hydrology and characteristics of the sediment suggest a free access of adsorbed PAHs to the study area, mainly of pyrolytic origin. The concentration of ∑PAHs decreases from the surface (527.0 ng g−1 dw) to a greater depth (75.7 ng g−1 dw), which corresponds to 60% of the HMW (high molecular weight) of the total PAHs as combustion products at low temperatures, while LWM-PAH (low molecular weight) inputs are from discharges of petroleum products. The core sediments showed a low probability of toxicity quotient of 9%. The analysis of the carcinogenic toxic equivalent (TEQcarc) in each section of the core was variable, decreasing with the depth from 107.91 ng TEQ g−1 dw to 57.65 ng TEQ g−1 dw, with the compounds benzo(a)pyrene (53.55 ng TEQ g−1 dw) and dibenzo(a,h) anthracene (29.2 ng TEQcarc g−1 dw) having the highest TEQcarc. The anthropogenic activities around the study area may increase the carcinogenic and mutagenic risk to human health. However, in the present study, the low toxic carcinogenic equivalents (TEQBaP) and mutagenic equivalents (MEQBaP) indicate a low probability of sediment toxicity. The ecosystem could be under constant threat from increasing anthropogenic activity; therefore, monitoring programs for the conservation of these ecosystems and oyster farms should be considered.</jats:p>"

Rationally designed catalysts with rich active sites and high intrinsic activity have been considered as a hopeful strategy to address the sluggish kinetics for OER. However, constructing such active sites in non-noble catalysts still faces grand challenges. To this end, we fabricate a Ni2P@Fe2P core–shell structure with outperforming performance toward OER via chemical transformation of rationally designed Ni-MOF hybrid nanosheets. Specifically, the Ni-MOF nanosheets and their supported Fe-based nanomaterials were in situ transformed into porous Ni2P@Fe2P core–shell nanosheets composed of Ni2P and Fe2P nanodomains in homogenous dispersion via a phosphorization process. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni2P@Fe2P core–shell nanosheets exhibits excellent OER performance, with a low overpotential of 238/247 mV to drive 50/100 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 32.91 mV dec−1, as well as outstanding durability, which could be mainly ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between Ni2P and Fe2P nanodomains stabilizing more Ni and Fe atoms with higher valence. These high-valence metal sites promote the generation of high-active Ni/FeOOH to enhance OER activity.</jats:p>"

Reoviruses also produce outercapsid (OC) proteins μ1, σ3 and σ1 that assemble onto cores to create highly stable infectious full virions. Current models of reovirus replication position amplification of transcriptionally-active cores and assembly of infectious virions in shared factories, but we hypothesized that since assembly of OC proteins would halt core amplification, OC assembly is somehow regulated. Kinetic analysis of virus +RNA production, core versus OC protein expression, and core particles versus whole virus particle accumulation, indicated that assembly of OC proteins onto core particles was temporally delayed. All viral RNAs and proteins were made simultaneously, eliminating the possibility that delayed OC RNAs or proteins account for delayed OC assembly. High resolution fluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that core amplification occurred early during infection at peripheral core-only factories, while all OC proteins associated with lipid droplets (LDs) that coalesced near the nucleus in a μ1–dependent manner. Core-only factories transitioned towards the nucleus despite cycloheximide-mediated halting of new protein expression, while new core-only factories developed in the periphery. As infection progressed, OC assembly occurred at LD-and nuclear-proximal factories. Silencing of OC μ1 expression with siRNAs led to large factories that remained further from the nucleus, implicating μ1 in the transition to perinuclear factories. Moreover, late during infection, +RNA pools largely contributed to the production of <jats:italic>de-novo</jats:italic> viral proteins and fully-assembled infectious viruses. Altogether the results suggest an advanced model of reovirus replication with spatiotemporal segregation of core amplification, OC complexes and fully assembled virions.</jats:p>"

Here, we explore the properties of the radius valley for low mass stars, assuming that the core-powered mass-loss is the dominant process shaping the small exoplanet population. We show that the slope of radius valley in the planet size-orbital period space, to first order, does not vary with stellar mass and has a negative slope of dlogRp/dlogP ≃ −0.11 even for stars as small as 0.1 M⊙, as observed in latest studies. Furthermore, we find that the slope of the radius valley in the planet size-stellar mass space is dlogRp/dlogM* ≃ (3ζ − 2)/36 where ζ is given by the stellar mass–luminosity relation $L_\\ast \\propto M_\\ast ^\\zeta$. Because ζ is ≳ 2 and increases with stellar mass, we predict that the radius valley has a positive slope in the planet size-stellar mass space across FGKM dwarfs. This slope, however, decreases (increases) in magnitude towards lower (higher) mass stars, due to the variation of ζ with stellar mass. While around 1.0 M⊙ stars the slope is dlogRp/dlogM* ∼ 0.37, it is as low as ∼0.13 around 0.1 M⊙ stars. In addition, we find that the radius valley is narrower and less empty around lower mass stars. Finally, we show that predictions for the radius valley for core-powered mass-loss and photoevaporation become increasingly distinct for lower mass stars.</jats:p>",

Validation studies are important ways to quantify the degree of error associated with case‐identifying algorithms for HOIs and are crucial for interpreting study findings within real‐world data. This review provides a rationale, framework, and step‐by‐step approach to validating case‐identifying algorithms for HOIs within healthcare databases. Key steps in validating a case‐identifying algorithm within a healthcare database include: (1) selecting the appropriate health outcome; (2) determining the reference standard against which to validate the algorithm; (3) developing the algorithm using diagnosis codes, diagnostic tests or their results, procedures, drug therapies, patient‐reported symptoms or diagnoses, or some combinations of these parameters; (4) selection of patients and sample sizes for validation; (5) collecting data to confirm the HOI; (6) confirming the HOI; and (7) assessing the algorithm's performance. Additional strategies for algorithm refinement and methods to correct for bias due to misclassification of outcomes are discussed. The review concludes by discussing factors affecting the transportability of case‐identifying algorithms and the need for ongoing validation as data elements within healthcare databases, such as diagnosis codes, change over time or new variables, such as patient‐generated health data, are included in these data sources.</jats:p>",

Here, we examine the role of mechanotransduction in brain development by focusing on Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel. We find that Piezo1 deletion results in a thinner neuroepithelial layer, disrupts pseudostratification, and reduces neurogenesis in E10.5 mouse embryos. Proliferation and differentiation of Piezo1 knockout (KO) mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from E10.5 embryos are reduced in vitro compared to littermate WT NSCs. Transcriptome analysis of E10.5 Piezo1 KO brains reveals downregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis superpathway, in which 16 genes, including Hmgcr, the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, are downregulated by 1.5-fold or more. Consistent with this finding, membrane lipid composition is altered, and the cholesterol levels are reduced in Piezo1 KO NSCs. Cholesterol supplementation of Piezo1 KO NSCs partially rescues the phenotype in vitro. These findings demonstrate a role for Piezo1 in the neurodevelopmental process that modulates the quantity, quality, and organization of cells by influencing cellular cholesterol metabolism. Our study establishes a direct link in NSCs between PIEZO1, intracellular cholesterol levels, and neural development.</jats:p>",

However, the stand-off distance of the current FSI-based ranging system for noncooperative targets is relatively short because the weak echo power cannot provide the needed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we report a ranging method that combines FSI and the laser feedback technique. Compared with conventional FSI, the interference between the weak echo signal and the local oscillator occurs in the laser cavity, which enhances the signal spontaneously and then provides an improved SNR. In the experiments, the detection limit of the echo power is less than 0.1 fW, with a 1 mW probe beam. Based on the enhancement from the laser feedback technique, the system can detect a noncooperative target that is up to hundreds of meters away in space without extra optical amplifiers. On the other hand, a large stand-off distance makes the system sensitive to environmental disturbance, which degrades the ranging precision. To address this issue, an interferometry-based compensation device, which is also sensitive to weak echoes from noncooperative targets, is proposed to monitor the optical-path-length drifts and ensure accurate beat frequency recognition. Moreover, the device can record distance changes during the integration time of ranging and track a moving target precisely with improved temporal resolution. Owing to the high sensitivity and the validity of the compensation approach, the standard deviation in 10 measurements is better than 0.07 mm when targeting an aluminum sheet at approximately 152 m. Generally, with a large range, high relative precision, and low photon consumption, the novel technical scheme for laser ranging demonstrates new capabilities that promise to enable a wide range of applications, such as large equipment assembly and noncooperative-target tracking.</jats:p>"

Although the predominant causal pathogen varies based on growing region, Fusarium avenaceum is often found to be an important contributor to disease. This study screened part of the lentil single plant-derived core collection for resistance to F. avenaceum in a greenhouse. Plants were phenotyped for disease severity using three scoring scales and the differences in biomass traits due to pathogen presence were measured. Lentil accessions varied in disease severity and differences in biomass traits were found to be correlated with each visual severity estimate (r = −0.37 to −0.63, P &lt; 0.001), however, heritability estimates were low to moderate among traits (H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.12 to 0.43). Results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from genotyping-by-sequencing revealed 11 quantitative trait loci (QTL) across four chromosomes. Two pairs of QTL colocated for two traits and were found near putative orthologs that have been previously associated with plant disease resistance. The identification of lentil accessions that did not exhibit a difference in biomass traits may serve as parental material in breeding or in the development of biparental mapping populations to further validate and dissect the genetic control of resistance to root rot caused by F. avenaceum. </jats:p>",

However, the differences in spinal function promotion between these two positions are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate muscle activation patterns and spinal kinematics during specific core stabilization training to provide evidence for selecting specific exercises.

The paired <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-test showed that the vertebral rotation angles were significantly higher during HKK than HFK, and the intra-group differences mainly occurred at the level of the thoracic vertebra.

The particles are taken into a microdroplet formed by optical tweezing in a thermo-responsive ionic liquid (IL)/water mixture. The confined particles aggregate as the droplet shrinks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Between 15 and 27 ka b2k (thousands of years before 2000 CE) during the last glacial, Greenland experienced a prolonged cold stadial phase, interrupted by two short-lived warm interstadials. Greenland ice-core calcium data show two periods, preceding the interstadials, of anomalously high atmospheric dust loading, the origin of which is not well understood. At approximately the same time as the Greenland dust peaks, the Chinese Hulu Cave speleothems exhibit a climatic signal suggested to be a response to Heinrich Event 2, a period of enhanced ice-rafted debris deposition in the North Atlantic. In the climatic signal of Antarctic ice cores, moreover, a relative warming occurs between 23 and 24.5 ka b2k that is generally interpreted as a counterpart to a cool climate phase in the Northern Hemisphere. Proposed centennial-scale offsets between the polar ice-core time scales and the speleothem time scale hamper the precise reconstruction of the global sequence of these climatic events. Here, we examine two new 10Be datasets from Greenland (NorthGRIP) and Antarctic (WDC) ice cores to test the agreement between different time scales, by taking advantage of the globally synchronous cosmogenic radionuclide production rates. Evidence of an event similar to the Maunder Solar Minimum is found in the new 10Be datasets, supported by lower-resolution radionuclide data from Greenland and 14C in the Hulu Cave speleothem, representing a good synchronization candidate at around 22 ka b2k. By matching the respective 10Be data, we determine the offset between the Greenland ice-core time scale, GICC05, and the WDC Antarctic time scale, WD2014, to be 125±40 years. Furthermore, via radionuclide wiggle-matching, we determine the offset between the Hulu speleothem and ice core timescales to be 375 years for GICC05 (75–625 years at 68 % confidence), and 225 years for WD2014 (-25–425 years at 68 % confidence). The rather wide uncertainties are intrinsic to the wiggle-matching algorithm and the limitations set by data resolution. The undercounting of annual layers in GICC05 inferred from the offset is hypothesized to have been caused by a combination of underdetected annual layers, especially during periods with low winter precipitation, and misinterpreted unusual patterns in the annual signal, during the extremely cold period often referred to as Heinrich Stadial 1.\n                        </jats:p>"

Rapid and automatic earthquake detection plays an important role in earthquake warning systems and earthquake operation mechanism research. Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) are frameworks that use expansion convolution and expansion, which have large and temporal receptive fields and can adapt to time series data. Given the excellent performance of temporal convolution networks using time series data, this paper proposes a deep learning framework based on the temporal convolution network model, which can be used to detect and obtain the accurate start times of seismic phases. In addition, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was added to the temporal convolution network model to automatically extract the deep features of seismic waves and the expansion convolution of each level was added to optimize its structure, which not only reduced the experimental parameters but also produced high-precision seismic phase detection results. Finally, the model was compared to the TCN, CNN-LSTM, SELD-TCN and the traditional AR-AIC methods. Our experimental results showed that the S-TCN method demonstrated great advantages in the accuracy and performance of seismic phase detection.</jats:p>"

Significant perturbations in metabolomics and lipidomics were observed at 1, 3, and 6 h, while values returned close to those of control mice by 24 h, hence reflecting a transient pattern of metabolic disturbance. Both venoms induced significant changes in amino acids, as well as in several purines and pyrimidines, and in some metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. KEGG analysis of metabolic pathways that showed those with the greatest change included aminoacyl tRNA synthesis and amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. With regard to lipid metabolism, there was an increase in triglycerides and some acyl carnitines and a concomitant drop in the levels of some phospholipids. In addition, envenomed mice had higher levels of cortisol, heme, and some oxidative stress markers. The overall pattern of metabolic changes in envenomed mice bears similarities with the patterns described in several traumatic injuries, thus underscoring a metabolic response/adaptation to the injurious action of the venoms.</jats:p>"

Here, we created paclitaxel (PTX)/norcantharidin (NCTD)-loaded core–shell lipid nanoparticles modified with a tumor neovasculature-targeted peptide (Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly, APRPG) and investigated their anti-tumor effects in HCC. Core–shell-type lipid nanoparticles (PTX/NCTD-APRPG-NPs) were established by combining poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-wrapped PTX with phospholipid-wrapped NCTD, followed by modification with APRPG. For comparison, PTX-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PTX-NPs) and PTX/NCTD-loaded core–shell-type nanoparticles without APRPG (PTX/NCTD-NPs) were prepared. The <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> anti-tumor effects were examined in HepG2 cells and tumor-bearing mice, respectively. Morphological and release characterization showed that PTX/NCTD-APRPG-NPs were prepared successfully and achieved up to 90% release of PTX in a sustained manner. Compared with PTX/NCTD-NPs, PTX/NCTD-APRPG-NPs significantly enhanced the uptake of PTX. Notably, the inhibition of proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells was significantly higher in the PTX/NCTD-APRPG-NP group than those in the PTX-NP and PTX/NCTD-NP groups, which reflected significantly greater anti-tumor properties as well. Furthermore, key molecules in cell proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways were altered most in the PTX/NCTD-APRPG-NP group, compared with the PTX-NP and PTX/NCTD-NP groups.

To compare the combined effects of core stability exercise and pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) with the effects of PFME alone on women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) who experience nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). Methods. A stratified randomized controlled trial study (RCT) was conducted with 50 women with SUI who experienced LBP, aged 18–60 years and with pad weight ≥2 grams for the one-hour pad test. The respondents were divided into two groups: the intervention group (PFME + core stability exercise) and the control group (PFME). The primary outcomes were the amount and frequency of urine leakage, which were measured using the one-hour pad test and the Bengali-ISI subjective questionnaire. A secondary outcome was quality of life (QoL), which was measured using King’s Health Questionnaire (KHQ). An ITT analysis was conducted using repeated measures ANOVA (2 × 2) with Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis. Results/Preliminary Findings. The findings illustrated that 72% (n = 18) of the intervention and 28% (n = 7) of the control group participants showed improvement in UI after 12 weeks of intervention. In addition, the amount and frequency of urine leakage significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the control group (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <a:mi>p</a:mi>\n                        <a:mo>≤</a:mo>\n                        <a:mn>0.001</a:mn>\n                     </a:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>).

However, the mechanisms involved in its regulation are not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that the peroxiredoxin 5 (Prdx5) enzyme, which detoxifies reactive oxygen species, is associated to genomic instability and signal transduction. Its role in the regulation of DDR, however, is not well characterized. In this study, we demonstrate a role of Prdx5 in the regulation of the DDR signaling pathway. Knockdown of Prdx5 resulted in DNA damage manifested by the induction of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1). We show that Prdx5 regulates DDR through (1) polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) mediated phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase to further trigger downstream mediators Chek1 and Chek2; (2) the increase of the acetylation of p53 at lysine 382, stabilizing p53 in the nucleus and enhancing transcription and (3) the induction of autophagy, which regulates the recycling of molecules involved in DDR. We identified Sirt2 as a novel deacetylase of p53 at lysine 382, and Sirt2 regulated the acetylation status of p53 at lysine 382 in a Prdx5-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that exogenous expression of Prdx5 decreased DNA damage and the activation of ATM in Pkd1 mutant renal epithelial cells, suggesting that Prdx5 may play a protective role from DNA damage in cystic renal epithelial cells. This study identified a novel mechanism of Prdx5 in the regulation of DDR through the ATM/p53/Sirt2 signaling cascade.</jats:p>",

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) promote the mobilization and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and are thereby critical mediators of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community. At present, it is unclear whether specific AMR categories are differentially disseminated via bacteriophages (phages) or plasmids. To understand the segregation of AMR in relation to MGEs, we analyzed meta-omic (metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) data systematically collected over 1.5 years from a BWWTP. Our results showed a core group of 15 AMR categories which were found across all timepoints. Some of these AMR categories were disseminated exclusively (bacitracin) or primarily (aminoglycoside, MLS and sulfonamide) via plasmids or phages (fosfomycin and peptide), whereas others were disseminated equally by both. Combined and timepoint-specific analyses of gene, transcript and protein abundances further demonstrated that aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were expressed more by plasmids, in contrast to fosfomycin and peptide AMR expression by phages, thereby validating our genomic findings. In the analyzed communities, the dominant taxon <jats:italic>Candidatus</jats:italic> Microthrix parvicella was a major contributor to several AMR categories whereby its plasmids primarily mediated aminoglycoside resistance. Importantly, we also found AMR associated with ESKAPEE pathogens within the BWWTP, and here MGEs also contributed differentially to the dissemination of the corresponding ARGs. Collectively our findings pave the way toward understanding the segmentation of AMR within MGEs, thereby shedding new light on resistome populations and their mediators, essential elements that are of immediate relevance to human health.</jats:p>"

The dire need for empathy-building exercises from the grass root level is evident. There is hope if future generations are taught to think of others as well as themselves, giving equal importance to every member of society. This article highlights the importance of empathy and traces its development in the mind of children, as an important core competency and life skill. Prosocial skills are discussed as a precursor and complementary attribute of the essential empathic skill.

A spintronics device is a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing hardware and can be used in extreme environments due to its high resistance to radiation. Improving the information‐processing capability of neuromorphic computing is an important challenge for implementation. Herein, a novel neuromorphic computing framework using spintronics devices is proposed. This framework is called coupled spintronics reservoir (CSR) computing and exploits the high‐dimensional dynamics of coupled spin‐torque oscillators as a computational resource. The relationships among various bifurcations of the CSR and its information‐processing capabilities through numerical experiments are analyzed and it is found that certain configurations of the CSR boost the information‐processing capability of the spintronics reservoir toward or even beyond the standard level of machine learning networks. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through conventional machine learning benchmarks and edge computing in real physical experiments using pneumatic artificial muscle‐based wearables, which assist human operations in various environments. This study significantly advances the availability of neuromorphic computing for practical uses.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Since 2011, it has been mandatory for health services to offer psychotherapy in Uruguay's National Health System. Adolescents and young people are a priority population. The lack of information about the functioning and the effectiveness of the mental health services focused on youth is an obstacle to assess and, as a consequence, to improve the services. The objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a system to establish the characteristics and outcomes of psychological treatment received by young people at services provided by Uruguay's National Health System. The present study was the first of its kind to examine the outcomes of psychotherapy offered in mental health services. A pre‐post design in a naturalistic setting was used. Sixty‐nine participants, aged 16 to 24 years, and 26 therapists from four health services participated. Sociodemographic and clinical questionnaires, the Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluation‐Outcome Measure (CORE‐OM; Evans et al., 2002) and a semi‐structured interview were applied to assess the perception of change. CORE‐OM results portrayed a decrease in psychological distress. Interview data helped to better understand the perception of change. A high number of dropouts revealed the need for the services to use strategies to prevent early dropouts in young users. The CORE‐OM appears to be a valuable tool. Barriers for outcomes system implementations are discussed and may prove useful to other countries where there is a lack of an outcome‐oriented clinical culture.</jats:p>",

The materials were produced by self–assembled growth achieved by means of multilayer magnetron sputtering deposition. We demonstrated the successful fabrication of well-ordered 3D lattices of Ge/Al and Ge/Si3N4/Al core/shell quantum dots with a body-centred tetragonal arrangement within the Al2O3 matrix. The addition of shells to the Ge core enables a strong tuning of the optical and electrical properties of the material. An Al shell induces a bandgap shift toward smaller energies, and, in addition, it prevents Ge oxidation. The addition of a thin Si3N4 shell induces huge changes in the material spectral response, i.e., in the number of extracted excitons produced by a single photon. It increases both the absolute value and the width of the spectral response. For the best sample, we achieved an enhancement of over 250% of the produced number of excitons in the measured energy range. The observed changes are, as it seems, the consequence of the large tensile strain in Ge QDs which is induced by the Si3N4 shell addition and which is measured to be about 3% for the most strained QDs. The tensile strain causes activation of the direct bandgap of germanium, which has a very strong effect on the spectral response of the material.</jats:p>"

Testing of its applicability for mineral exploration and research was performed by scanning and analyzing 1,500 m of drill core from the Paleoproterozoic Lovisa stratiform Zn-Pb sulfide deposit, which is part of a larger mineral system also including Cu-Co and Fe-(rare earth element) mineralization, hosted by the highly strained West Bergslagen boundary zone in south-central Sweden.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The obtained scanning data complements data derived from structural field mapping, drill core logs, and chemical analysis as well as from multiscale 3-D geologic modeling at Lovisa. Data integration reveals macro- and mesoscopic folding of S0/S1 by asymmetric steeply SE-plunging F2 folds and N-striking vertical F3 folds. Stretching lineations, measured directly from the scanning imagery, trend parallel to F2 fold hinges and modeled ore shoots at the nearby Håkansboda Cu-Co and Stråssa and Blanka Fe deposits. The textural character of the Lovisa ore zones is revealed in 3-D by XCT-XRF scanning and highlight remobilization of Zn and Pb from primary layering into ductile and brittle structures. The downhole bulk geochemical trends seen in scanning and traditional assay data are generally comparable but with systematic variations for some elements due to currently unresolved XRF spectral overlaps (e.g., Co and Fe).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The 3-D deformation pattern at Lovisa is explained by D2 sinistral transpression along the West Bergslagen boundary zone in response to regional north-south crustal shortening at ca. 1.84–1.81 Ga. Local refolding was caused by D3 regional east-west crustal shortening resulting in dextral transpression along the West Bergslagen boundary zone, presumably at ca. 1.80–1.76 Ga. Based on polyphase ore textures and modeled ore shoots aligned to F2 fold hinges, we postulate that D2 and D3 transpressive deformation exerted both a strong control on ore remobilization and the resulting orebody geometries at Lovisa and neighboring deposits within the West Bergslagen boundary zone.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We conclude that the combined XCT-XRF drill core scanning technique provides a valuable tool for 3-D ore and rock characterization, generating continuous downhole data sets, with the potential for increasing precision and efficiency in mineral exploration and mining.</jats:p>",

However, cell death can proceed efficiently in the absence of caspase-9 following mitochondrial disruption, suggesting the existence of caspase-9-independent cell death mechanisms. Through a genome-wide siRNA library screening, we identified a network of genes that mediate caspase-9-independent cell death, through ROS production and Alox5-dependent membrane lipid peroxidation. Erk1-dependent phosphorylation of Alox5 is critical for targeting Alox5 to the nuclear membrane to mediate lipid peroxidation, resulting in nuclear translocation of cytolytic molecules to induce DNA damage and cell death. Consistently, double knockouts of caspase-9 and Alox5 in mice, but not deletion of either gene alone, led to significant T cell expansion with inhibited cell death, indicating that caspase-9- and Alox5-dependent pathways function in parallel to regulate T cell death in vivo. This unbiased whole-genome screening reveals an Erk1-Alox5-mediated pathway that promotes membrane lipid peroxidation and nuclear translocation of cytolytic molecules, leading to the execution of cell death in parallel to the caspase-9 signaling cascade.</jats:p>"

These oxides exhibit fast proton conduction due to the complex physicochemical phenomena of hydration, chemical lattice expansion, proton migration, proton trapping, and local distortion. Using a proton-conducting oxide as an electrolyte film in electrochemical devices introduces an interface, which thermally and chemically generates mechanical strain. Here, we briefly review the current state of research into proton-conducting oxides in bulk samples and films used in electrochemical devices. We fabricated 18 and 500 nm thick 20 mol% BZY20 epitaxial films on (001) Nb-doped SrTiO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> single-crystal substrates to form a model interface between proton-conductive and non-proton-conductive materials, using pulsed laser deposition, and quantified the mechanical strain, proton concentration, proton conductivity, and diffusivity using thin-film x-ray diffractometry, thermogravimetry, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and AC impedance spectroscopy. Compressive strains of −2.1% and −0.85% were measured for the 18 and 500 nm thick films, respectively, and these strains reduced both the proton conduction and diffusion by five and one orders of magnitude, respectively, at 375 °C. Analysis based on a simple trapping model revealed that the decrease in proton conduction results from the slower diffusion of mobile protons with a negligible change in the proton trapping contribution. The model shows that the high ohmic resistance reported for a high-performance PCFC with a power density of 740 mW cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> at 600 °C can be solely explained by the estimated compressive strain in the cells. This study shows that minimizing biaxial compressive strain by appropriate choices of the electrolyte–electrode combination and fabrication process is important for maximizing the performance of electrochemical cells.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Establishment of vegetable soybean (edamame) [<jats:italic>Glycine max</jats:italic> (L.) Merr.] germplasms has been highly valued in Asia and the United States owing to the increasing market demand for edamame. The idea of core collection (CC) is to shorten the breeding program so as to improve the availability of germplasm resources. However, multidimensional phenotypes typically are highly correlated and have different levels of missing rate, often failing to capture the underlying pattern of germplasms and select CC precisely. These are commonly observed on correlated samples. To overcome such scenario, we introduced the “multiple imputation” (MI) method to iteratively impute missing phenotypes for 46 morphological traits and jointly analyzed high-dimensional imputed missing phenotypes (EC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>) to explore population structure and relatedness among 200 Taiwanese vegetable soybean accessions. An advanced maximization strategy with a heuristic algorithm and PowerCore was used to evaluate the morphological diversity among the EC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>. In total, 36 accessions (denoted as CC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>) were efficiently selected representing high diversity and the entire coverage of the EC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>. Only 4 (8.7%) traits showed slightly significant differences between the CC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub> and EC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>. Compared to the EC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>, 96% traits retained all characteristics or had a slight diversity loss in the CC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>. The CC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub> exhibited a small percentage of significant mean difference (4.51%), and large coincidence rate (98.1%), variable rate (138.76%), and coverage (close to 100%), indicating the representativeness of the EC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub>. We noted that the CC<jats:sub><jats:italic>impu</jats:italic></jats:sub> outperformed the CC<jats:sub><jats:italic>raw</jats:italic></jats:sub> in evaluation properties, suggesting that the multiple phenotype imputation method has the potential to deal with missing phenotypes in correlated samples efficiently and reliably without re-phenotyping accessions.

Fibrous morphology is preferred due to its high active surface which can improve the actuation/sensing properties, its preparation still being challenging. Thus, a simple fabrication algorithm based on electrospinning, sputtering deposition and electrochemical polymerization produced electroactive aligned ribbon meshes with analogous characteristics as natural muscle fibers. These can simultaneously generate a movement (by applying an electric current/potential) and sense the effort of holding weights (by measuring the potential/current while holding objects up to 21.1 mg). Electroactivity was consisting in a fast bending/curling motion, depending on the fiber strip width. The amplitude of the movement decreases by increasing the load, a behavior similar with natural muscles. Moreover, when different weights were hung on the device, it senses the load modification, demonstrating a sensitivity of about 7 mV/mg for oxidation and − 4 mV/mg for reduction. These results are important since simultaneous actuation and sensitivity are essential for complex activity. Such devices with multiple functionalities can open new possibilities of applications as e.g. smart prosthesis or lifelike robots.</jats:p>"

Autonomous vehicles are typically equipped with multiple 3D LiDARs because there are many commercially available low-cost 3D LiDARs. Extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDAR sensors is essential in order to obtain consistent geometric information. This paper presents a systematic procedure for the extrinsic calibration of multiple 3D LiDAR sensors using plane objects. At least three independent planes are required within the common field of view of the LiDAR sensors. The planes satisfying the condition can easily be found on objects such as the ground, walls, or columns in indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore, the proposed method does not require environmental modifications such as using artificial calibration objects. Multiple LiDARs typically have different viewpoints to reduce blind spots. This situation increases the difficulty of the extrinsic calibration using conventional registration algorithms. We suggest a plane registration method for cases in which correspondences are not known. The entire calibration process can easily be automated using the proposed registration technique. The presented experimental results clearly show that the proposed method generates more accurate extrinsic parameters than conventional point cloud registration methods.</jats:p>"

Gal‐3 has both intracellular and extracellular functionality, and we wanted to assess whether the affect we observed in the <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic> knockout (KO) mice could be attributed to the ability of Gal‐3 to bind glycoproteins. Mutation of a highly conserved arginine to a serine in human Gal‐3 (<jats:italic>LGALS3</jats:italic>‐R186S) blocks glycan binding and secretion. We generated mice with the equivalent mutation (<jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐R200S) and observed a subsequent reduction in Gal‐3 secretion from mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in circulating blood. When examining bone structure in aged mice, we noticed some similarities to the <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐KO mice and some differences. First, we observed greater bone mass in <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐R200S mutant mice, as was previously observed in <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐KO mice. Like <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐KO mice, significantly increased trabecular bone mass was only observed in female <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐R200S mice. These results suggest that the greater bone mass observed is driven by the loss of extracellular Gal‐3 functionality. However, the results from our cortical bone expansion data showed a sex‐dependent difference, with only male <jats:italic>Lgals3</jats:italic>‐KO mice having an increased response, contrasting with our earlier study. These notable sex differences suggest a potential role for sex hormones, most likely androgen signaling, being involved. In summary, our results suggest that targeting extracellular Gal‐3 function may be a suitable treatment for age‐related loss of bone mass.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change is undeniable, and its effects, like droughts and intense precipitation, evidence this reality. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as climate extremes’ future frequency and intensity. International collaboration projects such as the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)-Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CORE) have emerged to address these questions, creating protocols to facilitate the intercomparison among simulations obtained by different regional climate models (RCMs). Given this context, this study aims to describe the projected changes in the extreme precipitation events over the South America domain by using a set of projections of three RCMs (Eta, RegCM, and REMO) under the CORDEX-CORE framework (except Eta). These models were nested in different global climate models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under the RCP8.5 scenario and integrated with a grid space of 25 km. In addition, six climate indices (PRCPTOT, SDII, R95p, P95, CDD, and CWD) were computed by season for the historical period (1995–2014) and four future time-slices (2020–2039, 2040–2059, 2060–2079, and 2080–2099). For brevity, this study focuses on the austral summer. RCMs are generally capable of representing the spatial pattern of climate indices but with differences in intensity. The ensemble with all RCMs shows a slightly better spatial correlation with the reference data than the ensemble of each RCM. The signal of the projections is similar between RegCM and REMO and, in general, opposite to Eta (mainly in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone region). Of the six climate indices analyzed, the ensemble performed with the three RCMs projects statistically significant negative (positive) trends for four indices in the Amazon (La Plata Basin), indicating a signal of dry (wet) conditions increasing towards the end of the century. Furthermore, both regions have significant positive (negative) trends of consecutive dry (wet) days. The region with higher uncertainties lies over southeastern Brazil, where Eta projects a dry climate and RegCM and REMO, a wet one.</jats:p>"

Currently, at least 6 randomized clinical trials are examining the benefit of extending EVT to this population of patients with acute ischemic stroke. These trials were independently conceived and have significant differences in their inclusion criteria. Understanding these inclusion criteria and other differences in trial design is pivotal for the field to interpret the upcoming results of these trials. In this review, the designs of the 6 trials are summarized and compared. Specific differences are described, including (1) the rationale for EVT treatment in patients with LICV, (2) how to define LICV and the imaging modality used to identify LICV, (3) inclusion of an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score 0 to 5 versus 3 to 5, (4) use of the mismatch between blood flow and the size of infarct as an inclusion criterion, and (5) inclusion of early window and/or late window patients. The potential impact of these trial results on current guidelines for acute ischemic stroke is discussed. Differences in trial design as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria may influence trial outcomes. The implications of these trial results will likely be enhanced by a pooled analysis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In placental mammals, estradiol levels are chronically elevated during pregnancy, but quickly drop to prepartum levels following birth. This may produce an “estrogen withdrawal” state that has been linked to changes in affective states in humans and rodents during the postpartum period. The neural mechanisms underlying these affective changes, however, are understudied. We used a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy (HSP), a model of postpartum estrogen withdrawal, in adult female C57BL/6 mice to test the impact of postpartum estrogen withdrawal on several behavioral measures of anxiety and motivation. We found that estrogen withdrawal following HSP increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, but not in the open field or marble burying tests. Although hormone treatment during HSP consistently increased sucrose consumption, sucrose preference was generally not impacted by hormone treatment or subsequent estrogen withdrawal. In the social motivation test, estrogen withdrawal decreased the amount of time spent in proximity to a social stimulus animal. These behavioral changes were accompanied by changes in the expression of ΔFosB, a transcription factor correlated with stable long-term plasticity, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Specifically, estrogen-withdrawn females had higher ΔFosB expression in the nucleus accumbens core. Using transgenic reporter mice, we found that this increase in ΔFosB occurred in both D1- and D2-expressing cells in the NAc core. Together, these results suggest that postpartum estrogen withdrawal impacts anxiety and motivation and increases ΔFosB in the NAc core.</jats:p>"

The hot deformation equation of the alloy is derived from the piecewise model based on the theory of work hardening-dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization (DRX), respectively. Comparisons between the predicted and experimental data indicate that the proposed constitutive model had a highly accurate prediction. The deformation rate and temperature effect were associated with microstructural change, and the evolution of the microstructure was analyzed through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The dislocation densities of the alloy at the deformation of 850 °C and 2.72 s−1 is higher than at the other deformation, the higher dislocation density is the higher stored energy and the higher degree of DRX. As well, two types of DRX nucleation mechanisms have been identified: discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX). Changes in grain boundary have significant effect on the DRX nucleation of the alloy, twin boundaries act as potential barriers limiting dislocation slip and motion and eventually leading to the accumulation of dislocation during plastic deformation. This study identified that the major contribution which results in the growth of new twins in DRX grains is the new boundary of Σ3 twins.</jats:p>"

Thus, there are few clinical options to improve vision after traumatic or ischemic optic nerve injury or in neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma, dominant optic neuropathy, or optic pathway gliomas. Research over the past two decades has identified several strategies to enable RGCs to regenerate axons the entire length of the optic nerve, in some cases leading to modest reinnervation of di- and mesencephalic visual relay centers. This review primarily focuses on the role of the innate immune system in improving RGC survival and axon regeneration, and its synergy with manipulations of signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, and cell-extrinsic suppressors of axon growth. Research in this field provides hope that clinically effective strategies to improve vision in patients with currently untreatable losses could become a reality in 5–10 years.</jats:p>"

For Co2MnZ (Z = Ge, Sn) Heusler alloys, an L21-order is expected to appear even in the as-deposited state or by a low-temperature annealing process due to their very high L21 to B2-order transition temperature (&amp;gt;1500 K). Here, epitaxial Co2MnZ films were grown on MgO (001) substrate at room temperature (RT) and post-annealed at Tann = 200–500 °C. Interestingly, as-sputtered films exhibit L21-ordering, which improves systematically upon increasing Tann. The spin-polarization of electric current (β) was estimated at RT using nonlocal spin-valve (NLSV) devices by measuring the spin-accumulation signal in a copper (Cu) channel. It was found that at Tann = 300 °C, the β value of Co2MnGe films is higher (∼0.65) than that of Co2FeGe0.5Ga0.5 films due to a higher degree of L21-order, which makes the Co2MnGe alloy a promising ferromagnetic electrode for spintronic device applications.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the results of scientific research on this issue from the standpoint of comparative (Russian-Ossetian) and general aspectology achievements have not been practically introduced into the scientific use of modern Ossetian studies for the last decades, have not become the property of methodological and didactic manuals to help practical teachers, which, in our opinion, underlines the relevance of the research undertaken within the framework of this article. The genre of the article is somewhat unusual: it combines aspects of scientific coverage of the topic of the device of the core and periphery in the FSF of the aspectuality of the modern Ossetian language, the features of their interaction in comparison with the situation in the FSF of aspectuality in modern Russian, brief information about the landmark stages of the development of this problem, individual methodological recommendations and specific didactic proposals to help teachers-practitioners working with an Ossetian-speaking audience with both Russian and Ossetian language of instruction. The desire of the author of the article to “immerse” Ossetian scientists, practical teachers, philology students studying in the areas of dual qualification “Teacher of the native language. The teacher of the Russian language”, explains the bibliography of the question, which is greater than is customary in such publications, that in the situation of the lack of educational and methodological literature on this topic should be considered a plus rather than a flaw, as well as a detailed description of the conceptual (terminological) apparatus used in modern aspectology. All the fundamental differences in the organization of the core of aspectuality in the modern Ossetian language in comparison with Russian are highlighted on specific linguistic facts, as well as the most debatable aspects of the topic.</jats:p>",

Among the many qubit platforms, spin qubits in silicon quantum dots are promising for large-scale integration along with their nanofabrication capability. However, linking distant silicon quantum processors is challenging as two-qubit gates in spin qubits typically utilize short-range exchange coupling, which is only effective between nearest-neighbor quantum dots. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate between spin qubits via coherent spin shuttling, a key technology for linking distant silicon quantum processors. Coherent shuttling of a spin qubit enables efficient switching of the exchange coupling with an on/off ratio exceeding 1000, while preserving the spin coherence by 99.6% for the single shuttling between neighboring dots. With this shuttling-mode exchange control, we demonstrate a two-qubit controlled-phase gate with a fidelity of 93%, assessed via randomized benchmarking. Combination of our technique and a phase coherent shuttling of a qubit across a large quantum dot array will provide feasible path toward a quantum link between distant silicon quantum processors, a key requirement for large-scale quantum computation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The kiwifruit is cultivated globally due to its diversity of phytochemicals, especially phenolic compounds, which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer medical effects. However, only the pulp of the kiwifruit is consumed, while the peels and cores—which are also rich in phytochemicals—are usually wasted. Meanwhile, detailed information on the comparison among the three parts is still limited. In this study, the antioxidant potentials in the core, pulp, and peel of the three most commercialized kiwifruit cultivars (Australian-grown Hayward kiwifruit, New Zealand-grown Zesy002 kiwifruit, and New Zealand-grown organic Hayward kiwifruit) were selected. Their antioxidant capacities were tested, and their phenolic profiles were identified and characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS). The antioxidant results showed that the peel of New Zealand-grown organic Hayward kiwifruit contained the highest total phenolic content (9.65 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) mg/g) and total antioxidant capacity (4.43 mg ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE) mg/g), respectively. In addition, the antioxidant capacity of the peel is generally higher than that of the pulp and cores in all species, especially ABTS (2,2-Azino-bis-3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging ability), ranging from 13.25 mg AAE/g to 18.31 mg AAE/g. The LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS tentatively identified the phenolic compounds present in the three kiwifruit species, including 118 unique compounds in kiwifruit peel, 12 unique compounds in the kiwifruit cores, and three unique compounds in kiwifruit pulp. The comprehensive characterization of the phenolics in the kiwifruits’ parts indicates the importance of their waste part as a promising source of phenolics with antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study can guide the industry with meaningful information on kiwifruit waste, and can provide it with the utilization of food and pharmacological aspects.</jats:p>"

We identify cores using the dendrogram algorithm and utilize machine learning techniques, including Neural Gas prototype learning and Fuzzy c-means clustering to analyse the density and velocity dispersion profiles of cores together with six bulk properties. We produce a 2-d visualization using a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), which facilitates the connection between physical properties and three partially-overlapping phases: i) unbound turbulent structures (Phase I), ii) coherent cores that have low turbulence (Phase II), and iii) bound cores, many of which become protostellar (Phase III). Within Phase II, we identify a population of long-lived coherent cores that reach a quasi-equilibrium state. Most prestellar cores form in Phase II and become protostellar after evolving into Phase III. Due to the turbulent cloud environment, the initial core properties do not uniquely predict the eventual evolution, i.e. core evolution is stochastic, and cores follow no one evolutionary path. The phase lifetimes are 1.0 ± 0.1 × 105 yr, 1.3 ± 0.2 × 105 yr, and 1.8 ± 0.3 × 105 yr for Phase I, II, and III, respectively. We compare our results to NH3 observations of dense cores. Known coherent cores predominantly map into Phase II, while most turbulent pressure-confined cores map to Phase I or III. We predict that a significant fraction of observed starless cores have unresolved coherent regions and that ≳20 per cent of observed starless cores will not form stars. Measurements of core radial profiles in addition to the usual bulk properties will enable more accurate predictions of core evolution.</jats:p>",

However, traditional metal complex‐based laser‐ignitable primary explosives are limited by high input laser energy and low detonation ability. In this study, an efficient laser‐ignitable primary explosive‐based copper azide is prepared by constructing core‐shell hetero‐framework Cu‐MOF@COF as the precursor. The pyrolysis of Cu‐MOF@COF hybrid material affords copper azide (CA) nanoparticle confined in a porous carbon shell, referred to CA@C Shell. The evenly coated porous carbon shell functions as light‐to‐heat conversion layer efficiently promoting the laser initiation process of inside CA. Consequently, CA@C Shell can be initiated at lower laser energy thresholds (0.80 mJ at 1064 nm). This value is significantly lower than typical laser ignitable metal complex tetraamine‐cis‐bis(5‐nitro‐2H‐tetrazolato‐N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>)cobalt(III)perchlorate (726 mJ at 808 nm).

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Determining physical process parameters in atmospheric models is critical to obtaining accurate weather and climate simulations; estimating optimal parameters is essential for reducing model error. Recently, automatic parameter estimation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been tested instead of conventional manual parameter tuning. To maintain uncertainty for the parameters to be estimated and avoid filter divergence in EnKF-based methods, some inflation techniques should be applied to parameter ensemble spread (ES). When ES is kept constant through the estimation using an inflation technique, the precision and convergence speed of the estimation vary depending on the ES assigned to estimated parameters. However, there is debate over how to determine an appropriate constant ES for estimated parameters in terms of precision and convergence speed. This study examined the dependence of precision and convergence speed of an estimated parameter on the ES to establish a reliable and efficient method for EnKF-based parameter estimation. This was carried out by conducting idealized experiments targeting a parameter in a cloud microphysics scheme. In the experiments, there was a threshold value for ES where any smaller values did not result in any further improvements to the estimation precision, which enabled the determination of the optimal ES in terms of precision. On the other hand, the convergence speed accelerates monotonically as ES increases. To generalize the precision and convergence speed, we approximated the time series of parameter estimation with a first-order autoregression (AR(1)) model. We demonstrated that the precision and convergence speed may be quantified by two parameters from the AR(1) model: the autoregressive parameter and the amplitude of random perturbation. As the ES increases, the autoregressive parameter decreases, while the random perturbation amplitude increases. The estimation precision was determined based on the balance between the two values. The AR(1) approximation provides quantitative guidelines to determine the optimal ES for the precision and convergence speed of the EnKF-based parameter estimation.</jats:p>"

We previously found that influenza A/guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/99 (H9N2) virus (GFHK99) displays a particularly high reliance on multiple infection in mammalian cells. Here, we sought to uncover the viral processes underlying this phenotype. We found that the need for multiple infection maps to amino acid 26K of the viral PA protein. PA 26K suppresses endonuclease activity and viral transcription, specifically within cells infected at low multiplicity. In the context of the higher functioning PA 26E, inhibition of PA using baloxavir acid augments reliance on multiple infection. Together, these data suggest a model in which sub-optimal activity of the GFHK99 endonuclease results in inefficient priming of viral transcription, an insufficiency which can be overcome with the introduction of additional viral ribonucleoprotein templates to the cell. More broadly, the finding that deficiency in a core viral function is ameliorated through multiple infection suggests that the fitness effects of many viral mutations are likely to be modulated by multiplicity of infection, such that the shape of fitness landscapes varies with viral densities.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, the investigation execution of SERS‐LFIA is often compromised by the intricacy and overlap of the Raman fingerprint spectrum as well as the affinity‐interference of nano‐tracer to antibody. To circumvent these critical issues, an engineered core–shell multifunctional nano‐tracer (named APNPs) with precise control of the size of nano‐core (AuNPs) and coating of the nano‐shell (Prussian blue nanomaterials) is prepared for SERS‐LFIA via a modified enlarging particle size and coating modification strategy. Importantly, this nano‐tracer exhibits enhanced coupling efficiency, highly retained affinity, reinforced colloid stability, and unique SERS signal (2156 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in the silent region (1800–2800 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) with high signal‐to‐background ratio simultaneously, all of which are beneficial to the enhancement of the analysis performance. With a proof‐of‐concept demonstration for detection of ractopamine (RAC), a dual‐pattern LFIA that synergizes both the enlarged particle size and coating modification supported colorimetric/biological silence Raman dual‐response (coined as the ECCRD assay) is demonstrated by integrating APNPs with the competitive‐type immunoreaction.

Here, we evaluated this Fab x sdAb-Fc format as a T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody (TbsAbs) by targeting mEGFR on tumor cells and mCD3E on T cells. We focused our attention specifically on the hinge design of the sdAb arm of the bispecific antibody. Our data show that a TbsAb with a shorter hinge of 23 amino acids (TbsAb.short) showed a significantly better T cell redirected tumor cell elimination than the TbsAb with a longer, classical antibody hinge of 39 amino acids (TbsAb.long). Moreover, the TbsAb.short form mediated better T cell-tumor cell aggregation and increased CD69 and CD25 expression levels on T cells more than the TbsAb.long form. Taken together, our results indicate that already minor changes in the hinge design of TbsAbs can have significant impact on the anti-tumor activity of TbsAbs and may provide a new means to improve their potency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. As a frequent cause of death in cancer patients, liver cancer usually occurs in hepatitis B and cirrhosis. In China, Chinese people have been using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating various chronic liver diseases, which could effectively improve the symptoms and slow down the progression of liver diseases. However, due to the complexity rules of TCM prescription, their action mechanisms are still not clearly understood, which may affect the popularization of effective prescriptions. This study aims to identify the core TCM herbs in the treatment of hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer so as to clarify the mechanism of action of the core herb networks. Methods. There were 1,673 prescriptions for chronic liver diseases collected in this study, of which 854 were hepatic B prescriptions, 530 were for liver cirrhosis, and 289 were for liver cancer. The basic characteristics of herbal medicine were firstly explained via descriptive analysis, then the core prescriptions of herbal medicine were analyzed through association rule, and finally, the mechanism of core prescriptions was explored with the help of systematic network pharmacology and by applying such databases as TCMIP, HERB, OMIM, GeneCards, KEGG, and software like RStudio and Cytoscape. Results. The rule of the core prescriptions in these cases was characterized by the application of herbs with both cold and warm properties, in which bitter herbs with cold property took priority. Tonifying deficiency, clearing heat, and activating blood circulations to remove stasis were common treatment principles for the three liver diseases. Turmeric Root Tuber (YuJin), White Peony Root (BaiShao), Bupleurum (ChaiHu), Salvia miltiorrhiza (DanShen), and Astragali Radix (HuangQi) were prescribed the most in hepatitis B treatment to invigorate the spleen and soothe the liver. Astragali Radix (HuangQi), Tuckahoe (FuLing), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (BaiZhu), Fructus Polygoni Orientalis (ShuiHongHuaZi), and Curcumae Rhizome (EZhu) were most frequently applied in liver cirrhosis treatment to replenish qi and activate blood. Oldenlandia (BaiHuaSheSheCao), Bearded Scutellaria (BanZhiLian), Curcumae Rhizome (EZhu), and Cardamom (DouKou) were most frequently prescribed to eliminate cancer toxin, invigorate the spleen, and activate blood. These core herbs mainly act through signal transduction and immune system pathways, in which the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a key role. The core prescription for liver cirrhosis regulated more endocrine system pathways than the hepatitis B prescription, and liver cancer prescription regulated more nervous system-related pathways. Conclusion. Three core prescriptions for hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer treatment were identified, which acted mainly through signal transduction and immune system pathways to regulate immunity and cell growth and participate in inflammation inhibition, in which liver cancer prescription regulated more pathways, especially more nervous system-related pathways than the other two.</jats:p>",

An active learning scheme is employed to obtain a training set containing configurations of thermodynamic relevance. This enables bypassing of the structural relaxation procedure that is necessary when applying conventional NNP approaches to the lattice configuration problem. The idea is demonstrated on the calculation of the temperature dependence of the degree of A/B site inversion in three spinel oxides, MgAl2O4, ZnAl2O4, and MgGa2O4. The present scheme may serve as an alternative to cluster expansion for “difficult” systems, e.g., complex bulk or interface systems with many components and sublattices that are relevant to many technological applications today.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, EEG analysis is recognized as the most direct way to detect epileptogenic lesions from spatiotemporal perspectives. Although ictal direct-current shifts (below 1 Hz) and ictal high-frequency oscillations (above 80 Hz) have received increasing attention as good indicators that can add more specific information to the conventionally defined seizure-onset zone, large cohort studies on postoperative outcomes are still lacking. This work aimed to clarify whether this additional information, particularly ictal direct-current shifts which is assumed to reflect extracellular potassium concentration, really improve postoperative outcomes. To assess the usefulness in epilepsy surgery, we collected unique EEG data sets recorded with a longer time constant of 10 s using an alternate current amplifier. Sixty-one patients (15 with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and 46 with neocortical epilepsy) who had undergone invasive presurgical evaluation for medically refractory seizures at five institutes in Japan were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Among intracranially implanted electrodes, the two core electrodes of both ictal direct-current shifts and ictal high-frequency oscillations were independently identified by board-certified clinicians based on unified methods. The occurrence patterns, such as their onset time, duration, and amplitude (power) were evaluated to extract the features of both ictal direct-current shifts and ictal high-frequency oscillations. Additionally, we examined whether the resection ratio of the core electrodes of ictal direct-current shifts and ictal high-frequency oscillations independently correlated with favourable outcomes. A total of 53 patients with 327 seizures were analyzed for wide-band EEG analysis, and 49 patients were analyzed for outcome analysis. Ictal direct-current shifts were detected in the seizure-onset zone more frequently than ictal high-frequency oscillations among both patients (92% versus 71%) and seizures (86% versus 62%). Additionally, ictal direct-current shifts significantly preceded ictal high-frequency oscillations in patients exhibiting both biomarkers, and ictal direct-current shifts occurred more frequently in neocortical epilepsy patients than in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Finally, although a low corresponding rate was observed for ictal direct-current shifts and ictal high-frequency oscillations (39%) at the electrode level, complete resection of the core area of ictal direct-current shifts significantly correlated with favourable outcomes, similar to ictal high-frequency oscillation outcomes. Our results provide a proof of concept that the independent significance of ictal direct-current shifts from ictal high-frequency oscillations should be considered as reliable biomarkers to achieve favourable outcomes in epilepsy surgery. Moreover, the different distribution of the core areas of ictal direct-current shifts and ictal high-frequency oscillations may provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy, in which not only neurons but also glial cells may be actively involved via extracellular potassium levels.</jats:p>",

Simulation is used for a variety of medical procedures including central venous catheterization (CVC). The dynamic haptic robotic trainer (DHRT) is a CVC teaching simulator developed to specifically focus on training the needle insertion portion of CVC. While the DHRT has been validated to teach CVC as well as other training methods, an opportunity was seen to redesign the instructions of the DHRT to increase the learnability of the system. A hands-on instructional walkthrough was designed. A group trained with the hands-on instructions was compared to a previous group to assess initial insertion performance.

To test whether this maladaptive neuroplastic mechanism underlies the addiction-like behavior induced in young mice by a high-fat diet (HFD), we utilized 28-days-old male mice fed HFD ad-libitum over 2 weeks, followed by 5 days of HFD abstinence. Control groups were fed a regular diet. HFD fed mice showed increased ΔFosB levels in the NAc core region, whereas LTD triggered from the mPFC became suppressed. Interestingly, LTD suppression was prevented by an i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine 2.5 h before inducing LTD from the mPFC. In addition, excessive weight gain due to HFD feeding was diminished by adding 2mg/mL N-acetylcysteine in drinking water. Those results show a loss of neuroplastic mPFC control over NAc core activity induced by HFD consumption in young subjects. In conclusion, ad libitum consumption of HFD can lead to neuroplastic changes an addiction-like behavior that can be prevented by N-acetylcysteine, helping to decrease the rate of excessive weight gain.</jats:p>"

However, the accumulated chromatic dispersion in OAM-fiber could limit the data speed and transmission distance of communication systems. A potential solution is to insert a dispersion compensation ring-core fiber with opposite-sign of dispersion in the transmission fiber along the fiber link. In this work, we propose a triple ring-core fiber with broadband negative dispersion. A highest negative dispersion of -24.47 ps/(nm·km) at 1550 nm and an average dispersion slope in the C band from -0.182 ps/(nm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>·km) to 0.065 ps/(nm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>·km) can be achieved to compensate multi-order dispersion. The effects of Ge-doping concentration fluctuation in the high-index ring core and fabrication errors on fiber geometric structures are also investigated. Furthermore, the effective mode area decreases as the widths of high-index rings increase due to the enhanced confinement ability. The designed triple ring-core fiber could offer potential for compensating OAM fiber links with positive dispersions.</jats:p>",

High-risk tumours are often difficult to treat, and patients’ survival chances are less than 50%. Retinoic acid treatment is part of the maintenance therapy given to neuroblastoma patients; however, not all tumours differentiate in response to retinoic acid. Within neuroblastoma tumors, two phenotypically distinct cell types have been identified based on their super-enhancer landscape and transcriptional core regulatory circuitries: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). We hypothesized that the distinct super-enhancers in these different tumour cells mediate differential response to retinoic acid. To this end, three different neuroblastoma cell lines, ADRN (<jats:italic>MYCN</jats:italic> amplified and non-amplified) and MES cells, were treated with retinoic acid, and changes in the super-enhancer landscape upon treatment and after subsequent removal of retinoic acid was studied. Using ChIP-seq for the active histone mark H3K27ac, paired with RNA-seq, we compared the super-enhancer landscape in cells that undergo neuronal differentiation in response to retinoic acid versus those that fail to differentiate and identified unique super-enhancers associated with neuronal differentiation. Among the ADRN cells that respond to treatment, <jats:italic>MYCN</jats:italic>-amplified cells remain differentiated upon removal of retinoic acid, whereas <jats:italic>MYCN</jats:italic> non-amplified cells revert to an undifferentiated state, allowing for the identification of super-enhancers responsible for maintaining differentiation.

On the one hand, the emergence of composites containing glass fibers has had a significant impact on reducing the weight of structures in various industries. On the other hand, with the advent of 3D printers, many limitations for the geometry of engineering structures were removed. In this research, due to the wide application of these two sciences, a new type of composite absorbers has been introduced. The presented absorbers have glass fiber-reinforced polymer cores (GFRP) or low-density polyethylene cores (LDPE), the shells of each sample are made of PLA or ABS. In this study, 24 different samples were tested under quasi-static loading. The samples were examined in three different groups. In the first group, no cores were used, but in the second group, GFRP cores were used, and in the third group, LDPE cores were used. Triangular, trapezoidal, semielliptical, and square sections were studied, and the results showed that the lowest maximum force was related to samples with semielliptical cross section, then the maximum force increased by changing the cross section from triangular to trapezoidal and then to a square. In addition, the maximum force was higher in the GFRP core than in the LPDE core. </jats:p>",

The AGS total score showed internal consistency and temporal stability when used one month later. Moreover, academic grit was shown to be positively correlated with academic achievement, general grit, and dimensional student engagement. Academic grit also predicted academic achievement after isolating the effects of the related variables (i.e., general grit and student engagement) and overlapping components of academic grit and the related variables. Overall, the Chinese version of the AGS demonstrated adequate reliability and validity and was shown to be a useful tool for examining academic grit in Chinese adolescents. </jats:p>",

While the mechanisms underlying seasonal reproduction and its associated behaviours are well characterized, fewer studies have examined the hormonal basis of non-reproductive social behaviours (e.g. aggression) on a seasonal time scale. Our previous work suggests that the pineal hormone melatonin facilitates a ‘seasonal switch’ in neuroendocrine regulation of aggression in male and female Siberian hamsters (\n            <jats:italic>Phodopus sungorus</jats:italic>\n            ), specifically by acting on the adrenal glands to increase the production of the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) during the short-day (SD) photoperiods of the non-breeding season. Here, we provide evidence that the activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-Δ4 isomerase (3β-HSD), a key enzyme within the steroidogenic pathway that mediates DHEA synthesis and metabolism, varies in a sex-specific and melatonin-dependent manner. Although both male and female hamsters displayed increased aggression in response to SDs and SD-like melatonin, only males showed an increase in adrenal 3β-HSD activity. Conversely, SD and melatonin-treated females exhibited reductions in both adrenal and neural 3β-HSD activity. Collectively, these results suggest a potential role for 3β-HSD in modulating non-breeding aggression and, more broadly, demonstrate how distinct neuroendocrine mechanisms may underlie the same behavioural phenotype in males and females.\n          </jats:p>",

Analysis via powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD) studies and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images confirm the presence of crystalline phases of core/shell Co/CoO with average particle size ≈ 18 nm. Volume fraction (φ) is varied (from 20% to 1%) by the introduction of a stoichiometric amount of non-magnetic amorphous silica matrix (SiO2) which leads to a change in interparticle interaction (separation). The influence of exchange and dipolar interactions on the EB effect, caused by the variation in interparticle interaction (separation) is studied for a series of Co/CoO core/shell nanoparticle systems. Studies of thermal variation of magnetization (M−T) and magnetic hysteresis loops (M−H) for the series point towards strong dependence of magnetic properties on dipolar interaction in concentrated assemblies whereas individual nanoparticle response is dominant in isolated nanoparticle systems. The analysis of the EB effect reveals a monotonic increase of coercivity (HC) and EB field (HE) with increasing volume fraction. When the nanoparticles are close enough and the interparticle interaction is significant, collective behavior leads to an increase in the effective antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO shell thickness which results in high HC and HE. Moreover, in concentrated assemblies, the dipolar field superposes to the local exchange field and enhances the EB effect contributing as an additional source of unidirectional anisotropy.</jats:p>"

Accurate modeling and optimization of its structure is a key part of the SCF structure design process. Due to the drawbacks of traditional numerical simulation methods, such as low speed and large errors, the deep learning-based inverse design of SCFs has become mainstream. However, the advantage of deep learning models over traditional optimization methods relies heavily on large-scale a priori datasets to train the models, a common bottleneck of data-driven methods. This paper presents a comprehensive deep learning model for the efficient inverse design of SCFs. A semi-supervised learning strategy is introduced to alleviate the burden of data acquisition. Taking SCF’s three key optical properties (effective mode area, nonlinear coefficient, and dispersion) as examples, we demonstrate that satisfactory computational results can be obtained based on small-scale training data. The proposed scheme can provide a new and effective platform for data-limited physical computing tasks.</jats:p>"

Our results show that the yield advantages using the land equivalent ratio of the IPs were 44% for rice–maize, 54% for rice–soybean, and 63% for maize–soybean compared to MPs. Rice equivalent yield, maize equivalent yield, and the gross margin under IPs were significantly higher per cycle than under MPs; IPs provided a substantially lower cost of production and of paid workers. Compared to just rice, there were additional net return gains of USD 160 and USD 203 ha−1 per cycle under rice–maize and rice–soybean intercropping. Maize–soybean intercropping resulted in an additional net return gain of USD 153 ha−1 compared to just maize. These results suggest there is considerable potential for small farmers to increase their yields and profits by intercropping in rainfed areas with a wet climate.</jats:p>"

The production of recombinant PV virus-like particles (VLPs), which lack the viral genome offer great potential as next-generation vaccines for the post-polio world. We have previously reported production of PV VLPs using Pichia pastoris, however, these VLPs were in the non-native conformation (C Ag), which would not produce effective protection against PV. Here, we build on this work and show that it is possible to produce wt PV-3 and thermally stabilised PV-3 (referred to as PV-3 SC8) VLPs in the native conformation (D Ag) using Pichia pastoris. We show that the PV-3 SC8 VLPs provide a much-improved D:C antigen ratio as compared to wt PV-3, whilst exhibiting greater thermostability than the current IPV vaccine. Finally, we determine the cryo-EM structure of the yeast-derived PV-3 SC8 VLPs and compare this to previously published PV-3 D Ag structures, highlighting the similarities between these recombinantly expressed VLPs and the infectious virus, further emphasising their potential as a next-generation vaccine candidate for PV</jats:p>"

This is largely due to a lack of existing, systematic, and well-distributed REE and CM samples and analyses in United States sedimentary basins. In addition, the type of sampling and characterization performed to date has generally lacked the resolution and approach required to constrain geologic and geographic heterogeneities typical of subsurface, mineral resources. Here, we describe a robust and systematic method for collecting core scale characterization data that can be applied to studies on the contextual and spatial attributes, the geologic history, and lithostratigraphy of sedimentary basins. The methods were developed using drilled cores from coal bearing sedimentary strata in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming (PRB). The goal of this effort is to create a unified core characterization methodology to guide systematic collection of key data to achieve a foundation of spatially and geologically constrained REEs and CMs. This guidance covers a range of measurement types and methods that are each useful either individually or in combination to support characterization and delineation of REE and CM occurrences. The methods herein, whether used in part or in full, establish a framework to guide consistent acquisition of geological, geochemical, and geospatial datasets that are key to assessing and validating REE and CM occurrences from geologic sources to support future exploration, assessment, and techno-economic related models and analyses.</jats:p>"

A core outcome set (COS) - an agreed minimum set of outcomes to be measured and reported - may address this. International initiatives focus on defining core outcomes assessments across brain tumour types. This protocol describes the development of a COS involving UK stakeholders for use in glioma trials, applicable across glioma types, with provision to identify subsets as required. Due to stakeholder interest in data reported from the patient perspective, outcomes from the COS that can be patient-reported will be identified.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and analysis</jats:title><jats:p>Stage I: (1) trial registry review to identify outcomes collected in glioma trials and (2) systematic review of qualitative literature exploring glioma patient and key stakeholder research priorities. Stage II: semi-structured interviews with glioma patients and caregivers. Outcome lists will be generated from stages I and II. Stage III: study team will remove duplicate items from the outcome lists and ensure accessible terminology for inclusion in the Delphi survey. Stage IV: a two-round Delphi process whereby the outcomes will be rated by key stakeholders. Stage V: a consensus meeting where participants will finalise the COS. The study team will identify the COS outcomes that can be patient-reported. Further research is needed to match patient-reported outcomes to available measures.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Ethics and dissemination</jats:title><jats:p>Ethical approval was obtained (REF SMREC 21/59, Cardiff University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Brain hypoxia remains an Achilles’ heel for public health that must be urgently addressed. Hypoxic damage affects both neurons and glial cells, particularly astrocytes, which are in close dynamic bi-directional communication, and are organized in plastic and tightly regulated networks. However, astroglial networks have received limited attention regarding their influence on the adaptive functional rearrangements of neural networks to oxygen deficiency. Herein, against the background of astrocytic Cx43 gap junction blockade by the selective blocker Gap19, we evaluated the features of spontaneous calcium activity and network characteristics of cells in primary cultures of the cerebral cortex, as well as the expression levels of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 (mGluR2) and 5 (mGluR5) in the early and late periods after simulated hypoxia in vitro. We showed that, under normoxic conditions, blockade of Cx43 leads to an increase in the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR5 and long-term modulation of spontaneous calcium activity in primary cortical cultures, primarily expressed in the restructuring of the functional architectonics of neuron–glial networks through reducing the level of correlation between cells in the network and the percentage of existing correlated connections between cells. Blocking Cx43 during hypoxic injury has a pronounced neuroprotective effect. Together with the increased expression of mGluR5 receptors, a decrease in mGluR2 expression to the physiological level was found, which suggests the triggering of alternative molecular mechanisms of cell adaptation to hypoxia. Importantly, the blockade of Cx43 in hypoxic damage contributed to the maintenance of both the main parameters of the spontaneous calcium activity of primary cortical cultures and the functional architectonics of neuron–glial networks while maintaining the profile of calcium oscillations and calcium signal communications between cells at a highly correlated level. Our results demonstrate the crucial importance of astrocytic networks in functional brain adaptation to hypoxic damage and could be a promising target for the development of rational anti-hypoxic therapy.</jats:p>"

This Letter reports mid-infrared PL measurements on InAs/InGaAs, InAs/AlSb, and InAs/GaSb c/s NWs, together with bare InAs NWs as a reference. Analyses show that the IQE is depressed by a shell coating at 9 K but gets improved by up to approximately 50% for the InGaAs shell coating at 40 –140 K and up to approximately 20% beyond 110 K for the AlSb shell. The effect is ascribed not only to the crystal quality but more importantly to the radial band alignment. The result indicates the high-temperature IQE improvement of the type-I and type-II c/s NWs and the appropriateness of the mid-infrared PL analyses for narrow-gap NW evaluation.</jats:p>",

In this sense, the core stabilization training (CT) has been suggested for patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP), but it is unclear whether it induces EIH. Patients with CNSLBP have neuromotor dysfunctions that can affect the performance of functional tasks, thus, performing functional training (FT) could improve motor control and promote EIH, since functional training uses multi‐joint exercises that aim to improve the functionality of actions performed in daily life. EIH is usually assessed using quantitative sensory tests (QST) such as conditioned pain modulation, pressure pain threshold, and temporal summation. Thus, the sum of parameters from quantitative sensory tests and plasma β‐endorphin would make it possible to understand what the neuroendocrine effects of FT and CT session are. Our study compared the acute effect of CT and FT on the EIH and plasma β‐endorphin release, and correlated plasma β‐endorphin with quantitative sensory testing in patients with CNSLBP. Eighteen women performed two training sessions (CT and FT) with an interval of 48 h between sessions. EIH was assessed by QST and plasma β‐endorphin levels. Results showed that only FT significantly increased plasma β‐endorphin (FT <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01; CT <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.45), which correlated with pain pressure threshold (PPT) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). However, QST values were not different in women with CNSLBP after CT or FT protocols. Plasma β‐endorphin correlated with PPT and CPM, however, the same did not occur with a temporal summation.</jats:p>",

The control is based on a high-order particle swarm optimization algorithm with an improved sliding mode control neural network. Although the sliding mode variable structure control has a certain degree of robustness, because of its own switching characteristics, chattering can occur in the later stage of the trajectory tracking of the manipulator end. Hence, on the basis of the high-order sliding mode control, the homogeneous continuous control law and super-twisting adaptive algorithm were added to further improve the robustness of the system. The radial basis function neural network was used to compensate the errors in the modeling process, and an adaptive law was designed to update the weights of the middle layer of the neural network. Furthermore, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm was established and applied to optimize the parameters of the neural network, which improved the trajectory tracking of the manipulator end. Finally, MATLAB simulation results indicated the validity and superiority of the proposed control method compared with other sliding mode control algorithms.</jats:p>"

The substitution of Cu2+ ions for Mg2+ ions contributed to Al3+ ions preferential occupation of the octahedron and changed the degree of inversion. The quality factor (Qf) value, which is correlated with the degree of inversion, increased to a maximum value at x = 0.04 and then decreased. Ionic polarizability and relative density affected the dielectric constant (εr) value. The temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf) value, which was dominated by the total bond energy, generally shifted to the positive direction.

In this study, we combined glasshouse and field studies to analyse the soil and plant rhizosphere microbiome of cotton plants (<jats:italic>Gossypium hirsutum</jats:italic>) in the presence of a cotton‐specific fungal pathogen, <jats:italic>Fusarium oxysporum</jats:italic> f. sp. <jats:italic>vasinfectum</jats:italic> (FOV). We found that FOV directly and consistently altered the rhizosphere microbiome, but the biocontrol agents enabled microbial assemblages to resist pathogenic stress. Using co‐occurrence network analysis of the core microbiome, we identified the pathobiome comprised of the pathogen and key associate phylotypes in the cotton microbiome. Isolation and application of some negatively correlated pathobiome members provided protection against plant infection. Importantly, our field survey from multiple cotton fields validated the pattern and responses of core microbiomes under FOV infection. This study advances key understanding of core microbiome responses and existence of plant pathobiomes, which provides a novel framework to better manage plant diseases in agriculture and natural settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Identifying the PPR-E+-NUWA-DYW2 editosome improves our understanding of the C-to-U RNA editing in plant organelles. However, the mechanism of RNA editing remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that GLUTAMINE-RICH PROTEIN23 (GRP23), a previously identified nuclear transcription regulator, plays an essential role in mitochondrial RNA editing through interacting with MORF (multiple organellar RNA-editing factor) proteins and atypical DYW-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. GRP23 is targeted to mitochondria, plastids, and nuclei. Analysis of the\n            <jats:italic>grp23</jats:italic>\n            mutants rescued by embryo-specific complementation shows decreased editing efficiency at 352 sites in mitochondria and 6 sites in plastids, with a predominant specificity for sites edited by the PPR-E and PPR-DYW proteins. GRP23 interacts with atypical PPR-DYW proteins (MEF8, MEF8S, DYW2, and DYW4) and MORF proteins (MORF1 and MORF8), whereas the four PPR-DYWs interact with the two MORFs. These interactions may increase the stability of the GRP23-MORF–atypical PPR-DYW complex. Furthermore, analysis of\n            <jats:italic>\n              mef8\n              <jats:sup>N</jats:sup>\n            </jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>△</jats:sup>\n            <jats:italic>\n              <jats:sup>64aa</jats:sup>\n              mef8s\n            </jats:italic>\n            double mutants shows that MEF8/MEF8S are required for the editing of the PPR-E protein–targeted sites in mitochondria. GRP23 could enhance the interaction between PPR-E and MEF8/MEF8S and form a homodimer or heterodimer with NUWA. Genetic complementation analysis shows that the C-terminal domains of GRP23 and NUWA possess a similar function, probably in the interaction with the MORFs. NUWA also interacts with atypical PPR-DYWs in yeast. Both GRP23 and NUWA interact with the atypical PPR-DYWs, suggesting that the PPR-E proteins recruit MEF8/MEF8S, whereas the PPR-E+ proteins specifically recruit DYW2 as the\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            deaminase, and then GRP23, NUWA, and MORFs facilitate and/or stabilize the E or E+-type editosome formation.\n          </jats:p>",

This approach allows for optimal, functional, and controlled cascade-type biotechnological thermal conversion of carbon compounds present in sewage sludge, later in solid digestate residues (after biogas production), and finally in the ash structure (after incineration, purposefully dosed nanostructural additives make the production of a useful solid product possible, especially for cyclic adsorption and slow release of nutrients (N, P, K) in the soil). The idea is generally targeted at achieving an innovative conversion cycle under a Circular Economy framework. In particular, it is based on an energy carrier (methane biogas) and direct energy production. The functionalized combustion by-products can be advantageous in agriculture. The use of ashes with nanostructural additives (halloysite, kaolinite) from combustion of sewage sludge after the anaerobic fermentation as an adsorbent of selected nutrients important in agriculture (Na+, K+, NO3−, SO42−, PO43−, Cl−) was verified at laboratory scale. The tests were carried out both for pure ash and for the ash derived from combustion with the purposeful addition of kaolinite or halloysite. The equilibrium conditions for nitrate, potassium, sodium, phosphate(V), sulphate(VI), and chloride ions from aqueous solutions with the use of the three adsorbent structures were determined. The obtained innovative results were interpreted theoretically with adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Jovanović). The most spectacular and clearly favorable results related to the influence of nanostructural additives in the process of sludge combustion, and formation of sorption surfaces under high temperature conditions were identified in the case of sorption-based separation of phosphate(V) ions (an increase from 1.13% to 61.24% with the addition of kaolinite, and even up to 76.19% with addition of halloysite).</jats:p>"

As an example, a double ARLGM based on a partially polyimide (PI)-coated HCF structure for the simultaneous measurement of relative humidity (RH) and temperature is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally.

Hence, the proposed sensor structure can be used as an RH sensor that is also capable of compensating for local temperature fluctuations. More importantly, the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters (such as biomarkers) is possible using the proposed method provided the proper sensing materials are partially coated onto the HCF surface.</jats:p>",

Most of the variants of concern have mutations in this area, which could reduce the efficacy of existing antibodies. In contrast, N‐glycosylation sites are relatively invariant, and some are essential for infection. Here, we observed that the S proteins of the ancestral (Wuhan) and Omicron strains bind with <jats:italic>Pholiota squarrosa</jats:italic> lectin (PhoSL), a 40‐amino‐acid chemically synthesised peptide specific to core‐fucosylated N‐glycans. The affinities were at a low nanomolar level, which were ~ 1000‐fold stronger than those between PhoSL and the core‐fucosylated N‐glycans at the micromolar level. We demonstrated that PhoSL inhibited infection by both strains at similar submicromolar levels, suggesting its broad‐spectrum effect on SARS‐CoV‐2 variants. Cryogenic electron microscopy revealed that PhoSL caused an aggregation of the S protein, which was likely due to the multivalence of both the trimeric PhoSL and S protein. This characteristic is likely relevant to the inhibitory mechanism. Structural modelling of the PhoSL–S protein complex indicated that PhoSL was in contact with the amino acids of the S protein, which explains the enhanced affinity with S protein and also indicates the significant potential for developing specific binders by the engineering of PhoSL.</jats:p>",

All patients were followed up for 3 years or until the occurrence of death. Characteristics of CHM users and risk of all-cause mortality were assessed, and core CHMs with potential pharmacologic pathways were explored. Among 1618 patients, clinical features of CHM users (88) and nonusers (1530) were similar except for lower serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) and higher serum albumin levels in CHM users. CHM users had significantly higher 3 year overall survival rates (15.0% vs. 9.7%) and 3 year liver-specific survival rates (13.4% vs. 10.7%), about 3 months longer median survival time, and lower risk of all-cause mortality. Core CHMs were discovered from the prescriptions, including Hedyotis diffusa Willd combined with Scutellaria barbata D.Don, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge., Curcuma longa L., Rheum palmatum L., and Astragalus mongholicus Bunge.

However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations, collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pools, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Finally, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans. Together, the data provide novel insights into the origin and impact of basal cell heterogeneity on the establishment of regionally distinct responses of the airway epithelium during injury-repair and in disease conditions.</jats:p>"

Additionally, calculations based on the fundamental principles of Density Functional Theory (DFT) were employed to simulate inhibitor–iron interactions. Experimental results indicated that investigated inhibitors can significantly enhance the corrosion resistance of CS, reaching a performance of 95% and 87% at 5 × 10−3 mol/L of MeOTZ and MeTZD, respectively. According to gravimetric and electrochemical experiments, inhibitor molecules obstruct corrosion reactions by adhering to the CS surface, which follows the Langmuir isotherm model. On the other hand, the morphological analysis showed a well-distinguished difference between unprotected and protected CS surfaces as a result of the inhibitors’ addition to HCl.

Thus, technological variability has been the centrepiece on this debate. However, the variability of lithic assemblages cannot be correctly interpreted without understanding site occupational models and function and considering that individual tools represent specific discard moments in a continuous reduction process. In Europe, the earliest technological record is represented by the scarce and scattered Mode 1 technologies, often deriving from occasional occupations or restricted activity areas yielding unrepresentative assemblages. In this paper, we approach the technological behaviours exhibited by Lower Palaeolithic hominins from the subunit TD6.2 of the Gran Dolina site (Atapuerca, Burgos) by including the perspective of reduction intensity studies on the analysis of technological variability. Gran Dolina TD6.2 is a unique and extremely significant archaeological context, as it represents the oldest multi-layered unit of domestic hominin occupations in the Early Pleistocene of Europe. We use the Volumetric Reconstruction Method (VRM) to estimate the original volume of the blanks and quantify the reduction intensity of each core individually to characterise the reduction distribution patterns using Weibull probability distribution functions. Our results suggest differential raw material management in terms of reduction intensity, according to the characteristics of each lithology. This could reflect a solid understanding of raw material qualities and a certain degree of planning. Altogether, the continuity between knapping strategies through reduction denotes constant adaptation to raw material constraints as well as particular knapping conditions, rather than specific compartmentalised mental schemes. In conclusion,<jats:italic>Homo antecessor</jats:italic>toolmakers would have been situational knappers whose technological behaviour would be highly adaptive. This research constitutes the first reduction approach for the European Early Pleistocene assemblages that will lead to a referential framework for other European Early Pleistocene sites.</jats:p>",

The basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) plays a central role in regulating thermomorphogenetic hypocotyl elongation in various plant species, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Although it is well known that PIF4 and its co-activator HEMERA (HMR) promote plant thermosensory growth by activating genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of the phytohormone auxin, the detailed molecular mechanism of such transcriptional activation is not clear. In this report, we investigated the role of the Mediator complex in the PIF4/HMR-mediated thermoresponsive gene expression. Through the characterization of various mutants of the Mediator complex, a tail subunit named MED14 was identified as an essential factor for thermomorphogenetic hypocotyl growth. MED14 was required for the thermal induction of PIF4 target genes but had a marginal effect on the levels of PIF4 and HMR. Further transcriptomic analyses confirmed that the expression of numerous PIF4/HMR-dependent, auxin-related genes required MED14 at warm temperatures. Moreover, PIF4 and HMR physically interacted with MED14 and both were indispensable for the association of MED14 with the promoters of these thermoresponsive genes. While PIF4 did not regulate MED14 levels, HMR was required for the transcript abundance of MED14. Taken together, these results unveil an important thermomorphogenetic mechanism, in which PIF4 and HMR recruit the Mediator complex to activate auxin-related growth-promoting genes when plants sense moderate increases in ambient temperature.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this pilot study was to measure a mixture of phthalates and volatile organic compounds in nail salons in the Greater New York City area, and to characterize work-related determinants of indoor air quality in these nail salons. Working with four Asian nail salon organizations in the Greater New York City area, we measured indoor air phthalates and volatile organic compounds at 20 nail salons from February to May 2021 using silicone wristbands and passive samplers, respectively. Nail salon characteristics were also examined. We measured six phthalates and 31 volatile organic compounds. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and Diethyl phthalate had the highest concentrations among the six phthalates measured. Concentrations of toluene, d-limonene, methyl methacrylate, and ethyl methacrylate were higher than that of the rest. Manicure/pedicure tables, the number of customers per day, and application of artificial nail (acrylic) services were positively associated with the levels of phthalates and volatile organic compounds. Given the large number of people employed in the nail industry and the even larger number of customers visiting such establishments, exposures to these toxic chemicals are likely to be widespread.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, studies aiming to identify the mechanism of these sequelae are limited due to the biosafety level 4 (BSL4) requirements of LASV itself. ML29, a reassortant virus proposed as an experimental vaccine candidate against LASV, is potentially an ideal surrogate model of LF in STAT1-/- mice due to similar phenotype in these animals. We intended to better characterize ML29 pathogenesis and potential sequelae in this animal model. Our results indicate that while both CD4 and CD8 T cells are responsible for acute disease in ML29 infection, ML29 induces significant hearing loss in a mechanism independent of either CD4 or CD8 T cells.

Therefore, many drug delivery methods are being developed. The use of nanotechnology is one of the most promising methods. The use of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as antitumor agents makes it possible to prevent off-target cytotoxicity and other side effects of traditional chemotherapy. The use of nanoparticles is limited by their low efficiency. the Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/Fe galvanic couple makes it possible to control the release of toxic iron ions and, accordingly, the activity of nanoparticles. <jats:bold>Purpose</jats:bold>.

Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-Fe nanoparticles were obtained by electric explosion of an iron wire in a mixture of gases: argon and oxygen. The mass fraction of the components was regulated by varying the ratio of the components of the gas mixture. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were studied using X-ray phase analysis, thermal desorption of nitrogen, transmission electron microscopy, and microelectrophoresis. Antitumor activity was studied using the MTT test against HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. As a result of the electric explosion of an iron wire in an argon + oxygen gas mixture containing oxygen in the range of 1 – 5 vol. %, Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-Fe NPs with 5 – 90 % wt.

The study of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles showed that the zeta potential does not depend on the content of Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> in NPs and is -30 mV. The change in the specific surface area and the average particle size passes through a maximum at the content of Fe<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> W=20 %, which can be explained by the mechanism of oxide phase formation during an electric explosion. Using the MTT test, it was found that nanoparticles containing 5 wt.

Herein, the magnetic Fe3O4-Au@Ag@(Au@Ag) nanocomposites (CSSN NCs) have been prepared by self-assembly method and applied for ultra-sensitive surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) detection of BPA. A simple and rapid coupling reaction of Pauly’s reagents and BPA not only solved the problem of poor affinity between BPA and noble metals, but also provided the SERRS activity of BPA azo products. The distribution of hot spots and the influence of incremental introduction of noble metals on the performance of SERRS were analyzed by a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. The abundance of hot spots generated by core–shell–satellite structure and outstanding SERRS performance of Au@Ag nanocrystals were responsible for excellent SERRS sensitivity of CSSN NCs in the results. The limit of detection (LOD) of CSSN NCs for BPA azo products was as low as 10−10 M. In addition, the saturation magnetization (Ms) value of CSSN NCs was 53.6 emu·g−1, which could be rapidly enriched and collected under the condition of external magnetic field. These magnetic core–shell–satellite NCs provide inspiration idea for the tailored design of ultra-sensitive SERRS substrates, and thus exhibit limitless application prospects in terms of pollutant detection, environmental monitoring, and food safety.</jats:p>"

However, applications of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs are limited by rapid loss of mature cellular function in culture. We hypothesized that changes in autophagy impact the phenotype and cellular proliferation of iPSC-ECs. Endothelial cells were differentiated from distinct induced pluripotent stem cell lines in 2D culture and purified for CD144 positive cells. Autophagy, mitochondrial morphology, and proliferation were characterized during differentiation and over serial passages in culture. We found that autophagy activity was stimulated during differentiation but stagnated in mature iPSC-ECs. Mitochondria remodeled through mitophagy during differentiation and demonstrated increasing membrane potential and mass through serial passages; however, these plateaued, coinciding with decreased proliferation. To evaluate for oxidative damage, iPSC-ECs were alternatively grown under hypoxic culture conditions; however, hypoxia only transiently improved the proliferation. Stimulating mTOR-independent ULK1-mediated autophagy with a plant derivative AMP kinase activator Rg2 significantly improved proliferative capacity of iPSC-ECs over multiple passages. Therefore, autophagy, a known mediator of longevity, played an active role in remodeling mitochondria during maturation from pluripotency to a terminally differentiated state. Autophagy failed to compensate for increasing mitochondrial mass over serial passages, which correlated with loss of proliferation in iPSC-ECs. Stimulating ULK1-kinase-driven autophagy conferred improved proliferation and longevity over multiple passages in culture. This represents a novel approach to overcoming a major barrier limiting the use of iPSC-ECs for clinical and research applications.</jats:p>",

The pig is a physiologically relevant model species for studying human neurological disorders, many of which are associated with microglial dysfunction. Furthermore, pigs are an important agricultural species, and there is a need to understand how microglial function affects their welfare. As a basis for improved understanding to enhance biomedical and agricultural research, we sought to characterize pig microglial identity at genome‐wide scale and conduct inter‐species comparisons. We isolated pig hippocampal tissue and microglia from frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, as well as alveolar macrophages from the lungs and conducted RNA‐sequencing (RNAseq). By comparing the transcriptomic profiles between microglia, macrophages, and hippocampal tissue, we derived a set of 239 highly enriched genes defining the porcine core microglial signature. We found brain regional heterogeneity based on 150 genes showing significant (adjusted <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) regional variations and that cerebellar microglia were most distinct. We compared normalized gene expression for microglia from human, mice and pigs using microglia signature gene lists derived from each species and demonstrated that a core microglial marker gene signature is conserved across species, but that species‐specific expression subsets also exist. Our data provide a valuable resource defining the pig microglial transcriptome signature that validates and highlights pigs as a useful large animal species bridging between rodents and humans in which to study the role of microglia during homeostasis and disease.</jats:p>",

Nr4a1-GFP reporter mice were injected with PBS for control or RRV within 24 h of delivery to induce perinatal liver inflammation.

Our results demonstrate that non-classical monocytes in the neonatal liver exhibit the highest mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Nr4a1 (Ly6CLo MFI 6344 vs. neutrophils 3611 p &lt; 0.001; macrophages 2782; p &lt; 0.001; and Ly6CHi classical monocytes 4485; p &lt; 0.0002). During inflammation, hepatic Ly6CLo non-classical monocytes showed a significant increase in Nr4a1 expression intensity from 6344 to 7600 (p = 0.012), while Nr4a1 expression remained unchanged on the other myeloid populations.

However, a fine control of nano-systems’ morphology permitting the synthesis of a single magnetic core with controlled position of the sensor presents a main challenge. We report here the design of new iron oxide core–silica shell nano-objects containing luminescent Tb3+/Eu3+-(acetylacetonate) moieties covalently anchored to the silica surface, which act as a promising heater/thermometer system. They present a single magnetic core and a controlled thickness of the silica shell, permitting a uniform spatial distribution of the emissive nanothermometer relative to the heat source. These nanoparticles exhibit the Tb3+ and Eu3+ characteristic emissions and suitable magnetic properties that make them efficient as a nanoheater with a Ln3+-based emissive self-referencing temperature sensor covalently coupled to it. Heating capacity under an alternating current magnetic field was demonstrated by thermal imaging. This system offers a new strategy permitting a rapid heating of a solution under an applied magnetic field and a local self-referencing temperature sensing with excellent thermal sensitivity (1.64%·K−1 (at 40 °C)) in the range 25–70 °C, good photostability, and reproducibility after several heating cycles.</jats:p>"

Thus, increasing the ceramide content in tumor cells is likely to increase their sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy. Aerobic exercise has been shown to modulate ceramide metabolism in healthy tissue, but the relationship between exercise and ceramide in tumors has not been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that aerobic exercise causes tumor cell apoptosis and accumulation of pro-apoptotic ceramides in B16F10 but not BP melanoma models using mice. B16F10 tumor-bearing mice were treated with two weeks of moderate treadmill exercise, or were control, unexercised mice. A reverse-phase protein array was used to identify canonical p53 apoptotic signaling as a key pathway upregulated by exercise, and we demonstrate increased apoptosis in tumors from exercised mice. Consistent with this finding, pro-apoptotic C16-ceramide, and the ceramide generating enzyme ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6), were higher in B16F10 tumors from exercised mice, while pro-survival sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) was lower. These data suggest that exercise contributes to B16F10 tumor cell death, possibly by modulating ceramide metabolism toward a pro-apoptotic ceramide/sphingosine-1-phosphate balance. However, these results are not consistent in BP tumors, demonstrating that exercise can have different effects on tumors of different patient or mouse origin with the same diagnosis. This work indicates that exercise might be most effective as a therapeutic adjuvant with therapies that kill tumor cells in a ceramide-dependent manner.</jats:p>"

However, how these mutations affect PLD self-assembly properties has remained elusive. In this study, we uncovered the implicit pathogenic structures caused by the mutations. NMR analysis indicated that the dynamic structures of the PLD are synergistically determined by the physicochemical properties of amino acids in units of five residues. Molecular dynamics simulations and three-dimensional electron crystallography, together with biochemical assays, revealed that the WDM mutation E384K attenuated the sticky properties, whereas the ALS mutations P362L and A381T enhanced the self-assembly by inducing β-sheet interactions and highly condensed assembly, respectively.

The origination of the smoke is estimated by the means of the HYSPLIT dispersion model, taking into account the location of the fires and the injection height for each fire. Consequently, for each fire location, the associated land cover type is acquired by satellite-derived land cover products. We explore the relationship between the measured intensive parameters of the smoke layers and the respective land cover of the burned area. The vegetation type for the cases we analyzed was either broadleaf crops or grasses/cereals. Overall, the intensive parameters are similar for the two types, which can be associated with the fact that both types belong to the broader group of agricultural crops.

In this paper, a high-security SCMA-OFDM multi-core fiber transmission system based on a regular hexagonal chaotic codebook is proposed for next-generation passive optical network (PON). The whole encryption process consists of a regular hexagon chaotic codebook design and frequency domain block scrambling. In designing the regular hexagon chaotic codebook, the optimization of constellation points on orthogonal resources are considered as the starting point. Firstly, the chaos factor generated by the four-dimensional <jats:italic>Rossler</jats:italic> chaos model is deployed to disturb the mother constellation, and then the corresponding chaotic book is formed by rotating the mother constellation and multiplying the sparse matrix. The designed codebook logically avoids the degradation of transmission performance caused by the rough scrambling of codebook constellation, to find a balance between codebook disturbance and bit error rate (BER). The security and reliability of the transmission system have been verified by performing 42 Gb/s encrypted SCMA-OFDM data transmission experiments in a 2km multi-core fiber. The key space of the encryption scheme can reach 10<jats:sup>178</jats:sup>, which effectively ensures the security of the transmission system. Furthermore, the performance of the transmission system with a regular hexagon chaotic codebook is improved by 2.5 dB compared with the traditional codebook when the BER is 1 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. Moreover, the SCMA-OFDM-based transmission architecture and the detection effects of different multi-user detection algorithms in the SCMA-OFDM multi-core fiber transmission system are also studied.</jats:p>",

Electrospun materials have been intensively studied as the next generation of skin wound dressing mainly due to their high surface area and fibrous porosity. However, the electrospinning of collagen‐based solutions causes degradation of its structure. In this work, a coaxial electrospinning process was proposed to overcome this limitation. The production of mats of polycaprolactone (PCL)–Col_1/PVA (collagen/poly(vinyl alcohol)) composed of core‐shell nanofibers was investigated. PCL solution was used as the core solution, while Col_1/PVA was used as the shell solution. PVA was used to improve the processability of collagen, while PCL was employed to improve the mechanical properties and morphology of Col_1/PVA fibers. The morphology and the cytotoxicity of the fibers were highly dependent on the processing parameters. Defect‐free core‐shell nanofibers were obtained with a shell/core flow rates ratio = 4, flight distance of 12 cm, and an applied voltage of 16 kV. Using this strategy, the triple helix structure characteristic of the collagen molecule was preserved. Moreover, the common post‐processing of solvent removal could be suppressed, simplifying the manufacturing processing of these biomaterials. The nanostructured mats showed no cytotoxicity, high liquid absorption, structural stability, hydrophilic character, and collagen release capacity, making them a potential novel dressing for skin damage regeneration, in special in the case of chronic wounds treatment, in which exogenous collagen delivery is necessary.</jats:p>",

This enables a higher SDM capacity at longer fiber lengths in the proposed seven-core PCSF if compared with previously proposed angular division multiplexing (ADM) in single-core (SC) PCSF. As a result, the SDM is not limited to short fiber lengths in the proposed seven-core PCSF, as it is in the case of the ADM channels due to mode coupling in the SC PCSF. In addition, the time-independent power flow equation (TI PFE) is used to analyze the effect of the width of the launch beam distribution on the equilibrium mode distribution (EMD) and steady state distribution (SSD) in each of the seven cores of the investigated PCSF. The width of the launch beam distribution has a considerable impact on the fiber length at which the EMD and SSD are attained, according to our numerical results. Thus, by decreasing the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the launch beam distribution from 20 to 2°, the length at which EMD is established increases from Lc = 1020 to 1250 m, and the length at which SSD is attained increases from zs = 2650 to 3250 m. A narrow launch beam distribution leads to higher bandwidth at small and intermediate fiber lengths. On the other hand, at shorter fiber lengths, a wider launch beam distribution induces a bandwidth change from 1/z proportional to 1/z1/2 proportional curve, e.g., a slower bandwidth reduction. When building a multicore optical fiber transmission system for SDM, such characterization of multicore PCSFs under various launch conditions should be taken into account.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Here we present a newly developed ice core gas-phase proxy that directly samples a component of the large-scale atmospheric circulation: synoptic-scale pressure variability. Surface pressure variability weakly disrupts gravitational isotopic settling in the firn layer, which is recorded in krypton-86 excess (86Krxs). We validate 86Krxs using late Holocene ice samples from eleven Antarctic and one Greenland ice core that collectively represent a wide range of surface pressure variability in the modern climate. We find a strong correlation (r = -0.94, p &lt; 0.01) between site-average 86Krxs and site synoptic variability from reanalysis data. The main uncertainties in the method are the corrections for gas loss and thermal fractionation, and the relatively large scatter in the data. We show 86Krxs is linked to the position of the eddy-driven subpolar jet (SPJ), with a southern position enhancing pressure variability. We present a 86Krxs record covering the last 24 ka from the WAIS Divide ice core. West Antarctic synoptic activity is slightly below modern levels during the last glacial maximum (LGM); increases during the Heinrich Stadial 1 and Younger Dryas North Atlantic cold periods; weakens abruptly at the Holocene onset; remains low during the early and mid-Holocene, and gradually increases to its modern value. The WAIS Divide 86Krxs record resembles records of monsoon intensity thought to reflect changes in the meridional position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) on orbital and millennial timescales, such that West Antarctic storminess is weaker when the ITCZ is displaced northward, and stronger when it is displaced southward. We interpret variations in synoptic activity as reflecting movement of the South Pacific SPJ in parallel to the ITCZ migrations, which is the expected zonal-mean response of the eddy-driven jet in models and proxy data. Past changes to Pacific climate and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may amplify the signal of the SPJ migration. Our interpretation is broadly consistent with opal flux records from the Pacific Antarctic zone thought to reflect wind-driven upwelling. We emphasize that 86Krxs is a new proxy, and more work is called for to confirm, replicate and better understand these results; until such time, our conclusions regarding past atmospheric dynamics remain tentative. Current scientific understanding of firn air transport and trapping is insufficient to explain all the observed variations in 86Krxs.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent development of prime editing (PE) genome engineering technologies has the potential to significantly simplify the generation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based disease models. PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson’s disease in hPSCs.</jats:p>"

To quantify the uniformity of the liquid–liquid process, the specific surface area ratio is proposed and studied through computational fluid dynamics simulation. There is a scale effect in the liquid–liquid two phase chemical processing that the specific surface area ratio decreases to 7.01% when the diameter of the Y-like mixer increases from 1 mm to 10 mm. A millimeter-scale mixer with a fan-notched baffle structure was designed, and the baffle unit length, baffle tilt angle, baffle notch size and baffle thickness of the mixer were optimized. Compared with the 1 mm Y-like mixer, the specific surface area ratio of the 10 mm mixer with notched baffle structures increases to 2.5 times and the treatment capacity increases to 100 times. Additionally, experiment and simulation results prove that FNBS is considered to be a suitable structure for enhancing liquid-liquid two-phase. This study will provide a useful reference for the design of large-scale mixers applicable to liquid-liquid heterogeneous chemical processes.</jats:p>",

Adjusted hazard ratios for first arterial thrombosis after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with no COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 21.7 (95% CI, 21.0–22.4) in week 1 after COVID-19 diagnosis to 1.34 (95% CI, 1.21–1.48) during weeks 27 to 49.

Six volunteers are involved in the experiment, and the results verify that the rehabilitation robot can ensure the completion of natural track in sit-to-stand training and improve the joint torque.

Here, the prism(s) is used to suppress the angular dispersion and transform it into spatial chirp, while the HCF is used for removing this spatial chirp and the residual angular dispersion, which can also significantly improve the beam quality. The feasibility of this novel method is numerically and experimentally investigated with the ultra-broadband idler pulses centered at 1250 nm wavelength and generated by an LBO crystal based non-collinear optical parametric amplifier. The proof-of-principle experiment shows that the angular dispersion can be effectively removed and ultra-broadband idler pulses with good spectral quality and spatial profile can be obtained. The total transmission efficiency in the experiment is around 67% and the measured <jats:inline-formula>\n      <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\">\n\t<mml:msubsup>\n\t  <mml:mi>M</mml:mi>\n\t  <mml:mi>x</mml:mi>\n\t  <mml:mn>2</mml:mn>\n\t</mml:msubsup>\n      </mml:math>\n    </jats:inline-formula> and <jats:inline-formula>\n      <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\">\n\t<mml:msubsup>\n\t  <mml:mi>M</mml:mi>\n\t  <mml:mi>y</mml:mi>\n\t  <mml:mn>2</mml:mn>\n\t</mml:msubsup>\n      </mml:math>\n    </jats:inline-formula> can reach 1.12 and 1.04, respectively.

Moreover, based on immune and inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, macrophages could also play an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms. In order to provide a more in-depth insight into SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in marine mammals, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and the expression of ACE2 and the pan-macrophage marker CD68. Aliquots of tissue samples, belonging to cetaceans stranded along the Italian coastline during 2020-2021, were collected for SARS-CoV-2 analysis by real-time PCR (RT-PCRT) (N = 43) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (N = 59); thirty-two aliquots of pulmonary tissue sample (N = 17 Tursiops truncatus, N = 15 Stenella coeruleoalba) available at the Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (MMMTB) of the University of Padua (Legnaro, Padua, Italy) were analyzed to investigate ACE2 expression by IHC. In addition, ACE2 and CD68 were also investigated by Double-Labeling Immunofluorescence (IF) Confocal Laser Microscopy. No SARS-CoV-2 positivity was found in samples analyzed for the survey while ACE2 protein was detected in the lower respiratory tract albeit heterogeneously for age, gender/sex, and species, suggesting that ACE2 expression can vary between different lung regions and among individuals. Finally, double IF analysis showed elevated colocalization of ACE2 and CD68 in macrophages only when an evident inflammatory reaction was present, such as in human SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p>"

We describe heterozygous point variants in ATP6V0C, encoding the c-subunit in the membrane bound integral domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, in 27 patients with neurodevelopmental abnormalities with or without epilepsy. Corpus callosum hypoplasia and cardiac abnormalities were also present in some patients. In silico modelling suggested that the patient variants interfere with the interactions between the ATP6V0C and ATP6V0A subunits during ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with decreased vacuolar H+-ATPase activity, functional analyses conducted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed reduced LysoSensor fluorescence and reduced growth in media containing varying concentrations of CaCl2. Knockdown of ATP6V0C in Drosophila resulted in increased duration of seizure-like behaviour, and the expression of selected patient variants in Caenorhabditis elegans led to reduced growth, motor dysfunction and reduced lifespan. In summary, this study establishes ATP6V0C as an important disease gene, describes the clinical features of the associated neurodevelopmental disorder and provides insight into disease mechanisms.</jats:p>",

The aim of this work was to generate murine models that show high-risk features including multifocal tumors, vascular invasion, metastasis, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). HepT1 cells were injected into the livers or tail veins of mice, and tumor growth was monitored with magnetic resonance and bioluminescent imaging. Blood was analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting to identify CTCs. Intra- and extra-hepatic tumor samples were harvested for immunohistochemistry and RNA and DNA sequencing. Cell lines were grown from tumor samples and profiled with RNA sequencing. With intrahepatic injection of HepT1 cells, 100% of animals grew liver tumors and showed vascular invasion, metastasis, and CTCs. Mutation profiling revealed genetic alterations in seven cancer-related genes, while transcriptomic analyses showed changes in gene expression with cells that invade vessels. Tail vein injection of HepT1 cells resulted in multifocal, metastatic disease. These unique models will facilitate further meaningful studies of high-risk HB.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.</jats:p>",

To address these questions, we characterized the evolution of indel SVs using genome assemblies of three closely related<jats:italic>Heliconius</jats:italic>butterfly species. Over the relatively short evolutionary timescales investigated, up to 18.0% of the genome was composed of indels between two haplotypes of an individual<jats:italic>Heliconius charithonia</jats:italic>butterfly and up to 62.7% included lineage-specific SVs between the genomes of the most distant species (11 Mya). Lineage-specific sequences were mostly characterized as transposable elements (TEs) inserted at random throughout the genome and their overall distribution was similarly affected by linked selection as single nucleotide substitutions. Using chromatin accessibility profiles (i.e., ATAC-seq) of head tissue in caterpillars to identify sequences with potential<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>-regulatory function, we found that out of the 31,066 identified differences in chromatin accessibility between species, 30.4% were within lineage-specific SVs and 9.4% were characterized as TE insertions. These TE insertions were localized closer to gene transcription start sites than expected at random and were enriched for sites with significant resemblance to several transcription factor binding sites with known function in neuron development in<jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>. We also identified 24 TE insertions with head-specific chromatin accessibility. Our results show high rates of structural genome evolution that were previously overlooked in comparative genomic studies and suggest a high potential for structural variation to serve as raw material for adaptive evolution.</jats:p>",

We aimed to assess the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy versus placebo on maternal and fetal lipids. Main inclusion criteria were: women &lt;20 weeks’ gestation, BMI ≥ 29 kg/m2. Eligible women (n = 154) were randomized to receive vitamin D3 (1600 IU/day) or placebo. Assessments were performed &lt;20, 24–28 and 35–37 weeks and at birth. Linear regression models were used to assess effects of vitamin D on maternal and cord blood lipids. In the vitamin D group significantly higher total 25-OHD and 25-OHD3 levels were found in maternal and cord blood compared with placebo. Adjusted regression models did not reveal any differences in triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, free fatty acids, ketone bodies or leptin between groups. Neonatal sum of skinfolds was comparable between the two groups, but correlated positively with cord blood 25-OH-D3 (r = 0.34, p = 0.012). Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy increases maternal and cord blood vitamin D significantly resulting in high rates of vitamin D sufficiency. Maternal and cord blood lipid parameters were unaffected by Vitamin D3 supplementation.</jats:p>"

Here, we developed a somatic CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to study 215 recurrent “long-tail” breast cancer genes, which revealed epigenetic regulation as a major tumor-suppressive mechanism. We report that components of the BAP1 and COMPASS-like complexes, including KMT2C/D, KDM6A, BAP1, and ASXL1/2 (“EpiDrivers”), cooperate with PIK3CAH1047R to transform mouse and human breast epithelial cells. Mechanistically, we find that activation of PIK3CAH1047R and concomitant EpiDriver loss triggered an alveolar-like lineage conversion of basal mammary epithelial cells and accelerated formation of luminal-like tumors, suggesting a basal origin for luminal tumors. EpiDriver mutations are found in ∼39% of human breast cancers, and ∼50% of ductal carcinoma in situ express casein, suggesting that lineage infidelity and alveogenic mimicry may significantly contribute to early steps of breast cancer etiology.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Infrequently mutated genes comprise most of the mutational burden in breast tumors but are poorly understood.

Assessing these alterations has become a topic of increasing interest. However, a few studies have examined different stages of AD from a complex network perspective that cover different topological scales. This study used resting state fMRI data to analyze the trend of functional connectivity alterations from a cognitively normal (CN) state through early and late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI and LMCI) and to Alzheimer’s disease. The analyses had been done at the local (hubs and activated links and areas), meso (clustering, assortativity, and rich-club), and global (small-world, small-worldness, and efficiency) topological scales. The results showed that the trends of changes in the topological architecture of the functional brain network were not entirely proportional to the AD progression. There were network characteristics that have changed non-linearly regarding the disease progression, especially at the earliest stage of the disease, i.e., EMCI. Further, it has been indicated that the diseased groups engaged somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default mode modules compared to the CN group. The diseased groups also shifted the functional network towards more random architecture. In the end, the methods introduced in this paper enable us to gain an extensive understanding of the pathological changes of the AD process.</jats:p>"
