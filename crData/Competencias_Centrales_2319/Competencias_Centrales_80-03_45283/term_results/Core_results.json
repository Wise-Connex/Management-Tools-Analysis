A rod-shaped molecular core was utilized to describe the molecular shape. The potential parameters were determined from the observed lattice constant and heat of sublimation at P=0 bar. The calculated libration frequencies at P=0 bar for either n=12 or n=9 models were in good agreement with observed Raman and neutron data. The crystal energies and the libration frequencies at high pressures were computed to obtain, respectively, the P–V relation and the Grüneisen parameters associated with the k=0 modes. Good agreement of the calculated Grüneisen parameters with observed data was attained for the n=9 models. The calculated P–V relation should be compared with experimental data which is not currently available.</jats:p>",

Thus, although the remaining core-particles were inactive in both the puromycin reaction and in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, activity was restored when they were combined with either homologous or heterologous split-protein fractions. This technique was used to prepare active hybrid L-subparticles, e.g. rabbit cores/N. crassa split-proteins, and also active hybrid ribosomes, e.g. rabbit smaller subparticle/X. laevis core-particle/rabbit split-proteins. Rabbit and X. laevis split-protein fractions labelled with 14C by reductive methylation with [14C]formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride were both shown to bind to rabbit core-particles in approximate correlation with the degree of re-activation. The split-protein fractions of rabbit and X. laevis L-subparticles were analysed by two-dimensional and sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights (measured in sodium dodecyl sulphate gels) of the split-proteins of rabbit and X. laevis L-subparticles were found to be similar. These results demonstrate that the peptidyltransferase active centre of cytoplasmic ribosomes of eukaryotes has components that are interchangeable over a wide evolutionary range. Evidently the essential molecular architecture of the active centre is highly conserved.</jats:p>",

An essentially linear relationship was found between the frequency of observation and line‐width for the single broad envelope of <jats:sup>31</jats:sup>P resonances of the DNA in the nucleosome cores. We attributed this largely to chemical shift dispersion, with smaller contributions from chemical shift anisotropy and dipolar broadening. These results suggest the presence of different environments for phosphorus atoms in the core particles. However, within the accuracy of the method, no asymmetry in the resonance could be detected, which would tend to rule out any significant degree of DNA “kinking.” To investigate the interactions of the DNA and histones within the core particles we also studied transitions induced by urea and by temperature. Urea caused two stepwise increases in linewidth, which we attributed to conformational changes. A biphasic transition was also observed in the temperature profile, consistent with previous optical studies [Weischet et. al. (1978) <jats:italic>Nucleic Acids Res.</jats:italic> <jats:bold>5</jats:bold>, 139]. Various models with different types of local mobility were examined by the relaxation theory.

The calculations show that they do not. This result is opposite to the predictions of Fontaine and Haasen and the conclusions of Belzner and Granzer. The results are generated with the same point‐ion model (PIM) potential employed by Belzner and Granzer, plus a breathing shell model (BSM) potential due to Corish, Parker, and Jacobs. Core properties such as the stable symmetry type, the strain energy, and the Peierls stress are determined. Both potentials produce an approximately sinusoidally shaped Peierls barrier with a periodicity of one Burgers vector. The PIM and BSM potentials yield Peierls stresses of 80 and 17.3 MPa, respectively. Comparison of these results with low‐temperature flow stress data suggests that the BSM result is consistent with the experimental data whereas the PIM result is not.</jats:p>",
