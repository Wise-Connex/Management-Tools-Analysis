Participants had nonmydriatic, 45-degree, single-field digital retinal photographs taken on site (Digital Retinal System, Centervue). Following retinal imaging, participants then completed a survey about barriers to regular eye care and their acceptance of potential interventions to promote screening. Digital retinal photographs were interpreted remotely by a board-certified ophthalmologist and communicated to participants’ primary care physician and/or endocrinologist.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Over the study period, 275 ED patients had a documented diagnosis of diabetes, of whom 167 were deemed clinically stable for the study and 141 were invited to participate. Sixty-four were enrolled, of whom 50 had gradable-quality fundus images (78%). Of these 50 patients, almost all had type 2 diabetes (47, 94%), with an average disease duration of 12 ± 9 years and mean hemoglobin A1c of 8.1 ± 2.0% (mmol/mol). Based on fundus photography, 14 patients (28%) were diagnosed with DR, which was newly diagnosed for 10 (20% of the total study population). Severity was most commonly mild or moderate (12/14, 86%), with 1 case of severe nonproliferative DR and 1 proliferative DR. The majority (26, 52%) reported at least one barrier to routine eye care in our self-administered survey, of which having too many appointments (6, 12%) and cost (5, 10%) were frequently cited as most important. The majority were receptive to interventions to promote DR screening, including reminder phone calls (29, 58%) and text messages (28, 56%).</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Digital fundus photography in the ED detected a high rate of undiagnosed DR.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence has increased twice over the past few decades, while the incidence of other cancer types has trended downward globally. Therefore, an understanding of HCC development and therapy resistance mechanisms is needed for this incurable malignancy. This review article describes links between immunotherapies and microbiota in tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs), which have stem cell characteristics with self-renewal ability and express pluripotency transcription factors such as NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4. This review discusses (1) how immunotherapies fail and (2) how gut dysbiosis inhibits immunotherapy efficacy. Gut dysbiosis promotes resistance to immunotherapies by breaking gut immune tolerance and activating suppressor immune cells. Unfortunately, this leads to incurable recurrence/metastasis development. Personalized medicine approaches targeting these mechanisms of TIC/metastasis-initiating cells are emerging targets for HCC immunotherapy and microbiota modulation therapy.</jats:p>"

Illustrating the technique, we analyze a finite Kitaev chain with boundary dissipation and consider anyon-type nonlocal excitations. We give explicit formula for the Green's functions, demonstrating an asymmetric light cone induced by the anyon statistical parameter and an increasing relaxation rate with this parameter. We also analyze some other types of nonlocal operator correlations such as the full counting statistics of the charge number and the Loschmidt echo in a quench from the vacuum state. The former shows clear signature of a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition, while the later exhibits cusps at some critical times and hence demonstrates dynamical quantum phase transitions.</jats:p>"

We find a significant reduction in the number of time-steps compared to fixed-step methods. Due to the at least quadratic scaling of Kadanoff-Baym equations, reducing the amount of steps can dramatically increase the accessible integration time, opening the door for the study of long-time dynamics in interacting systems. A selection of illustrative examples is provided, among them interacting and open quantum systems as well as classical stochastic processes.

Despite their potential toxicity, these materials have even been used in face masks to prevent COVID-19 transmission. The increasingly widespread use of these materials requires the design and implementation of appropriate, versatile, and accurate toxicological screening methods to guarantee their safety. Murine models are adequate, though limited when exploring different doses and lengths of exposure—as this increases the number of animals required, contrary to the Three R's principle in animal experimentation. This article proposes an in vitro model using primary, non-transformed normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells as an alternative to the most widely used model to date, the human lung tumor cell line A549. The model has been tested with three graphene derivatives—graphene oxide (GO), few-layer graphene (FLG), and small FLG (sFLG). We observed a cytotoxic effect (necrosis and apoptosis) at early (6- and 24-h) exposures, which intensified after seven days of contact between cells and the graphene-related materials (GRMs)—with cell death reaching 90% after a 5 µg/mL dose. A549 cells are more resistant to necrosis and apoptosis, yielding values less than half of NHBE cells at low concentrations of GRMs (between 0.05 and 5 µg/mL). Indeed, GRM-induced cell death in NHBE cells is comparable to that induced by toxic compounds such as diesel exhaust particles on the same cell line. We propose NHBE as a suitable model to test GRM-induced toxicity, allowing refinement of the dose concentrations and exposure timings for better-designed in vivo mouse assays.</jats:p>"

Many works have indicated that electronic excitations in strained graphene realize Dirac fermions in curved space in the presence of a background pseudo-gauge field, providing an ideal playground for this. However, the absence of a direct matching between a numerical, strained tight-binding calculation of an observable and the corresponding curved space prediction has hindered realistic predictions. In this work, we provide this matching by deriving the low-energy Hamiltonian from the tight-binding model analytically to second order in the strain and mapping it to the curved-space Dirac equation. Using a strain profile that produces a constant pseudo-magnetic field and a constant curvature, we compute the Landau level spectrum with real-space numerical tight-binding calculations and find excellent agreement with the prediction of the quantum Hall effect in curved space. We conclude discussing experimental schemes for measuring this effect.</jats:p>"

Semi-circular tubes (SCTs) are added to constitute the core boundary and reduce the fiber-core radius (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">R</jats:italic>). Double NANFs tubes and single-ring tubes are added inside the SCTs to reduce loss. Simulation results show that the optimized structure with <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">R</jats:italic> of 5 µm has confinement loss and total loss of 0.687 dB/km and 4.27 dB/km at 1.55 µm, respectively. The bending loss is less than 10 dB/km at 1.4 ∼ 1.6 µm with a bending radius of 10 mm. The direct coupling loss with standard single mode fiber is greatly reduced to ∼ 0.125 dB compared to other HC-NANFs. The modified structure of HC-NANFs also shows a large bandwidth, effective single-mode operation, potentially high birefringence performance, and remarkable robustness of the optimized structure parameters, making it suitable for short-haul applications in laser-based gas sensing, miniaturized fiber sensing, etc.</jats:p>",

It was found that the higher the current, the relatively later the limiting state sets in, the shorter the welding duration and the less the possibility of overheating the nearcontact region. Issues of rational technology of resistance welding of reinforced concrete reinforcement have been developed. The parameters of the mode of electric contact welding of crossing round rods are determined. The publication may be of interest to a wide range of readers interested in the problem of studying energy-saving technologies for the manufacture of metal structures with rod elements, including researchers, teachers and students of higher educational institutions in the field of energy conservation.</jats:p>",

Core shift is the change in position of the core from its original position in the mould before the molten fluid is passed into the cavity. Core shift occurs due to the temperature difference in the mould box and the pressure induced on the side walls of the mould box. Thus, the final product will have unexpected and uncountable variations and defects which will have a huge impact on the mechanical properties which in turn will affect the performance when running an operation. Also, the design and analysis of the final product will give an estimation on the various stresses acting on the core and how it will eventually affect both the mould and the core during the casting process. The problem of core shift has been resolved and the results obtained from the correction, have made an impact on the small foundries which usually do not operate in a systematic way. Thus, the goal of minimal to absolutely zero core shift can be achieved and the new final product will have more advantages compared to the old product with defects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The influence of core-hole delocalization for X-ray photoelectron, X-ray absorption, and X-ray emission spectrum calculations is investigated in detail, using approaches including response theory, transition-potential methods, and ground state schemes. The question of a localized/delocalized vacancy is relevant for systems with symmetrically equivalent atoms, as well as near-degeneracies which can distribute the core-orbitals over several atoms. We show that issues relating to core-hole delocalization are present for calculations considering explicit core-hole states, e.g. when using a core-excited or core-ionized reference state, or for fractional occupation numbers. Including electron correlation eventually alleviates the issues, but even using CCSD(T) there is a noticable discrepancy between core-ionization energies obtained with a localized and delocalized core-hole (0.5 eV for the carbon K-edge). Within density functional theory, the discrepancy correlates to the exchange interaction involving the core orbitals of the same spin symmetry as the delocalized core-hole. The use of a localized core-hole allows for a reasonably good inclusion of relaxation at lower level of theory, whereas the proper symmetry solution involving a delocalized core-hole requires higher levels of theory to account for the correlation effects involved in orbital relaxation. For linear response methods, we further show that if X-ray absorption spectra are modelled by considering symmetry-unique sets of atoms, care has to be taken such that there are no delocalizations of the core orbitals, which would otherwise introduce shifts in absolute energies and relative features.</jats:p>"

Small nanoparticles with a size much smaller than the wavelength of incident light are assumed, and the quasi-static approximation is applied to develop analytic equations to describe the absorption, scattering, extinction efficiencies in the core-bishell nanoparticles. The proposed nanostructures exhibit two LSPRs; one is in the visible range and corresponds to a plasmon mode of the core-inner shell composite while the second lies in the near infrared and is induced by the graphene plasmons excited at the outer shell. Interestingly, the latter LSPR of graphene has an ultra-narrow bandwidth and can be tuned in the NIR by altering the physical parameters of graphene, such as the Fermi energy and the number of graphene layers. Therefore, the LSPR peak of graphene is promising for medical applications. In addition, the LSPR of graphene can be tuned to the visible range near the position of the first LSPR, resulting in two narrow linewidth peaks. These resonance peaks could be beneficial for high-sensitive LSPR-based sensors.</jats:p>"

We also engineer the thickness of Mie resonators to achieve an MD-mode linewidth as small as 0.56 nm and a figure of merit greater than 160 RIU−1. The measured sensitivity of the MD mode is more accurate than that of the ED mode, which is more prone than the MD mode to measurement errors arising from the partial filling of the liquid.

It has been found that this precursor wave can be successfully modeled as a reflection under the liquid / solid interface at a depth of 100 km below the inner core boundary. In this study, we use these precursor waves of the lower reflection at the inner core boundary observed at the antipodal station (&gt; 179°). The sensitivity kernel for the shear wave velocity structure on the inner core surface was calculated by the adjoint method corresponding to these precursor waves, using theoretical seismic waveforms. The location of the fluid region was identified using the obtained sensitivity kernel. Our results show two regions of the inner core surface where the shear wave velocity is close to zero and is considered fluid. These regions are consistent with the westward shifts of geomagnetic anomalies observed on the Earth's surface and the regions of upwellings expected from geomagnetic dynamo simulations in the outer core<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>.

      "abstract": "<p>Music is a product of biological and cultural evolution. One major motor of the latter is cultural transmission, which may play a role in explaining the existence of musical universals. We tested how cultural transmission can shape melodic features in music. Specifically, we investigated whether random melodic seeds, in their transformation, take on properties known to characterise music within or even across cultures. We used iterated learning, a paradigm simulating the transmission of culturally-learned items through a transmission chain with non-musician participants (N=64). We found that melodies vocally reproduced between \"generations\" became more similar to known musical scales, showed a predominance of consonant intervals, and decreased their number of used scale degrees. Further observed were certain cross-cultural principles relating to interval progressions; as well as, interestingly, features that music shares with speech, such as phrase-final lengthening and Zipfian rank-frequency distributions of signalling units. Converging towards better memorability, participants' vocalisations decreased in entropy, and their contours became smoother and more consistent. Finally, certain short melodic patterns became prominent motifs within incipient musical \"traditions\", insofar as simulated by the chains. These emerging features may reflect a process shaped by (i) cognitive bottlenecks such as learnability; (ii) statistical properties of the processes and structures involved in inter-generational vocal transmission; but also by (iii) idiosyncratic cultural artefacts specific to the lab samples employed. Overall, our results show that core aspects of melodic organisation, as known from musical cultures around the world, begin to emerge under cultural transmission as simulated in the lab.</p>"

To address the challenges posed by ever-growing data size, fast and memory-efficient PCA methods have gained prominence. In this paper, we propose a novel Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) algorithm implemented in PCAone, featuring a window-based optimization scheme that enables accelerated convergence while improving the accuracy. Additionally, PCAone incorporates out-of-core and multithreaded implementations for the existing Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) and RSVD. Through comprehensive evaluations using multiple large-scale real-world datasets in different fields, we demonstrate the advantage of PCAone over existing methods. The new algorithm achieves significantly faster computation time while maintaining accuracy comparable to the slower IRAM method. Notably, our analyses of UK Biobank, comprising around 0.5 million individuals and 6.1 million common SNPs, demonstrate that PCAone accurately computes the top 40 principal components within a 9 hours. This analysis effectively captures population structure, signals of selection, structural variants, and low recombination regions, utilizing less than 20 GB of memory and 20 CPU threads. Furthermore, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data featuring 1.3 million cells, PCAone, accurately capturing the top 40 principal components in 49 minutes. This performance represents a 10-fold improvement over state-of-the-art tools.</jats:p>"

In this study, the effect of different coil parameters such as current, frequency, the number of coil turn, and the core lamination factor in different directions ([<jats:italic>X</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>Y</jats:italic>] and <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> axes), on the performance of a nickel‐core magnetostrictive transducer is investigated.

By increasing the lamination factor in the <jats:italic>X</jats:italic> direction, the fluctuation of magnetostrictive force along the <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>‐axis remains constant. However, the ultrasonic performance of the magnetostrictive transducer may be optimized by proper selection of lamination factor along the <jats:italic>X</jats:italic>‐axis.

Based on these equations, it was concluded that current and turn number of coil has the greatest positive impact on the magnetostrictive performance of the transducer, while increasing the frequency and lamination factor have a weakening effect.</jats:p>",

The rice germplasm is conserved in different gene banks around the world, which can be accessed for plant breeding programmes aiming to improve rice varieties. However, the ever‐increasing number of accessions poses problem of the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the germplasm. Therefore, to speed up characterization and utilization of germplasm, the concept of core collection (~10–20% of total base collection) was developed which provides maximum diversity in limited number of accessions. Similarly, a mini core collection (~1–2% of the entire collection) is constructed retaining maximum diversity to provide wider genetic coverage in manageable numbers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Ice-core timescales are vital for the understanding of past climate; hence\nthey should be updated whenever significant amounts of new data become\navailable. Here, the Greenland ice-core chronology GICC05 was revised for\nthe last 3835 years by synchronizing six deep ice cores and three shallow\nice cores from the central Greenland ice sheet. A new method was applied by\ncombining automated counting of annual layers on multiple parallel proxies\nand manual fine-tuning. A layer counting bias was found in all ice cores\nbecause of site-specific signal disturbances; therefore the manual\ncomparison of all ice cores was deemed necessary to increase timescale\naccuracy. After examining sources of error and their correlation lengths,\nthe uncertainty rate was quantified to be 1 year per century. The new timescale is younger than GICC05 by about 13 years at 3835 years\nago. The most recent 800 years are largely unaffected by the revision.\nBetween 800 and 2000 years ago, the offset between timescales increases\nsteadily, with the steepest offset occurring between 800 and 1100 years ago.\nMoreover, offset oscillations of about 5 years around the average are\nobserved between 2500 and 3800 years ago. The non-linear offset behavior is\nattributed to previous mismatches of volcanic eruptions, to the much more\nextensive dataset available to this study, and to the finer resolution of\nthe new ice-core ammonium matching. By analysis of the common variations in\ncosmogenic radionuclides, the new ice-core timescale is found to be in\nalignment with the IntCal20 curve (Reimer et al., 2020).\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The notion of affordance remains elusive, notwithstanding its importance for the representation of agency, cognition, and behaviors. This paper lays down a foundation for an ontology of affordances by elaborating the idea of “core affordance” which would serve as a common ground for explaining existing diverse conceptions of affordances and their interrelationships. For this purpose, it analyzes M. T. Turvey’s dispositional theory of affordances in light of a formal ontology of dispositions. Consequently, two kinds of so-called “core affordances” are proposed: specific and general ones. Inspired directly by Turvey’s original account, a specific core affordance is intimately connected to a specific agent, as it is reciprocal with a counterpart effectivity (which is a disposition) of this agent within the agent-environment system. On the opposite, a general core affordance does not depend on individual agents; rather, its realization involves an action by an instance of a determinate class of agents. The utility of such core affordances is illustrated by examining how they can be leveraged to formalize other major accounts of affordances. Additionally, it is briefly outlined how core affordances can be employed to analyze three notions that are closely allied with affordances: the environment, image schemas, and intentions.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, we start to derive a general expression of photoemission time delay based on the first order time dependent perturbation theory within the one electron and single channel model in the fixed-in-space system (atoms, molecules and crystals) and apply it to the core-level photoemission within the electric dipole approximation. By using multiple scattering theory and applying series expansion, plane wave and muffin-tin approximations, the core-level photoemission time delay <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math/>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:mi>t</mml:mi>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"bac68b7ieqn1.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula> is divided into three components, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math/>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mi>t</mml:mi>\n                           <mml:mtext>abs</mml:mtext>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"bac68b7ieqn2.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math/>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mi>t</mml:mi>\n                           <mml:mtext>path</mml:mtext>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"bac68b7ieqn3.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula> and <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math/>\n                     <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mi>t</mml:mi>\n                           <mml:mtext>sc</mml:mtext>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"bac68b7ieqn4.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>, which are atomic photoemission time delay, delays caused by the propagation of photoelectron among the surrounding atoms and the scattering of photoelectron by them, respectively.

This study evaluates participants’ perceptions of workload while learning intrinsic foot muscle exercises with or without neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Twenty-six individuals completed a 4-week supervised intrinsic foot muscle training program. Thirteen participants utilized neuromuscular electrical stimulation during the initial 2 weeks of training. Participant perceptions of workload, measured by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index, revealed decreasing load over 2 weeks and minimal load at 4 weeks.

This paper presents a framework for competency development, which is based on the views of both educators and industry professionals. By integrating knowledge from a variety of contexts and countries around the world, a set of generic core competencies has been derived via a systematic classification process. Specifically, forty competency statements have been posited taking the form of questions given to both educators and industry professionals. Subsequently, the responses have been analysed and, using taxonomy, a framework of seven core competency categories has been developed. The competency categories involve aspects of Human Resource Management (HRM); Professional Image; Operational Knowledge; Leadership; Communication; Information Management; and People Relationship Management. Specific competency items include essential capabilities for the hospitality industry such as: communicating effectively with clients and customers, identifying and solving problems, making decisions under pressure or in a crisis situation, and understanding the factors that influence the profitability of the hospitality enterprise. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a basis for developing a set of core competencies suitable for creating a sustainable competitive advantage for the hospitality industry. Further, the framework would be useful to educators, professionals and graduate students as a guide for cultivating a set of key competencies for success in the hospitality sector.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

This study was conducted by analyzing the syllabi using document analysis parameters and triangulated by conducting interviews to some lecturers and students in MPBI-19. The results are: first, the syllabi were reflecting the core values, vision and mission statements. Second, there are four ways to deliver values. Third, syllabus should be seen as a part of a curriculum not as a separated unit of course. Fourth, all courses are crystallized in Teaching Practice course (in practical term) and Thesis Writing (in theoretical form). The suggestions were: first, using a generalized format of syllabus to help lecturers state their values explicitly. Second, there are opportunities to research further the same topic in the scope of enacted curriculum. And third, lecturers should maintain their internalization processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>BackgroundBananas (<jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp.) are a globally significant crop and are severely afflicted by diseases for which there are no effective chemical controls. Banana microbiomes may provide novel solutions to these constraints but are difficult to manage due to their high diversity and variability between locations. Hence ‘common core’ taxa, which are a subset of the microbiome that frequent all, or most, individuals of a host species, represent logical targets for the development of microbiome management approaches. ResultsTo identify the common core bacterial microbiome of banana, we first performed a pot experiment to characterise the effects of two factors that are likely to differ between farms (<jats:italic>viz</jats:italic>. edaphic conditions and host genotype) on bacterial diversity in bulk soil and seven plant compartments. As diversity was found to differ between plant compartments and soils, but not genotypes, we identified populations that were frequent across most plants irrespective of the soil in which they were grown. Shortlisted ‘candidates’ were then refined according to whether they were also frequent in a survey of 52 field-grown <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. This led to the selection of 36 ‘common core’ bacteria, that represented 65-95% of the dominant taxa in field-grown plants and were identified as highly interconnected ‘hubs’ using networks – a characteristic shown to be indicative of microbes that influence host fitness in studies of other plants. Lastly, by comparing the sequences of our core taxa with those reported in 22 previous studies, we demonstrated that they are closely related to banana-associated bacteria observed on five other continents.  ConclusionsOur study provides a robust list of common core bacterial taxa for <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. Further research may now focus on how changes in the frequencies and activities of these most persistent taxa influence host fitness. Notably, for several of our core taxa highly similar populations have already been isolated in previous studies and may be amenable to such experimentation. This contribution should help to accelerate the development of effective <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. microbiome management practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Many amyloid-forming proteins, which are normally intrinsically disordered, undergo a disorder-to-order transition to form fibrils with a rigid β-sheet core flanked by disordered domains. Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) excel at resolving the rigid structures within amyloid cores but studying the dynamically disordered domains remains challenging. This challenge is exemplified by mutant huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1), which self-assembles into pathogenic neuronal inclusions in Huntington disease (HD). The mutant protein’s expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) segment forms a fibril core that is rigid and sequestered from the solvent. Beyond the core, solvent-exposed surface residues mediate biological interactions and other properties of fibril polymorphs. Here we deploy magic angle spinning ssNMR experiments to probe for semi-rigid residues proximal to the fibril core and examine how solvent dynamics impact the fibrils’ segmental dynamics. Dynamic spectral editing (DYSE) 2D ssNMR based on a combination of cross-polarization (CP) ssNMR with selective dipolar dephasing reveals the weak signals of solvent-mobilized glutamine residues, while suppressing the normally strong background of rigid core signals. This type of ‘intermediate motion selection’ (IMS) experiment based on cross-polarization (CP) ssNMR, is complementary to INEPT- and CP-based measurements that highlight highly flexible or highly rigid protein segments, respectively. Integration of the IMS-DYSE element in standard CP-based ssNMR experiments permits the observation of semi-rigid residues in a variety of contexts, including in membrane proteins and protein complexes. We discuss the relevance of semi-rigid solvent-facing residues outside the fibril core to the latter’s detection with specific dyes and positron emission tomography tracers.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlights</jats:title><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Mutant huntingtin exon 1 fibrils feature a broad range of molecular dynamics.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Molecular motion is coupled to water dynamics outside the fiber core.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Dynamics-based spectral editing ssNMR reveals mobile non-core residues.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Intermediate-motion selection via dipolar dephasing of rigid sites.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Semi-mobile glutamines outside the fiber core observed and identified.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The National Forum’s 2020 Network and Discipline Fund was launched in November 2020 and focuses on Shared Solutions to Common Challenges. Its overarching aim is to support networks and discipline groups to work together to respond proactively to identified challenges in teaching and learning in higher education, including those that have come to light through the sudden move to online/remote teaching and learning. The National Forum’s 2020 Network and Discipline Fund, drawing on the Higher Education Colleges’ Association (HECA) members’ experience, provided the HECA Academic Quality Enhancement Forum(HAQEF) with opportunities to strengthen its networks and discipline group, support their efforts to enhance teaching and learning, and produce useful insights and resources into the application of quality assurance of blended and online learning. In the pandemic period, many colleges were forced to change from a face-to-face delivery model of education and training to an online format of delivery. This disruption meant that assumptions about and plans for how the courses were to be delivered and managed had to be rapidly reviewed. With government pronouncements advising all staff to work from home where possible, the majority of internal roles and processes of colleges were also affected. The quality assurance (QA) policies, processes and procedures that were developed by colleges had to be modified to reflect this change in circumstances. This document reports on the results of a mixed methods study of QA developments that came about as a result of the initial changes enforced by the pandemic and the move to working from home. It also looked at what was learned about the management of quality in this sector during this time. Data was collected by HAQEF via a survey of QA personnel from the member colleges of HECA and follow up interviews. The survey consisted of 11 questions, one for each Core Area of Quality, as set out in the QQI Core QA Guidelines (2016). The questions asked for reflections on each provider’s experience of managing this aspect of QA, what resources or instances of good practice they could share with practitioners and which stakeholders were involved in this adaptation. The interviews asked about the measures that were undertaken to adapt QA processes in the pandemic period and what challenges could be reported from this adaptation. The report is divided into 11 chapters, with each chapter centred on a discussion of one Core Area of Quality as set out in the QQI Core QA Guidelines. An overview of the core area is developed, followed by a commentary on common experiences of the group in this area. Most sections conclude with resources, volunteered by member colleges of HECA, that was rated as useful in how the cohort navigated the management of QA in this core area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The vibroseismic method of studying the bowels of the earth is widely used to study the structural features of the bowels. The effectiveness of the method is due to the presence of controlled sources of seismic waves. In this case, the sources of seismic waves form a seismic signal, the parameters of which are determined and set by the researcher during the planning of the experiment. Frequency-modulated seismic signals - sweep signals - have become the most popular in field seismology. A special case of these signals are monochromatic signals. During the experiment, the seismic signal generated by the source is recorded by a seismic receiver. Thus, the researcher receives the initial seismic record - a seismogram. Processing of a seismogram, as an element of vibroseismic data, assumes the presence of information about the parameters of the seismic signal of the source. Based on this signal, a conversion core is formed for processing the seismogram. As a result of the operation of convolution of the seismogram with the core of the transformation, a vibrogram is formed. If it is necessary to increase the contrast (resolution) of the vibrogram, an additional filtering function is introduced into the conversion core, which performs the reverse filtering procedure. The purpose of this study is to form a filtering function and a mathematical model of the transformation core, which allows to increase the contrast of the vibrogram. The structurality and simplicity of the analytical expressions of the filtering function and the mathematical model of the transformation kernel is achieved by representing the function and model in operator form by means of the Laplace transform. The result of the study is analytical expressions in the operator form of the filtering function and a mathematical model of the transformation core to increase the contrast of vibrograms.</jats:p>",

Given that power produced during lifting tasks or trunk rotations plays an important role in most sport-specific and daily life activities, its measurement should represent an important part of the test battery in both athletes and the general population. The aim of this scoping review was 1) to map the literature related to testing methods assessing core muscle strength and stability in sport and rehabilitation, chiefly studies with particular focus on force-velocity-power characteristics of exercises involving the use of core muscles, 2) and to identify gaps in existing studies and suggest further research in this field. The literature search was conducted on Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and MEDLINE, which was completed by SpringerLink, Google Scholar and Elsevier. The inclusion criteria were met in 37 articles. Results revealed that among a variety of studies investigating the core stability and core strength in sport and rehabilitation, only few of them analyzed force–velocity–power characteristics of exercises involving the use of core muscles. Most of them evaluated maximal isometric strength of the core and its endurance. However, there are some studies that assessed muscle power during lifting tasks at different loads performed either with free weights or using the Smith machine. Similarly, power and velocity were assessed during trunk rotations performed with different weights when standing or sitting. Nevertheless, there is still scant research investigating the power-velocity and force-velocity relationship during exercises engaging core muscles in able-bodied and para athletes with different demands on stability and strength of the core. Therefore, more research is needed to address this gap in the literature and aim research at assessing strength and power-related measures within cross-sectional and intervention studies. A better understanding of the power-force-velocity profiles during exercises with high demands on the core musculature has implications for designing sport training and rehabilitation programs for enhancement of athletes’ performance and/or decrease their risk of back pain.</jats:p>"

The smallest but most extreme heterogeneities yet observed are ‘Ultra-Low Velocity Zones’ (ULVZ). We exploit seismic shear waves that diffract along the core-mantle boundary to provide new insight into these enigmatic structures. We measure a rare core-diffracted signal refracted by a ULVZ at the base of the Hawaiian mantle plume at unprecedentedly high frequencies. This signal shows remarkably longer time delays at higher compared to lower frequencies, indicating a pronounced internal variability inside the ULVZ. Utilizing the latest computational advances in 3D waveform modeling, here we show that we are able to model this high-frequency signal and constrain high-resolution ULVZ structure on the scale of kilometers, for the first time. This new observation suggests a chemically distinct ULVZ with increasing iron content towards the core-mantle boundary, which has implications for Earth’s early evolutionary history and core-mantle interaction.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this work is to develop a method for calculating the bending of three-layer plates with a polyurethane foam filler, taking into account the nonlinear creep of the middle layer. The non-linear Maxwell–Gurevich equation is used as the polyurethane foam creep law. Methods: In the article, the system of resolving the equations is obtained, and the solution is carried out numerically by the finite difference method in combination with the Euler method in a MATLAB environment. An analytical solution is also obtained for a plate hinged along the contour. Results: The developed model and calculation algorithms are verified by comparison with the calculation in the ANSYS software package. A comparison with the calculation according to the linear theory is also carried out, and the effects caused by the non-linear creep of polyurethane foam are revealed. Conclusion: It has been established that when nonlinear creep is taken into account, in contrast to the linear law, the stresses in the plate are not constant in time. In the faces, at the initial stage, the stresses increase with a subsequent return to the initial values, and in the filler, on the contrary, the stresses at the initial stage decrease. These results indicate the need to take into account the nonlinear creep of polyurethane foam in the calculation of sandwich panels.</jats:p>"

This research examined the physical and chemical defenses of rice plants against the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). A total of 10 rice varieties were used in this study. An electron microscope was used to observe trichomes. Constitutive and induced volatile compound profiles were assessed using GC-MS analyses. The preference of BPH for volatiles from the 10 rice plants was tested using a two-choice arena olfactometer system. The density of prickle trichomes had a negative relationship with the BPH injury level. Without BPH infestation, the volatile of the most resistant rice variety (Rathu Heenati (RH)) was preferred by BPH than those of the other varieties, with the exception of Gled Plah Chawn. However, the relative BPH preference for volatiles from the RH variety decreased during BPH infestation. When rice plants were infested by BPH, the numbers of VOCs and these quantities decreased. In the RH variety, the emission of essentities found without BPH infestation ceased during infestation by BPH. During the BPH infestation, rice plants started to emit new VOCs that were not detected before the BPH infestation started. In conclusion, we discovered that rice plants defended against BPH by changing VOC components during BPH infestation and β-Sesquiphellandrene was likely the most effective component.</jats:p>"

Examining three datasets collected between December 2020 and April 2021, this paper details conspiracy narratives that have developed around COVID-19 vaccines, with specific focus on understanding the deployment of the idea of a planned pandemic or so-called ‘#plandemic’. This is then used to consider where existing resilience-based approaches to countering off-line polarisation and extremism might posit an appropriate online response. The article identifies four key #plandemic framings of COVID-19 vaccines — as control, as reset, as unnecessary and as unsafe — and analyses how these themes are constructed, to find that they are often created through hostile and confrontational interaction with other users. Based on these findings, the conclusion suggests companies shift their focus away from ‘negative’ approaches to content moderation (e.g., content removal) and towards resilience-building responses that cultivate flexible individual identities, build community support networks, and/or engage users with national and supranational democratic structures, as a more effective response to the sharing of online conspiracies.</jats:p>"

Methods: The method applied was a correlational study analyzed by the structural equation modeling approach. Total of 401 participants were selected through stratified sampling (considering the gender and population of each field of study) among all University of Isfahan’s bachelor students who were in the last two years of their education. The Career adaptability scale (Savickas and Profeili, 2012), the core Self-evaluation scale (Judge &amp; Durham, 2003), and the big five personality traits questionnaire (Mc-Crae &amp; Costa, 2004) were applied to collect data. Results: Results indicated that core self-evaluation partially mediated the relationship between conscientiousness (p&lt;0/001) and extraversion (p&lt;0/001) with career adaptability. On the other hand, the relationship between career adaptability with openness to experience (p&lt;0/05) and neuroticism (p&lt;0/001) was indirect, and a direct relationship was noticed between career adaptability and agreeableness (p&lt;0/02). Conclusion: Results of the current study confirm the importance of conscientiousness, extraversion, and core self-evaluations’ roles on increasing career adaptability of the students who will graduate in the upcoming years. Furthermore, it seems that it is necessary to plan for the programs which enhance students’ core self-evaluation that increases their career adaptability. Also, in planning these programs, individual's big five personality traits should be considered.</jats:p>"

During uniaxial tensile along the wire axis at different temperature, different stages including elasticity, plasticity, necking, and fracture are characterized through stress-strain curves, Young’s modulus and tensile strength are obtained. The simulation results indicate that as the temperature increases, the elasticity during the stretching process becomes less apparent. The Young’s modulus of the Ge@Si and Si@Ge nanowires at room temperature show differences with changing the core-shell ratio. In addition, the atomic level pressures show the differences of these atoms under compression or tension, and the temperature and strain significantly affect the pressure distribution in these wires. Phonon density of states with varying the composition and strain suggest different vibration modes at room temperature, and then the heat capacities of these nanowires are determined.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>TRPV1, a capsaicin- and heat-sensitive ion channel, is expressed by peripheral nociceptors and has been implicated in various inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. Although pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 has attracted therapeutic interest, their utility is limited because TRPV1 agonists and antagonists thus far examined show thermo-modulatory side effects in animal models and human clinical trials. These on-target effects may result from the perturbation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptors, which transduce signals to central thermoregulatory circuits and also release pro-inflammatory factors from their peripheral terminals, such as the vasodilative neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Alternatively, they may originate from the modulation of TRPV1 on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), where channel activation promotes arteriole constriction. Here, we ask which of these pathways is most responsible for the body temperature perturbations elicited by TRPV1 drugs <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. We address this question by selectively eliminating TRPV1 expression in sensory neurons or vSMCs and show that only the former abrogates agonist-induced hypothermia and antagonist-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, lesioning the central projections of TRPV1-positive sensory nerve fibers also abrogates drug-mediated thermo-modulation, whereas eliminating CGRP has no effect. Thus, TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature by modulating sensory input to the central nervous system, rather than through peripheral actions on the vasculature. These findings suggest how mechanically distinct TRPV1 antagonists may diminish inflammatory pain without affecting core body temperature.</jats:p>"

The nanotube consists of a metallic core and a metallic shell with the analyte is inserted between the core and the shell.

By calculating the figure of merit (FOM), it is found that the high sensing performance with FOM &gt; 100 could be achieved. The dipole mode exhibits a higher sensing performance as compared to the other modes. Finally, the sensing performance is very sensitive to variations of the geometrical parameter and the background medium of the nanotube.</jats:p>",

These dams made since early days of civilization and constitute to be the most common type, because it is generally built of locally available soils proved to be most economical. The soil used in earthen dam are suspectable to seepage through the body of dam due to their permeability. Due to seepage soil gets reduces its strength and failures of dam may occurs. Past studies on earthen dam failures concluded that about 30% of dam failed due to seepage. An impervious central core is used in zoned type earthen dam to reduce the seepage quantity through the body of the dam and protects against the seepage failure of dam like piping and sloughing. Earthen dams are vulnerable to failures due to seepage that take place in the core since all soils are pervious to some extent. One of the best ways to control seepage problem in earthen dam is by using proper impervious soil for core section which provides the water tightness to flow through it. Thus, this paper analyses the usage of locally available soils with different combinations with central impervious vertical core and to study the seepage discharge by using Darcy law. The results obtained from the study is compared with actual seepage data obtained with existing soil in central core.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electricity has shaped modern civilization in a way few other discoveries have. Nonetheless, few students successfully develop a basic understanding of voltage, current, and resistance or their mutual relationship in simple DC circuits. Despite teachers’ best efforts in the classroom, so-called “alternative conceptions” often prevail after traditional instruction. In particular, voltage has proven to be a difficult concept to teach—many students erroneously think of voltage as a property of electric current. Furthermore, a battery is often considered to be a source of constant current rather than constant voltage. In order to help students develop a better understanding of simple DC circuits, we developed a new curriculum with an accompanying computer simulation that illustrates potential differences in circuits in order to make voltage rather than current the students’ primary concept when analyzing circuits. To this end, the curriculum takes typical alternative conceptions into account and builds on students’ everyday experiences with air pressure in order to provide them with an immediately tangible counterpart in electric potential. In analogy to air pressure differences that cause an air flow, voltage is introduced as an “electric pressure difference” that causes an electric current. Using the accompanying computer simulation, potential differences are visualized in simple DC circuits using color coding and a height representation. The new curriculum including teaching resources as well as the newly developed computer simulation are both freely available online to teachers and students alike.</jats:p>",

The transport of the branch associated to the southern cores shows annual cycles with maxima occurring in August (&gt;17 Sv) and July (&gt;7 Sv) respectively in the western and central areas. The annual cycle in the West is influenced by the wind stress curl (WSC) strength. The central area might be influenced by a return flow of the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current over the central Atlantic. At the opposite, the transport associated with the NECC’s northern core shows the same annual cycles with maxima occurring in September in both areas. This transport of the NECC shows seasonal cycles leaded by the WSC strength with 1-month lag. 83% and 71% of the total transport between the first 150 m-depth is above the thermocline respectively in the western and central areas. In the West, the northern core transport shows year-to-year variations associated with the WSC strength, while the southern core position of the NECC in the central tropical Atlantic appears influenced by the InterTropical Convergence Zone migration.</jats:p>"

The survey was conducted for 983 college students from April 12 to 16, 2021, and the final 75 questionnaires were confirmed through statistical verification. Through the collected data, potential profiles with heterogeneous characteristics based on core competencies were classified into three, and the characteristics of each potential group profile were confirmed. The main analysis results are as follows. First, the five core competencies (humanities competency, communication competency, globalization competency, creativity competency, professionalism competency) consists of 15 sub-competencies and 75 questionnaires. Second, the improved K-University core competency scale has secured validity after verifying the improvement plan through the expert meetings and surveys. Third, based on the improved K-University Core Competency Diagnosis scale, the overall average of core competencies was 3.85, communication competencies 3.99, creativity competency 3.96, humanities competencies 3.85, professionalism competencies 3.85, and globalization competencies 3.58. Furthermore, a total of three analyzing the latent profile through the core competency diagnosis result, a total of three latent profiles (upper group, middle group, and lower group) were identified. Through the analysis results, a new core competency diagnostic scale was developed by reflecting the educational goals, vision, and future capabilities of the university.

In addition, for each of the above models, four dam operation stages including “End of Construction”, “Full Reservoir”, “Half-Full Reservoir”, and “Rapid Drawdown” were considered. The results show, in four different stages of construction and impounding and three different slope modes, the maximum stress as well as horizontal and vertical displacements at the upper, middle, and lower points of the core increase with increasing height. In all models, increasing upstream and downstream slopes results in an increase in the amount of vertical displacement for all construction and impounding stages at the upper, middle, and lower points of the core. In the middle and lower points of the core, with increasing height, the amount of deviatoric stress increases for all construction and impounding conditions. In addition, for all operation cases, the maximum strain increases in all points of the vertical and tilted cores as the core thickness increases. Additional results are presented in the next sections.</jats:p>",

Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past 5 years, the Alma College Integrative Physiology and Health Science Department has noted a decrease in student success in the introductory human physiology course. A major element in variable performance is the increasing diversity of prior experience in students’ educational background, specifically as it relates to courses in STEM disciplines. Within the life science community, and more recently, the physiology community, use of “core concepts” in undergraduate education has been actively promoted as a means to improve student outcomes. To address the concern regarding student success, the department implemented a new “Foundations” course as a pre‐requisite to the Anatomy and Physiology sequence. This class replaced the previous pre‐requisite, Introduction to Cell Biology. We hypothesized that this approach would produce significant gains in student learning. The specific core concepts covered in the class were: causality, scientific reasoning, physics/chemistry, structure‐function, homeostasis, flow down gradients, cell membrane, energy, cell‐cell communication, and interdependence/integration. This set of concepts included and class design emphasized the 5 principles identified by physiology educators as most important for students to know.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> To assess learning, the Phys‐MAPS assessment tool was administered to students enrolled in IPH 227: Human Physiology (for students who had previously completed the Cell Biology pre‐requisite) and students enrolled in IPH 131: Foundations in Physiology (no pre‐requisite completed).<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> The tests were taken during the first week of class and again in the final week of the term. Although average scores increased by the end of the semester, the improvement was not significant, regardless of the class assessed (IPH 227: 36.8<jats:styled-content>+</jats:styled-content>5.8 vs 39.2<jats:styled-content>+</jats:styled-content>5.9 total points; IPH 131: 33.3<jats:styled-content>+</jats:styled-content>5.6 vs 36.5<jats:styled-content>+</jats:styled-content>7.3 total points). Importantly, students completing the Foundations class performed as well as those students who had previously taken the Introduction to Cell Biology as represented in the IPH 131 post and IPH 227 pre data, respectively (36.5<jats:styled-content>+</jats:styled-content>7.3 vs. 36.8<jats:styled-content>+</jats:styled-content>5.8). Therefore, while students from the Foundations course performed as well as those enrolled in a traditional introductory cell biology course at the end of each course, use of the “core concepts” failed to result in the expected learning outcomes. As an initial offering, there were multiple challenges/limitations that will be discussed. Adjustments in course design, together with additional/alternative assessment methods, could have an impact on measured student learning. Details of course design, assessment, and limitations will be presented.</jats:p>",

The gut microbiome of the Madagascar hissing cockroach <jats:italic>Gromphadorhina portentosa</jats:italic> has not been studied in detail, and there is evidence from culture experiments that this cockroach carries a unique microbial community. Here we present the results of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in the foregut, midgut and hindgut of <jats:italic>G. portentosa</jats:italic> to identify the most abundant lineages and to assess the bacterial diversity of each gut compartment.\nResults\n The hindgut showed the highest bacterial diversity, with a mean Shannon-Wiener index of ~ 4, compared to ~ 2 in the foregut and ~ 3 in the midgut. Lineages of the families <jats:italic>Oscillospiraceae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Christensenellaceae</jats:italic> (phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia) together with specific members of the phyla Verrucomicrobiota, Pseudomonadota, Fusobacteriota and Bacteroidota were predominant in the hindgut. The genus <jats:italic>Entomobacter</jats:italic> (family <jats:italic>Acetobacteraceae</jats:italic>) and certain subclades of the family <jats:italic>Lactobacillaceae</jats:italic> formed the core microbiome of the foregut, whereas the taxonomic groups well represented in the midgut were members of the family <jats:italic>Spirochaetaceae</jats:italic>, certain lineages of the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Clostridia, and the phylum Bacteroidota. A number of abundant sequences found particularly in the hindgut could not be classified in taxonomic ranks lower than order or class, strongly suggesting that these represent yet undescribed taxa.\nConclusions\n Bacteria of the family <jats:italic>Lactobacillaceae</jats:italic> were abundant and prevalent in the foregut and midgut of <jats:italic>G. portentosa</jats:italic>, but the hindgut was largely dominated by anaerobic clades such as members of the phyla Fusobacteriota and Bacteroidota, the classes Desulfovibrionales and Desulfobacterales, and the family <jats:italic>Peptostreptococcaceae</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

The device consists of low breaking point one‐way spirometer valve coupled serially to a flow‐through latex balloon that is fitted distally with a flow restrictor. The spirometer valve models the aortic valve; the latex balloon models the elastic arteries; the restrictor valve models the peripheral resistance. The user blows vigorously and intermittently into the proximal end of the device, modeling the ventricle's stroke volume. Initially designed to clarify the role of elastic arteries in cardiovascular function, it became evident that the arterial demonstration device could be employed to explain and demonstrate a number of physiological principles, including the distinct structure and functions of arteries and veins, the pathophysiological impact of aortic valve dysfunction (using device versions that incorporate dysfunctional valves), and the Law of LaPlace. Further, the device can be used to demonstrate several core physiological concepts, including causality; flow down gradients; energy acquisition, transformation and use; and mass balance in elastic structures<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>.

This study tested the theoretical model with a sample of 331 employees from six enterprises in China. The results showed that the interaction between perceptions of coworkers’ receiving idiosyncratic deals and low core self-evaluations stimulated employees’ feelings of relative deprivation, which triggered social undermining toward i-dealers. At the same time, employees’ conscientiousness could weaken the positive effect of relative deprivation on social undermining. Therefore, it reveals the negative peer effect of idiosyncratic deals and provides theoretical and practical implications for preventing the interpersonal harm doing caused by idiosyncratic deals.</jats:p>"

Specifically, 3D rotor wake computations produce detailed vortex structures, but typically, only a small fraction of the data is leveraged. A critical limiting factor is the time needed to process these large 3D data sets and infer the correct physics. The development of machine learning methods to process these data sets reduces the data processing burden on the analyst and also increases the volume of data that can be processed within a reasonable amount of time. Recent efforts in this area have resulted in the development of a novel machine learning-based vortex-core data extraction methodology. The present study demonstrates the application of this method to hovering rotor wakes to compare different blade tip geometries, ground effect, wake grid spacing, and collective changes and discusses the extracted vortex physics for each case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</jats:p>",

With governmentpronouncements advising all staff to work from homewhere possible, the majority of internal roles andprocesses of colleges were also affected. The qualityassurance (QA) policies, processes and procedures thatwere developed by colleges had to be modified to reflectthis change in circumstances.This document reports on the results of a mixedmethods study of QA developments that came about asa result of the initial changes enforced by the pandemicand the move to working from home. It also looked atwhat was learned about the management of quality inthis sector during this time.Data was collected by HAQEF via a survey of QApersonnel from the member colleges of HECA andfollow up interviews. The survey consisted of 11questions, one for each Core Area of Quality, as set outin the QQI Core QA Guidelines (2016). The questionsasked for reflections on each provider’s experienceof managing this aspect of QA, what resources orinstances of good practice they could share withpractitioners and which stakeholders were involvedin this adaptation. The interviews asked about themeasures that were undertaken to adapt QA processesin the pandemic period and what challenges could bereported from this adaptation.The report is divided into 11 chapters, with eachchapter centred on a discussion of one Core Area ofQuality as set out in the QQI Core QA Guidelines. Anoverview of the core area is developed, followed by acommentary on common experiences of the groupin this area. Most sections conclude with resources,volunteered by member colleges of HECA, that wasrated as useful in how the cohort navigated themanagement of QA in this core area.</jats:p>"

The degree of parallelism in software and the accuracy of performance estimation in the early design stages of model-based development can be improved by estimating performance of blocks in models and utilizing the estimate for parallelization. Research is therefore being performed on a software performance estimation technique that uses the IEEE2804-2019 hardware feature description called software-hardware interface for multi-many-core (SHIM). In SHIM, each LLVM-IR instruction is associated with the execution cycle of the target processor. Because several types of assembly instruction sequences for the target processor are generated from a given LLVM-IR instruction, it is not easy to estimate the number of execution cycles. In this study, we propose a regression analysis method to estimate the execution cycles for each LLVM-IR instruction. It is observed that our method estimated the execution cycles within the target error of ±20% in experiments using a Raspberry Pi3 Model B+.</jats:p>"

Human behavior is a multifaceted phenomenon, with strategic coalition formation being one form. A hybrid agent-based modeling approach, called ABMSCORE, has been derived to emulate strategic group formation. In this paper, we describe a simulation experiment to compare the ABMSCORE with actual human behavior. The comparison criterion is the respective rates of finding an ideal coalition. In our experimental design, we go to great lengths to ensure the similarity of the scenarios in the two trial types: trials with computerized agents only and trials involving human participants when one of the computerized agents is replaced by an actual human. We did this to limit the number of possible extraneous variables introduced into the experimental system. The scenario considered is the glove game, a standard cooperative game that has been previously used in human experiments. Our results indicate that the ABMSCORE model produces similar rates of finding the ideal coalition as the human players; however, there are some limitations. This research provides evidence for using the ABMSCORE modeling approach to model human strategic coalition formation in agent-based models. </jats:p>",

In our method, we carry out numerical thermal evolution model of a small but rough area taking into account its latitude, shadowing effect, and re-absorption of the thermal radiation by neighbor. By visualization of the resulting temperature distribution for an observation direction, we obtain the thermal flux from the area as a function of the observation direction. Then thermal image of an asteroid with random topography is constructed. The resulting daytime temperature evolution profile is different from the well-known parabolic shape due to the surface roughness, implying that the daytime temperature evolution profile is a diagnostic to evaluate the surface roughness. Although this model is inapplicable to a morphologically complex asteroid such as Itokawa, the target body of Hayabusa2, Ryugu is generally convex and suitable for application of our model. Furthermore, the study presents predictions of the location shift of Ryugu trajectory after one orbital rotation due to the thermal moment caused by the rebound force from thermally emitted photons known as the Yarkovsky effect. This model is thus verifiable by precise calculation of the ephemeris of Ryugu.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Species and their interactions are more dynamic over time and space in fragmented habitats than in continuous habitats. In fragmented habitats, the low nestedness of mutualistic networks may be related to the position change of stable (high persistence over time/space) species and interactions in the networks. Previous studies have shown that stable species and interactions tend to be in the core position of mutualistic networks. However, in fragmented habitats, it remains unknown whether stable species or interactions still tend to be in the core position. To address this gap, here we evaluated the correlation between the position of proximity to the network core and the temporal/spatial stability of species and interactions, using the observation of 42 plant–pollinator networks conducted in a fragmented island landscape over 3 years. We showed that temporally/spatially stable species and interactions deviated from the network core to varying degrees. Temporally stable plants were most likely to deviate from the network core, followed by pollinators and interactions, while only spatially stable pollinators tend to deviate from the network core. When unstable species (present in few time/space points, typically specialists) and interactions occupy the network core, they cannot interact with most species in the network as generalists do, resulting in the decrease of network nestedness. Therefore, from the perspective of position and stability, stable species and interactions deviate from the network core in fragmented habitats, which is an important reason for the decrease of nestedness in mutualistic networks. Our study suggests that protecting plants which occupy the core in large plant–pollinator networks is essential for maintaining the network persistence in fragmented habitats.</jats:p>",

CER query evaluation is known to be computationally challenging, since it requires maintaining a set of partial matches, and this set quickly grows super-linearly in the number of processed events. We present CORE, a novel COmplex event Recognition Engine that focuses on the efficient evaluation of a large class of complex event queries, including time windows as well as the partition-by event correlation operator. This engine uses a novel automaton-based evaluation algorithm that circumvents the super-linear partial match problem: under data complexity, it takes constant time per input event to maintain a data structure that compactly represents the set of partial matches and, once a match is found, the query results may be enumerated from the data structure with output-linear delay. We experimentally compare CORE against state-of-the-art CER systems on real-world data. We show that (1) CORE's performance is stable with respect to both query and time window size, and (2) CORE outperforms the other systems by up to five orders of magnitude on different workloads.</jats:p>",

We collected samples from several European countries during the 2018 outbreak and determined 53 near full-length genome (‘whole genome’) sequences. These sequences were combined with 718 whole genome and 1,987 VP1-gene publicly available sequences. In 2018, circulating strains clustered into multiple subgroups in the B3 and A2 subclades, with different phylogenetic origins. Clusters in subclade B3 emerged from strains circulating primarily in the US and Europe in 2016, though some had deeper roots linking to Asian strains, while clusters in A2 traced back to strains detected in East Asia in 2015-2016. In 2018, all sequences from the USA formed a distinct subgroup, containing only three non-US samples. Alongside the varied origins of seasonal strains, we found that diversification of these variants begins up to 18 months prior to the first diagnostic detection during a EV-D68 season. EV-D68 displays strong signs of continuous antigenic evolution and all 2018 A2 strains had novel patterns in the putative neutralizing epitopes in the BC- and DE-loops. The pattern in the BC-loop of the USA B3 subgroup had not been detected on that continent before. Patients with EV-D68 in subclade A2 were significantly older than patients with a B3 subclade virus. In contrast to other subclades, the age distribution of A2 is distinctly bimodal and was found primarily among children and in the elderly. We hypothesize that EV-D68’s rapid evolution of surface proteins, extensive diversity, and high rate of geographic mixing could be explained by substantial reinfection of adults. Better understanding of evolution and immunity across diverse viral pathogens, including EV-D68 and SARS-CoV-2, is critical to pandemic preparedness in the future.</jats:p>"

Strategies for boosting the optomechanical interaction strength are particularly compelling for the field of nanotechnologies. Here we show that the optical coupling strength between nano-waveguides can be enhanced by orders of magnitude when they are confined in hollow-core fibers. The presence of hollow core greatly increases the overlap integral between the nano-waveguides through excitation of the core modes. The excited higher-order core modes are able to mediate a long-range optomechanical interaction between the waveguides even though they are separated by tens of optical wavelength. It is found that the optical forces between the nanofibers can be switched from attractive to repulsive ones purely by tuning the gap between the nanofibers due to the optomechanical back-action effect induced by the higher-order core modes. The enhanced optomechanical coupling can be exploited to manipulate the collective eigenfrequencies of the coupled nano-waveguides via the optical spring effect. Our observation may find applications on the design of waveguide couplers embedded in the hollow core, or to realize miniaturized acoustic sensors.</jats:p>"

Three individuals (age: 61.7 ± 3.2 years; range: 58–64 years) with post-stroke hemiplegia participated in 12-sessions of the CSI. The participants completed up to 142 rotating planks at inclination angles (IAs) that ranged from 40° to 65°, over 12 sessions. The interventional effects on the functional outcomes of trunk performance, balance and mobility were assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test, the 10-m walk test (10MWT), and the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Postural outcomes were assessed using the center of pressure (CoP) data recorded during quiet standing on a balance platform, and neuromuscular outcomes were assessed using electromyography (EMG) during AllCore360° rotations. All participants completed the CSI (minimum of 120 rotations), demonstrating the feasibility of the CSI in chronic stroke. The CoP data suggested improved lateral control of posture during standing across participants (averaging an over 30% reduction in lateral sway), while the EMG data revealed the ability of the CSI to systematically modulate trunk muscle responses. In summary, the current investigation presents the feasibility of a novel delivery method for core strengthening to maximize rehabilitation outcomes in the chronic phase of stroke.</jats:p>"

The formation of student character can be started from within students by strengthening self-confidence, confidence in themselves and their intellectual abilities. Self-confidence or self-confidence is known as self-efficacy. Chemers proves that self-efficacy is related to learning achievement and self-adaptation, so it can indirectly affect student achievement. One of the learning models is the CORE (Connecting, Organizing, Reflecting and Extending) model based on peer tutors. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the peer tutor-based CORE model on students' self-efficacy in learning science. The research design used quasi-experimental. The research was conducted at Ma'arif Ponorogo Junior High School. The instruments used are test questions and questionnaires about self-efficacy. The data generated is data about the self-efficacy of students who experience science learning with the CORE model based on peer tutors. Data analysis in this study used the t test and the t-one tailed test. Based on the results of the t-test, the t-count value was 3.329 &gt; t-table 2.086. Furthermore, further tests were carried out on the one tiled t test and the results obtained were t0 -3.313 &lt; from -t table 1.725 and v 37.256. So it can be concluded that H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted so that the use of the CORE model based on peer tutors has an effect on self-efficacy.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Self-Efficacy, CORE Learning Model, Peer Tutor-Based, Science Learning</jats:p>"

We demonstrate that Pk and Dsh/Dvl bind to Vang/Vangl in an overlapping region centered around this tyrosine. Strikingly, Vang/Vangl2 phosphorylation promotes its binding to Pk, a key effector of the Vang/Vangl complex, and inhibits its interaction with Dsh/Dvl, and thus phosphorylation of this tyrosine appears to promote the formation of the mature and stable Vang/Vangl-Pk complex during PCP establishment. Interestingly, as our single point mutations allow selective binding inhibition of either Dsh or Pk, we can demonstrate for the first time that Dsh interaction with Vang is physiologically important, as all single point mutations fail to rescue the <jats:italic>Vang</jats:italic> null mutant wing phenotype.</jats:p>"

Methods: This study used an analogical reasoning approach. This legal research method includes examining the rule of law, presenting cases for comparison, and applying the fact pattern to predict outcomes of current or future cases. Results: The results demonstrate that the inclusion of the ECC in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) varies from state to state. Only two states have passed legislation requiring instruction in the ECC. These statutes have been referenced in case holdings. Administrative hearings from four different jurisdictions in the United States have held that the ECC must be included in the IEP to some extent. </jats:p><jats:p> Discussion: The ECC is a critical component of the education of students with visual impairments and must be incorporated in some form within their IEPs. Depending upon the jurisdiction, the ECC may have to be explicitly stated in the IEP, while in other locales it may have to be embedded within the IEP. In some states, specific statutes governing instruction in the ECC form the rule of law. Implications for Practitioners: School administrators and teachers of students with visual impairments should be knowledgeable of the legislation governing the ECC in their state and the legal precedents that have been created in their state. School administrators and teachers of students with visual impairments should carefully consider how the principles of a legal precedent can be applied to situations within their own communities to understand their obligations and likelihood of prevailing in any legal dispute. Finally, parents and students with visual impairments should be aware of the legal precedent created for the ECC in their state and use the dispute resolution process to inform change in their own communities as the families did in these exemplar cases. </jats:p>",

Gene\n                    Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to obtain GSE25031 microarray\n                    dataset. R package “limma” was applied to identify\n                    differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AIMAH and normal samples. The\n                    Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was\n                    employed to perform Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for the DEGs, and Kyoto\n                    Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was\n                    conducted. A protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the\n                    STRING online website and visualized using the Cytoscape software. The key\n                    modules and hub genes were then identified. Finally, Gene Set Enrichment\n                    Analysis (GSEA) enrichment analysis was carried out to find the signaling\n                    pathways of significant clinical value in AIMAH. A total of 295 DEGs between\n                    AIMAH and healthy samples were screened out, including 164 upregulated genes and\n                    131 downregulated genes. Combining enrichment analysis and PPI network\n                    construction, there were 5 signifiant pathways and 10 hub genes, among which 3\n                    genes (FOS, FOSB, and DUSP1) were identified as potential core genes of clinical\n                    significance in AIMAH. In conclusion, the 3 core genes, FOS, FOSB, and DUSP1,\n                    identified here might be potential biomarkers for AIMAH, and the current study\n                    is of guiding significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment of this\n                    disease.</jats:p>",

The Canadian supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) concept pressure tube includes a transition from zirconium-tin alloy (Excel) to a yet to be selected stainless steel to allow it to be seal welded to the inlet plenum. Thus, a method to join zirconium and its alloys to ferrous and nickel-bearing alloys is desired. To this end, a series of experiments were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. A joint approaching the strength of the parent material was achieved using both rotary friction welding and co-extrusion methods, although the joints exhibited lower ductility than that of the parent material. Microstructural examination of the joint revealed a ∼200 nm to ∼1 μm intermetallic layer at the transition zone, which was the location of failure in the tensile specimen.</jats:p>",

Core muscle percent fat was used as the outcome measure, and logistic regression as the analytical method to compare the relationship of the following five independent variables (erector spinae, rectus abdominis, [transversus abdominal, internal abdominal oblique, and external abdominal oblique muscle], lumbar multifidus, and psoas major muscles) with LDH. The result showed core muscles percent fat was significantly higher in LDH patients than in healthy volunteers (P&lt;0.001). LDH is closely associated with degeneration of erector spinae (B=2.413, OR=11.166) and rectus abdominus muscles (B=2.196, OR=8.991).

Therefore, this study focuses on understanding the decisive factors in regional revitalization and the relationship between business strategy, strategic alliance, and alliance performance through small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan. This study selected a sample of 220 SMEs in Taiwan that had participated in the SME regional revitalization counseling program. The results showed that competitive advantage, core competency and strategic alliance partner selection had significant effects on alliance performance. In addition, core competency had an indirect effect on alliance performance through strategic alliance partner selection. However, competitive advantage did not have a significant effect on strategic alliance partner selection. Finally, this study proposes management implications and practical suggestions for SMEs’ competitive advantage, core competency, and alliance performance.</jats:p>"

A dielectric metasurface q-plate was designed and fabricated to excite the desired mode combination in a hollow ring-core fiber that supports stable propagation of OAM modes. The observed spatial patterns show strong agreement with numerical simulations of the vector coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations.

This paper aims to acknowledge CS as an early or core manifestation and highlight EOAD as a differential diagnosis of mental disorders in young people, even without a remarkable family history.</jats:p>",

WHO Prescription indicators are intended to evaluate the services provided to the population concerning rational use of medicines.To study the prescription practices  and rational drug use in the department of Internal medicine, using the WHO prescribing indicators in a tertiary care teaching institute of national importance,<jats:bold>Methods and Material: </jats:bold> The present OPD based prescription audit pilot study was carried out in the department of internal medicine, in an institute of national importance, Central India.A total of 50 prescriptions were digitally photographed and analysed for prescription practices and rational drug use, using standard WHO core prescribing indicators. A total of 301 drugs with multiple and diverse diagnoses. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 22 version.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The average number of drugs per prescription was 3.48%. It was found that only 13.79% of prescriptions have generic names, whereas 27.58% of patient encounters had at least one drug from the NLEM, 6.8% of prescriptions have antibiotics and 0.7% prescriptions were injections. The number of prescriptions with FDC was 27.55%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Many prescriptions were not met the WHO core drug indicators criteria in EML, FDC and also in prescribing with the generic name. Hence, we will suggest regular prescription audit practices and conducting CMEs and training workshops for clinicians for rational use of medicines in all healthcare settings to succeed in the rational use of medicine.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Replaceable Link merupakan sebuah istilah untuk elemen link beam yang dihubungkan oleh coupling beam pada sistem struktur core yang didesain dapat diganti jika mengalami kelelehan. Sifat inelastik struktur hanya direncanakan pada link beam, sehingga elemen lain seperti kolom dan coupling beam tetap bersifat elastik. Kajian numerik dilakukan untuk mempelajari kinerja struktur terhadap kekakuan, daktilitas, disipasi energi dan mekanisme kelelelehan. Struktur ini dianalisis dengan memvariasikan link terhadap penebalan web, penebalan flange, dan penambahan panjang. Struktur ini dibandingkan dengan struktur serupa tanpa link sebagai benchmark. Hasil studi menunjukkan struktur dengan konsep replaceable link memiliki kinerja yang baik jika direncanakan menggunakan link geser. Kinerja struktur dengan variasi penebalan web dan flange memiliki kekakuan elastik struktur yang sama dan disipasi energi meningkat, tetapi menurunkan daktilitas. Penebalan web pada link geser meningkatkan kekakuan inelastiknya. Penambahan panjang link memiliki kekakuan cenderung sama dan meningkatkan daktilitas serta disipasi energi. Struktur yang optimal sesuai konsep replaceable link memiliki kapasitas base shear maksimum mencapai 95% dari struktur tanpa link serta memiliki daktilitas dan disipasi energi yang lebih baik daripada struktur tanpa link.&#x0D;\nDari kajian numerik yang dilakukan terlihat variasi penebalan web pada link geser merupakan variasi yang baik karena dapat meningkatkan kekakuan dan disipasi energi serta tidak perlu merubah konfigurasi struktur. Oleh karena itu, dilakukan kajian eksperimental pada struktur ini dengan variasi tebal web pada link. Kajian eksperimental dilakukan terhadap half-scale struktur yang terdiri dari kolom, coupling beam dan link beam. Sub-assembly diuji dibawah pembebanan siklik sesuai dengan ketentuan AISC 341-10 dengan mengkonversi rotasi menjadi displacement. Inovasi dilakukan pada link beam dengan cara melakukan penebalan pada bagian web link. Link-1 digunakan profil W150x75x6x8 sedangkan untuk Link-2 digunakan penampang link dengan profil W150x75x8x8. Pengujian diamati berdasarkan displacement kontrol yang direncanakan pada kolom sub-assembly dengan pembebanan lateral melalui aktuator. Hasil pengujian menunjukan bahwa penebalan yang dilakukan pada web link terbukti dapat meningkatkan disipasi energi sebesar 47% dan kekakuan elastik link dengan presentase rata-rata sebesar 42% tanpa menyebabkan kelelehan pada elemen lain seperti kolom, coupling beam dan sambungan link.</jats:p>"

To date, there is no consensus about which outcome domains should be measured, when they should be measured, and how they should be measured. In addition, most studies seeking to develop core outcome sets and measures for hearing rehabilitation services have primarily focussed on the opinions and expertise of researchers, and, to a lesser extent, clinicians, rather than also involving clients of those services. The principles of experience-based co-design suggest that health services, researchers, and policymakers should come together with clients and their families to design health services and define what metrics should be used for their success.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Objectives</jats:title><jats:p>This study aimed to seek views and consensus from a range of key stakeholders to define which client-centred self-report outcome domains should be measured, when they should be measured, and how they should be measured, in a national publicly funded hearing rehabilitation scheme. In addition, the study aimed to identify current and future potential mechanisms and systems to standardise the collection of data and reporting of outcomes, to enable comparison across clients and hearing service providers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>Two stakeholder groups participated in a three-round online Delphi process: (1) 79 professional stakeholders involved in the delivery of hearing services in Australia, and (2) 64 hearing rehabilitation services’ clients identified by not-for-profit consumer organisations. An initial set of in-person workshops scoped the key issues upon which to develop the initial open-ended questions and subsequent Likert-scale statements addressing these issues. These statements were then distributed to both groups in an online survey. The respondent ratings were summarised, and the summary was returned to respondents along with a second round of the survey. This process was then repeated once more. The five most important outcome domains from both groups were then combined, and a consensus workshop of seven professionals and three client advocates agreed on the top four ranked domains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>A range of potential outcome domains were identified as relevant indicators of successful hearing rehabilitation. Communication ability, personal relationships, wellbeing, and participation restrictions were identified as a core outcome domain set that should be measured as a minimum for patients receiving hearing rehabilitation. There was little agreement on the preferred timepoints for collection of outcome measures, with respondents expressing the view that this should be established by research once a set of outcome measures has been selected. However, there was broad agreement that measurements of these domains should be collected at baseline (before the provision of hearing rehabilitation) and no earlier than 3 months following the completion of rehabilitation. Potential benefits and issues with the development of a national outcomes database/collection system were also identified and prioritised, with participants highlighting the importance of valid, high-quality, trustworthy, and comprehensive data collection.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>These results provide a Core Outcome Domain Set for the self-reported evaluation of hearing rehabilitation and provide important background information for the design of methods to implement them across hearing healthcare systems. However, the wide range of outcome domains identified as potentially providing important additional information and the lack of specific measures to address these domains strongly suggest that there is still more research to be done. Ongoing stakeholder engagement will continue to be vital for future implementation. In addition, further research is required to determine the optimal time following hearing rehabilitation to utilise any particular outcome measure.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

However, the property improvements are obtained at the cost of reduced mechanical properties. In this study, heat-treated Douglas fir wood with thermally modified shell and unchanged inner core was prepared by surface heating to make possible the broader applications of heat-treated wood. Colour comparison, dynamic vapor sorption and dynamic mechanical analysis were performed to characterize the physico-mechanical performance of the shell and core of the treated wood. The results reveal a darkened, hydrophobic and rigid shell and a barely changed inner core. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows pronounced degradation of polysaccharides in the surface layer. In contrast, the relative contents of different carbon components in the core layer are similar to that of the untreated wood, indicating the reason for the performance difference between the shell and the core of the treated wood. The initial wood moisture content plays an important role in controlling the temperature gap between the core and the shell during treatment and can be used as a key parameter to adjust the structure and performance of the heat-treated wood.</jats:p>"

Respondent of this experiment are 16 people (n=16) met the inclusion criteria with 8 people in the core stability group and 8 people in the zig zag run group. The research method used is a quasi-experimental approach with two groups of pre and post test designs. The data collected was first tested for normality with the Shapiro Wilk test (n=&lt;50), the results obtained were 0.179 (preZigzag), 0.321 (preCoreStability) meaning the data was normally distributed (p&gt;0.05). Then the homogeneity test was carried out with the Levene test, the value (sig) of 0.863 (p&gt;0.05) means that there is a similarity of variance (homogeneous) between groups. Statistical analysis in both groups used Paired Sample t-test and obtained a sig value for the core Stability group of 0.000 and for the Zigzag Run group of 0.000, it can be concluded that there was a difference after being given treatment in each treatment group (p &lt;0.05). Different test of the effect of post test core Stability and zigzag Run using the Independent Sample t-test and obtained a value (sig) of 0.015. So it can be concluded that there is a difference between the treatment of group I and group II (p&lt;0.05).

Bioprinting promises accurate control over the formation of such complex materials through programmable deposition of cells in soft materials, but current approaches had limited success in fine-tuning cell microenvironments while generating robust macroscopic morphologies. Here, we address this challenge through the use of core-shell microgel ink to decouple cell microenvironments from the structural shell for further processing. Cells are microfluidically immobilized in the viscous core that can promote the formation of both microbial populations and mammalian cellular spheroids, followed by interparticle annealing to give covalently stabilized functional scaffolds with controlled microporosity. The results show that the core-shell strategy mitigates cell leakage while affording a favorable environment for cell culture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different microbial consortia can be printed into scaffolds for a range of applications. By compartmentalizing microbial consortia in separate microgels, the collective bioprocessing capability of the scaffold is significantly enhanced, shedding light on strategies to augment living materials with bioprocessing capabilities.</jats:p>"

The high velocity of the game, high number of matches and the athletic conditioning puts a strain on the musculoskeletal system, leading to a high risk of injury. Prior research substantiates the belief that a better spinal stabilization function due to the application of Pilates exercises would help to achieve better sports results and reduce the risk of injuries.&#x0D;\nThe aim. To evaluate the impact of a Pilates exercise program on functional movements, core stability and risk of injuries in young handball players.&#x0D;\nMethods. 12 professional handball players aged 18.25 ± 0.45 years participated in the study. A Pilates exercise program was applied in addition to the regular handball training. The program lasted for 8 weeks, with the sessions organized on-line, twice a week for 60 minutes. Before and after the program, functional movements were assessed using the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) method, core stability was assessed by McGill core muscle isometric endurance tests, dynamic stability and associated injury risk was assessed by modified star excursion balance test.&#x0D;\nResults. After the application of the Pilates exercise program, the evaluation of functional movements according to FMS scores significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05). The isometric endurance ratio of the right and left side core muscles significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05), and the isometric strength endurance ratio between the right side and back muscles also improved (p &lt; 0.05). No significant change in either the total index of dynamic stability of the arms or legs, which indicates the risk of injury was found after the Pilates exercise program.&#x0D;\nConclusion. This study illustrates the idea that a Pilates exercise program improved quality of the handball players’ functional movements and the isometric strength of some core-stabilizing muscles, while the risk of injuries did not change.&#x0D;\nKeywords: movement quality, static endurance, dynamic stability, athletes, core stabilization exercise.</jats:p>"

GEO2R, NCBI’s online analysis tool, is used to screen out significant gene expression differences. The genes were functionally enriched by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. On this basis, the hub genes were explored through Cytoscape software, and the immune infiltration analysis and diagnostic value of the screened hub genes were judged. Finally, four hub genes (NFKBIA, CDKN1A, BTG2, GADD45B) were screened. There was a significant correlation between two hub genes (NFKBIA, BTG2) and resting memory CD4 T cells. The ROC curve results showed that all four hub genes had diagnostic value.</jats:p>"

The aim of our study was to investigate the gene network and biomarkers of IDD and suggest potential therapeutic targets.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with IDD were identified by analyzing the mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA expression profiles of IDD cases from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis as well as miRNA–lncRNA–mRNA networks were conducted. Moreover, we obtained 71 hub genes and performed a comprehensive analysis including GO, KEGG, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene set variation analysis (GSVA), Disease Ontology (DO), methylation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and potential drug identification. We finally used qRT-PCR to verify 13 significant DEGs in normal and degenerative nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We identified 305 DEGs closely related to IDD. The GO and KEGG analyses indicated that changes in IDD are significantly associated with enrichment of the inflammatory and immune response. GSEA analysis suggested that cell activation involved in the inflammatory immune response amide biosynthetic process was the key for the development of IDD. The GSVA suggested that DNA repair, oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome, IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, and apoptosis were crucial in the development of IDD. Among the 71 hub genes, the methylation levels of 11 genes were increased in IDD. A total of twenty genes showed a high functional similarity and diagnostic value in IDD. The result of the immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that seven genes were closely related to active natural killer cells. The most relevant targeted hub genes for potential drug or molecular compounds were MET and PIK3CD. Also, qRT-PCR results showed that ARHGAP27, C15orf39, DEPDC1, DHRSX, MGAM, SLC11A1, SMC4, and LINC00887 were significantly downregulated in degenerative NPCs; H19, LINC00685, mir-185-5p, and mir-4306 were upregulated in degenerative NPCs; and the expression level of mir-663a did not change significantly in normal and degenerative NPCs.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our findings may provide new insights into the functional characteristics and mechanism of IDD and aid the development of IDD therapeutics.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Dual earthquake-resistant archetypes suffer residual damage following a severe earthquake leading to socio-economic drawbacks. A vertical isolated rocking core-moment frame (VI-RCMF) provides a resilience technique to curtail the seismic vulnerability using the isolation of subsystems. Viscous dampers, installed at each floor level of the VI-RCMF archetype, separate moment frame (MF) from rocking-core (RC). The self-centering RC performs as a passive strong-back core, which can uplift on its toes. Although the VI-RCMFs have exhibited superior performance compared to non-isolated dual frames, there are analytical challenges to come up with the optimal design due to the complex interaction of subsystems. This paper presents an optimization framework for quantifying the optimal design parameters of VI-RCMFs. Accordingly, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method is employed as the optimization algorithm. The objective function is defined to minimize the displacement of MF and the design vector includes mass, stiffness, and damping ratios. The SPSA optimization analyses are conducted for a set of archetypes using OpenSees software. Optimal normalized responses of subsystems are computed for 44 far-field ground motions and aleatory uncertainties are quantified for optimal design variables. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure for optimizing VI-RCMFs. The derived optimal design vector can be used for the preliminary design of low-to mid-rise archetypes. </jats:p>",

Three scenarios were considered. In Scenario 1, drainage basins, in Scenario 2, the valleys, and in Scenario 3, canyons, shallow valleys, headwaters, and u-shaped valleys were considered MCs.

The connectivity of the physical structure of landscapes plays a critical role in the connectivity of population cores.

Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for managing ankle OA. One of the current challenges to establishing guidelines is the lack of a widely agreed-upon set of outcome measures that are consistently used in ankle OA research. Without a set of agreed-upon outcome measures, it is difficult to synthesise clinical trial outcomes through meta-analysis – an essential element of evidence-informed practice. In order to develop an appropriate set of outcome measures for ankle OA, it is important first to develop a core domain set. In this protocol, we describe the methodological approach that we will use to develop such a core domain set for ankle OA.<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>We established an international steering committee to guide the development of a core domain set for ankle OA. The core domain set development will follow a multi-staged approach consisting of three phases, involving participation by patients and clinicians/healthcare professionals. In Phase 1, a list of candidate domains will be gleaned from (a) a systematic review of outcome measures used in ankle OA research, (b) qualitative interviews with individuals with ankle OA, and (c) qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals with expertise in ankle OA. In Phase 2, the steering committee will review and generate a list of candidate domains from those gleaned in Phase 1. In Phase 3, this list of candidate domains will be considered in a Delphi process to reach a consensus on a core domain set. We anticipated this will involve 3 rounds of surveys.<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>This protocol describes the methods that will be used to develop a core domain set of health-related aspects for ankle OA. Importantly, it will include both healthcare professional and patient involvement. This is a prerequisite step to developing a core outcome set for ankle OA that should be reported in all clinical trials for ankle OA. The findings will be widely disseminated across peer-refereed publication(s), national and international conferences, as well as via relevant professional societies, patient support group organisations and social media platforms.<jats:bold>Project registration</jats:bold>This project is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database on 17 March 2021. https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1837.</jats:p>"

Regime maps are presented for high submergence water levels by the amalgamation of visual inspection of interface profile inside the tank and within the flow intakes. The entrained air entities have transformed from discrete bubbles to a continuous gaseous core by passing through the number of intermediate fluidic structures within the pipe upon the increase in the flow rate in the entrainment regime. The flow rate at the inception of air entrainment has increased with an increase in the height of the nominal free surface. The transient evolution of the vortex tip depicted different rates of its downward traversal depending upon the location of occurrence between the free surface and flow inlet. The use of an air separator system has resulted in the mitigation of the flow fluctuations in the entrainment regime.</jats:p>",

Does, this, perhaps depend on the region where students are educated? The present article reports on a meta-study that sought to respond to these questions through looking at 40 generic competences valued by over 71,000 graduates, employers, students and academics from different disciplines in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The notion of trans-regional generic competences is introduced and four levels of trans-regionalisation are distinguished. Differences across regions and countries in relation to competence formulation and conceptualization, as well as the very presence/absence of a particular competence, are discussed with views of re-introducing further nuances in the global debates about internationalization of curriculum. </jats:p>",

Unemployment of the educated labor force often results in a waste of human capital and leads to serious economic and social problems. In the face of the impact of COVID-19, the Chinese government quickly introduced a series of employment policies for college graduates to relieve their employment pressure and create opportunities of career development. How did these employment policies for college graduates spread rapidly under the unconventional state of the COVID-19 epidemic? What are the diffusion characteristics? What are the core issues and measures? What are the differences between governments at all levels? These problems with rich connotation and research value needed to be further clarified. Based on the 72 employment support policies collected from the Chinese government network, this paper conducted a text analysis of the policies and found that in the process dimension, the employment policies of college graduates accumulated and exploded from bottom to top in the short term, and the policies diffusion followed the gradual model of “east–middle–west”. In the content dimension, there were five core issues: financial subsidies, innovation and entrepreneurship to drive employment, public institutions to absorb, optimizing public services, and lowering the support threshold. Meanwhile, there were obvious differences in the choice of policy tools, policy intensity, and implementation ideas in each region. The findings are of important significance for developed and developing countries to better respond to the impact of various emergency situations.</jats:p>"

It is of great research significance to uncover underlying patterns and insights from the high-dimensional data of IoT, to excavate valuable information to guide people’s production and life. Clustering can explore the natural cluster structure of the data, which is conducive to further understanding of the data, and is an essential preprocessing step for data analysis. However, clustering is highly dependent on the data. In order to reduce the complexity of the model, reduce the computational cost, and obtain a more robust clustering solution, we combine subspace clustering and ensemble learning to propose a novel subspace weighted clustering ensemble framework for high-dimensional data. The proposed framework first combines random feature selection and unsupervised feature selection to generate a set of base subspaces. Clustering is performed on each base subspace to achieve a set of subspace clustering solutions that generate a set of adaptive core clusters. The size of the core cluster is between the sample and the cluster. In the ensemble process, the core clusters are viewed as the basic unit, and the stability of the cluster is evaluated by measuring the distance between the core cluster pairs, and the similarity between the core clusters and the clusters in the base subspace, and then weighting the subspace clustering solution. Under this framework, we propose four subspace ensemble approaches based on core cluster to improve the accuracy of consensus clustering solutions. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world high-dimensional datasets, demonstrating that the proposed framework can process high-dimensional data for the IoT, and the proposed subspace clustering ensemble approaches are superior to the state-of-the-art clustering approaches.</jats:p>",

NetAct robustly infers regulators’ activity using target expression, constructs networks based on transcriptional activity, and integrates mathematical modeling for validation. Our in-silico benchmark test shows that NetAct outperforms existing algorithms in inferring transcriptional activity and gene networks. We illustrate the application of NetAct to model networks driving TGF-β induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and macrophage polarization.</jats:p>"

Therefore, we compared remimazolam with propofol in terms of core body temperature in patients undergoing robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Materials and methods: Ninety patients were randomly assigned to either the propofol–remifentanil (PR) group or the remimazolam–remifentanil (RR) group. The PR group (n = 45) received effect-site concentrations of 6.0 μg/mL of propofol and 4 ng/mL of remifentanil, followed by 0.9 mg/kg of 1% rocuronium and maintenance with effect-site concentrations of 2–4 μg/mL of propofol and 3 ng/mL of remifentanil. The RR group (n = 45) received remimazolam 6 mg/kg/h by continuous intravenous infusion and the effect-site concentration of 4 ng/mL of remifentanil, followed by 0.9 mg/kg of 1% rocuronium, remimazolam 1–3 mg/kg/h, and remifentanil 3 ng/mL. The primary outcome was core body temperature, and secondary outcomes included vasoconstriction threshold (°C) and time to onset of vasoconstriction (min). Results: The core body temperature in the RR group was significantly higher at 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 min after induction than in the PR group (p &lt; 0.01). The vasoconstriction threshold was significantly higher in the RR group (35.2 ± 0.4) than in the PR group (34.8 ± 0.3) (p &lt; 0.01). The time to onset of vasoconstriction was significantly less in the RR group (150.5 ± 10.2) than in the PR group (158.5 ± 8.4) (p &lt; 0.01). However, the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia was not significant between two groups. Conclusions: Remimazolam appears to reduce vasoconstriction threshold less than and had a faster onset of vasoconstriction, resulting in superior thermoregulatory control.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Social reputation (e.g., likes, comments, shares, etc.) on YouTube is the primary tenet to popularize channels/videos. However, the organic way to improve social reputation is tedious, which often provokes content creators to seek services of online blackmarkets for rapidly inflating content reputation. Such blackmarkets act underneath a thriving collusive ecosystem comprising core users and compromised accounts (together known as collusive users). Core users form the backbone of blackmarkets; thus, spotting and suspending them may help in destabilizing the entire collusive network. Although a few studies focused on collusive user detection on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, none of them differentiate between core users and compromised accounts.\nWe are the first to present a rigorous analysis of core users in YouTube blackmarkets. To this end, we collect a new dataset of collusive YouTube users. We study the core-periphery structure of the underlying collusive commenting network (CCN). We examine the topology of CCN to explore the behavioral dynamics of core and compromised users. We then introduce KORSE, a novel graph-based method to automatically detect core users based only on the topological structure of CCN. KORSE performs a weighted k-core decomposition using our proposed metric, called Weighted Internal Core Collusive Index (WICCI). However, KORSE is infeasible to adopt in practice as it requires complete interactions among collusive users to construct CCN. We, therefore, propose NURSE, a deep fusion framework that only leverages user timelines (without considering the underlying CCN) to detect core blackmarket users. Experimental results show that NURSE is quite close to KORSE in detecting core users and outperforms nine baselines.</jats:p>"

The adsorption kinetics of Pb(II) followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the adsorption rate could be decreased by increasing the initial concentration of Pb(II).

Temperature–based covert communication channel, known as Thermal Covert Channel (TCC), can pose a threat to the security of critical information and data. In this paper, we present a novel scheme against such TCC attacks. The scheme adds selective noise to the thermal signal so that any possible TCC attack can be wiped out. The noise addition only happens at instances when there are chances of correct information exchange to increase the bit error rate (BER) and keep the power consumption low. Our experiments have illustrated that the BER of a TCC attack can increase to 94% while having similar power consumption as that of state-of-the-art.</jats:p>"

The side indirect cooling with top flooding strategy described in this study may lead to water ingression through the melt crust, which may lead to interaction between unoxidized metal and water, leading to hydrogen production. In order to avoid this deleterious scenario, water ingression into the interior region of the melt should be avoided. The studies described in this paper show that water ingression depends on the flooding strategy, i.e., the time delay between top flooding and melt relocation. Two experiments under identical conditions of simulant temperature, melt material, and test section geometry were conducted with simulated decay heat of 1 MW/m3. Sodium borosilicate glass was used as the corium simulant. In the first experiment, water was flooded onto the top of melt pool soon after melt relocation. In the second experiment, water flooding at the top of melt pool was made after 30 min of the melt relocation. The results show that a finite time delay of introduction of water onto the top of the melt pool is paramount to engender the development of a stable crust around the melt and therefore eliminating water ingression into melt pool and ensuring controlled coolability of the melt.</jats:p>",

The thalamus has a coordinative role in cortical function and is key to the development of the cerebral cortex. Conversely, altered functional organization of the thalamus might relate to overarching cortical disruptions in schizophrenia, anchored in development. Here, we contrasted resting-state fMRI in 99 antipsychotic-naive first-episode early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) patients and 100 typically developing controls to study whether macroscale thalamic organization is altered in EOS. Employing dimensional reduction techniques on thalamocortical functional connectome, we derived lateral-medial and anterior-posterior thalamic functional axes. We observed increased segregation of macroscale thalamic functional organization in EOS patients, which was related to altered thalamocortical interactions both in unimodal and transmodal networks. Using an<jats:italic>ex vivo</jats:italic>approximation of core-matrix cell distribution, we found that core cells particularly underlie the macroscale abnormalities in EOS patients.

The platen is made from carbon fibre material with a special channel to insert the FBG inside the cell, and it is compatible with an NMR overburden system (i.e. no metal, and also resistant to pressure, temperature and reactive chemicals) to allow, for example, advanced chemical experiments. This development has allowed us to acquire both fluid dynamics behaviour, from NMR, and deformation/elastic properties, from FBG sensors, during NMR core flooding experiments for advanced hydro-mechanical-chemical coupling characterisation. Generally, pore fluid redistribution occurs while changing the surrounding stress and/or temperature conditions of the tested material, and will generate elastic and geomechanical responses. The impact of rock–fluid interactions during NMR core flooding has not been evaluated until now, mainly due to technical limitations. Fortunately, the FBG sensing technique is a localised/discreet micro-strain gauge (8 mm long and 125 micro thick), and it is applicable to the monitoring of pseudo-tomography during core flooding experiments. We recently managed to attach eight FBG sensors on a carbonate rock plug to monitor strain alteration during brine imbibition under 800 psi confining pressure. The results validate the ability of the FBG sensors to track mechanical strength alterations due to pore pressure changes and also to detect waterfront velocity during injection. The integration of FBG sensors into the NMR core flooding system has added a new capability to the NMR overburden system, enabling it to simultaneously monitor material deformation with FBG sensors during pressure/temperature alterations as a first basic application.</jats:p>",

Over the past decade, AM of electromagnetic materials has evolved into a promising new area of research. Considerable efforts have also been invested by the electrical machine (EM) research community to develop and integrate novel additive components. Several challenges remain, however, in printing soft magnetic flux guides—most prominently, reducing the induced eddy currents to achieve competitive AM core efficiency. This paper demonstrates the workflow of laser additive manufacturing magnetic cores with superior magnetic properties to soft magnetic composites (at 50 Hz excitation): describing the workflow, parameter tuning for both printing and annealing, and shape optimization. Process optimization yielded the optimal energy density of 77 J/mm3 and annealing temperature of 1200 °C, applied to prepare the samples with the highest relative density (99.86%), lowest surface roughness Rz (0.041 mm), minimal hysteresis losses (0.8 W/kg at 1.0 T, 50 Hz), and ultimate yield strength of 420 MPa. For Eddy current suppression, the sample (5 × 5 × 60 mm toroid) with bi-directional grading reached specific core losses as low as 1.8 W/kg (W10,50).

However, there have been no new successful therapies that improve long‐term survival in several decades. This indicates the need for novel therapeutic targets for treating OS. Core binding factor is a heterodimeric transcriptional complex, comprised of proteins runt‐related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and core‐binding factor subunit Beta (CBFβ), that promotes transcription of genes related to bone formation, osteoblast differentiation, and bone mineralization. RUNX2 protein expression is deregulated in OS tumors which contributes to chemoresistance, increased proliferation, and defective differentiation, suggesting it could be a therapeutic target in OS. This study utilizes small molecule allosteric inhibitor of CBFβ, AI‐14‐91, to target the interaction of RUNX2 and CBFβ, thereby reducing RUNX2 binding to target genes, in order to evaluate the CBFβ and RUNX2 interaction as a pharmacological target in OS.

Core self-evaluation partially mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and adult marital attitudes. CONCLUSION: The effect of childhood trauma on adult marital attitudes can be achieved indirectly through core self-evaluation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Background: To ensure appropriate transfer of successful implementation strategies from research to policy and practice, it is important to use tools to measure and support fidelity to an implementation strategy’s core components. Unfortunately, this aspect of implementation science is underdeveloped and infrequently applied. Implementation facilitation (IF) is a multifaceted interactive process of problem-solving, enabling, and supporting stakeholders in their efforts to adopt and incorporate clinical innovations into routine practice that occurs in the context of a recognized need for improvement and supportive interpersonal relationships. Our objective was to identify core activities for IF as a foundational first step in efforts to assess fidelity to the strategy.Methods: First, we conducted a scoping literature review to identify the range of activities applied in IF strategies. PubMed, CINAHL, and Thompson Scientific Web of Science databases were searched for English-language articles that included the term “facilitation” or other commonly used terms for the strategy published from January 1996 – December 2015. Initially, 1,471 citations/abstracts were identified and screened for relevance by two expert reviewers. Ultimately, 135 articles (from 94 unique studies) were identified for data abstraction on IF activities, frequency with which IF activities were identified as ‘core’ by study authors, and study outcomes. Next, we engaged an expert panel in a rigorous 3-stage modified Delphi consensus development process to identify core IF activities for examples of high and low complexity clinical innovations across three implementation phases (Pre-implementation, Implementation, and Sustainment phases).Results: Based on the scoping review, 32 distinct IF activities were identified and definitions/examples were developed for each. The expert panel process identified 8 core IF activities for the Pre-Implementation Phase, 8 core IF activities for the Implementation Phase, and 4 core IF activities for the Sustainment Phase.Conclusions: Core IF activities were identified based on a comprehensive scoping review of the literature followed by a rigorous expert panel consensus development process. Effective transfer of successful IF strategies from research to policy and practice requires tools to help ensure fidelity to core activities. Prototype tools for assessing IF fidelity based on the core activities identified in this work are currently being piloted.</p>"

The dust continuum emission, showing an elongated structure of ${1.^{\\prime \\prime }40} \\times {0.^{\\prime \\prime }95}$ (position angle = 43.°5) perpendicular to the outflow seen in SiO and SO, represents a rotating flattened envelope, or torus, with a radius of 7800 au inclined at 47.°5 or larger. The emissions from CH3CN, 13CS, HNCO, HC3N, SO2, DCN, H2CO, OCS, CH3OH, and C18O exhibit a consistent velocity gradient as a result of rotation. The magnitude of each velocity gradient is different, reflecting that each line samples a specific radial region. This allows us to derive a rotation curve as Vrot ∝ R0.44 ± 0.11 for 2400 au ≲  R  ≲ 14000 au, giving the dynamical mass as $M_{\\rm dyn} = 57.0^{+24.5}_{-17.1}\\, (R\\, [{\\rm au}]/3000)^{1.88}\\, M_{\\odot }$. The envelope mass independently estimated from the dust emission is 910 M⊙ (for Tdust = 180 K) for R ≤ 7800 au and 32 M⊙ (for Tdust = 300 K) for R ≤ 1700 au. The dynamical mass formula agrees well with these mass estimates within an uncertainty of a factor of three in the latter. The envelope is self-gravitating and is unstable to form spiral arms and fragments, allowing rapid accretion to the inner radii with a rate of the order of 10−2 M⊙ yr−1, although inward motion was not detected. The envelope may become a non-self-gravitating Keplerian disk at R  ≲  (300–1000) au. The formula is also consistent with the total mass ∼104 M⊙ of the entire HMC 0.15 pc (31000 au) in radius. Multiple transitions of CH3CN, HNCO, and CH3OH provide rotation temperatures of 278$^{+39}_{-30}$, 297$^{+52}_{-39}$, and 154$^{+73}_{-37}$ K, respectively, for R  ≲  1700 au, suggesting that the central source of MCN-a has an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of ∼106 L⊙. These results have revealed the structure and kinematics of MCN-a at its intermediate radii. With no broad-line H30α emission detected, MCN-a may be in the earliest phase of massive star formation.</jats:p>",

To this end, we considered twelve specific aversive traits, and additionally measured and modeled the common core of these traits. We found only weak correlations of FLHS with individual aversive traits as well as with their common core.

This study aims to determine the neutron mean free path in the slab reactor core with the neutron diffusion coefficient calculation using macroscopic cross-section data in the nuclear fuel cell level and the neutron flux distribution. The type of reactor used in this research is a fast reactor with nuclear fuel is uranium-plutonium nitride (U-PuN). The neutron mean free path is calculated for 70 energy groups of neutron by dividing the energy groups, namely the fast energy group, the intermediate energy group and the thermal energy group. The results showed that the neutron mean free path value for U-235 and Pu-239 fuels were obtained almost the same in all energy groups, namely in the fast energy group ranging from 0.11.10-2 to 0.17.10-2 cm, in the intermediate energy group 0.16.10-2 to 1.78.10-2 cm, and in the thermal energy group 0.4.0-2 to 8.04.10-2 cm. The neutron mean free path value for U-238 fuel is much smaller than that for U-235 and Pu-239 fuel, ranging from 0.03.10-2 to 0.36.10-2 cm. These results can be confirmed, because U-238 fuel is a fertile material. Keywords: Neutron mean free path, diffusion equation, neutron flux, slab reactor core</jats:p>"

Since its discovery in 1936 and the solidity hypothesis in 1940, Earth's IC has never ceased to inspire geoscientists. However, while there are many seismological observations of compressional waves and normal modes sensitive to the IC's compressional and shear structure, the shear waves that provide direct evidence for the IC's solidity have remained elusive and have been reported in only a few publications. Further advances in the emerging correlation-wavefield paradigm, which explores waveform similarities, may hold the keys to refined measurements of all IC shear properties, informing dynamical models and strengthening interpretations of the IC's anisotropic structure and viscosity. ▪ What are the shear properties of the IC, such as the shear-wave speed, shear modulus, shear attenuation, and shear-wave anisotropy? ▪ Can the shear properties be measured seismologically and confirmed experimentally? </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the future of nuclear power, the design and development of an economical, accident tolerant fuel (ATF) for use in the current pressurized water reactors (PWRs) are highly desirable and essential. It is reported that the composite fuels are advantageous over the conventional UO2 fuel due to their higher thermal conductivities and higher uranium densities. Due to higher uranium densities of the composite fuels, the use of composite fuels would lead to the significant increase of discharged burnup, thereby enhancing fuel cycle economy compared to that of the UO2 fuel. The higher thermal conductivities of composite fuels will increase the fuel safety margins. For implementation of the accident tolerant fuel concept, this study also investigates on the replacement of the conventional Zircaloy-4 cladding with SiC to minimize the hydrogen production due to interaction of water with cladding at high temperatures. In the present work, neutronic investigation of the composite fuels for a PWR has been conducted in comparison with that of the conventional UO2 fuel. Numerical calculations have been performed based on a lattice model using the SRAC2006 system code and JENDL-4.0 data library. Various parameters have been surveyed for designing a fuel with the UO2 and composite fuels such as U-235 enrichment, fuel pin pitch. In order to reduce the excess reactivity, Erbium was selected as a burnable poison due to its good depletion performance. The temperature coefficients including fuel, coolant temperature reactivity coefficients, and both the small and large void reactivity coefficients are also investigated. It was found that it is possible to achieve sufficient criticality up to 100 GWd/t burnups without compromising the safety parameters including that four reactivity coefficients are considered those associated with the fuel temperature, coolant temperature, small (5%) void and large (90%) void. Further analysis of the performance of the UO2 and composite fuels in a full core model of a PWR is being conducted.</jats:p>"

These are the so-called super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Their atmospheric composition suggests that they formed early during the gas-rich phase of the circumstellar disk and were able to avoid becoming hot Jupiters.

In this equilibrium, the atmosphere-to-core mass ratio stays well below 10%, preventing the atmosphere from becoming self-gravitating and entering runaway gas accretion. Higher core masses cause the atmosphere to become turbulent, which further enhances recycling. Compared to the core mass, the effect of the headwind on the recycling timescale is negligible. The opacity has no significant effect on the recycling timescale, which demonstrates that the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction timescale and the atmosphere-disk recycling timescale are independent of each other.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> Even for our highest core mass of 10 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>Earth</jats:sub>, atmosphere-disk recycling is efficient enough to fully compensate for radiative cooling and prevent the atmosphere from becoming self-gravitating. Hence, in-situ formation of hot Jupiters is very unlikely, and migration of gas giants is a key process required to explain their existence.

These films not only are characterized by representations that are universally appealing to contemporary tastes, but also integrate the desires and interests of the public. They have become mainstream films because they are full of realistic content and true sentiments. Regarding the narrative esthetics and ideological strategies of these films, the three new “core actions” make the powerful trend of “uniquely colorful lyricism” appear brilliantly on the screen. These core actions are: (1) revealing the true nature of life and struggle by strengthening the sense of opposing forces; (2) emphasizing comedic elements to highlight low-level esthetic charms; and (3) creating open spaces and thematic implications through the use of different phases. Obviously, it has been the inevitable choice of new mainstream films to restore sincerity and truth of the screen, to sense the changes in people and society, and to interpret the new modern and contemporary histories in ways that originated from, but rise above, reality.</jats:p>",

The pore volume that is available for oil uptake amounts to 85–90% of the total volume of the sorbent. When it is introduced to a crude oil–water mixture, the sorbent selectively absorbs the oil instantaneously. The gelator in the shell congeals the oil in the shell matrix, forming a rigid enclosure for the absorbed oil and this allows the collection of the oil‐absorbed sorbents without dripping. The absorbed oil can be recovered quantitatively by simple pressing. The method is general and works with all kinds of crude oils. The cheaply available natural raw materials and easy preparation make this method attractive in terms of economy, reliability, scalability, practicability, and greenness.</jats:p>",

Making this resource accessible for interactive analysis at scale requires efficient approaches for its storage and indexing. There have recently been remarkable advances in building compressed representations of <jats:italic>annotated</jats:italic> (or <jats:italic>colored</jats:italic>) <jats:italic>de Bruijn graphs</jats:italic> for efficiently indexing <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer sets. However, approaches for representing quantitative attributes such as gene expression or genome positions in a general manner have remained underexplored. In this work, we propose <jats:italic>counting de Bruijn graphs</jats:italic>, a notion generalizing annotated de Bruijn graphs by supplementing each node–label relation with one or many attributes (e.g., a <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer count or its positions). Counting de Bruijn graphs index <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer abundances from 2652 human RNA-seq samples in over eightfold smaller representations compared with state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and is faster to construct and query. Furthermore, counting de Bruijn graphs with positional annotations losslessly represent entire reads in indexes on average 27% smaller than the input compressed with gzip for human Illumina RNA-seq and 57% smaller for Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing of viral samples. A complete searchable index of all viral PacBio SMRT reads from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (152,884 samples, 875 Gbp) comprises only 178 GB. Finally, on the full RefSeq collection, we generate a lossless and fully queryable index that is 4.6-fold smaller than the MegaBLAST index. The techniques proposed in this work naturally complement existing methods and tools using de Bruijn graphs, and significantly broaden their applicability: from indexing <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer counts and genome positions to implementing novel sequence alignment algorithms on top of highly compressed graph-based sequence indexes.</jats:p>",

In this study, we propose a spatially separated multiwavelength filter based on a 2D chirped fiber grating. The resonant fields of lasers with different wavelengths are spatially separated, reducing cross-gain modulation. In addition, the structure of the 2D chirped fiber grating is analyzed, and the spectral output characteristics of the device are investigated for different grating parameters, which provides theoretical guidance for designing such a novel optical comb filter. Furthermore, by fabricating the 2D chirped fiber grating onto a single-mode fiber, a multiwavelength filter with 17 wavelengths, a frequency interval of approximately 88 GHz, and a grating length of 4.8 cm is created. This device is characterized by its compact structure and simple fabrication method.</jats:p>"

This study, for the 1st time, investigated angiogenic sprouting in free-standing two-vasculature-embedded scaffold with three different culture conditions and additional GFs. A two-core laminar flow device continuously extruded one vascular channel with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a 3 mg/ml type-1 collagen, one hollow channel, and a shell layer with 2% w/v gelatin-alginate (70:30) composite. Under the GF flowing condition, angiogenic sprouting from the HUVEC vessel had started since day 1 and gradually grew toward the hollow channel on day 10. Due to the medium flowing, the HUVECs showed elongated spindle-like morphology homogeneously. Their viability has been over 80% up to day 10. This approach could apply to vascular investigation, and drug discovery further, not only to the engineered thick tissue.</jats:p>"

The sandwich panel is composed of three-phase composites with polymer/Graphene platelet/fiber skins at the top and bottom surfaces and an auxetic honeycombs core layer with a negative Poisson’s ratio. The motion equations of the panel within the framework of higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) and von Kármán nonlinearity are driven. In addition to Krumhaar’s modified supersonic piston, unsteady aerodynamic pressure in the supersonic flow regime is considered. The governing equations of the sandwich panel are derived by implementing Hamilton’s principle and solved by the generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM). Validation of the present formulation is assessed by comparing the numerical results with those available in the open literature. Then, the effects of several parameters such as geometric parameters, volume fraction, Mach number, different boundary conditions, yaw angle, and different inclined angles on the nonlinear aeroelastic stability of sandwich panels are examined. Finally, it was found that the ratio of core thickness, inclined angle, and Mach number have significant effects on aerodynamic pressure. </jats:p>",

Their evolution is heavily influenced by their internal mixing, allowing the stars to live longer and yield a more massive helium core at the end of their main-sequence evolution. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for studying stellar interiors by providing direct probes of the interior physics of the oscillating stars. This work revisits the recently derived internal mixing profiles of 26 slowly pulsating B stars observed by the Kepler space telescope, in order to investigate how well the mixing profiles can in fact be distinguished from one another as well as provide predictions for the expected helium core masses obtained at the end of the main-sequence evolution. We find that for five of these stars the mixing profile is derived unambiguously, while the remaining stars have at least one other mixing profile which explains the oscillations equally well. Convective penetration is preferred over exponential diffusive overshoot for ≈55% of the stars, while stratified mixing is preferred in the envelope (≈39%). We estimate the expected helium core masses obtained at the end of the main-sequence evolution and find them to be highly influenced by the estimated amount of mixing occurring in the envelopes of the stars.</jats:p>",

The framework provides a powerful tool for rapidly deciphering and understanding the evolution of the mindset of different corporate brands. Therefore, this paper deeply analyzes the core value strategy of corporate social responsibility in the current new era, finds out the deficiencies, and explores its root causes.

The severe accident management strategy for In-Vessel Retention—or IVR—consists in stabilizing the corium within the reactor pressure vessel by external cooling of the vessel’s lower head. If now, the vessel fails due to excessive thermal loading on its walls, the Ex-Vessel Retention—or EVR—strategy is adopted. In this case, the core melt stabilization can be achieved by effective corium spreading, either in the reactor vessel cavity or in a dedicated “core-catcher”, and cooling by water. The success of both strategies highly depends on the corium behavior at high temperatures, conditioning vessel’s integrity for IVR, and promotion for the spreading of the EVR.

Methods: The descriptive cross-cultural linguistic validation study in which PedsQL Generic core scale was conducted by following Bombardier, Beaton and Guillemin’s guidelines for cross cultural adaptation. The study was conducted in different phases i.e. translation and validation. The original English version of PedsQL was translated into Urdu by two individuals, one with an Urdu background and the other from a medical background, during the translation phase (T1, T2) (Forward translation). The T3, T4 Versions were then developed by two independent translators (one with an English background and the other with a medical background). The T1, T2, T3, and T4 versions were compared to the original English version and evaluated by a group of multilingual specialists, resulting in the T5-urdu version. Twenty pediatric rehab professionals were given the T5-urdu version to validate.  Results: Chronbach’s alpha value of PedsQL of both child and parent reported after translation were 0.986 and 0.987 respectively and after testing on population were 0.956 and 0.910   respectively. P-values showed significant results which are &lt;0.05 in all domains. The inter domain correlations of child and parent reports after translation and testing on population were &gt;0.70 that interpreted good Pearson correlation. The interclass coeffieneint was ranged from 0.541-0.982.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Core stabilization exercise has become a well-known trend in fitness. The diaphragm, which is a component of core stability, plays a role in respiration and stabilizing the trunk by controlling intra-abdominal pressure. Abdominal exercises, such as sit-ups and leg lifts, are used to enhance the strength of the core muscles. Correct breathing (especially as it involves the respiratory muscles) is vital to abdominal training because respiratory muscles are directly involved during common core stability exercises. This is an experimental study where pre and post design is used. This study was done on a healthy population; a total number of 30 subjects were taken according to the inclusion criteria. 15 subjects in Group-A received five core stabilization exercises combined with diaphragmatic breathing with pre and post-test analysis and 15 subjects in Group-B received resting breathing and diaphragmatic breathing with pre and post-test analysis. 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) were measured. Based on the inter-group analysis, Group-A (Experimental Group) showed greater improvement p &lt; 0.05 than Group-B (Control Group) in post-test on 6MWT as well as FEV1, FVC, PEF. All the interventions have brought about some improvement (p&lt;0.05) in each group post-treatment based on the mean score but its significance varies. The significance of this study is that it showed the relationship between the core muscles and respiratory functions. So, this study can be concluded that the exercise protocol of core stability exercise with diaphragmatic breathing could improve respiratory functions significantly as compared to resting breathing and diaphragmatic breathing exercise alone.\n </jats:p>"

The advent of IoT makes it possible for physical things to transmit, process, compute, and receive data over internet. But, it also introduces in‐device communication security vulnerabilities. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) IP has been used to address security vulnerabilities in IoT. It is an efficient and high‐performance crypto algorithm used in IoT devices for secure and fast data encryption. However, due to rise of many attacks, the security of AES IP is also under threat. Hardware obfuscation is one such prominent countermeasure that mitigates hardware attacks such as tampering, reverse engineering, and malicious alteration. This article presents secure AES IP mechanism using the potential technique of obfuscation inspired by the concept of combinational hardware Trojan. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is resilient against reverse‐engineering, malicious alteration, Boolean satisfiability attack, and key‐sensitizing attacks. The confusion and diffusion features of obfuscated AES IP are higher in terms of Hamming distance, avalanche effect, and balance rate. The proposed technique is implemented in Basys‐3 FPGAs within 5% of power and area overhead while maintaining high throughput.</jats:p>",

Most current AI solutions use this modality to analyze the EEG signals in an automated manner to identify the epileptic seizure focus. To develop AI system for identifying the epileptic focus, there are many recently-published AI solutions based on biomarkers or statistic features that utilize interictal EEGs. In this review, we survey these solutions and find that they can be divided into three main categories: (i) those that use of biomarkers in EEG signals, including high-frequency oscillation, phase-amplitude coupling, and interictal epileptiform discharges, (ii) others that utilize feature-extraction methods, and (iii) solutions based upon neural networks (an end-to-end approach). We provide a detailed description of seizure focus with clinical diagnosis methods, a summary of the public datasets that seek to reduce the research gap in epilepsy, recent novel performance evaluation criteria used to evaluate the AI systems, and guidelines on when and how to use them. This review also suggests a number of future research challenges that must be overcome in order to design more efficient computer-aided solutions to epilepsy focus detection.</jats:p>",

We review the experimental evidence that crowding affects the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein stability and protein association and discuss the theories employed to explain these observations. In doing so, we highlight differences between synthetic polymers and biologically relevant crowders. Theories based on hard-core interactions predict only crowding-induced entropic stabilization. However, experiment-based efforts conducted under physiologically relevant conditions show that crowding can destabilize proteins and their complexes. Furthermore, quantification of the temperature dependence of crowding effects produced by both large and small cosolutes, including osmolytes, sugars, synthetic polymers, and proteins, reveals enthalpic effects that stabilize or destabilize proteins.Crowding-induced destabilization and the enthalpic component point to the role of chemical interactions between and among the macromolecules, cosolutes, and water.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The 5G networks aim to realize a massive Internet of Things (IoT) environment with low latency. IoT devices with weak security can cause Tbps-level Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on 5G mobile networks. Therefore, interest in automatic network intrusion detection using machine learning (ML) technology in 5G networks is increasing. ML-based DDoS attack detection in a 5G environment should provide ultra-low latency. To this end, utilizing a feature-selection process that reduces computational complexity and improves performance by identifying features important for learning in large datasets is possible. Existing ML-based DDoS detection technology mostly focuses on DDoS detection learning models on the wired Internet. In addition, studies on feature engineering related to 5G traffic are relatively insufficient. Therefore, this study performed feature selection experiments to reduce the time complexity of detecting and analyzing large-capacity DDoS attacks in real time based on ML in a 5G core network environment. The results of the experiment showed that the performance was maintained and improved when the feature selection process was used. In particular, as the size of the dataset increased, the difference in time complexity increased rapidly. The experiments show that the real-time detection of large-scale DDoS attacks in 5G core networks is possible using the feature selection process. This demonstrates the importance of the feature selection process for removing noisy features before training and detection. As this study conducted a feature study to detect network traffic passing through the 5G core with low latency using ML, it is expected to contribute to improving the performance of the 5G network DDoS attack automation detection technology using AI technology.</jats:p>"

The aims of this study were to identify the needs of public health competencies for medical doctors in Thailand and to assess the level of integration for technical collaboration in teaching public health. Method: A total of 17 out of 21 Thai medical schools participated in the national survey. Qualitative inquiries applied focus group interviews of community representatives from ten sample villages and in-depth interviews of representatives from stakeholder organizations particularly employers. The list of public health competencies framework recommended by WHO-SEARO was applied. Quantitative analysis applied descriptive analysis using STATA 15 and qualitative findings were validated by interrelating the meaning of themes from Word Clouds created in NVivo12. Data integration applied a mixed-method Quan-qual approach. Results: 17 medical schools returned the questionnaires (80.95 % yield). The most common regionally-defined public health competencies (in over 70% of schools) were shown to be: Biostatistics, Community Medicine, Epidemiology, Family Medicine, Medical Ethics and Professional Laws, Preventive Medicine, Health Promotion, Holistic Care, and Research. The curriculum in only one medical school lacked Health Economics, whilst Disaster Management was lacking in two other schools. Discipline-based subjects were found to be more prevalent than interdisciplinary competencies. A variety of methods were being applied for teaching public health. The majority of the schools applied lecture as the main teaching method and multiple-choice questions as the main assessment method. Thai communities expect the doctors to get in touch with the community more often, lead the primary health care team through training the health professionals and community health volunteers, and educate the community for better health. Conclusion: Human resource is the main challenge in addressing interdisciplinary competencies. It is necessary to establish a collaborating mechanism among the big and small medical schools and the faculties of public health to improve the teaching of public health to undergraduate students in medical schools. There is also a need to strengthen the health system science and leadership so that future MDs can lead health service delivery according to the needs of their employers such as the Ministry of Public Health and the Rural Doctors Association. The findings of this study may help to identify a national framework of public health core competencies for medical schools and create a common platform for interdisciplinary collaborations.</jats:p>"

Due to climate change, current fitness patterns could vary in the future ecological scenario, as highly performant lineages can undergo maladaptation under the new climatic contexts. Peripheral populations have been argued to represent a potential source of species adaptation against climate change, but experimental evidence is poor. This paper considers the consequences of within- and between-population mating between a large core population and the southernmost population, the rare Dianthus guliae, to evaluate optimal AGF design under current and future conditions. We performed experimental self-pollinations and within- and between-population cross-pollinations to generate seed material and test its adaptive value to aridity. Seed germination, seedling growth and survival were measured under current and expected aridity. Effects of population type, pollination treatment and stress treatment on fitness components were analysed by generalized linear models. Relative measures of inbreeding depression and heterosis were taken under different stress treatments. Self-pollination reduced fitness for all the considered traits compared to within- and between-population cross-pollination. Under current aridity regime, the core population expressed higher fitness, and a larger magnitude of inbreeding depression. This indicated the core unit is close to its fitness optimum and could allow for restoring the fitness of the small peripheral population. Contrarily, under increased aridity, the fitness of outbred core lineages decreased, suggesting the rise of maladaptation. In this scenario, AGF from the small peripheral population enhanced the fitness of the core unit, whereas AGF from the core population promoted a fitness loss in the peripheral population. Hence, the small peripheral population could improve fitness of large core units versus climate change, while the contrary could be not true. Integrating reciprocal breeding programmes and fitness analyses under current and predicted ecological conditions can support optimal AGF design in a long-term perspective.</jats:p>",

The proposed concept is realized with biocompatible materials in a simplified design that delivers multi‐stimuli sensitivity with high spatial resolution, all of which are prerequisites for an efficient electronic skin. While the piezoelectricity of ZnO provides sensitivity to external force, the thermoresponsiveness of the hydrogel core provides sensitivity to surrounding temperature and humidity changes. The hydrogel core exerts mechanical stress onto the ZnO shell, which is translated to a measurable piezoelectric signal. A localized force sensitivity of 364 ± 66 pC N<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> is achieved with very low cross talk between 0.25 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> pixels. Additionally, the sensor's sensitivity to humidity is demonstrated at 25 and 40 °C, i.e., above and below the hydrogel's lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 34 °C. The largest response to temperature is obtained at high humidity and below the hydrogel's LCST. The sensor response to force, humidity, and temperature is significantly faster than the system's intrinsic or excitation‐induced time scale.

Further, our calculated total production spectrum released into the interstellar medium demonstrates spectral consistency at high energy (HE) with the injection spectrum of Galactic CRs, which is required in propagation models. The magnetic field structure effectively influences the emission morphology of SNRs as it governs the transportation of particles and the synchrotron emissivity.

Acoustic metamaterials can break the law of mass in specific frequency bands and have high sound transmission loss (STL); however, the resonance frequency is difficult to regulate. To solve this problem, this paper first proposes an infinitely large metamaterial honeycomb core sandwich plate, which can generate newly tuned piezoelectric resonance frequencies, and we study its STL. The structure has piezoelectric patches arranged in sub-wavelength arrays with inductance shunting circuits that are elastically connected to both sides of the honeycomb core sandwich plate. The effective dynamic mass density and effective dynamic bending stiffness of the metamaterial plates were obtained using the effective medium (EM) method. A theoretical model for the numerical calculation of oblique STL and diffuse-field STL was established by the structural bending wave method. The finite element simulation method was used to verify that the metamaterial plates can generate three peaks at 1147 Hz, 1481 Hz and 1849 Hz in oblique or diffuse-field STL curves, which reached 57 dB, 86 dB and 63 dB, respectively, and are significantly better than the plate rigidly connected with piezoelectric sheets and the bare plate with the same mass. In order to better understand the characteristics of STL, the explicit functions of the resonance frequencies were derived. Key influencing factors were analyzed, and the regulation law of new piezoelectric resonance frequencies was clarified.</jats:p>"

This may indicate a Lower Paleolithic origin of the Levallois method, although the circumstances leading to its emergence, spread and assimilation are still debated. We aim at contributing towards this intriguing issue by studying patterns of flint procurement and exploitation at Late Acheulian Jaljulia (Israel; ∼500–300 kya). We classified artifacts into flint types, using four samples: a general sample, bifaces, “regular” cores with one/two striking platforms, and prepared cores, divided into proto-Levallois, prepared (general) and discoid cores. A geologic survey located potential flint sources, and a petrographic analysis was used to assign flint types to sources. Our results show that while local Turonian flint of the Bi’na Formation dominates the general sample, selectivity in using specific flint types was observed, including among local materials. While brecciated flint types are especially common among handaxes and discoid cores, among proto-Levallois and prepared cores (general), fine-textured homogenous flint types are more common, suggesting that such flint types are better-suited when improved control over the end-product was desired. Based on our results, and following previous suggestions, we support the hypothesis that prepared core technologies in the Levant did not originate from one single technological trajectory. We support the idea that the production of predetermined blanks was based on knowledge gathered from several technological trajectories, including mainly biface shaping and the production of flakes from regular cores. This novel method was most likely transmitted time and again between individuals, gradually adjusting it to produce improved end-products. We see these conclusions as additional support for the view of prepared core technologies at the Late Acheulian as a demonstration of cumulative culture, and the existence of high-fidelity social learning mechanisms in practice already during the late Lower Paleolithic of the Levant.</jats:p>"

While freely diffusing TOM-CC molecules are predominantly in a high permeability state, non-mobile molecules are mostly in an intermediate or low permeability state. We explain this behavior by the mechanical binding of the two protruding Tom22 subunits to the hydrogel and a concomitant combinatorial opening and closing of the two β-barrel pores of TOM-CC. TOM-CC could thus represent a β-barrel membrane protein complex to exhibit membrane state-dependent mechanosensitive properties, mediated by its two Tom22 subunits.</jats:p>"

The subject of research is the Mishrif formation core from one of the Mesopotamian oil-and-gas province field wells. At the first stage the 3 lithological petrophysical rocks types were identified based on core nuclear magnetic resonance experiments taking into account structural features, which are determined with description data of thin sections. At the second stage the 5 petrophysical rocks types were identified based on routine and special core analyses taking into account secondary changes influence, which is determined by thin sections description data. The identified petrophysical rocks types were described in detail, linear discriminant functions were deduced. These functions allow predicting the identified petrophysical types with the suggested parameters. Comparison of the lithological petrophysical and petrophysical types has shown that the pore space structure of the studied deposits depended on two factors: the first is structural features and the second is postdepositional alterations.</jats:p>",

Prior work has studied the schedulability analysis of global scheduling for real-time multi-core systems with shared caches. This article considers another common scheduling paradigm: partitioned scheduling in the presence of shared cache interference. To achieve this, we propose CITTA, a cache interference-aware task partitioning algorithm. We first analyze the shared cache interference between two programs for set-associative instruction and data caches. Then, an integer programming formulation is constructed to calculate the upper bound on cache interference exhibited by a task, which is required by CITTA. We conduct schedulability analysis of CITTA and formally prove its correctness. A set of experiments is performed to evaluate the schedulability performance of CITTA against global EDF scheduling and other greedy partition approaches such as First-fit and Worst-fit over randomly generated tasksets and realistic workloads in embedded systems. Our empirical evaluations show that CITTA outperforms global EDF scheduling and greedy partition approaches in terms of task sets deemed schedulable.</jats:p>",

Results suggested that microbiota assembly along the two compartments were predominantly shaped by the environment (especially pH, relative humidity, and geniposide acid) and not by host genotype or compartment niche. There were 690 shared genera in the rhizosphere soil and bark, and the bark microbiota was mainly derived from rhizosphere soil.

Metabolic functions of the core microbiota included ammonia oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and polyhydroxybutyrate storage, which are closely related to plant growth or metabolism.

In this study, we used mRNA‐sequencing analysis to investigate the early antipathogen response of the model macroalga <jats:italic>Delisea pulchra</jats:italic> (Rhodophyta) under the environmental conditions that are known to promote the onset of disease. Using de novo assembly methods, 27,586 unique transcripts belonging to <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>pulchra</jats:italic> were identified that were mostly affiliated with stress response and signal transduction processes.

Fucosyltransferase 8 (Fut8) is the only enzyme in mammals that catalyzes CF and following activation, both expression of Fut8 and CF synthesis increases on CD8+ T cells. To test the hypothesis that CF of N-glycans regulates memory T cell differentiation following acute viral infection, we generated mice with a floxed Fut8 gene. WT (CD4-Cre−) and Fut8−/− (CD4-Cre+) mice were infected with LCMV Armstrong (LCMV-Arm) and the differentiation of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells was analyzed by measuring the surface expression of killer-cell lectin like receptor G1 (KLRG1) and the α chain of interleukin 7 receptor (CD127) to identify short-lived effector and memory precursor T cells, respectively. LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells from both WT and Fut8−/− followed the same pattern of expansion and contraction without any significant difference in the overall frequency of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells. However, Fut8−/− retained a higher percentage of CD127+ KLRG1− and a lower percentage of KLRG1+ CD127− CD8 T cells throughout the course of infection suggesting CF influences the progression to long-term memory. At day 42 post infection, mice were infected with virulent Listeria monocytogenes expressing the LCMV epitope GP33–41. Both WT and Fut8−/− GP33-specific CD8+ T cells expanded equally. However, Fut8−/− retained a higher frequency of GP33-specific CD8+ T cells and did not undergo contraction until &amp;gt;3 weeks post-2ry challenge. Taken together, our findings suggest that CF of N-linked glycans regulates memory CD8+ T cell differentiation following acute viral infection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Supported by grants from NIH (R21 AI159401)</jats:p>",

Six weeks pilates training programme has been formulated to see the effectiveness of training programme on core muscles strength and BMI. The core muscles strength has been tested by ‘Bunkie Test’ through the performance of functional lines before the training starts and after completion of six weeks pilates training programme and BMI has been calculated by height and weight. Significant improvement in core muscles strength as well as on BMI has been found by analysing and comparing the pre-test and post-test score through descriptive analysis and ANCOVA among the obese children of PTG and CG.

There are no clinical and radiologic criteria for differentiating leiomyoma from malignant uterine tumors. However, some ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging findings may be informative. We present a technique of ultrasound-guided trans-uterine cavity (UG-TUC) core needle biopsy for uterine lesions. As the procedure is an in-organ biopsy, there is no risk of needle canal contamination. The technique also enables the biopsy of lesions inaccessible by the transvaginal tru-cut biopsy. The core needle of the automatic biopsy system is inserted via the cervical canal into the uterine cavity and is directed and activated at the myometrial lesion under ultrasound control. The standard local treatment of localized uterine sarcomas is en bloc total hysterectomy; for fibroids, there are multiple options including conservative management or tumorectomy and tumor morcellation using minimally invasive techniques. Fragmentation of the sarcoma significantly worsens oncologic outcomes and should therefore be avoided. The UG-TUC core needle biopsy of uterine lesions can complement imaging to obtain sufficient material for histologic and molecular analyses of suspected or undetermined lesions, thus facilitating treatment planning and decreasing the risk of unsuspected sarcomas.</jats:p>"

Although the risks of CNB are low, the most common complications include bleeding and hematoma formation. Post-procedural bleeding is of particular concern in patients taking antithrombotic therapy, but there is currently no widely established standard protocol in the United States to guide antithrombotic therapy management. In the face of an increasing number of patients taking antithrombotic therapy and with the advent of novel classes of anticoagulants, the American College of Radiology guidelines recommend that radiologists consider cessation of antithrombotic therapy prior to CNB on a case-by-case basis. Lack of consensus results in disparate approaches to patients on antithrombotic therapy undergoing CNB. There is further heterogeneity in recommendations for cessation of antithrombotic therapy based on the modality used for image-guided biopsy, target location, number of simultaneous biopsies, and type of antithrombotic agent. A review of the available data demonstrates the safety of continuing antithrombotic therapy during CNB while highlighting additional procedural and target lesion factors that may increase the risk of bleeding. Risk stratification of patients undergoing breast interventional procedures is proposed to guide both pre-procedural decision-making and post-procedural management. Radiologists should be aware of antithrombotic agent pharmacokinetics and strategies to minimize post-procedural bleeding to safely manage patients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A Silurian–Devonian metamorphic core complex has recently been recognized in northwest Spitsbergen, on the northwest corner of the Barents Shelf at the junction between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The associated Keisarhjelmen detachment, a major, ductile-brittle fault zone, is 200–500 m thick and has a map trace &amp;gt;150 km. A top-to-the-north transport direction is parallel to the axis of a large-scale, shallowly north-plunging, detachment corrugation. This detachment zone separates overlying faulted Silurian–Devonian aged cover strata from underlying migmatitic rocks in the core. The detachment shows a diverse array of fault and metamorphic rocks with structural ascent, ranging from sheared migmatite, mylonite, ultramylonite, foliated cataclasite, pseudotachylite, and breccia. Footwall post-kinematic granitic intrusions occurred shortly prior to, and likely during, deposition of the older cover strata. Variably deformed, syn-kinematic granitic sheets and veins within the detachment zone are considered coeval. Thin sections show significant grain size reduction, porphyroclasts, and well-developed composite fault surfaces. Relict garnet sigma porphyroclasts associated with chlorite and sericite indicate retrogression. Feldspar porphyroclasts show significant sericite alteration, undulose extinction and limited recrystallization low in the detachment, and brittle deformation throughout. Quartz deformation textures and grain size vary considerably within and between samples. Deformation during retrogression continued into the brittle realm with the development of thick foliated cataclasites, fault breccias, and local pseudotachylites concentrated at the top of the detachment. Biotite in particular shows grain size reduction, concentration along C-surfaces, and shredding and redistribution, suggesting it played a significant role in both ductile and brittle faulting. Veins, micro-veins, and fluid inclusion planes are ubiquitous throughout the detachment, indicating substantial fault-related fluid flow. Given existing geochronologic and P-T (pressure-temperature) data from the basement rocks of the area, the kinematics, retrogression, and ductile-brittle transition are consistent with exhumation of a core complex developing by orogen-parallel extension associated with transtension during the Late Silurian and Early to Middle Devonian in northwest Spitsbergen. Remaining questions include how this core complex connects with coeval plate-scale strike-slip faults in Svalbard, and its relationship to mainland Norwegian core complexes and Devonian basins to the south.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive whole-joint disease; no disease-modifying drugs are currently available to stop or slow its process. Symptoms alleviation is the only treatment option. OA is the major cause of chronic pain in adults, with pain being the main symptom driving patients to seek medical help. OA pathophysiology is closely associated with the innate immune system, which is also closely linked to pain mediators leading to joint pain. Pain research has shown sex differences in the biology of pain, including sexually dimorphic responses from key cell types in the innate immune system. Not only is OA more prevalent in women than in men, but women patients also show worse OA outcomes, partially due to experiencing more pain symptoms despite having similar levels of structural damage. The cause of sex differences in OA and OA pain is poorly understood. This review provides an overview of the involvement of innate immunity in OA pain in joints and in the dorsal root ganglion. We summarize the emerging evidence of sex differences regarding innate immunity in OA pain. Our main goal with this review was to provide a scientific foundation for future research leading to alternative pain relief therapies targeting innate immunity that consider sex differences. This will ultimately lead to a more effective treatment of pain in both women and men.</jats:p>"

In order to determine the flexural strength of the sandwich panels, they have been subjected to three-point bending and compressive loads. From the results of the study, it was figured out that: (a) Adding 1–3 wt% of nano-silica into the glass fiber had the most desirable effects on the enhancement of flexural strength of the sandwich panels (b) PU has improved the flexural strength of sandwich panels (c) The new M-shaped core can well postpone the buckling and failure of the composite sandwich structures. </jats:p>",

This model involves the merger during a common-envelope phase of an oxygen/neon/magnesium composition white dwarf and the core of a hydrogen-rich or helium-rich non-degenerate star, leading to the creation of peculiar new types of objects. The results of binary population synthesis simulations show that the CMIC channel could make important contributions to the populations of (millisecond) pulsars, T$\\dot{\\rm Z}$Os, magnetars, and BHs. The possibility of superluminous supernovae powered by T$\\dot{\\rm Z}$Os, magnetars, and BHs formed through the CMIC model is also being investigated. Magnetars with immediate matter surroundings formed after the CMIC might be good sources for fast radio bursts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Core descriptions provide an essential element of ground truth to subsurface reservoir characterizations, but adequate core characterization and interpretation require a significant time commitment from geoscientists because they are usually done manually. Moreover, core characterizations and interpretations often are inconsistent because they are made at different times by different people. We have used deep-learning segmentation networks, trained using worldwide data sets labeled by specialists, to infer lithofacies and structural features on core images. These networks are not intended to provide perfect core descriptions, but rather to provide high-level fully digital characterizations that can be quickly checked for quality and manually fixed if needed. This ensures that all available and relevant data can be used and relieves geoscientists from the most repetitive characterization tasks to allow them to focus on more complex and value-adding integration and interpretation. We test the previously trained networks in legacy public data from a UK field as an example. There are more than 1300 m of released core images in the field, together with multiple vintages of fault interpretations, that significantly differ from one another. Integrating core and seismic-scale structural characterizations is critical because the best reservoir facies are the most prone to deform via permeability-reducing processes. Detailed structural characterization and identification of individual structural features achieved through deep learning provide an unprecedented amount of data to highlight areas where the seismic-scale fault interpretations and core-scale structural interpretations are inconsistent, yielding valuable insights to validate fault interpretation. </jats:p>",

PfATP4 maintains sodium homeostasis in the parasite and its inhibition causes the death of the parasite through a mechanism that mimics premature schizogony. Over the past few years, we and others have identified ~20 different chemotypes of molecules that can disrupt sodium homeostasis via PfATP4. We have developed two series of potent PfATP4 inhibitors with a pyrazole and/or benzimidazole core and tested them on wild type and lab resistant strains of P. falciparum. However, due to lack of PfATP4 crystal structure, we have limited understanding of the structure‐activity relationship among the analogs of these molecules and the mechanism of inhibition of PfATP4 which has hindered the rational optimization of the discovered inhibitors. In this study, we modeled the E1 and E2 states of PfATP4 using homology modeling with the corresponding state templates from the mammalian Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA). Models of PfATP4 were refined using molecular dynamics simulations and ~200 pyrazole and benzimidazole compounds were docked to the binding site using GOLD molecular docking software. Results from the docking study suggests that the compounds preferred mode of binding is to the proton bound E2 state of PfATP4. The docking scores significantly correlated with IC50 values with a correlation co‐efficient &gt; 0.7. Further MD simulations of the docked complexes suggested residues GLN172, GLN351, SER175 and ASN207 play a key role in ligand binding which may have a role in the development of resistance to PfATP4 inhibitors which needs further experimental validation.</jats:p>",

On this basis, a core market incorporating CCs with comparable properties enables the implementation of a tracking error approach. A prerequisite for this is the segmentation of the CC market into a core and a satellite, with the latter comprising the accumulation of the residual CCs remaining in the complement.

However, while the prime functions of individual components of the replisome have been deciphered, the more complex interactions between the components is an active area of study to understand replisome coupling. At the core of the replisome, the DnaB helicase unwinds the double strand DNA which is followed by rapid synthesis of nascent strand by Polymerase III core (Pol III core).

The unwinding kinetics of wild‐type versus mutant DnaB enzymes on different length substrates are being examined.

We continue the study of SFDM with a strong, repulsive self-interaction; the Thomas–Fermi (TF) regime of SFDM (SFDM-TF). In this model, structure formation is suppressed below a scale related to the TF radius RTF, which is close to the radius of central cores in these halos. We investigate for the first time the impact of baryons onto realistic galactic SFDM-TF halo profiles by studying the process of adiabatic contraction (AC) in such halos. In doing so, we first analyse the underlying quantum Hamilton–Jacobi framework appropriate for SFDM and calculate dark matter orbits, in order to verify the validity of the assumptions usually required for AC. Then, we calculate the impact of AC onto SFDM-TF halos of mass $\\sim 10^{11}\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot }$, with various baryon fractions and core radii, RTF ∼ (0.1–4) kpc, and compare our results with observational velocity data of dwarf galaxies. We find that AC-modified SFDM-TF halos with kpc-size core radii reproduce the data well, suggesting stellar feedback may not be required. On the other hand, halos with sub-kpc core radii face the same issue than CDM, in that they are not in accordance with galaxy data in the central halo parts.</jats:p>",

Previous research has echoed religious authorities’ concern regarding the widespread integration of new media yet has done little to delineate their narratives of legitimation. Ergo, the question is begged, how do religious communities legitimate the use of new media? Utilizing a case study approach, this study focuses on the social construction of new media’s legitimacy within the Jewish Religious-Zionist community in Israel, through an analysis of the community’s educational elite. To this end, 26 in-depth interviews with the community’s prominent educational leaders were conducted. Findings indicate 4 primary narratives that are employed to legitimate new media use: (1) acclaiming modernity; (2) sanctifying the new media; (3) promoting solidarity; and (4) religious study and the public’s ability to choose. Understanding these narratives of legitimation towards new media sheds light on the ways that modern ideas are incrementally being integrated into religious communities, and the ways the elite negotiate its integration through what can be seen as their most weighty tool, that of youth socialization.</jats:p>"

Instead, using additive manufacturing to print the internal structure of blades, upon which it would be possible to lay composite plies, could significantly reduce manufacturing costs and, as one could “3D print” topologically optimal designs, improve structural efficiency. In general, topology optimisation integrates well with additive manufacturing. There are, however, two main challenges associated with the adoption of topology optimisation in wind blade design, i.e. accounting for: (i) the aeroelastic response of blades; and (ii) the variety of different materials that would be employed, in the composite laminates as well as the printed structure. To address these challenges, the present paper proposes a new multi-step design and optimisation framework relying on the combination of three software. First, a conventional aero-servo-elastic model is used to evaluate blade loads and displacements. Next, a topology optimisation software is used to optimise the blade laminates and core structure. Third, a lattice generator is used to convert the topological optimised “grey” design into an equivalent cellular design that can be printed using additive manufacturing. The full methodology of this design framework and an initial proof-of-concept topology optimisation solution are presented in this paper.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to develop core content to prepare patients with HF for transition from hospital to home care. The content was validated by expert panelists using Delphi methods. Nineteen draft items based on literature review were developed. We established a consensus on four core sections, including 47 categories and 128 subcategories through the Delphi survey: (1) understanding HF (five categories and 23 subcategories), (2) HF medication (19 categories and 45 subcategories), (3) HF management (20 categories and 47 subcategories), and (4) HF diary (three categories and 13 subcategories). Each section provided easy-to-understand educational contents using cartoon images and large or bold letters for older patients with HF. The developed core HF educational contents showed high consensus between the experts, along with clinical validity. The contents can be used as an educational booklet for both planning discharge education of patients with HF and for post-discharge management when transitioning from hospital to home. Based on this study, a booklet series for HF patients was first registered at the National Library of Korea. Future research should focus on delivering the core content to patients with HF in convenient and accessible format through various media.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, 3D printing technology has become a practical method to realize products rapidly. It is suitable for making small quantities of products. Although it is capable of printing with a high level of geometric complexity, there is a lack of tensile strength due to its process where the products are printed layer by layer. However, this technology is potentially to be combined in a composite manufacturing process. Mostly, a composite product is made by using a mold. This mold is relatively expensive and can only create a product with less complexity. Nevertheless, the composite product has main advantages such as light, strong, and flexible. Therefore, combining these two technologies is a new breakthrough in realizing products with high complexity, light, strong, and flexible. This study aims to determine the mechanical properties of sandwich composite filled with 3D printed product as a core. Several parameters were varied including core thickness and skin thickness. The skin material was a Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) while the core material was 3D printed Polylactic Acid (PLA). The tensile and bending tests have been done in accordance with ASTM D638 and ASTM D790. The results showed that the addition of GFRP skin on the sandwich composite could significantly increase the tensile strength but did not have an impact on the flexural strength. The highest flexural strength of 50.36 MPa was achieved at 3 layers of GFRP skin while a remarkable tensile strength of 55.74 MPa was obtained at 4 layers GFRP skin. Moreover, the addition of core thickness also does not have an impact on flexural strength. The flexural strength of the 3D printed core was around 20 MPa for all thickness. However, when 2 layers of GFRP skin were used, a remarkable flexural strength of 57.67 MPa was obtained but the flexural strength was then decreased when using 10 and 15 mm cores.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Students in an upper division, stand‐alone animal physiology course at Missouri Western State University are required to have completed a freshman‐level introductory cell biology course and a sophomore‐level genetics course as prerequisites. These prerequisite courses include discussion of the eukaryotic cell membrane and basic properties and functions of the membrane. However, many students remember the basic information about membrane structure but have difficulty relating that structure to membrane function and related topics in our physiology course, including vesicular transport, primary and secondary active transport, osmosis, and current flow across the membrane. To gain a better understanding of what students recall about the cell membrane before covering membrane structure and function in class, students were given an open‐ended prompt, “What do you know about the structure and function of the animal cell membrane?” The students were allowed to work in small groups or alone, and could generate their response as drawings, written statements, or both. They were given 10 minutes to construct a response. These student responses were analyzed using the conceptual framework for the “cell membrane” core concept recently published by Michael and Modell (<jats:italic>Adv Physiol Educ</jats:italic> 2019). This activity was repeated 2 weeks after finishing discussing of the cell membrane. Prior to covering this content in class, 100% (19 out of 19) submissions included a drawing or description of the cell membrane as a phospholipid bilayer, and 84% of submissions included integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Similar percentages of students included these concepts in the post‐coverage assessment. However, other components of the “cell membrane” conceptual framework were included much less frequently or not at all prior to covering the content in class, but improved dramatically afterwards. In the pre‐assessment, only 11% of responses included solute concentration gradients or selective permeability, while 70% of responses in the post‐assessment included this concepts. In the pre‐assessment less than 10% mentioned vesicular transport, receptors, or channel proteins; after covering the content in class, these topics were included by 15%, 45%, and 35% of student responses, respectively. This quick activity provides valuable information about what students recall from prior coursework and what concepts need to be revisited before moving into more detailed discussion of cell membrane function. When used in addition to objective exam or assignment questions, this free‐response activity can also provide a complementary view of student understanding of core concepts of the cell membrane.</jats:p>",

This characteristic is mainly assessed considering three transport mechanisms: direct tunneling, thermionic emission, and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Here, by analyzing the effect of temperature on TER, we show that taking into account only these mechanisms may not be enough in order to fully characterize the performance of FTJ devices. We approach the electron tunneling in FTJ with the non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is able to overcome the limitations affecting the three mechanisms mentioned above. We bring evidence that the performance of FTJs is also affected by temperature–in a non-trivial way–via resonance (Gamow-Siegert) states, which are present in the electron transmission probability and are usually situated above the barrier. Although the NEGF technique does not provide direct access to the wavefunctions, we show that, for single-band transport, one can find the wavefunction at any given energy and in particular at resonant energies in the system.</jats:p>"

Physical and heat limits of the semiconductor technology require the adaptation of heterogeneous architectures in supercomputers, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) with many-core accelerators and many-core processors with management and computing cores, to maintain a continuous increase of computing performance. The transition from homogeneous multi-core architectures to heterogeneous many-core architectures can produce “potential differences” that lead to numerical perturbations and uncertainties in simulation results, which could blend with errors due to coding bugs. The development of a methodology to identify the computational perturbations and secure the model correctness is a critically important step in model development on the computer system with new architectures. We have developed a methodology to characterize the uncertainties in the heterogeneous many-core computing environment, which contains a simple multiple-column atmospheric model consisting of typical discontinuous physical parameterizations defined by on-off switches, an efficient ensemble-based test approach, and a software tool applied to the GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) and Sunway systems. Statistical distributions from ensembles of the heterogeneous systems show quantitative analyses of computational perturbations and acceptable error tolerances. The methodology explores fully understanding to distinguish between perturbations caused by platforms and discrepancies caused by software bugs, and provides encouraging references for verifying the reliability of supercomputing platforms and discussing the sensibility of Earth system modeling to the adaptation of new heterogeneous many-core architectures.\n                        </jats:p>"

In parallel, monolithic NFs consisting of blended CHT-PCD and TCL were prepared. Nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). SEM displayed the morphology of NFs and the structure of the nanowebs, while TEM evidenced the core-sheath structure of NFs prepared by coaxial electrospinning. The core diameters and sheath thicknesses were found dependent on respective flow rates of both precursor solutions. Nanofibers stability and TCL release in aqueous medium were studied and correlated with the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Results showed that the release profiles of TCL and therefore the antibacterial activity were directly related to the type of nanofibers. In the case of monolithic nanofibers, the NFs matrix was composed of polyelectrolyte complex (PEC formed between CHT and PCD) and resulted in a prolonged release of TCL and a sustained antibacterial effect. In the case of core-sheath NFs, the PEC was formed only at the core-sheath interface, leading to less stable NFs and therefore to a faster release of TCL, and to a less extended antibacterial activity compared to monolithic ones.</jats:p>"

A 16‐subunit complex termed the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) is bound to nucleosomes harboring the histone variant, CENP‐A, and is essential for assembling the mitotic kinetochore. The core centromere nucleosome complex (CCNC) consists of CENP‐A nucleosomes and CCAN subunits, CENP‐C and CENP‐N. In prior studies, we proposed that the CCNC undergoes an alteration at mitotic onset where one of two copies of CENP‐N is lost. This model indicates that there would remain only one CENP‐A nucleosome surface with both CENP‐N and CENP‐C that is competent to recruit the CCAN and, in turn, assemble the kinetochore. We hypothesize that the asymmetric surfaces on CENP‐A nucleosomes provide a level of organization of centromeric chromatin that is important for chromosome segregation. We are developing a system to study these functional relationships in cells using chemical biology approaches. We have created a cell line with complementary SNAP and HALO tags on the CCNC components and employed the SNAP‐HALO cross linker, HaXS8, to tether CCNC components (CENP‐A with CENP‐N) irreversibly on nucleosomes. Initial experiments indicate that this system is able to retain CENP‐N at high levels on mitotic centromeres in an HaXS8 concentration‐dependent fashion. This provides additional support for the model of a centromeric chromatin transition as cells enter mitosis, and our system holds promise to test predictions that arise from it.</jats:p>",

Different dependence degrees of the magnitude or occurrence of element content variation could shed light on this long-standing issue in actual large ingots. Here, based on etched surface height and grayscale, element content distributions within the solid fraction in continuous casting billets and additive manufacturing samples are first obtained by only a two-dimensional surface. Then, combined with the phylogenetic trees, the rank correlation is applied to measure the dependence of content differences during initial solidification. Assessments of external dependence degrees are helpful to determine nucleation core origin and low internal dependence degree facilitates grain refinement. Moreover, in continuous casting, some nucleation cores in the central equiaxed grain zone are confirmed to originate from the edge-chilled zone and high equiaxed grain area ratio under a low superheat, which is attributed to the low ratio of temperature gradient to growth rate rather than remelting fewer cores originating from the chilled zone. In addition, the floating behavior of separated grains originating from the chilled zone can be affected by gravity force, but these grains should be more active when increasing the casting superheat that may weaken the influence of gravity to a certain extent.</jats:p>"

Their success depends on an improved design with a tailored cathode manufacturing process. To facilitate a knowledge-driven optimal design of cathode, a model-based analysis on the impact of the cathode particle structure on the electrochemical cell performance is conducted. During production of solid-state cathodes, small active material particles such as lithium-iron phosphate tend to form large agglomerates with inner electrolyte-filled pores which have significant effect on transport properties within a secondary particle. Therefore, a battery cell model with secondary particles and optionally with a core-shell structure is developed and evaluated. Discharge performance is shown to be stronger impacted by changing the electrolyte fraction inside the particle than by changing the size of the electrolyte core within the secondary particle. A core-shell structure has a positive impact on the discharge performance and should be preferred for high power application. In contrast, cells with homogeneous agglomerate particles show better performance at low discharge rates. Thus, they are recommended for high energy and low power applications. The results of this study highlight the potentials of tailored production process for next-generation batteries.</jats:p>",

Unlike the transport barriers previously reported in the literature, the trigger mechanism for the F-ATB has been shown to be a wave-particle resonant interaction between supra-thermal particles—generated via ion cyclotron resonance heating—and ion scale plasma turbulence. This resonant mechanism strongly depends on the particular shape of the fast ion temperature and density profiles. Therefore, to further improve our theoretical understanding of this transport barrier, we present results exploring the parameter space and physical conditions for the F-ATB generation by performing a systematic study with global GENE simulations. Particular emphasis is given to the transport barrier width and its localization by scanning over different energetic particle temperature profiles. The latter are varied in amplitude, half-width, and radial localization of an ad-hoc Gaussian-like energetic particle logarithmic temperature gradient profile. For the reference parameters at hand, a threshold in the ratio between the fast ion and electron temperature and the amplitude of the fast ion logarithmic temperature gradient is identified to trigger the transport barrier effectively. The role of <jats:italic>q</jats:italic> = 1 rational surface to the transport barrier formation is investigated as well by retaining electromagnetic effects and its impact found to be negligible for this particular barrier formation mechanism.</jats:p>",

The correct evaluation and analysis of the situation can lead to the elaboration of the most efficient strategies and policies to control and mitigate its propagation. The paper proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Support (MCDS) based on the combination of three methods: the Group Analytic Hierarchy Process (GAHP), which is a subjective group weighting method; Extended Entropy Weighting Method (EEWM), which is an objective weighting method; and the COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS), which is a multi-criteria method. The COPRAS uses the combined weights calculated by the GAHP and EEWM. The sum normalization (SN) is considered for COPRAS and EEWM. An extended entropy is proposed in EEWM. The MCDS is implemented for the development of a complex COVID-19 indicator called COVIND, which includes several countries’ COVID-19 indicators, over a fourth COVID-19 wave, for a group of European countries. Based on these indicators, a ranking of the countries is obtained. An analysis of the obtained rankings is realized by the variation of two parameters: a parameter that describes the combination of weights obtained with EEWM and GAHP and the parameter of extended entropy function. A correlation analysis between the new indicator and the general country indicators is performed. The MCDS provides policy makers with a decision support able to synthesize the available information on the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

Gene ontology analyses of genes under selection revealed that different gene functions were enriched in different clades. Furthermore, some gene functions were enriched only amongst clade‐specific core or accessory genomes. Genes under purifying selection were often clade‐specific, while genes under diversifying selection showed signs of frequent HGT. These patterns are consistent with different selection pressures acting on both the core and the accessory genomes of different clades and can lead to ecological divergence in both cases. Examining variation in allelic diversity allows us to uncover genes under clade‐specific selection, allowing ready identification of strains and their ecological niche.</jats:p>",

This discipline allows a student to develop a system of spiritual values, reveal talents and acquire skills needed for professional growth. Chinese art is an integral part of the global cultural space, and Chinese contemporary art performs the functions of cultural reflection, occupying an important place in developing the state’s cultural identity. In the process of globalization, it is extremely important to study not only Chinese, but also world contemporary art, as well as the peculiarities of its teaching in the educational institutions of the PRC within the framework of the multiculturalism movement. The study objectives are to develop a unique online platform for teaching and learning contemporary art in China, to identify the features of art teacher training, to identify the methods of and trends in teaching contemporary art in the Chinese system of secondary and higher education, as well as to determine the most effective method of teaching contemporary art in China based on the experiment. In the course of the study, a plan and structure of the website containing audio and video materials, graphic editors and a conference system for students and teachers were developed. An innovative classification of the contemporary art movements was made in accordance with the tools and methods of creating art works. The styles of contemporary art were divided into groups: painting, sculpture/architecture, photography, cybernetic art, literature, optical art, theatrical art, mass culture, and hybrid art. The database was compiled by the masters of Art from China and Ireland, which emphasizes the internationality and multiculturalism of the project. An experiment was conducted to determine the level of effectiveness of different methods of teaching contemporary art in China. In the course of the experiment, the Spark platform developed for the study purpose was recognized as the most effective (56.1%). The effectiveness of the active method and passive method of teaching was 27.2% and 16.7%, respectively. The study results can be used in the study of various trends in contemporary art in the process of modernization and within the framework of pedagogical and commercial activities related to the work of exhibitions and galleries. In addition, they can be used to improve the methods of teaching contemporary art online and offline to the broad public audience and improve the professional skills of graphic or UI/UX designers, 3D modeling experts, engineers, editors, and IT developers. The practical significance of the developed online platform lies in the possibility of database use, practical application of the knowledge gained, and taking online lessons with Chinese and foreign teachers as part of a multicultural experience exchange.</jats:p>"

This retrospective case series reports the use of these drugs in children aged 2 to 13 years. Methodology: A total of 82 children (mean age, 5 years; 79% male) with ASD treated at the Kids Neuro Clinic and Rehab Center in Dubai between January 2020 and September 2021 were included in this retrospective case series. All patients had comorbid challenging behaviors that were resistant to standard supportive therapies alone and warranted pharmacological intervention. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale—2nd Edition Standard form (CARS2-ST) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)—Severity (CGI-S) and CGI—Improvement (CGI-I) scales were used to assess the severity of ASD at baseline and to monitor response to treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Results: Besides the expected improvement in comorbid challenging behaviors, 79/82 patients (96%) attained a CGI-I score of 2 or 1 following treatment, and 35/82 patients (43%) achieved both a CGI-I score of 1 and minimal-to-no symptoms as per the CARS2-ST test, with complete resolution of their ASD signs and symptoms. The differences in the overall mean CARS2-ST and CGI-S scores pre- and post-treatment were statistically significant (Z = −7.86, p &lt; 0.0001 for both), with pre- and post-treatment mean values of 42 and 23 for CARS2-ST, respectively, and 6 and 2 for CGI-S, respectively. The main side effects were asymptomatic elevated prolactin (n = 12) and excessive weight gain (n = 2). Conclusions: ASD core symptoms and comorbid behaviors in young children improved following chronic treatment with antipsychotic medications, either with or without medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, when combined with standard supportive therapies. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to verify these findings.</jats:p>"

Makaleye kaynaklık eden veri, yangının söndürülmesinin hemen ardından niteliksel yöntemle yapılmış bir alan araştırmasına dayanmaktadır. Alan araştırması, Sandras Dağı’nda bulunan ve yangından etkilenen Köyceğiz’e bağlı köylere odaklanmıştır. Araştırmanın sonuçlarını tartışan bu makale kuramsal olarak, ormana toplumsal bir aktör olarak bakabilmeyi mümkün kılan Bruno Latour’un ve Donna Haraway’in perspektiflerinden beslenmektedir. Makalede, önce yangın, yangın alanında yapılan işler, yangından etkilenenler, ağaçların, insanların ve hayvanların durumu, medyanın yangını ele alma biçimi tartışılmaktadır. Ardından yapılan alan araştırmasının sonuçlarına başvurularak yangının arka planına ilişkin üç konu ele alınmaktadır. Bunlar birincisi, bölgede yazın çok sıcak geçmiş olmasıdır.  Bu yüzden 2021 Köyceğiz orman yangınları, küresel iklim krizi sonucunda çıkan günümüz orman yangınları silsilesinin bir parçasıdır. İkincisi, orman ve insan arasındaki ilişkiler dönüşmektedir. Özellikle orman köylülerinin yaşam biçimi değişmektedir, keçi sürüleri azalmaktadır, kırsal yoksulluk arttıkça köylüler işçileşmektedir. Bu dönüşüm, ormanın bakımının aksamasına neden olduğu için yeni yangınların çıkması ihtimalini arttırmaktadır. Son olarak, neoliberal politikalarla biçimlenen bir işletme olarak orman düşüncesi, ormandan kar elde etme hırsı, ormandan yeni yerleşim alanları açılması, saldırgan madencilik gibi ilişkiler aracılığıyla ormansızlaşmaya neden olmaktadır. Bu durum yangının etkilerini ekososyal bir kriz olarak derinleştirmektedir.</jats:p>"

Since its emergence there has been great efforts to identify correlates of protection,which is crucial for vaccine evaluation studies. However, handling SARS-CoV-2 requires BSL-3 containment facilities slowing research efforts. Pseudotype viruses (PV) are a safe alternative to authentic virus that can be handled at low containment. PVs are chimeric viruses containing the core of a virus where its genome has been completely or partially replaced by a reporter gene, displaying a correctly folded SARS-CoV-2 spike on its surface. We developed lentiviral and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) core PVs alongside a stable A549 cell line expressing receptor ACE2 and protease TMPRSS2 responsible for S protein priming, for use in neutralization assays. Lentiviral PVs were generated by transfection with plasmids encoding the spike, HIV-1 gag-pol and a luciferase reporter. For VSV PVs, producer cells pre-transfected with the spike were infected with recombinant VSV expressing luciferase,before harvesting. The stable A549 cell line was generated by sequential infection of VSV-G PVs bearing lentiviral vectors encoding ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes followed by antibiotic selection, before being tested in neutralization assays. We compared lentiviral and VSV PV platforms using monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera with our stable A549 cells or HEK293T cells pre-transfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Antibody titres showed equivalence however VSV had the advantage of a shorter incubation therefore enabling a higher throughput. PVs offer a robust platform for future seroepidemiology and vaccine evaluation studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To manufacture a complicated hollow product without any assembly process, for example, the plastic intake manifold, is difficult by the traditional injection molding method. The fusible-core technique, which uses a low-melting-point alloy as a sacrificial core, was developed to solve this problem; however, the limited selection of resin type and the huge capital investment have caused this technique to spread slowly. In this work, a novel method is established that can produce similar products without the limitation of resin type, as well as a lower-energy-consumption process. The concept of the enveloped core defined by a water-soluble core assembled with a shell is proposed herein; it provides both rigidity and toughness to resist the pressure during the injection molding process. The shape of the enveloped core equals the internal contour of the designated product. An insert molding process was introduced to cover the enveloped core with a skin layer. Cut out the end of the enveloped core and immerse it into a water bath. When the water-soluble core inside the shell is dissolved, the product with a special internal contour is accomplished. A tee-joint is presented to demonstrate how the proposed method can be utilized. The optimal ingredient of the core and processing parameters are determined by the Taguchi method. The result shows that the proposed product is molded successfully when the compressive strength of the core is larger than 2 MPa. In addition, the eccentricity measurement of internal contour of the optimal sample exhibits a 56% improvement, and the required time for the core removal is less than 154 s.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We report on the experimental study of a precessing vortex core (PVC) in an air model of a Francis turbine. The focus is placed on the modal decomposition of the PVC that occurs in the draft tube of the model turbine for a range of operation conditions. The turbulent flow fluctuations in the draft tube are assessed using stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to the antisymmetric and symmetric components of the velocity fields to distinguish the dynamics of the azimuthal instabilities. The pressure pulsations induced by the PVC are measured by four pressure sensors mounted on the wall of the hydro turbine draft tube. Spatial Fourier decomposition is applied to the signals of the pressure sensors to identify the contributions of azimuthal modes, m=1 and m=2, to the total pressure fluctuations. The analysis based on velocity and pressure data shows similar results regarding the identification of the PVC. The contribution of the m=2 mode to the overall turbulent kinetic energy is significant for the part load regimes, where the flow rates are twice as low as at the best efficiency point (BEP). It is also shown that this mode is not the higher harmonic of the PVC, suggesting that it is driven by a different instability. Finally, we show a linear fit of the saturation amplitudes of the m=1 and m=2 oscillations to determine the critical bifurcation points of these modes. This yields critical swirl numbers of Scr=0.47 and 0.61, respectively. The fact that the PVC dynamics in hydro turbines are driven by two individual instabilities is relevant for the development of tailored active flow control of the PVC.</jats:p>"

Thermobarometric studies indicate that many of these Late Cretaceous metamorphic assemblages formed at pressures of &amp;gt;8 kbar, conventionally interpreted as &amp;gt;30 km depth by assuming lithostatic conditions. However, in the northern Basin and Range Province, detailed structural reconstructions and a growing body of contradictory geologic data in and around the metamorphic core complexes indicate these metamorphic rocks are unlikely to have ever been buried any deeper than ~15 km depth (~4 kbar, lithostatic). Recent models controversially interpret this discrepancy as the result of “tectonic overpressure,” whereby the high-grade mineral assemblages were formed under superlithostatic conditions without significant tectonic burial. We performed several detailed studies within the Snake Range metamorphic core complex to test the possibility that cryptic structures responsible for additional burial and exhumation might exist, which would refute such a model. Instead, our data highlight the continued discordance between paleodepth and paleopressure and suggest the latter may have reached nearly twice the lithostatic pressure in the Late Cretaceous.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>First, new detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology combined with finite-strain estimates show that prestrain thicknesses of the lower-plate units that host the high-pressure mineral assemblages correspond closely to the thicknesses of equivalent-age units in adjacent ranges rather than to those of the inferred, structurally overridden (para) autochthon, inconsistent with cross sections and interpretations that assume a lower plate with a deeper origin for these rocks. Second, new Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous material of upper- and lower-plate units identified an ~200 °C difference in peak metamorphic temperatures across the northern Snake Range detachment but did not identify any intraplate discontinuities, thereby limiting the amount of structural excision to motion on the northern Snake Range detachment itself, and locally, to no more than 7–11 km. Third, mapped geology and field relationships indicate that a pre-Cenozoic fold truncated by the northern Snake Range detachment could have produced ~3–9 km of structural overburden above Precambrian units, on the order of that potentially excised by the northern Snake Range detachment but still far short of expected overburden based on lithostatic assumptions. Fourth, finite-strain measurements indicate a shortening (constrictional) strain regime favorable to superlithostatic conditions. Together, these observations suggest that pressures during peak metamorphism may have locally reached ~150%–200% lithostatic pressure. Such departures from lithostatic conditions are expected to have been most pronounced above regions of high heat flow and partial melting, and/or at the base of regional thrust-bounded allochthons, as is characteristic of the spatial distribution of Cordilleran metamorphic core complexes during the Late Cretaceous Sevier orogeny.</jats:p>",

However, it is unclear what core members and their ecological organization ensures the stable provision of this organ’s essential health-relevant functions to the host. With high quality metagenome-assembled genomes as network nodes, here we identified two competing guilds<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>of the most stably and highly connected bacteria that together correlate with a wide range of host health conditions. Genomes in these two guilds kept their ecological relationship unchanged despite experiencing profound abundance changes during a 3-month high fiber intervention and 1-year follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The genomes of one guild harbored more genes for plant polysaccharide degradation and butyrate production, while the other guild had more genes for virulence or antibiotic resistance. A Random Forest regression model showed that the abundance distributions of these genomes were associated with 41 out of 43 bio-clinical parameters in the study cohort. With these genomes as reference, Random Forest modeling successfully classified case and control of T2DM, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, ankylosing spondylitis, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease in 12 independent metagenomic datasets from 1,816 participants across ethnicity and geography. This core microbiome signature may serve as a common target for health recovery.</jats:p>"

Polypropylene 3D multi-layer woven fabric impregnated with an epoxy resin was selected as the core, while E-glass fiber reinforced epoxy was used for the sandwich composite face sheets. The sandwich composite exhibited a ductile behavior when loaded in three-point bending as the core layers increased. This is due to the drop in core shear strength with the increased number of core layers. The core layers that were not directly connected with the face sheets deformed most under shear, resulting in a more flexible plate behavior. The number of core layers, size of core unit-cell and stitching density were the critical design parameters determining the flexural strength and stiffness of the sandwich panel. The flexural modulus of sandwich composites with higher stitching density core stiffer than those of lower stitching density. </jats:p>",

For the first time, we study the growth of dust grains during the earliest phases of star formation using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We begin with a typical interstellar dust grain size distribution and study dust growth during the collapse of a molecular cloud core and the evolution of the first hydrostatic core, prior to the formation of the stellar core. We examine how the dust size distribution evolves both spatially and temporarily. We find that the envelope maintains its initial population of small dust grains with little growth during these phases, except that in the inner few hundreds of au the smallest grains are depleted. However, once the first hydrostatic core forms rapid dust growth to sizes in excess of 100 μm occurs within the core (before stellar core formation). Progressively larger grains are produced at smaller distances from the centre of the core. In rapidly rotating molecular cloud cores, the ‘first hydrostatic core’ that forms is better described as a pre-stellar disc that may be gravitationally unstable. In such cases, grain growth is more rapid in the spiral density waves leading to the larger grains being preferentially found in the spiral waves even though there is no migration of grains relative to the gas. Thus, the grain size distribution can vary substantially in the first core/pre-stellar disc even at these very early times.</jats:p>",

Several early Cretaceous Mid‐Pacific atolls were previously investigated through ocean drilling, but due to the low quality of vintage seismic data available, few spatial constraints exist on their stratigraphic evolution and large‐scale diagenesis. Here, we present results from an integrated core‐log‐seismic study at Resolution Guyot and comparison with modern and ancient analogues. We identify six seismic‐stratigraphic units: (1) platform initiation with aggradation and backstepping through the Hauterivian which ended by platform emersion; (2) reflooding of the platform with progradation and aggradation through the Barremian till the early‐Aptian when ocean anoxic event 1a resulted in incipient drowning; (3) platform backstepping till the mid‐Aptian when the platform shifted to progradation and aggradation till the mid‐Albian; (4) platform emersion; (5) reflooding with backstepping ending at the latest‐Albian by platform emersion; and (6) final drowning. The stratigraphic surfaces bounding these units are coeval with some of the Cretaceous eustatic events, which suggest an eustatic control on the evolution of this atoll and confirm that several previously reported sea‐level variations in the early Cretaceous are driven by eustasy. Changes in subsidence and carbonate production rates and suspected later magmatism have also impacted the stratigraphic evolution. The suspected later magmatism could lead to environmental perturbations and potentially platform demise. Contrary to previous studies, we identify two emersion events during the mid‐ and late‐Albian which resulted in intensive meteoric dissolution and karstification. The platform margin syndepositional fractures interacted with the subaerial exposure events by focusing the dissolution which formed vertically stacked flank‐margin fracture‐cave system. The study gives a unique insight into the interplay between eustasy, subsidence, and volcanic activity(ies) on long‐term evolution of early Cretaceous shallow‐marine carbonates. It also documents the impact and distribution of hypogenic and epigenic fluid‐flow in atolls serving as an analogue for isolated carbonate platforms.</jats:p>",

By clustering cancer stem cells (CSCs), we discovered the ubiquitous existence of sub-cluster CSCs in all UGICs, which is named upper gastrointestinal cancer stem cells (UGCSCs). The identification of UGCSC function is coincident with the carcinogen of UGICs. We compared the UGCSC expression profile with 215,291 single cells from six other cancers and discovered that UGCSCs are specific tumor stem cells in UGIC.

These results suggest a new mechanism for carcinogenesis in UGIC: mucosa damage and repair caused by poor eating habits lead to chronic inflammation, and the persistent chronic inflammation triggers the Wnt pathway; ultimately, this process induces UGICs. These findings establish the core signal pathway that connects poor eating habits and UGIC. Our system provides deeper insights into UGIC carcinogens and a platform to promote gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis and therapy.</jats:p>"

The public’s misperceptions, hesitancy, and negative emotions toward vaccines are psychological factors discouraging vaccination. At the individual level, studies have revealed negative perceptual/behavioral outcomes of COVID-19 information exposure via social media where misinformation and vaccine fear flood. Objective: This study extends research context to the global level and investigates social media discourse on the COVID-19 vaccine and its association with vaccination rates of 192 countries in the world. Methods: COVID-19 vaccine tweets were compared by country in terms of (1) the number per million Twitter users, (2) mentions of adverse events—death, side-effects, blood clots, (3) negative sentiment (vs. positive), and (4) fear, sadness, or anger emotions (vs. joy). Artificial intelligence (AI) was adopted to classify sentiment and emotions. Such tweets and covariates (COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates, GDP, population size and density, literacy rate, democracy index, institutional quality, human development index) were tested as predictors of vaccination rates in countries. Results: Over 21.3 million COVID-19 vaccine tweets posted between November 2020 and August 2021 worldwide were included in our analysis. The global average of COVID-19 vaccine tweets mentioning adverse events was 2% for ‘death’, 1.15% for ‘side-effects’, and 0.80% for ‘blood clots’. Negative sentiment appeared 1.90 times more frequently than positive sentiment. Fear, anger, or sadness appeared 0.70 times less frequently than joy. The mention of ‘side-effects’ and fear/sadness/anger emotions appeared as significant predictors of vaccination rates, along with the human development index. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that global efforts to combat misinformation, address negative emotions, and promote positive languages surrounding COVID-19 vaccination on social media may help increase global vaccination uptakes.</jats:p>"

Thus, the need for a comprehensive study of the properties of these pigments grows more urgent, before their application to paints and varnishes. The hiding power of core/shell pigments comes close to the one of pure polyaniline (PANi), when the PANi content in the pigment reaches 50 wt.%, with sulfuric and phosphoric acids used as dopants. This paper, also, shows that the blackness value of core/shell pigments with 10 wt.% PANi is around 35 and constant; for pure PANi, their blackness value is 40. When PANi content is 5 wt.%, kaolin-based pigment shows the lowest blackness, which happens due to a generally higher whiteness of kaolin. However, when the PANi content surpasses 10 wt.%, there seems to be no influence on the blackness of the core/shell pigments. The core/shell pigment with a 20 wt.% PANi is, optically, identical to a black-iron-oxide pigment. An increase in the PANi content of the core/shell pigment leads to an increase in the oil absorption of the samples. It was found that the dispersion process would be the most energy efficient for core/shell pigments, containing kaolin and talc as a core.</jats:p>"

The increased level of S100B and the decreased levels of sTRAIL with adropin were significantly associated with moderate to severe neurologic presentation (p=0.0001, p=0.002, p=0.002, respectively). On the control CT, a large infarct core was significantly associated with decreased serum levels of sTRAIL and adropin (p=0.001 and p=0.000, respectively); however, the levels of S100B were not significantly associated with good ASPECTS score (p=0.684).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The quality of formation evaluation and reservoir estimates depends a lot on the quality of open hole logs, which is intricately tied to the borehole geometry and stand-offs. Bad borehole sections cause interesting patterns on wireline logs that can result in multiple interpretations. We have conducted an automated identification of bad borehole sections (&gt;50 ft [15 m] thick) in multiple wells in the Wolfcamp Formation in the Midland Basin of the United States and investigated the causalities behind the unstable borehole section. The wells impacted by bad hole conditions appear to be within a particular region of the northern Midland Basin, and the bad hole condition impacts a specific zone in the Wolfcamp D. We consider well logs as multivariate time series (or depth series), where they share interdependencies to a large extent. We use this concept and unsupervised multivariate time series clustering to automatically identify bad borehole sections. Our proposed workflow simultaneously clusters the wireline logs, resulting in a large labeled regional-scale data set that can be further used for log quality assurance, processing, and petrophysical modeling. More importantly, we investigate the reasons behind the borehole washout, integrating sedimentology and geochemical data. Thick borehole washout sections are related to the presence of a significant amount of clay (&gt;73 wt%, a mixture of smectite and illite) in the Wolfcamp D. The results also indicate that the manual editing of wireline logs and even supervised machine learning-based log reconstruction (commonly known as a missing log prediction problem) can lead to erroneous and inconsistent interpretation of subsurface characteristics. Such exercise can be meaningless if derived models are not validated with the ground truth (preserved subsurface rocks). </jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title/><jats:p> Geologic feature: Clay-rich unstable borehole section Log appearance: Large-to-small caliper response associated with erratic density and neutron porosity logs Features with similar appearance: Gypsum, siderite nodules, and tool failure Formation: Wolfcamp Formation Age: Wolfcampian Location: Northern Midland Basin, Texas, USA Well data: Obtained from the IHS Analysis tools: Unsupervised machine learning, core description, geochemistry, and petrophysical inversion modeling </jats:p></jats:sec>",

This study aims to analyze and compare the stress distribution in an endodontically treated maxillary first molar restored with various post and core systems and assess the benefit of the presence of an antirotational post and the effect of its length using finite element analysis. Materials and Methods. Five 3D models of maxillary first molar restored with variable designs of post and core were constructed using CT scanning and information obtained from textbook and FEM software. Variables were types of core, presence or absence of an antirotational post, and length of the antirotational post. A load of 480 (N) vertically and a load of 240 (N) with 45° to the occlusal plane were applied. Results were analyzed using 3D von Mises criteria. Results. The results showed that the most homogeneous stress distribution pattern along with dentin and the post-core system was observed in the model with one main post in the palatal canal and in the model with a two-piece core and one main post in the palatal canal and shorter antirotational post in the distal-buccal canal. However, models with one-piece core and antirotational post (either the same length or shorter than the main post) in the distal-buccal canal had the most stress concentration sites. Conclusion. In this study, it was found that the presence of an antirotational post, its length, and type of core affected the distribution of stress along the dentin and post-core system. This study indicated that if the antirotational post is considered in the post-core design, it is better to use a two-piece core type due to more homogeneous stress distribution along the dentin and post-core system.</jats:p>",

Identifying the birds with the most important structural roles can shed light on how seed dispersal systems function. Here, we characterized the seed dispersal network in a megadiverse Neotropical bird community from Brazil and quantitatively scored birds according to their importance in the network. We tested the applicability of the recent core–periphery framework based on stochastic block models and contrasted it with other metrics commonly used in ecological networks to define structurally important species. Then, we also evaluated the main attributes (body mass, degree of frugivory and abundance) associated with the role of frugivorous birds in the network. In the field we recorded 1132 mutualistic interactions between 44 bird species and 41 plant species. We identified the Silver‐beaked Tanager <jats:italic>Ramphocelus carbo</jats:italic>, Band‐tailed Manakin <jats:italic>Pipra fasciicauda</jats:italic> and Red‐legged Honeycreeper <jats:italic>Cyanerpes cyaneus</jats:italic> as the most important seed‐dispersers.

Finally, we discovered that bird abundance was the main predictor of a species' role.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Core binding factor beta (CBFβ) functions as a binding partner to the RUNX family of DNA binding transcription factors (RUNX1‐3) and acts as a transcriptional co‐activator by allosterically increasing their DNA binding. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) and Genotype‐Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets, high CBFβ expression is correlated with poor disease‐free and overall survival across 17 cancer types, including sarcomas. Of particular interest to osteosarcoma (OS) research is the interaction of CBFβ with RUNX2, the master regulator of bone growth and differentiation, also dysregulated in aggressive OS and implicated in chemoresistance. Recent research supports a non‐canonical role of CBFβ as a regulator of protein translation initiation. In breast cancer cells, this translation‐associated activity occurs via interactions with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) and allows CBFβ to influence translation of hundreds of mRNA transcripts. Binding of CBFβ to hnRNPK or RUNX1 appears mutually exclusive, suggesting possible competition between these two roles.</jats:p><jats:p>We hypothesized that CBFβ plays a role in the translation of RUNX2 and RUNX2‐target gene mRNAs in OS and that disruption of this role may result in an antitumor effect. The intertwined nature of the two roles of CBFβ hampers study of each in OS. Thus, we aimed to decouple them to identify which presents the most viable therapeutic target in OS.</jats:p><jats:p>Using CRISPR/Cas9 we generated a CBFβ knockout (KO) U2OS cell line and evaluated RUNX2 protein and mRNA levels via western blot (WB) and qRT‐PCR, respectively. Cycloheximide chase assay and proteasome inhibition were used to evaluate RUNX2 stability and degradation, respectively. Interactions between CBFβ and RUNX2 or hnRNPK were assessed via co‐immunoprecipitation. Site‐directed mutagenesis (SDM) of CBFβ and transfection of U2OS CBFβ KO cells with FLAG tagged CBFβ mutants was used to prevent RUNX2‐CBFβ interaction. WB was used to evaluate changes in subcellular CBFβ localization. Global, as well as protein‐specific, changes in de novo protein synthesis were evaluated using the Click‐IT system. Finally, <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> modeling was used to design a peptide that mimics a 10 amino acid sequence on RUNX2 in the CBFβ binding interface, which was then evaluated <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> using a recombinant RUNX2‐CBFβ pulldown assay.</jats:p><jats:p>Our results demonstrate that loss of CBFβ leads to reduced RUNX2 protein expression without changes in RUNX2 mRNA levels. RUNX2 protein half‐life is not reduced in CBFβ nor does proteasome inhibition rescue RUNX2 protein levels. CBFβ interacts with hnRNPK in OS cells, and through this binding may perform a role in oncoprotein translation in OS, specifically modulating protein levels of RUNX2. SDM of CBFβ identified important residues for RUNX2 binding, which when targeted via a peptide resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in CBFβ and RUNX2 interaction. Ribosome footprinting combined with RNAseq and immunoprecipitation‐mass spectrometry utilizing WT U2OS, CBFβ mutants and peptide‐inhibited cells will provide further information on the translational role of CBFβ and potential therapeutic targets in OS.</jats:p>",

To fill the gap for vibroacoustic characteristics, this paper focuses on proposing a model to investigate sound transmission through double-walled cylindrical shells with a circumferentially corrugated core. The structure is composed of outer and inner isotropic layers and a corrugated core. The outer layer is subjected to an oblige plane wave, and also a subsonic flow is traveling outside the double-walled shell. An equivalent method is applied to replace the corrugated core as axial, radial, and rotational springs with specific stiffness coefficients. The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is applied to describe the behavior of isotropic shells. A considerable parametric study is established concerning both the incident wave and structural characteristics. The results show that the presence of the corrugated core improves sound transmission loss (STL) of the structure in the mass-controlled region, and it has a negative effect on STL in the coincidence-controlled region; therefore, using such a core for sound insulation depends on the desired frequency domain. </jats:p>",

A fundamental requirement is that the validity of any healthcare intervention must be supported by the resultant favourable treatment outcome. Unfortunately, differences in study design and the outcome measures evaluated often make it challenging to synthesize the available research evidence required for secondary research analysis and guideline development. Core outcome sets (COS) are defined as an agreed standardized set of outcomes, which should be measured and reported as a minimum in all clinical trials on a specific topic. The benefits of COS include less heterogeneity, a reduction in the risk of reporting bias and ensuring all trials contribute data to facilitate meta‐analyses; given the engagement of key stakeholders, it also increases the chances that clinically relevant outcomes are identified. The recognition of the need for COS for assessing endodontic treatment outcomes leads to the development of Core Outcome Sets for Endodontic Treatment modalities (COSET) protocol, which is registered (No. 1879) on the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) website.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Objectives</jats:title><jats:p>The objectives of this scoping review are to: (1) identify the outcomes assessed in studies evaluating surgical endodontic procedures; (2) report on the method of assessment used to measure the outcomes; (3) and assess selective reporting bias in the included studies.

For RR, in addition to tooth survival, endodontic complications and adverse effects, the outcome measures were primarily periodontal‐related, including pocket depth reduction, attachment gain, periodontal disease and periodontic–endodontic lesions. The majority of outcome measures for PS, IR and RR were assessed clinically, radiologically and/or via patient history. Specific tools such as rating scales (Visual Analog Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, Numerical Rating Scale and other scales) were used for the assessment of pain, swelling and tenderness, and validated questionnaires were used for the assessment of oral health‐related quality of life. The range of follow‐up periods was variable, dependent on the outcome measure and the type of intervention.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Outcome measures, method of assessment and follow‐up periods for PS, IR and RR were identified and categorized to help standardize the reporting of outcomes for future research studies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. Yiqi Yangjing prescription (YQYJ) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription used for treating lung cancer. It has a significant effect on enhancing efficacy, reducing toxic symptoms, and improving patients’ physical well-being. The effective inhibitory effect on nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of action and the material basis still remain unclear. Methods. In this study, we explored this mechanism using network pharmacology, after which we explored the pharmacodynamics and the action mechanism of YQYJ using cell viability evaluation, plate clone formation assay, flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot. Results. The enrichment results showed that there were 50 active components and 68 core targets related to YQYJ inhibiting NSCLC, including quercetin, luteolin, gamatin, kaempferol, heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and others. Among them, quercetin and kaempferol revealed the best binding effect with core targets. Most importantly, YQYJ promoted A549 cells from the quiescent phase into the proliferative phase to enhance the sensitivity of A549 cells to YQYJ and inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells significantly (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <a:mi>P</a:mi>\n                        <a:mo>&lt;</a:mo>\n                        <a:mn>0.05</a:mn>\n                     </a:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>). The A549 cells were blocked in both S and G2/M phases while the apoptosis ratio was increased. The proliferation score of A549 cells treated with YQYJ was significantly reduced compared to A549 cells in the proliferative phase (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\">\n                        <c:mi>P</c:mi>\n                        <c:mo>&lt;</c:mo>\n                        <c:mn>0.05</c:mn>\n                     </c:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>). This regulatory effect was related to the expression regulation of HSP90AA1, CDK2, STAT3, and phosphor-STAT3 (p-STAT3) by YQYJ, kaempferol, and quercetin. Conclusion. Our results suggested that the inhibition of NSCLC via YQYJ had multicomponent and multitarget characteristics. Its core mechanism is related to the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis of NSCLC. This study provides a direction and scientific basis for exploring the future mechanism of YQYJ for the treatment of NSCLC.</jats:p>",

The Bohai Sea hosts vast volumes of sediment discharged from rivers of mainland China and has undergone large-scale sea-level fluctuations during the Quaternary. Three transgressions have been previously determined for the Bohai Sea since the late Pleistocene. However, the timings of the two earlier transgressions are still unclear. Here we present chronological, micropalaeontological, and sedimentological data for an 80-m-long sediment core recovered from the modern Yellow River delta. The changes in grain size and foraminiferal assemblages suggest the occurrence of three marine sedimentary units, M-3, M-2, and M-1, that represent transgressions of the Bohai Sea. We applied optically stimulated luminescence dating using both quartz and feldspar minerals on 15 samples obtained from core YRD-1401 and eight radiocarbon ages using fragments of microfossils shells and organic carbon. Our quartz optically stimulated luminescence ages for M-2 (<jats:italic>ca</jats:italic>. 60 ka), are consistent with K-feldspar post-infrared stimulated luminescence ages, suggesting that M-2 on the southwestern coast of the Bohai Sea was deposited during early MIS 3. The sea level of the Bohai Sea during early MIS 3 is estimated to have ranged from 26.8 to 19.9 m below the present sea level. Luminescence ages and foraminiferal assemblages indicate that M-3 was likely formed during MIS 5 and a tidal-river environment prevailed on the southwestern coast of the Bohai Sea during MIS 6 or earlier.</jats:p>"

Such phenomena can be seen in familiar coupled pendulums and, on a cosmic scale, neutrino oscillations: the oscillation between different types of neutrinos. In solids, on the other hand, there are various wave excitations responsible for their thermal and electromagnetic properties. Here we report the observation of coherent beating between different excitation species in a solid: phonons and magnons.

The period of the oscillation as a function of the field is consistent with the prediction of the magnon-phonon beating.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is wide observational evidence that electron velocity distribution functions (eVDF) observed in the solar wind generally present enhanced tails and field-aligned skewness. These properties may induce the excitation of electromagnetic perturbations through the whistler heat-flux instability (WHFI), that may contribute to a non-collisional regulation of the electron heat-flux values observed in the solar wind via wave-particle interactions. Recently, a new way to model the solar wind eVDF has been proposed: the core-strahlo model. This representation consist in a bi-Maxwellian core plus a Skew-Kappa distribution, representing the halo and strahl electrons as a single skewed distribution. The core-strahlo model is able to reproduce the main features of the eVDF in the solar wind (thermal core, enhanced tails, and skewness), with the advantage that the asymmetry is controlled by only one parameter. In this work we use linear kinetic theory to analyze the effect of solar wind electrons described by the core-strahlo model, over the excitation of the parallel propagating WHFI. We use parameters relevant to the solar wind and focus our attention on the effect on the linear stability introduced by different values of the core-to-strahlo density and temperature ratios, which are known to vary throughout the Heliosphere. We also obtain the stability threshold for this instability as a function of the electron beta and the skewness parameter, which is a better indicator of instability than the heat-flux macroscopic moment, and present a threshold conditions for the instability that can be compared with observational data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate specification of hurricane inner-core structure is critical to predicting the evolution of a hurricane. However, observations over hurricane inner cores are generally lacking. Previous studies have emphasized Tail Doppler radar (TDR) data assimilation to improve hurricane inner-core representation. Recently, Doppler wind lidar (DWL) has been used as an observing system to sample hurricane inner-core and environmental conditions. The NOAA P3 Hurricane Hunter aircraft has DWL installed and can obtain wind data over a hurricane’s inner core when the aircraft passes through the hurricane. In this study, we examine the impact of assimilating DWL winds and TDR radial winds on the prediction of Hurricane Earl (2016) with the NCEP operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) system. A series of data assimilation experiments are conducted with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI)-based ensemble-3DVAR hybrid system to identify the best way to assimilate TDR and DWL data into the HWRF forecast system. The results show a positive impact of DWL data on hurricane analysis and prediction. Compared with the assimilation of u and v components, assimilation of DWL wind speed provides better hurricane track and intensity forecasts. Proper choices of data thinning distances (e.g., 5 km horizontal thinning and 70 hPa vertical thinning for DWL) can help achieve better analysis in terms of hurricane vortex representation and forecasts. In the analysis and forecast cycles, the combined TDR and DWL assimilation (DWL wind speed and TDR radial wind, along with other conventional data, e.g., NCEP Automated Data Processing (ADP) data) offsets the downgrade analysis from the absence of DWL observations in an analysis cycle and outperforms assimilation of a single type of data (either TDR or DWL) and leads to improved forecasts of hurricane track, intensity, and structure. Overall, assimilation of DWL observations has been beneficial for analysis and forecasts in most cases. The outcomes from this study demonstrate the great potential of including DWL wind profiles in the operational HWRF system for hurricane forecast improvement.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease with limited effective treatment options. This potentiates the importance of uncovering novel drug targets. We have discovered global dysregulation of the gene regulatory process alternative polyadenylation (APA) in PDAC. APA is a pre-mRNA processing mechanism that generates mRNAs with distinct 3’ ends, impacting gene expression and protein function. We revealed that APA dysregulation in PDAC drives oncogenic signatures and predicts poor patient outcome. As APA directs widespread gene expression dysregulation across the PDAC patient population, we hypothesized that inhibition of APA has therapeutic potential. APA is controlled by a complex of proteins, including cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3 (CPSF3). CPSF3 is the endonuclease catalyzing mRNA cleavage, and a potentially druggable target. We now find that <jats:italic>CPSF3</jats:italic> is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients. CPSF3 knockdown decreases PDAC proliferation and clonogenicity <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and tumor growth <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. We demonstrate that <jats:italic>CPSF3</jats:italic> knockdown induces widespread APA alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and determine the contribution of one of these events to CPSF3-induced cell proliferation phenotype. Furthermore, we find that PDAC, but not non-transformed pancreatic cells, are sensitive to the CPSF3 small molecule inhibitor JTE-607. Mechanistically, JTE-607 impairs replication-dependent histone processing, disrupting nucleosome assembly and destabilizing chromatin structure. Finally, we determine that JTE-607 attenuates cell proliferation by arresting cells in early S-phase of the cell cycle. Altogether, we identify CPSF3 as a druggable target in PDAC and reveal novel mechanisms by which CPSF3 controls cancer cell growth.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance</jats:title><jats:p>This work identifies CPSF3 as a potential drug target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and reveals new mechanisms by which CPSF3 inhibition attenuates PDAC cell proliferation through modulating alternative polyadenylation and histone processing.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

However, there has been no investigation into how nicotine‐related behaviors may be altered by HFD. To investigate the potential mechanisms of HFD on nicotine addiction‐related behaviors, we exposed adult male and female mice to HFD or a regular diet (RD) for 6 weeks. Following this, we trained mice in a nicotine e‐vape® self‐administration (EVSA) paradigm. Here mice, were trained to self‐administer 6 mg/mL nicotine on a fixed‐ratio 1 (FR1), FR3 and progressive‐ratio schedules. Following behavioral assays we anesthetized the mice and extracted brains for ex‐vivo fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) assays. We observed that both male and female mice exhibited an increase in nicotine intake on the FR1 schedule but had the same intake of nicotine as RD mice on a FR3 schedule. We also observed that both male and female mice exhibited a significantly lower breakpoint when assessed on a progressive ratio. Using FSCV, we observed that HFD mice exhibited a significant decrease in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core when compared to RD mice at both tonic and phasic stimulation frequencies. These data support the fact that HFD promotes nicotine intake at low‐effort schedules (FR1) and this may be due to decreased baseline dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core.</jats:p>",

Tidal dissipation in an unconsolidated core has been proposed as the main source of Enceladus' geological activity. However, the tidal response of its core has generally been modeled assuming it behaves viscoelastically rather than poroviscoelastically. In this work, we analyze the poroviscoelastic response to better constrain the distribution of tidal dissipation within Enceladus. A poroviscoelastic body has a different tidal response than a viscoelastic one; pressure within the pores alters the stress field and induces a Darcian porous flow. This flow represents an additional pathway for energy dissipation. Using Biot's theory of poroviscoelasticity, we develop a new framework to obtain the tidal response of a spherically symmetric, self‐gravitating moon with porous layers and apply it to Enceladus. We show that the boundary conditions at the interface of the core and overlying ocean play a key role in the tidal response. The ocean hinders the development of a large‐amplitude Darcian flow, making negligible the Darcian contribution to the dissipation budget. We therefore infer that Enceladus' core can be the source of its geological activity only if it has a low rigidity and a very low viscosity. A future mission to Enceladus could test this hypothesis by measuring the phase lags of tidally induced changes of gravitational potential and surface displacements.</jats:p>",

In this research, reactive core–shell (RCS) particles with polybutadiene (PB) as core and the terpolymer styrene–acrylonitrile‐glycidyl methacrylate as shell were prepared to improve the toughening ability of RCS for PLA. The tert‐dodecyl mercaptan (TDDM) content was varied during polymerization and higher TDDM concentrations induced lower grafting and cross‐linking of the PB phase, which significantly influenced the dispersed phase morphology and toughness of RCS toughened PLA blends. With the increase of TDDM content, the phase morphology of RCS changed from uniform dispersion, net‐like structure to an agglomeration pattern. The impact strength of PLA blends increased with TDDM content and reached 922 J/m for the PLA/RCS‐T5 (TDDM: 1.18 wt%), which was 30 times higher than pristine PLA and ~3 times than PLA/RCS‐T0 blend. Higher TDDM contents decreased toughening efficiency. Appropriate TDDM contents decreased the glass transition temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub>) and cross‐linking degree of RCS particles which enhanced the cavitation ability of the PB core phase and promoted the shear yielding of PLA matrix.

It is shown in this paper that this mechanism can also produce superrotation with terrestrial parameters when the baroclinic forcing moves to low latitudes, explaining previous results by Williams. The transition between superrotating and subrotating flow occurs abruptly as the baroclinic forcing moves poleward. Although Kelvin–Rossby instability weakens when the baroclinic zone moves away from the equator, the key factor explaining the abrupt transition is the change in the baroclinic eddies. When differential heating is contained within the tropics, baroclinic eddies do not decelerate the subtropical jet and the upper-tropospheric flow approximately conserves angular momentum, providing conditions favorable for Kelvin–Rossby instability. In contrast, when baroclinic eddies are generated in the extratropics, they decelerate the subtropical jet and prevent the Kelvin–Rossby coupling. Due to this sensitivity to baroclinic eddies, the system exhibits hysteresis: near the transition parameter, extratropical eddies can prevent superrotation when they are initially present.</jats:p>",

The random and discrete distribution of the fiber cores in an MCF induces strong spatial aliasing to the CGHs, hence, an approach that can rapidly generate tailored CGHs for MCFs is highly demanded. We demonstrate a novel deep neural network—CoreNet, providing accurate tailored CGHs generation for MCFs at a near video rate. The CoreNet is trained by unsupervised learning and speeds up the computation time by two magnitudes with high fidelity light field generation compared to the previously reported CGH algorithms for MCFs. Real-time generated tailored CGHs are on-the-fly loaded to the phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) for near video-rate complex light fields generation through the MCF microendoscope.

This represents the first time that HEMA is used in TEMs. The liquid blowing agent core is next optimized, followed by the prepolymerization emulsion time.

Herein we explore the electrocatalytic activity of copper-palladium core-shell nanostructures on pencil graphite (Cu@Pd/PGE) for EOR and HER. A maximum peak current density of 261 ± 11 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> with excellent retention for 1000 potential cycling is observed for EOR. High performance liquid chromatography and Raman analysis indicate upto 12-electron transfer oxidation with the formation of carbon dioxide or carbonate, which imply the superiority of the catalyst. High HER current near to its thermodynamic potential of ∼0 V vs RHE, together with a stable performance for 1000 voltammetric cycles, make Cu@Pd/PGE as a potential catalyst for HER in acidic media. The catalytic efficiency is also manifested by the well resolved voltammetric features during HER activity with a Tafel slope comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent bifunctional activity of Cu@Pd/PGE provides a new route for commercialisation of low-cost electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"jesac6706-ga.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>",

Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 54%. A secondary endpoint of the study was to correlate pCR rate to the presence of germline pathogenic variants in DNA damage response (DDR) genes or in core genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HR).MethodsPeripheral blood from 60 patients was collected for germline DNA analysis. Whole Exome Sequencing was performed; only rare variants (minor allelic frequency &lt; 0.01) in 276 DDR genes were considered. The correlation between pCR rate and DDR or HR deficiency was analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. The same was done for the correlation between DDR gene mutations and the presence of hematologic toxicities. ResultsThirty-five out of 60 patients (58.3%) carried a protein disrupting germline mutation in a DDR gene. Twenty-four of these 35 patients (68.6%) had a pCR, while a pCR was observed in 40% without a DDR mutation (p=0.026). In 14/15 patients (93.3%) with a HR core gene mutation a pCR was obtained, while a pCR was present in 44.4% without a HR core gene mutation (p=0.0007). Eight of nine patients (88.9%) with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant reached a pCR compared to 51% of the BRCA wild-type patients (p=0.035). ConclusionsThis is the first study to demonstrate that germline pathogenic variants in genes involved in HR core genes predicts for pCR after platinum-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</jats:p>"

Hence, modern many-core processors require sophisticated thermal and resource management strategies to mitigate these undesirable side effects. A simulation-based evaluation of these strategies is limited by the accuracy of the underlying processor model and the simulation speed. Therefore, we present, for the first time, an field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based evaluation approach to test and compare thermal and resource management strategies using the combination of benchmark generation, FPGA-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) emulation, and run-time monitoring. The proposed benchmark generation method enables an evaluation of run-time management strategies for applications with various run-time characteristics. Furthermore, the ASIC emulation platform features a novel distributed temperature emulator design, whose overhead scales linearly with the number of integrated cores, and a novel dynamic voltage frequency scaling emulator design, which precisely models the timing and energy overhead of voltage and frequency transitions. In our evaluations, we demonstrate the proposed approach for a tiled many-core processor with 80 cores on four Virtex-7 FPGAs. Additionally, we present the suitability of the platform to evaluate state-of-the-art run-time management techniques with a case study.</jats:p>",

The demetallization rate and selectivity of PAA@PB were investigated with varying concentration, electrical desalination conditions, pH value, and NaCl concentration. In contrast, the demetallization efficiency of PAA@PB is much greater than that of PAA@SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐G. Notably, PAA@PB exhibits excellent nickel removal efficiency, but a little more selective for iron. The optimal removal rate for calcium, nickel, and iron are 55.3%, 52.6%, and 46.1%, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The efficiency of hydrogen gas generation via electrochemical water splitting has been mostly limited by the availability of electrocatalyst materials that require lower overpotentials during the redox reaction. Noble metals have been used extensively as electrocatalysts due to their high activity and low overpotentials. However, the use of single noble metal electrocatalyst is limited due to atomic aggregation caused by its inherent high surface energy, which results in poor structural stability, and, hence, poor electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability. In addition, using noble metals as electrocatalysts also causes the cost to be unnecessarily high. These limitations in noble metal electrocatalysts could be enhanced by combining two noble metals in a core-shell structure (e.g., Rh@Ir) as a thin film over a base substrate. This could significantly enhance electrocatalytic activity due to the following: (1) the modification of the electronic structure, which increases electrical conductivity; (2) the optimization of the adsorption energy; and (3) the introduction of new active sites in the core-shell noble metal structure. The current state-of-the-art employs physical vapor deposition (PVD) or other deposition techniques to fabricate core-shell noble metals on flat 2D substrates. This method does not allow 3D substrates with high surface areas to be used. In the present work, atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to fabricate nanoparticle thin films of Rh@Ir and Rh@Pt in a core-shell structure on glassy carbon electrodes. ALD enables the fabrication of nanoparticle thin film on three-dimensional substrates (a 2D functional film on a 3D substrate), resulting in a significantly increased surface area for a catalytic reaction to take place; hence, improving the performance of electrocatalysis. The Rh@Pt (with an overpotential of 139 mV and a Tafel slope of 84.8 mV/dec) and Rh@Ir (with an overpotential of 169 mV and a Tafel slope of 112 mV/dec) core-shell electrocatalyst exhibited a better electrocatalytic performances compared to the single metal Rh electrocatalyst (with an overpotential of 300 mV and a Tafel slope of 190 mV/dec). These represented a 54% and a 44% improvement in performance, respectively, illustrating the advantages of core-shell thin film nanostructures in enhancing the catalytic performance of an electrocatalyst. Both electrocatalysts also exhibited good long-term stability in the harsh acidic electrolyte conditions when subjected to chronopotentiometry studies.</jats:p>"

Hence, identifying variation in the core microbiome and pathobiome can significantly advance our understanding of microbial-microbial interactions and consequences for disease progression and host functions. In this study, we combined glasshouse and field studies to analyse the soil and plant rhizosphere microbiome of cotton plants (<jats:italic>Gossypium hirsutum</jats:italic>) in the presence of a cotton-specific fungal pathogen,<jats:italic>Fusarium oxysporum</jats:italic>f. sp.<jats:italic>vasinfectum</jats:italic>(FOV). We found that FOV directly and consistently altered the rhizosphere microbiome, but the biocontrol agents enabled microbial assemblages to resist pathogenic stress. Using co-occurrence network analysis of the core microbiome, we identified the pathobiome comprised of the pathogen and key associate phylotypes in the cotton microbiome. Isolation and application of some negatively correlated pathobiome members provided protection against plant infection. Importantly, our field survey from multiple cotton fields validated the pattern and responses of core microbiomes under FOV infection. This study advances key understanding of core microbiome responses and existence of plant pathobiomes, which provides a novel framework to better manage plant diseases in agriculture and natural settings.</jats:p>"

Mitigating the consequences depends on whether the cause of the disorder is understood clearly or not! Many serious accidents such as Fukushima, Bhopal, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island show vast consequences, although different but primarily related to a similar factor, which is “Human Deficiency”. Literature shows, although leadership and top management and processes and mechanisms and good strategies are existent, yet problems remain. The fact is that there are fewer studies formulated in this field, from the crisis management strategies point of view, this is the deficiency. The article aims to shed light on the Importance and how to better understand Latency in management Strategy at Management levels, and to better say by the Core Native Human Effective Components (CNHECs) for better knowing and understanding the reality to better act based on the real management strategy in the Mindset (Based on the mind bandwidth). In addition, to understand whether ignoring ignorance is a good management strategy in time of crisis and will it buy time and be effective in not accurate managers or the other way around. Core Native Human Effective Components (CNHECs) are extracted from the Native Human Effective Components (NHECs) that are refined among different Human Effective Components (HECs) based on the literature reviewed in an article recently published by the authors of this article which can help to better understand the latency in management. These components may be generated and be shaped in the crisis managers’ minds’ bandwidth which can be used as a precautionary action to be avoided not to cause more situations that are complex through increase of resiliency and decrease of distress. As a conclusion, we understand that reality may be completely different from what could be assumed, understood and seen. It should be considered that actions are always based on the disaster and crisis Managers’ understanding. For better understanding, the reality we propose a method, Model or a taxonomy that to some extent clarifies and focuses on the statement of latency in management strategy process. This Structure, model or taxonomy shows how and through which windows (Soft, Semi Soft and Hard Spheres) we can get into it and to say how to better understand the function of latency in management strategy by special consideration of CNHECs which can help us to distinguish a crisis from a disaster.

Although Knudson's two-hit model requires two independent inactivating mutations, perhaps more frequently, a TSG inactivation can occur through a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of an inactivating mutation. Deletion and uniparental disomy (UPD) have been well documented as LOH mechanisms, but the role of gene conversion is poorly understood. Here, we developed a simple algorithm to detect somatic gene conversion from short-read sequencing data. We applied it to 6285 cancer patient samples, from which 4978 somatic mutations that underwent gene conversion to achieve LOH were found. This number accounted for 14.8% of the total LOH mutations. We further showed that LOH by gene conversion was enriched in TSGs compared with non-TSG genes, showing a significant contribution of gene conversion to carcinogenesis.</jats:p>",

Apart from properly reordering the mesh entities, the two most significant optimisations include adopting a lookup table in adding element matrices or vectors to their global counterparts, and using a row-wise assembly algorithm for multi-threaded parallelisation. Rigorous benchmarking shows that, due to the various optimisations, the actual volumes of memory traffic are in many cases very close to the estimated lower bounds.

Our study provides partial evidence for these models and, crucially, extends these models by adding a person variable: Core beliefs, which are defined as mental representations of experiences that individuals have while pursuing need-fulfilling goals. Specifically, we report results from a longitudinal investigation of the development of trait greed across time. Based on data from the German Personality Panel, we analyzed data on 1,965 young adults on up to 4 occasions, spanning a period of more than 3 years. According to our results, negative core beliefs that have so far been proposed only in the clinical literature (e.g., being unloved or being insecure) contributed to the development of trait greed, indicating that striving for material goals might be a substitute for unmet needs in the past. Additionally, greedy individuals more often self-selected themselves into business-related environments, which presumably allow them to fulfill their greed-related need to earn a lot of money. Our results expose important mechanisms for trait greed development. Regarding personality development in general, core beliefs were identified as an important variable for future theory building. </jats:p>",

The S1PR3-specific inhibitor CAY10444 was injected into the abdominal cavity of mice after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and changes in the expression of blood–brain barrier-related molecules were measured using PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Both GEO datasets showed that S1PR3 was upregulated during cerebral I/R in mice.

In the mouse cerebral I/R model, S1PR3 expression increased 24 h after ischemia. After the administration of CAY10444, brain edema and neurological deficits in mice were ameliorated. CAY10444 rescued the decreased expression of the tight junction (TJ) proteins zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) and occludin after ischemia induced by transient MCAO (tMCAO) and reduced the increase in aquaporin 4 (AQP4) levels after tMCAO, preserving the integrity of the BBB.

Aim: The goals of the study were to quantify the impact of maternal exposure to CO in the first trimester of pregnancy in the core Niger Delta by measuring MCOHb concentrations and to assess the effect of maternal demographic and obstetric characteristics on the impact. Material and methods: The study was of cross-sectional design carried out at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH) in Nigeria. 490 consecutive pregnant women in the first trimester were recruited from the antenatal clinic from January 2021 to January 2022. Gestational age was estimated with the aid of an ultrasound scan. Demographic, social and obstetric characteristics were taken. MCOHb concentrations were measured with the aid of a smokerlyser. Data was analyzed, using SPSS version 25.0 (Armonk, NY) software. Ethical approval was obtained from the RSUTH Ethics Committee. Results: The mean value of MCOHb concentration was 1.15±0.40% Out of the 490 patients that were assessed, 461(94.08%) had mild impact from CO exposure (MCOHb= 0.78-1.5%), 18 (3.67%) – moderate impact (MCOHb = 1.75-2.23%) and 11 (2.24%) had severe impact (MCOHb = 2.39% and above). Moderate and severe impact were most prominent in women of 25-29 and 35-39 years of age respectively at which they occurred in 11 out of 145 (7.59%) and 7 out of 103 women (6.80%) respectively and the differences at various age groups were statistically significant [X2=23.119, p&lt;0.010, 95%CI (0.038,0.046)]. The differences in the severity of maternal impact among women with different BMI classes were statistically significant [X2=56.707, p&lt;0.001, 95%CI (0.001,0.001)] with those with class III BMI most likely to have severe impact [4(22.22%) out of 18 patients]. There was inverse relationship between parity and the severity of the impact of CO exposure but the differences at various parity groups were not statistically significant [X2=10.580, p&lt;0.012, 95%CI (0.101,0.113)]. There was also a paradoxical finding of 3 smokers having only mild impact. Conclusion: The mean value of MCOHb was 1.15±0.40. Mild, moderate and severe impact from maternal CO exposure was established with the moderate and severe impacts more prominent at maternal ages of 25-39 years, at higher BMI and at lower parity.</jats:p>",

Resulting cumulative distribution functions reveal a narrower distribution for Ib SNe (standard deviation σ ∼ 0.06 dex) compared to Ic and IIP distributions (σ ∼ 0.15 dex). This narrow distribution of Ib SNe is confirmed with an extended dataset using data from Galbany et al. (2018). Statistical tests confirm a statistically significant difference between the Ib and II-P metallicity distributions with &lt; 5% probability that they result from the same progenitors. This narrow distribution suggests a lack of Type Ib SNe in low metallicity environments and points towards single star progenitors for these Type Ib SNe, rather than binaries. It also suggests that single massive stars at low metallicity are not commonly able to produce helium-rich Type Ib supernovae.</jats:p>",

Immobilized AlyFRA and AlyFRB were prepared using each crude enzyme solution and κ-carrageenan, and immobilized enzyme reuse in batch reactions and DEH yield were examined. Thus, DEH was produced in a relatively high yield of 79.6%, even after the immobilized enzyme was reused seven times.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Autophagy is an essential cellular survival mechanism that involves the degradation and recycling of aged or damaged organelles and protein aggregates to maintain cellular homeostasis. While autophagic dysfunction occurs with aging and is associated with many disease‐related pathologies, methods to modulate autophagic activity remain poorly understood in the context of human physiology. Recently, we demonstrated that autophagy is activated in an intensity‐dependent manner during both exercise and passive heat stress, however it is unknown if the autophagic response to elevations in body core temperature (T<jats:sub>core</jats:sub>) during passive heat exposure are comparable to those elicited through exercise. Therefore, we sought to assess the autophagic response to an elevated state of hyperthermia associated with intense exercise and compare responses to a similar rate and magnitude of increase in T<jats:sub>core</jats:sub> elicited through warm water immersion (WI). We evaluated the hypothesis that autophagic stimulation would occur during both exercise and WI, although responses would be greater during the exercise bout. To assess this hypothesis, 6 young men (mean [SD] 23 [3] years) performed 30 min of intense (70% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO<jats:sub>2max</jats:sub>)) semi‐recumbent cycling. On a separate day (at least 72h after the exercise bout), the same participants were immersed in warm water (up to the clavicle) for 30 min, with the water temperature adjusted to elicit the same relative increase in T<jats:sub>core</jats:sub> (as estimated by rectal temperature) as was achieved during the prior exercise session. Given T<jats:sub>core</jats:sub> during WI was matched to the prior exercise bout, all WI trials were conducted after the exercise session. Autophagic activity was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to, immediately post‐exercise or WI, and following a seated recovery (3 and 6h). Western blot was used to assess changes in autophagy via microtubule‐associated light chain 3 beta (LC3‐II) and normalized to β‐actin (expressed as relative fold change to the respective baseline). Area under the curve was used to assess the T<jats:sub>core</jats:sub> response between conditions and protein data were analyzed via a two‐way repeated measures ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD (α=0.05). A similar average relative increase in T<jats:sub>core</jats:sub> was observed during the exercise and WI bouts (0.65 [0.21]°C vs 0.61 [0.19]°C, respectively; p=0.80) with a return to baseline within 3h in both conditions. In response to 30‐min of exercise, LC3‐II significantly increased immediately after exercise (1.69 [0.12]; p&lt;0.01) and remained elevated above baseline at 3h (1.51 [0.23]; p&lt;0.01) and 6h (1.38 [0.16]; p&lt;0.01). A similar pattern of response was observed following WI (1.86 [0.77]; p=0.04), however, LC3‐II returned to pre‐WI levels within the first 3h of recovery. Our preliminary findings show similar increases in autophagy following a similar elevation in core temperature associated induced by exercise and WI. However, the autophagic response only remained elevated after exercise, likely caused by exercise‐associated metabolic perturbations. Further research is warranted to delineate the underlying pathways of autophagic activation during these different thermal stressors.</jats:p>",

The self-healing properties of bitumen, simple construction in cold and rainy conditions compared to clay cores, good flexibility and connection with embankment materials are the essential characteristics of asphaltic concrete. The main concern regarding the use of asphaltic concrete cores in Iran is mainly the performance of these dams under seismic loads. The evaluations of the performance of these types of dams in other countries show that asphaltic concrete cores perform satisfactorily in the static state, but in earthquake conditions, the situation may be different. In this paper, the static and seismic behavior of the Meijaran dam in Iran, Mazandaran, is evaluated for three core angles of 90°, 60° and 45°. This evaluation was conducted at the end of the impounding stage and after applying seismic loads using FLAC 2D software and Mohr–Coulomb consitutive models. The results were matched with the ICOLD recommendation to use angled cores in dams with asphaltic cores and showed that the dam performs better with angled cores. Finally, for the Meijaran dam, the results from the dynamic analysis are compared with the results from the centrifuge test.</jats:p>"

To achieve this, a kind of cross‐linkable giant surfactant, based on a functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) head tethered with a diblock copolymer tail containing reactive benzocyclobutene groups, is designed and prepared. By varying the volume fraction of linear block copolymer tail, these giant surfactants can self‐assemble into a body‐centered cubic (BCC) structure in bulk, in which the supramolecular spheres are composed of a core of POSS cages, a middle shell of crosslinkable poly(4‐vinylbenzocyclobutene) (PBCB) blocks, and a corona of inert polystyrene (PS) blocks. The solvent‐free thermally induced cross‐linking reaction of the benzocyclobutene groups can be finished in 5 min upon heating, resulting in well‐defined polymeric spheres with over 90 linear chains surrounding the cross‐linked cores. The outer PS blocks serve as the protection corona to ensure that cross‐linking of giant surfactants occurs in each supramolecular spherical domain. Given the modular design and diversity of the POSS‐based giant surfactants, it is believed that the strategy may enable access to a wide range of CSPs.</jats:p>",

The ECG (Figure 1) revealed complete AtrioVentricular Block (ABV) with a narrow–QRS junctional escape rhythm, with a heart rate of about 30 beats per minute (bpm). The other vital parameters were within the normal limits and no anomalies were detected on the physical examination. Medium–dose intravenous isoprenaline infusion was immediately started, with an increase in the junctional escape rate up to 50 bpm. The patient also underwent chest x–ray, which showed interstitial thickening in the pulmonary hilus, which was judged to be nonspecific. The blood chemistry was normal and the echocardiogram (Figure 2) did not show any abnormalities. Since there were no apparent reversible causes of the complete AV block, on the next day, a bicameral pacemaker was implanted via the left cephalic vein. The procedure was uneventful and the patient was discharged home two days later, in good general condition. Eight days after the discharge, surgical wound control and pacemaker control were performed, with completely normal parameters. About 15 days after the discharge the patient went back to the local emergency room for dyspnea and fever. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) without contrast medium was performed, which revealed the presence of widespread pathological mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Therefore, the patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward. An in–depth diagnostic was performed first with thoraco–abdominal angio–CT, then with Positron Emission Tomography (PET)–CT (see Figure 3), which revealed the presence of diffuse areas of fixation of the radio–drug (18F–Fluorodeoxyglucose –FDG–), at the ilo–mediastinal, hepatic, pulmonary, retrocrural, retrocaval, iliac, supra and subclavicular, and also cardiac area (activation of interatrial brown fat and between aortic root and the superior vena cava). The patient was therefore transferred to another hospital for diagnostic investigations and lymphoma therapy. In the light of the picture that emerged, the arrhythmological disease was considered to be referred to the cardiac involvement of the oncological disease; to date there are few similar cases described in the literature.

In this study, a simple electrostatic attraction‐assisted core approaching strategy was developed, which accelerates the synthesis of Au NCs by introducing polyamine (hyperbranched polyetheneimine, hPEI).

To date, the structure of C1GalT1 and the details of substrate recognition and catalysis remain unknown.

The binding of the glycopeptides to the enzyme is mainly driven by the GalNAc moiety while the peptide sequence provides optimal kinetic and binding parameters. Interestingly, to achieve glycosylation, C1GalT1 recognizes a high-energy conformation of the α-GalNAc-Thr linkage, negligibly populated in solution. By imposing this 3D-arrangement on that fragment, characteristic of α-GalNAc-Ser peptides, C1GalT1 ensures broad glycosylation of both acceptor substrates. These findings illustrate a structural and mechanistic blueprint to explain glycosylation of multiple acceptor substrates, extending the repertoire of mechanisms adopted by glycosyltransferases.</jats:p>"

Results show that for the cores with permeability from ultra-low to medium–high, the imbibition time shows a monotonically decreasing law with the increase in the wettability index. In the weak water-wet range, the imbibition time increases significantly with the weakening of water-wet. Oil imbibition rate goes up with the increase in wettability index. In the strong water-wet range, the imbibition rate will change significantly with wettability. In the water-wet zone, there is a positive correlation between imbibition oil limit recovery and wettability index, according to which a power exponent model of them is established. The imbibition–displacement ratio, which characterizes the contribution rate of oil recovery by imbibition to that by waterflooding, is also positively correlated with the wettability index. In addition, imbibition–displacement ratios of extra-low permeability cores are very close to that of medium–high permeability cores. According to the analysis of the research results, compared with the strongly water-wet oil layer, the weakly water-wet oil layer with a wettability index of 0–0.5 has a greater contribution to oil recovery by using the enhanced imbibition method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RNA Polymerase I(Pol I) is one of three essential DNA dependent RNA polymerases in eukaryotes and is responsible for synthesizing ribosomal RNA. A critical and essential Pol I transcription factor in yeast is Core Factor (CF) which binds to a ~24 bp region in the rDNA promoter called the Core Element (CE). CF plays fundamental roles in the Pol I transcription process helping to recruit Pol I and open Pol I promoter DNA before initiation. Previously, it was not yet known how CF precisely recognized the CE. When interacting with DNA, proteins use two main mechanisms: i) base‐pair readout, and ii) shape/structural readout. Base‐readout is the most common and is dominated by hydrogen bonding between the amino acid residues and base‐pair hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The second mechanism centers around DNA shape readout where proteins target specific DNA features such as curvature, bendability, and groove width. Previous studies from our lab have shown that CF and its human orthologue, Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1), use an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to target DNA which is governed by interactions with the GC minor groove, a unique surface rarely targeted by DNA‐binding proteins. To further understand the extent of structural recognition as well as specific DNA features CF may be using to interact with CE, we have employed a variety of selection‐based methods to resolve the structural rules governing CF’s interaction with DNA. Our findings are consistent with a model that CF‐CE interaction is governed primarily by DNA shape‐based structural features rather than sequence.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we take advantage of the strong signature of these modes in the NP ultrafast transient optical response, measured by pump-probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, to explore the NP vibrational landscape. The fast Fourier transform analysis of the TA dynamics reveals specific vibration modes in the frequency range 15–150 GHz, further studied by numerical simulations based on the finite element method. While bare Au nanorods exhibit extensional and breathing modes, the bimetallic NPs undergo more complex motions, involving the displacement of facets, edges and corners. The amplitude and frequency of these modes are shown to depend on the Ag shell thickness, as the silver load modifies the NP aspect ratio and mass. Moreover, the contributions of the vibrational modes to the experimental TA spectra are shown to vary with the probe laser wavelength at which the signal is monitored. Using the combined simulations of the NP elastic and optical properties, we elucidate this influence by analyzing the effect of the mechanisms involved in the acousto-plasmonic coupling.</jats:p>"

These devices are highly specific and robust, achieving attomolar detection of the viral protein target in human blood plasma. The improved sensitivity is rationalized by theoretical calculations showing that induced polarization at the graphene interface caused by the proximity of covalently bound probe molecule modulates the charge balance at the graphene/molecule interface. This charge balance causes a net shift of the Dirac cone providing enhanced sensitivity towards the attomolar detection of proteins. Such an unexpected effect paves the way for using this kind of graphene-based platform for real-time diagnostics of different diseases.</jats:p>"

We used finite-element method for numerical simulation studies of their transmission loss, bending loss, and single-mode performance, and then the transmission performance of various structural fibers is compared.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few decades, neuroscience studies have elucidated the structural/anatomical network characteristics in the brain and their associations with functional networks and the dynamics of neural activity. These studies have been carried out at multiple spatial-temporal scale levels, including spikes at the neural microcircuit level, neural activity at the intra-brain regional level, and neural interactions at the whole-brain network level. One of the structural and functional neural characteristics widely observed among large spatial-temporal scale ranges is long-tail distribution, typified as power-low distribution, gamma distribution, and log-normal distribution. In particular, long-tailed distributions found in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) induce various types of neural dynamics and functions. We reviewed recent studies on neural dynamics produced by the structural long-tailed characteristics of brain neural networks. In particular, the spiking neural network with a log-normal EPSP distribution was first introduced for the essential factors to produce spontaneous activity and was extended and utilized for studies on the association of neural dynamics with the network topology depending on EPSP amplitude. Furthermore, the characteristics of the response to a steady stimulus and its dependence on E/I balance, which are widely observed under pathological conditions, were described by the spiking neural networks with EPSP long-tailed distribution. Moreover, this spiking neural network has been utilized in modeling studies of mutual interactions among local microcircuit circuits. In future studies, the implementation of more global brain network architectures in modeling studies might reveal the mechanisms by which brain dynamics and brain functions emerge from the whole brain network architecture.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Amyloid fibrils have been known for many years. Unfortunately, their fame stems from negative aspects related to amyloid diseases. Nevertheless, due to their properties, they can be used as interesting nanomaterials. Apart from their remarkable stability, amyloid fibrils may be regarded as a kind of a storage medium and as a source of active peptides. In many cases, their structure may guarantee a controlled and slow release of peptides in their active form; therefore, they can be used as a potential nanomaterial in drug delivery systems. In addition, amyloid fibrils display controllable stiffness, flexibility, and satisfactory mechanical strength. In addition, they can be modified and functionalized very easily. Understanding the structure and genesis of amyloid assemblies derived from a broad range of amyloidogenic proteins could help to better understand and use this unique material. One of the factors responsible for amyloid aggregation is the steric zipper. Here, we report the discovery of steric zipper-forming peptides in the sequence of the amyloidogenic protein, human cystatin C (HCC). The ability of short peptides derived from this fragment of HCC to form fibrillar structures with defined self-association characteristics and the factors influencing this aggregation are also presented in this paper.</jats:p>"

To this end, 159 students in the teaching course of Busan P University were surveyed on a total of 21 questions corresponding to three categories of social, instrumental, and creative communication and seven sub-competencies (understanding, expression, attitude, digital literacy, information data literacy, collaboration, and innovation). For demand analysis, the difference between importance and current retention was analyzed through the corresponding sample t-test, and the priority of communication subcapabilities was derived through Borich demand analysis and The Locus for Focus Model. As a result of the overall analysis, there was a significant difference between the required level and the current level in all questions, and the top priority competencies derived by comparing the Borich demand and the LF model were ‘understanding competency’ and ‘information and data literacy competency’. By department, the humanities and social science departments and arts and sports departments had the highest demands for information and data literacy competency, and science and engineering departments had the highest demands for innovation competency. These results can be used as basic data for the development of curriculum and educational programs in future teacher training institutes.</jats:p>",

Although there are other methods for fabricating structures inside materials, none involves the fabrication of optical structures, particularly resonator structures.

The highly transparent nanoporous film comprises nonspherical SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>nanoparticles with a diameter of ≈12 nm. The voids in the nanoporous film are interconnected, facilitating the penetration of polymers exhibiting a diameter of 2–3 nm. By filling the voids in the nanoporous film with a hyperbranched polymer via the printing method, the refractive index can be uniformly controlled, and the optical structures can be embedded. Using infill printing, this is the first time a microdisk resonator exhibiting a reasonable quality factor inside a nanoporous film is successfully demonstrated just as “writing on paper.”</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Composite structural members such as concrete-filled double-skin steel tube (CFDSST) and concrete-filled double steel tubular (CFDST) columns are increasingly being utilized in modern structures owing to their capability to integrate the beneficial properties of constituent materials to carry heavy loads as compared to conventional reinforced concrete columns. Axial compression performance of such composite columns has been extensively investigated and available in the open literature. However, their response under impulsive loadings such as those induced by explosions is not very well studied because not many investigations have been conducted on these columns. Performance of composite compression members under short-duration/high-magnitude blast loading is of considerable interest under the prevailing environment of hi-tech wars, subversive activities, and accidental explosions. The recent devastating accidental Ammonium Nitrate explosion at Beirut port (Lebanon), and the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia raise the concern of researchers and engineers for the safety of structural elements/components. In this study, a 3-D finite element model of axially loaded 2500 mm long CFDSST column of ultra-high-strength concrete (170 MPa) is developed in ABAQUS/Explicit-v.6.15 computer code equipped with Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) model, and investigation has been carried out for its blast performance under the 50kg-TNT explosive load at a standoff distance of 1.50 m in free-air. The effects of strain rate on the compressive strength of the concrete are considered as per fib Model Code 2010 (R2010) and UFC-3-340-02 (2008). The non-linear behavior of the steel is also taken into account. Damages in the form of (1) a - concrete crushing on the explosion side of the column and b - concrete cracking on the tension side and their spread over the column length, and (2) yielding of tubes are observed. Computational results are validated with the available experimental observations. To improve the column response, the analysis has been extended to investigate the blast performance of axially loaded CFDSST columns with and without core concrete having an inner steel tube of circular/square cross-section and their response have been compared with the equivalent single skin concrete-filled steel tubular circular/square columns of same axial load capacity. </jats:p>",

It was recently reported (Xie et al., 2022) that the\nAbelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) ATP-site inhibitor imatinib also binds to\nAbl's myristoyl binding pocket, which is the target of allosteric Abl\ninhibitors. This was based on a crystal structure of a truncated Abl kinase\ndomain construct in complex with imatinib bound to the allosteric site as\nwell as further isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR, and kinase activity data. Although imatinib's affinity for the allosteric site is significantly weaker (10 µM) than for the ATP site (10 nM), imatinib binding to the allosteric site may\ndisassemble the regulatory core of Abl, thereby stimulating kinase activity, in particular for Abl mutants with reduced imatinib ATP-site affinity. It was argued that the previously observed imatinib-induced opening of the Abl regulatory core (Skora et al., 2013; Sonti et al., 2018) may be caused by the binding of imatinib to\nthe allosteric site and not to the ATP site. We show here that this is not\nthe case but that indeed imatinib binding to the ATP site induces the\nopening of the regulatory core at nanomolar concentrations. This agrees with findings that other type-II ATP-site inhibitors (nilotinib, ponatinib)\ndisassemble the regulatory core despite demonstrated negligible binding to\nthe allosteric site.\n                    </jats:p>"

Especially focusing on the A-site tetrahedral sub-lattice, in particular, pyrochlore oxides A2B2O7 (A = Sn, Pb and B = Nb, Ta), recent theoretical studies predict the emergence of the “quasi-flat band” structure as a result of the strong hybridization between filled A-ns and O-2p orbitals. In this work, we have established the growth conditions of Sn2Nb2O7, Sn2Ta2O7, Pb2Nb2O7, and Pb2Ta2O7 films by pulsed laser deposition on Y-stabilized ZrO2 (111) substrates to elucidate their optical properties. Absorption-edge energies, both for direct and indirect bandgaps, increase in the order of Sn2Nb2O7, Sn2Ta2O7, Pb2Nb2O7, and Pb2Ta2O7. This tendency can be well explained by considering the energy level of the constituent elements. A comparison of the difference between direct and indirect bandgaps reveals that Pb2B2O7 tends to have a less dispersive valence band than Sn2B2O7. Our findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions and are suggestive of the common existence of the hybridized states in this class of compounds.</jats:p>",

Lightwave guided in the Si waveguide evanescently coupled to the thin-film magnet and underwent optical absorption, resulting in heating and a decrease in coercive force.

However, due to the high homology of these family members, targeting JAK3 selectively is difficult. As a result, exploiting small changes or selectively boosting affinity within the ATP binding region to produce new tailored inhibitors of JAK3 is extremely beneficial. PubChem CID 137321159 was used as the lead inhibitor in this study to preserve the characteristic structure and to collocate it with the redesigned new parent core structure, from which a series of 1,7-dihydro-dipyrrolo [2,3-b:3′,2′-e] pyridine derivatives were obtained using the backbone growth method. From the proposed compounds, 14 inhibitors of JAK3 were found based on the docking scoring evaluation. The RMSD and MM/PBSA methods of molecular dynamics simulations were also used to confirm the stable nature of this series of complex systems, and the weak protein–ligand interactions during the dynamics were graphically evaluated and further investigated. The results demonstrated that the new parent core structure fully occupied the hydrophobic cavity, enhanced the interactions of residues LEU828, VAL836, LYS855, GLU903, LEU905 and LEU956, and maintained the structural stability. Apart from this, the results of the analysis show that the binding efficiency of the designed inhibitors of JAK3 is mainly achieved by electrostatic and VDW interactions and the order of the binding free energy with JAK3 is: 8 (−70.286 kJ/mol) &gt; 11 (−64.523 kJ/mol) &gt; 6 (−51.225 kJ/mol) &gt; 17 (−42.822 kJ/mol) &gt; 10 (−40.975 kJ/mol) &gt; 19 (−39.754 kJ/mol).

Although several genetic mutation experiments have shown that IG-DMR is essential for imprinting control of the domain, how DNA methylation itself functions has not been elucidated. Here, we performed both gain and loss of DNA methylation experiments targeting IG-DMR by transiently introducing CRISPR/Cas9 based-targeted DNA methylation editing tools along with one guide RNA into mouse ES cells. Altered DNA methylation, particularly at IG-DMR-Rep, which is a tandem repeat containing ZFP57 methylated DNA-binding protein binding motifs, affected the imprinting state of the whole domain, including DNA methylation, imprinted gene expression, and histone modifications. Moreover, the altered imprinting states were persistent through neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that the DNA methylation state at IG-DMR-Rep, but not other sites in IG-DMR, is a master element to determine whether the allele behaves as the intrinsic maternal or paternal allele. Meanwhile, this study provides a robust strategy and methodology to study core DNA methylation in cis-regulatory elements, such as ICRs and enhancers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the use of machine learning in materials science. Conventionally, a trained predictive model describes a scalar output variable, such as thermodynamic, electronic, or mechanical properties, as a function of input descriptors that vectorize the compositional or structural features of any given material, such as molecules, chemical compositions, or crystalline systems. In machine learning of materials data, on the other hand, the output variable is often given as a function. For example, when predicting the optical absorption spectrum of a molecule, the output variable is a spectral function defined in the wavelength domain. Alternatively, in predicting the microstructure of a polymer nanocomposite, the output variable is given as an image from an electron microscope, which can be represented as a two- or three-dimensional function in the image coordinate system. In this study, we considered two unified frameworks to handle such multidimensional or functional output regressions, which are applicable to a wide range of predictive analyses in materials science. The first approach employs generative adversarial networks, which are known to exhibit outstanding performance in various computer vision tasks such as image generation, style transfer, and video generation. We also present another type of statistical modelling inspired by a statistical methodology referred to as functional data analysis. This is an extension of kernel regression to deal with functional outputs, and its simple mathematical structure makes it an effective modelling even for given data in limited supply. We demonstrate the proposed method through several case studies in materials science.</jats:p>"

We observe that the shock-induced accretion solutions are prevalent and such solutions are commonly obtained for a wide range of the flow parameters, such as energy (${\\cal E}$) and angular momentum (λ), around the black holes of spin value 0 ≤ ak &amp;lt; 1. When the shock is dissipative in nature, a part of the accretion energy is released through the upper and lower surfaces of the disc at the location of the shock transition. We find that the maximum accretion energies that can be extracted at the dissipative shock ($\\Delta {\\cal E}^{\\rm max}$) are $\\sim 1{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ and $\\sim 4.4{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ for Schwarzschild black holes (ak → 0) and Kerr black holes (ak → 1), respectively. Using $\\Delta {\\cal E}^{\\rm max}$, we compute the loss of kinetic power (equivalently shock luminosity, Lshock) that is enabled to comply with the energy budget for generating jets/outflows from the jet base (i.e. post-shock flow). We compare Lshock with the observed core radio luminosity (LR) of black hole sources for a wide mass range spanning 10 orders of magnitude with sub-Eddington accretion rate and perceive that the present formalism seems to be potentially viable to account LR of 16 Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs) and 2176 active galactic nuclei. We further aim to address the core radio luminosity of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) sources and indicate that the present model formalism perhaps adequate to explain core radio emission of IMBH sources in the sub-Eddington accretion limit.</jats:p>",

In this study, we conduct a numerical investigation of decision making to solve large-scale multi-armed bandit problems by controlling the biases of chaotic temporal waveforms generated in semiconductor lasers with optical feedback. We generate chaotic temporal waveforms using the semiconductor lasers, and each waveform is assigned to a slot machine (or choice) in the multi-armed bandit problem. The biases in the amplitudes of the chaotic waveforms are adjusted based on rewards using the tug-of-war method. Subsequently, the slot machine that yields the maximum-amplitude chaotic temporal waveform with bias is selected. The scaling properties of the correct decision-making process are examined by increasing the number of slot machines to 1024, and the scaling exponent of the power-law distribution is 0.97. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing software algorithms in terms of the scaling exponent.

This transition is located at 1150 m depth in the EastGRIP ice core, corresponding to an age of 9720 years b2k.\nWe define the brittle zone in the EastGRIP ice core as that from 650 to 950 m depth, where we count on average more than three core breaks per meter.\nWe analyze melt layer thicknesses, correct for ice thinning, and account for missing layers due to core breaks.\nOur record of melt events shows a large, distinct peak around 1014 years b2k (986 CE) and a broad peak around 7000 years b2k, corresponding to the Holocene Climatic Optimum. In total, we can identify approximately 831 mm of melt (corrected for thinning) over the past 10 000 years.\nWe find that the melt event from 986 CE is most likely a large rain event similar to that from 2012 CE, and that these two events are unprecedented throughout the Holocene. We also compare the most recent 2500 years to a tree ring composite and find an overlap between melt events and tree ring anomalies indicating warm summers.\nConsidering the ice dynamics of the EastGRIP site resulting from the flow of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), we find that summer temperatures must have been at least 3 ± 0.6 ∘C warmer during the Early Holocene compared to today.\n                    </jats:p>"

The effects of genetic-shRNA LDH-A knockdown and LDH drug-targeted inhibition (GNE-R-140) on tumor-cell metabolism, tumor growth, and animal survival were similar. LDH-A KD and GNE-R-140 unexpectedly increased the aggressiveness of GL261 intracranial gliomas, but not CT2A and ALTS1C1 i.c. gliomas. Furthermore, the bioenergetic profiles (ECAR and OCR) of GL261 NC and LDH-A KD cells under different nutrient limitations showed that (a) exogenous pyruvate is not a major carbon source for metabolism through the TCA cycle of native GL261 cells; and (b) the unique upregulation of LDH-B that occurs in GL261 LDH-A KD cells results in these cells being better able to: (i) metabolize lactate as a primary carbon source through the TCA cycle, (ii) be a net consumer of lactate, and (iii) showed a significant increase in the proliferation rate following the addition of 10 mM lactate to the glucose-free media (only seen in GL261 KD cells). Our study suggests that inhibition of LDH-A/glycolysis may not be a general strategy to inhibit the i.c. growth of all gliomas, since the level of LDH-A expression and its interplay with LDH-B can lead to complex metabolic interactions between tumor cells and their environment. Metabolic-inhibition treatment strategies need to be carefully assessed, since the inhibition of glycolysis (e.g., inhibition of LDH-A) may lead to the unexpected development and activation of alternative metabolic pathways (e.g., upregulation of lipid metabolism and fatty-acid oxidation pathways), resulting in enhanced tumor-cell survival in a nutrient-limited environment and leading to increased tumor aggressiveness.</jats:p>"

MreB is a promising antibacterial target that functions as an essential elongasome protein in most Gram-negative bacterial rods. Here, we describe a third-generation MreB inhibitor (TXH11106) with enhanced bactericidal activity versus the Gram-negative pathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to the first- and second-generation compounds A22 and CBR-4830, respectively. Large inocula of these four pathogens are associated with a low frequency of resistance (FOR) to TXH11106. The enhanced bactericidal activity of TXH11106 relative to A22 and CBR-4830 correlates with a correspondingly enhanced capacity to inhibit E. coli MreB ATPase activity via a noncompetitive mechanism. Morphological changes induced by TXH11106 in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa provide further evidence supporting MreB as the bactericidal target of the compound. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of TXH11106 as an MreB inhibitor with activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of acute clinical importance.</jats:p>"

In B. cinerea, bcwcl1 encodes for the BcWCL1 protein, the orthologue of the blue-light photoreceptor WC-1 from Neurospora crassa. The functional partner of BcWCL1 is the BcWCL2 protein, both interacting in the nucleus and forming the B. cinerea white collar complex (BcWCC). This complex is required for photomorphogenesis and circadian regulation. However, no molecular evidence shows a light-dependent interaction between the BcWCC components or light-sensing capabilities in BcWCL1. In this work, by employing a yeast two-hybrid system that allows for the in vivo analysis of protein–protein interactions, we confirm that BcWCL1 and BcWCL2 interact in the absence of light as well as upon blue-light stimulation, primarily through their PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains. Deletion of the PAS domains present in BcWCL1 (BcWCL1PAS∆) or BcWCL2 (BcWCL2PAS∆) severely impairs the interaction between these proteins. Interestingly, the BcWCL1PAS∆ protein shows a blue-light response and interacts with BcWCL2 or BcWCL2PAS∆ upon light stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that BcWCL1 and BcWCL1PAS∆ respond to blue light by introducing a point mutation in the photoactive cysteine, confirming that both proteins are capable of light sensing. Altogether, the results revealed the complexity of protein–protein interactions occurring between the core elements of the B. cinerea circadian clock.</jats:p>"

The solver is comprised of semiconductor optical amplifiers and tunable delay lines, therefore it is reconfigurable. A probabilistic algorithm is used, which enables polynomial calculation and footprint complexity with an error rate of less than 1e-12.

This peptide contains a unique “PPTP” <jats:italic>C</jats:italic>-terminal sequence and a “PxIxIT” <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-terminal motif. Furthermore, p38MAPK phosphorylated the threonine residue of the “PPTP” sequence under physiological conditions, dramatically enhancing the peptide’s binding affinity to calcineurin. Therefore, the CABIN1 peptide inhibited the calcineurin-NFAT pathway and the activation of T cells more efficiently than the VIVIT peptide without affecting calcineurin’s phosphatase activity. The CABIN1 peptide could thus be a more potent calcineurin inhibitor and provide therapeutic opportunities for various diseases caused by the calcineurin-NFAT pathway.</jats:p>"

Several theoretical models explaining this spectral slope were proposed under an assumption of gravity wave (GW) saturation. However, little evidence has been obtained to show that these universal spectra are fully composed of GWs. To confirm the validity of this assumption, two kinds of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jgrd57795-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:2169897X:media:jgrd57795:jgrd57795-math-0004\" /> spectra are calculated using outputs from a GW‐permitting high‐top general circulation model. One is the spectra for GWs designated by fluctuations having total horizontal wavenumbers of 21–639. The other is the spectra of fluctuations unfiltered except extracting the linear trend in each vertical profile that were often analyzed in the observational studies. A comparison between the two shows that GWs dominate the observed spectra only in a higher <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jgrd57795-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:2169897X:media:jgrd57795:jgrd57795-math-0005\" /> part of the steep slope, whereas disturbances other than GWs significantly contribute to its lower <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jgrd57795-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:2169897X:media:jgrd57795:jgrd57795-math-0006\" /> part. Moreover, geographical distributions of the characteristic wavenumbers, slopes, and spectral densities of GW spectra are examined for several divided height regions of the whole middle atmosphere. It is shown that strong vertical shear below the zonal wind jets as well as wave saturation are responsible for the formation of the steep slopes of GW spectra.</jats:p>",

We measured both the in-plane and vertical carrier transport in the tBLG/h-BN van der Waals (vdW) tunneling device. The moiré periods were determined from the in-plane carrier transport measurements. The observed vertical tunneling transport characteristics indicated that resonant tunneling occurs from the graphite electrode to tBLG through localized defect states in the h-BN tunnel barrier. We observed multiple defect-assisted resonant tunneling trajectories, from which we derived the density of states (DOS) for tBLG. The obtained DOS has broad flatband features, in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we obtained three types of DOS, suggesting that we probed local band structures corresponding to AA, AB/BA, and domain wall sites in tBLG. Thus, defect-assisted tunneling spectroscopy has potential as a tool to determine the local band structures in twisted 2D vdW materials.</jats:p>",

This study followed a randomized parallel design. Twenty-nine participants (age: 12.86 ± 0.81 years old; height: 152.55 ± 10.37 cm; weight: 42.93 ± 8.85 kg) were allocated to a CST programme (n = 16) performed thrice weekly or to a control group (n = 13) only performing the sport-specific (karate) training. Participants were assessed three times (baseline, mid and post-intervention) for the following tests: (i) flexor endurance test (FET); (ii) back extensor test (BET); (iii) lateral musculature test (LMT); (iv) flexibility; (v) chance of direction (COD); (vi) countermovement jump (CMJ); (vii) back muscle strength (BMS); (viii) horizontal jump (LJ); (ix) sprint test; and (x) karate kick test (KKT). Between-group analysis revealed significant advantages for the CST group on the FET (p &lt; 0.001), BET (p &lt; 0.001), LMT (p &lt; 0.001), 20 m sprint (p = 0.021) and KKT for right (p &lt; 0.006) and left (p &lt; 0.020) legs. No significant differences were found between groups in the remaining physical fitness variables (p &gt; 0.05). The within-group changes revealed significant improvements in the CST group at flexibility (p = 0.002), COD (p &lt; 0.001), CMJ (p &lt; 0.001), BMS (p &lt; 0.002), 20 m sprint (p = 0.033), and KKT (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, within-group changes in the control group were also significant in flexibility (p = 0.024) and right kick (p &lt; 0.042). We conclude that the CST programme improves core endurance and karate kick performance; however, it is not effective enough for other physical performance parameters in KR practitioners.</jats:p>"

We identified that OVCD cells are under oxidative stress due to high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and low glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin 1. Furthermore, OVCD cells have increased glycolysis activity and mitochondrial respiration when compared to immortalized ovarian cells (hTER7) and parental cancer cells (OV90). Our goal was to study how ovarian cell growth depends upon the redox state of the cell; hence, we used MnP (BMX-001), a redox-active MnSOD mimetic, as a molecular tool to alter ovarian cancer redox state. Interestingly, OVCD cells preferentially uptake MnP relative to OV90 cells which led to increased inhibition of cell growth, glycolytic activity, OXPHOS, and ATP, in OVCD cells. These effects were further increased when MnP was combined with carboplatin. The effects were discussed with regard to the elevation in H2O2 levels, increased oxidative stress, and reduced Nrf2 levels and its downstream targets when cells were exposed to either MnP or MnP/carboplatin. It is significant to emphasize that MnP protects normal ovarian cell line, hTER7, against carboplatin toxicity. Our data demonstrate that the addition of MnP-based redox-active drugs may be used (via increasing excessively the oxidative stress of serous ovarian cancer cells) to improve cancer patients’ chemotherapy outcomes, which develop resistance to platinum-based drugs.</jats:p>",

Dense core fibrosis (DCF) and peri-infarct \"gray zone\" of myocardial fibrosis (GZF) on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have been proposed as potential arrhythmogenic substrates. The aim of our study was to determine whether DCF and GZF could predict the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with previous myocardial infarction.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We performed a single centre retrospective study enrolling consecutive patients with previous myocardial infarction undergoing CMR before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.

During a median follow-up of 23 months [IQR 9-38], 13 patients reached the primary endpoint (10 appropriate ICD shock, 2 sustained VT or VF, and 1 sudden arrhythmic death). Patients who attained the primary endpoint had similar DCF (30.4g ± 14.7 vs. 28.0g ± 15.3; P = 0.601) but a greater amount of GZF (18.1g ± 9.6 vs. 11.9g ± 6.7; P = 0.005). On univariate analysis, GZF was associated with the composite endpoint (HR: 1.09 per gram; 95%CI: 1.02-1.15; P = 0.006), whereas DCF was not (HR: 1.01 per gram; 95%CI: 0.98-1.05; P = 0.571). After adjustment for LVEF, GZF remained independently associated with the primary endpoint (adjusted HR: 1.06 per gram; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12; P = 0.035). Decision tree analysis identified 11.9g of GZF as the best cut-off to predict life-threatening arrhythmic events. The primary endpoint occurred in 11 out of the 35 patients (31.4%) with GZF ≥11.9g, but in only 2 of the 53 patients (3.8%) with GZF &amp;lt;11.9g – Figure.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The extent of peri-infarct GZF seems to be a better predictor of ventricular arrhythmias than DCF.

The preparation condition was systematically optimized by studying the effect of temperature and electrolytes. It has been found that an electrochemical exfoliation reaction carried out at an applied potential of 2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a phosphate-ion-containing alkaline solution at a temperature of 40 °C is an ideal condition for the preparation of 14 ± 4 nm-sized carbon nanoparticles. Unlike the literature protocols, there are no filtration and membrane dialysis-based off-line sample pretreatments adopted in this work. The as-prepared carbon nanoparticles were characterized by fluorescence, Raman spectrum, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic characterization methods. It was found that the carbon–oxygen functional group rich in graphene–oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) such as carbon nanoparticles were formed in this work. A preliminary study relating to simultaneous electrochemical oxidation and the sensing of uric acid and ascorbic acid with well-resolved peaks was demonstrated as a model system to extend the new carbon material for electroanalytical applications. Furthermore, in situ synthesis of 2 nm-sized gold nanoparticles stabilized by GOQDs was presented. The carbon nanoparticles prepared by the direct method in this work have shown good stability over 6 months when stored at room temperature. The electrochemical exfoliation reaction has been found to be highly reproducible and suitable for bulk synthesis of luminescence-effective carbon nanoparticles to facilitate fundamental studies and practical applications.</jats:p>"

Therefore, set‐based testing methods that jointly assess the effects of groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were developed to increase the powers of the association tests. However, these powers are still insufficient, and precise estimations of the effect sizes of individual SNPs are largely impossible. In this article, we provide an efficient set‐based statistical inference framework that addresses both of these important issues simultaneously using an empirical Bayes method with semiparametric multilevel mixture modeling. We propose to utilize the hierarchical model that incorporates variations in set‐specific effects and to apply the optimal discovery procedure (ODP) that achieves the largest overall power in multiple significance testing. In addition, we provide an optimal “set‐based” estimator of the empirical distribution of effect sizes. The efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated through application to a genome‐wide association study of coronary artery disease and through simulation studies. The results demonstrated numerous rare variants with large effect sizes for coronary artery disease, and the number of significant sets detected by the ODP was much greater than those identified by existing methods.</jats:p>",

The evolution of density profile, electron and ion temperatures together with the experimental magnetic equilibrium, total current and gas-puff rate is investigated. Comparisons with the interferometry diagnostic show a remarkable overall qualitative agreement during the discharge that can be quantitative at some locations in the plasma core. If at the onset of the <jats:italic>X</jats:italic>-points during the ramp-up the electron heat flux is dominant at the target, present results show that the ion heat flux becomes dominant during the stationary phase of the discharge. Using a simple model for erosion, present results assess the tungsten sputtering due to deuterium ions during the start-up and ramp-up phases of the discharge and confirm the need to consider full discharge simulation to accurately treat the W source of contamination. This work also demonstrates the interest of developing magnetic equilibrium free solver including efficient time integration to step toward predictive capabilities in the future for fusion operation.</jats:p>",

To cope with the risks posed by climate-related stressors to agricultural production, global population growth, and changes in food preferences, it is imperative to develop new climate-smart crop varieties with increased yield and environmental resilience. Molecular genetics and genomic analyses have revealed that allelic variations in genes involved in phytohormone-mediated growth regulation have greatly improved productivity in major crops. Plant science has remarkably advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of various phytohormone-mediated events in plant life. These findings provide essential information for improving the productivity of crops growing in changing climates. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in plant hormonomics (multiple phytohormone profiling) and discuss its application to crop improvement. We present plant hormonomics as a key tool for deep physiological phenotyping, focusing on representative plant growth regulators associated with the improvement of crop productivity. Specifically, we review advanced methodologies in plant hormonomics, highlighting mass spectrometry- and nanosensor-based plant hormone profiling techniques. We also discuss the applications of plant hormonomics in crop improvement through breeding and agricultural management practices.</jats:p>",

Using a juvenile polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C) psychiatric rat model, this study investigated the effects of adolescent risperidone treatment on GABAA receptors and AKT/GSK3β in the VTA. Pregnant female Sprague–Dawley rats were administered Poly I:C (5mg/kg; i.p) or saline at gestational day 15. Juvenile female offspring received risperidone (0.9 mg/kg, twice per day) or a vehicle from postnatal day 35 for 25 days. Poly I:C offspring had significantly decreased mRNA expression of GABAA receptor β3 subunits and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD2) in the VTA, while risperidone partially reversed the decreased GAD2 expression. Prenatal Poly I:C exposure led to increased expression of AKT2 and GSK3β. Risperidone decreased GABAA receptor β2/3, but increased AKT2 mRNA expression in the VTA of healthy rats. This study suggests that Poly I:C-elicited maternal immune activation and risperidone differentially modulate GABAergic neurotransmission and AKT-GSK3β signaling in the VTA of adolescent rats.</jats:p>"

Oxidative stress is an early event during AD pathogenesis and is associated with tau-mediated AD pathology. Oxidative environments can result in the formation of covalent dityrosine crosslinks that can increase protein stability and insolubility. Dityrosine cross-linking has been shown to occur <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> in Aβ plaques and α-synuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies, and this modification may increase the insolubility of these aggregates and their resistance to degradation. Using the PHF-core tau fragment (residues 297 – 391) as a model, we have previously demonstrated that dityrosine formation traps tau assemblies to reduce further elongation. However, it is unknown whether dityrosine crosslinks are found in tau deposits <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> in AD and its relevance to disease mechanism is unclear. Here, using transmission electron microscope (TEM) double immunogold-labelling, we reveal that neurofibrillary NFTs in AD are heavily decorated with dityrosine crosslinks alongside tau. Single immunogold-labelling TEM and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the presence of dityrosine on AD brain-derived tau oligomers and fibrils. Using the tau (297-391) PHF-core fragment as a model, we further showed that prefibrillar tau species are more amenable to dityrosine crosslinking than tau fibrils. Dityrosine formation results in heat and SDS stability of oxidised prefibrillar and fibrillar tau assemblies. This finding has implications for understanding the mechanism governing the insolubility and toxicity of tau assemblies <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Systematic measurements of atmospheric methane (CH4) mole fractions at the northern high latitudes only began in the early 1980s. Although CH4 measurements from Greenland ice cores consistently covered the period before ∼ 1900, no reliable observational record is available for the intermediate period. We newly report a data set of trace\ngases from the air trapped in firn (an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice formation) collected at the NGRIP (North Greenland Ice Core Project) site in 2001. We also use a set of published firn air data at the NEEM (North Greenland Eemian ice Drilling) site. The two Arctic firn air data sets are analysed with a firn air transport model, which translates\nhistorical variations to depth profiles of trace gases in firn. We examine a variety of possible firn diffusivity profiles, using a suite of measured trace gases, and reconstruct the CH4 mole fraction by an iterative dating method. Although the reconstructions of the Arctic CH4 mole fraction before the mid-1970s still has large uncertainties (&gt; 30 ppb – parts per billion), we find a relatively narrow range of atmospheric CH4 history that is consistent with both depth profiles of NGRIP and NEEM. The atmospheric CH4 history inferred by this study is more consistent with the atmospheric CH4 scenario prepared for the NEEM firn modelling than that for the CMIP6 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) experiments. Our study shows that the atmospheric CH4 scenario used for the NEEM firn modelling is considered to be the current best choice for the Arctic CH4 history, but it should not be used to tune firn air transport models until being verified by further measurements from sources such as the Arctic ice cores. Given the current difficulty in reconstructing the CH4 history with low uncertainty from the firn air data sets from Greenland, future sampling and measurements of ice cores at a high-accumulation site may be the only way to accurately reconstruct the atmospheric CH4 trend over the 20th century.\n                    </jats:p>"

Interregional LFP correlations across these brain regions could not detect pronounced differences between awake and sleep states in both young and aged mice. Multivariate analyses with machine learning algorithms with uniform manifold approximation and projection and robust continuous clustering demonstrated that LFP correlational patterns at multiple frequency bands, ranging from delta to high gamma bands, in aged mice less represented awake/sleep states than those in young mice. By housing aged mice in an enriched environment, the LFP patterns were changed to more precisely represent awake/sleep states.

The innovative composite sandwich beams consisted of glass fibre reinforced composite materials as the surface layer and web, Paulownia wood and South Pine as the core material. While keeping the external size unchanged, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 wood cores were formed by the vacuum infusion process at one time, to develop a different number of lattice-webs. In addition, the wood beam was used as a control. A four-point bending test was carried out on all specimen beams. The equivalent bending stiffness, equivalent shear stiffness, mid-span deflection of the specimens and bearing capacity were analysed. There is a larger plateau stage in the latter part of the load-midspan deflection curve of the beams strengthened by the lattice-web, which means the beams had ductile failure characteristics. Furthermore, the type of wood core greatly influenced the flexural behaviour of the composite sandwich beam, and the optimum lattice-web number of the Paulownia specimen is 2, and that of the South Pine specimen is 3. </jats:p>",

For the frame–eccentrical core tube structure, its long‐term deformation includes both vertical deformation and obvious horizontal deformation, which will have an inevitable influence on the structural verticality. The horizontal deformation and its formation mechanism in frame–eccentrical core tube structure are studied in this paper. Based on the finite element software ETABS, a refined finite element model combining with the time‐dependent material model of concrete is established base on a subsistent structure. According to the actual construction conditions, construction analysis is conducted, and the construction deformation and the long‐term deformation after completion are subsequently studied. Based on the results of construction analysis, the effects of elastic modulus, creep, and shrinkage on structural horizontal deformation are analyzed; furthermore, the horizontal deformation characteristics of different structural members in different periods are compared. The results show that the horizontal deformation is related to the vertical deformation of the component, and creep and shrinkage exert opposite effects on the structural horizontal deformation. Besides, the creep and shrinkage are the dominant factors of the horizontal deformation in the later stage. These results are supported by real deformation data obtained from real‐time deformation monitoring during construction, which proves the effectiveness of the method adopted in this paper.</jats:p>",

Alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) in tumor cells commonly contribute to emerging resistance to platinating agents, other targeted therapies, and radiation. The goal of this study is to identify the previously unreported role of NEDD9 scaffolding protein in controlling DDR processes and sensitivity to DNA damaging therapies. Using a siRNA-mediated approach to deplete NEDD9 in a group of human and murine KRAS/TP53-mutant NSCLC cell lines, coupled with a set of cell viability and clonogenic assays, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting, we evaluated the effects of NEDD9 silencing on cellular proliferation, DDR and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling, cell cycle, and sensitivity to cisplatin and UV irradiation. Using publicly available NSCLC datasets (TCGA) and an independent cohort of primary NSCLC tumors, subsequent in silico and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were performed to assess relevant changes in NEDD9 RNA and protein expression across different stages of NSCLC. The results of our study demonstrate that NEDD9 depletion is associated with the increased tumorigenic capacity of NSCLC cells. These phenotypes were accompanied by significantly upregulated ATM-CHK2 signaling, shifting towards a more mesenchymal phenotype in NEDD9 depleted cells and elevated sensitivity to UV-irradiation. IHC analyses revealed an association between reduced NEDD9 protein expression and a decrease in overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the NSCLC patients. These data, for the first time, identified NEDD9 as a negative regulator of ATM kinase activity and related DDR signaling in numerous KRAS/TP53 mutated NSCLC, with its effects on the regulation of DDR-dependent EMT signaling, sensitivity to DNA damaging modalities in tumor cells, and the survival of the patients.</jats:p>"

More MVPA and less ST outside pregnancy increase antioxidant capacity, hence, are beneficial in preventing oxidative stress. The placenta is the first line of defense for the fetus from an adverse maternal environment, including oxidative stress. However, effects of MVPA and ST on oxidative stress markers in the placenta are unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of MVPA and ST in pregnancy with oxidative stress markers in placentas of overweight/obese women (BMI ≥ 29 kg/m2). MVPA and ST were objectively measured with accelerometers at &lt;20 weeks, 24–27 and 35–37 weeks of gestation. Using linear Bayesian multilevel models, the associations of MVPA and ST (mean and changes) with mRNA expression of a panel of 11 oxidative stress related markers were assessed in 96 women. MVPA was negatively correlated with HSP70 mRNA expression in a sex-independent manner and with GCLM expression only in placentas of female fetuses. ST was positively associated with HO-1 mRNA expression in placentas of male neonates. None of the other markers were associated with MVPA or ST. We speculate that increasing MVPA and reducing ST attenuates the oxidative stress state in placentas of obese pregnant women.</jats:p>"

The model was set up, calibrated, and validated with data from 2017 to 2019. In comparison with the measured flow discharge, all the coefficient of determination values of the simulated results at the upstream, midstream, and downstream (outlet) points were larger than 0.80 in both calibration and validation periods, and the relevant Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values were above 0.62. With the model, the response of runoff yield in the small watershed to the land use change before (2015) and after (2019) Olympic construction was simulated and analyzed. The runoff yield change was only −5.1% from 2015 to 2019, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.87 &gt; 0.05). Through simulation of two extreme scenarios, two runoff yield change coefficients were introduced to explore the effects of land use change on runoff yield. The results revealed that the neutralization effects of the land use change from grassland to forest (with strong water conservation capacity) and residential and bare land (with poor water conservation capacity) were the main reasons for the insignificant change of runoff yield. The results of this research may provide some inspiration to the application of SWAT model in small watershed and some guidance to the vegetation restoration practices for water conservation. These results can promote understanding on the response of runoff yield to the land use changes towards two extreme directions of forest land and residential and barren land, and provide some guidance for the vegetation restoration practices in the small watersheds hosting major events.</jats:p>"

Conventional attenuation curve analysis is not standardized and might require input from expert users, hampering clinical application. This study aims to bypass conventional tracer-kinetic analysis with an end-to-end deep learning model to directly categorize patients by stroke core volume from raw, slice-reduced CTP data. (2) Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we included patients with acute ischemic stroke due to proximal occlusion of the anterior circulation who underwent CTP imaging. A novel convolutional neural network was implemented to extract spatial and temporal features from time-resolved imaging data. In a classification task, the network categorized patients into small or large core. In ten-fold cross-validation, the network was repeatedly trained, evaluated, and tested, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). A final model was created in an ensemble approach and independently validated on an external dataset. (3) Results: 217 patients were included in the training cohort and 23 patients in the independent test cohort. Median core volume was 32.4 mL and was used as threshold value for the binary classification task. Model performance yielded a mean (SD) ROC-AUC of 0.72 (0.10) for the test folds. External independent validation resulted in an ensembled mean ROC-AUC of 0.61. (4) Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept study, the proposed end-to-end deep learning approach bypasses conventional perfusion analysis and allows to predict dichotomized infarction core volume solely from slice-reduced CTP images without underlying tracer kinetic assumptions. Further studies can easily extend to additional clinically relevant endpoints.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the ABAQUS, a finite element simulation software, is used to establish the simulation model of the profile with rectangular ribbed section during the process of rotary draw bending, and the stress and strain laws are analyzed. The bending forming limit of the profile with rectangular ribbed section is studied by choosing the fracture of the outer wall as the evaluation standard. And the influences of bending speed, friction coefficient, and thickness on the forming limit are obtained. The minimum bending radius decreases as the bending speed increases and increases with increasing of friction coefficient and thickness. </jats:p>",

Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a prominent cellular mechanism involved in neurodegeneration, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the occurrence of proteinaceous Lewy body inclusions. The contribution of mtDNA variants to PD pathogenesis has long been debated and is still not clearly answered. Cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell models provided evidence for a contribution of mtDNA variants to the PD phenotype. However, conclusive evidence of mtDNA mutations as genetic cause of PD is still lacking. Several models have shown a role of somatic, rather than inherited mtDNA variants in the impairment of mitochondrial function and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, several nuclear genes driving inherited forms of PD are linked to mtDNA quality control mechanisms, and idiopathic as well as familial PD tissues present increased mtDNA damage. In this review, we highlight the use of cybrids in this PD research field and summarize various aspects of how and to what extent mtDNA variants may contribute to the etiology of PD.</jats:p>",

X-ray diffraction, magnetization, and electrical transport measurements show that the deposition at high substrate temperatures induces the crystallized structures of CMG, while the resistivity of the CMG films on YIG (GGG) prepared at and above 500 °C (550 °C) becomes too high to measure the thermo-spin and magneto-thermoelectric effects due to large roughness, highlighting the difficulty of fabricating highly ordered continuous CMG films on garnet structures. Our lock-in thermography measurements show that the deposition at high substrate temperatures results in an increase in the current-induced temperature change for CMG/GGG and a decrease in that for CMG/YIG. The former indicates the enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect in CMG through crystallization. The latter can be explained by the superposition of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect and the spin Peltier effect induced by the positive (negative) charge-to-spin conversion for the amorphous (crystallized) CMG films. These results provide a hint to construct spin-caloritronic devices based on Heusler alloys.</jats:p>",

The SLG\\Cu\\SnS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and SLG\\SnS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\\Cu stacks were annealed in S and Sn + S atmospheres, at various temperatures. Both stacks show a polymorphic structure, and higher annealing temperatures favor the monoclinic CTS phase formation. Morphology is influenced by the stacking order since a SnS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> top layer generates several voids on the surface due to the evaporation of SnS, while a Cu top layer provides uniform and void-free surfaces. The films in the copper-capped stack annealed under Sn + S atmosphere have the best structural, morphological, compositional and optical properties, with tunable band gaps between 1.18 and 1.37 eV. Remarkably, secondary phases are present only in a very low percent (&lt; 3.5%) in samples annealed at higher temperatures. This new synthesis strategy opens the way for obtaining CTS thin films for solar cell applications, that can be used also as intermediary stage for CZTS synthesis.</jats:p>"

The concentration of indoor chemical pollutants is a representative indicator for such evaluation and is generally measured on-site. Moreover, material flow analysis (MFA), using macroscopic statistical data, is a reasonable method for objectively evaluating pollution on a wide scale; however, no effective strategy exists for the prediction of indoor air pollution, nor for the assessment of an individual’s exposure from social stock data. Accordingly, we developed a novel integration method comprising MFA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a computer-simulated person (CSP) to establish a framework for evaluating indoor pollutant concentration and individual exposure of residents. We focused on diethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) and first estimated the amount of DEHP-containing product accumulation in Japan by MFA. Second, we conducted a thorough survey and measurement of DEHP emission rates. Using these results as boundary conditions for indoor CFD with CSP, the individual exposure of a resident, in a standard residential house, was quantitatively evaluated. The total daily exposure per unit of body weight was estimated to be more than 100 (μg/kg/d) in the worst-case scenario which was considered the upper limit for exposure in this analysis. </jats:p>",

Spionidae is one of the most diverse families of annelid worms and is a dominant group in terms of the number of species that have been introduced to non-native areas, while the members of Sabellidae are among the most visible polychaetes commonly found in fouling communities and are colonizing new geographic areas. Based on 20 samples collected in 2021, we provide an overview of the distribution of the investigated species and possible arrival pathways for Marenzelleria neglecta. Specimens were identified based on morphological descriptions. Both species have invasive behaviour, colonizing large areas in relatively short time periods and reaching relatively high densities (M. neglecta—1400 ind.m−2; L. xeprovala—40 ind.m−2). Due to their distribution and high abundances, the biology and ecology of these species in the Danube River–Danube Delta–Black Sea system need to be investigated further in order to assess their impact on ecosystem structure and functioning.</jats:p>"

The country has been successful to reduce its carbon footprint using biofuels, but it is facing a dilemma in vehicle electrification. It cannot shift abruptly to battery electric vehicles, as current consumers are unable to afford them and investment in recharging infrastructure is uncertain. However, it has a significant manufacturing base, and it cannot isolate itself from global industrial trends. This study relies on the inductive case study method, identifying the core green technologies in vehicle electrification and extrapolating their trends, to explain how the transition process is feasible. The emergence of a dominant design (set of core technologies defining a product category and adopted by the majority of players in the market) in small and affordable segments is essential for the diffusion of electric cars in developing countries. Biofuel hybrid technologies may support the transition. The Brazilian industry can engage in electric vehicle development by designing small cars based on global architectures, targeting consumers in emerging markets. The article contributes by using a dominant design core technologies framework to explain and map the transition to electric vehicles in developing countries, supporting academic research, government, and industry planning.</jats:p>"

By using above SERS substrate, we tested different kinds of OPs compounds and obtained excellent detection results. The detection limit of methyl parathion and triazophos can reach 0.01 mg/kg. Meanwhile, under the actual system (orange peel), the detection limit of the methyl parathion and triazophos also can reach 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the above substrate is also very effective for the detection of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a simulant for the chemical warfare agent (sarin), and the detection limit can reach 100 mg/kg. Besides, we also verified the reproducibility and stability of Au@ZrO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, which showed excellent properties.

For human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the core of the nuclear egress complex (NEC) consists of the pUL50–pUL53 heterodimer that is able to oligomerize and thus to build hexameric lattices. These structures determine capsid binding and multicomponent protein interaction including NEC-associated host factors. The underlying characteristic of the core NEC formation is based on the N-terminal hook structure of pUL53 that binds into an alpha-helical groove of pUL50, and is thus described as a hook-into-groove interaction. This central regulatory element has recently been validated as a target of antiviral strategies, and first NEC-targeted prototypes of inhibitory small molecules were reported by our previous study. Here, we further analyzed the oligomerization properties of the viral NEC through an approach of chemical protein cross-linking. Findings were as follows: (i) a cross-link approach demonstrated the oligomeric state of the HCMV core NEC using material from HCMV-infected or plasmid-transfected cells, (ii) a Western blot-based identification of NEC-associated kinases using the cross-linked multicomponent NECs was successful, and (iii) we demonstrated the NEC-inhibitory and antiviral activity of specific inhibitors directed to these target kinases. Combined, the results strongly underline the functional importance of the oligomerization of the HCMV-specific NEC that is both phosphorylation-dependent and sensitive to antiviral kinase inhibitors.</jats:p>"

The biocompatibility of Fe-Au nanoparticles was improved by coating with polyacrylic acid, which provided excellent colloidal stability of nanoparticles with highly negative ζ-potential in water (−38 ± 7 mV) and retained hydrodynamic size (88 ± 20 nm) in a physiological environment. The ferromagnetic iron cores offered great contrast in MRI images with r2 = 11.8 ± 0.8 mM−1 s−1 (at 1 T), while Au satellites showed X-ray attenuation in CT. The intravenous injection of nanoparticles enabled clear tumor border visualization in mice. Plasmonic peak in the Fe-Au hybrids had a tail in the near-infrared region (NIR), allowing them to cause hyperthermia under 808 nm laser exposure. Under NIR irradiation Fe-Au particles provided 24.1 °C/W heating and an IC50 value below 32 µg/mL for three different cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results show that laser synthesized Fe-Au core-satellite nanoparticles are excellent theranostic agents with multimodal imaging and photothermal capabilities.</jats:p>"

In this study, we have shown that the second-generation photosensitizer FOSCAN can be internalized by tumor cells and effectively induce tumor cell death when exposed to laser irradiation in vitro. In addition, these dying tumor cells can be phagocytosed by dendritic cells and lead to their activation and maturation as assessed by in vitro co-culture models. While PDT induces immunogenic tumor cell apoptosis, its application for the treatment of tumors located in deep tissues and advanced malignancies has been limited. In this study, we demonstrate that hepatitis B core virus-like particles (HBc VLPs) can serve as a vaccine to enhance PDT-induced anti-cancer immunity by priming humoral immune responses and inducing CD8+ T cell responses. The combination of PDT and HBc VLPs increased the survival rate of MC-38 tumor-bearing mice to 55%, compared to 33% in PDT alone and no tumor-free mice in vaccine alone. Moreover, the combination effectively prevented tumor recurrence in vivo through enhanced immune memory T cells after therapy. Therefore, as both are clinically approved techniques, this combination provides a promising strategy for cancer therapy.</jats:p>"

Here, we used the immunogenic bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle (VLP) technology to engineer vaccines against the Ct major outer membrane protein variable domain 4 (MOMP-VD4), which contains a conserved neutralizing epitope (TTLNPTIAG). A previously described monoclonal antibody to the MOMP-VD4 (E4 mAb) is capable of neutralizing all urogenital Ct serovars and binds this core epitope, as well as several non-contiguous amino acids. This suggests that this core epitope may require conformational context in order to elicit neutralizing antibodies to Ct. In order to identify immunogens that could elicit neutralizing antibodies to the TTLNPTIAG epitope, we used two approaches. First, we used affinity selection with a bacteriophage MS2-VLP library displaying random peptides in a constrained, surface-exposed loop to identify potential E4 mAb mimotopes. After four rounds of affinity selection, we identified a VLP-displayed peptide (HMVGSTKWTN) that could bind to the E4 mAb and elicited serum IgG that bound weakly to Ct elementary bodies by ELISA. Second, two versions of the core conserved TTLNPTIAG epitope (TTLNPTIAG and TTLNPTIAGA) were recombinantly expressed on the coat protein of the MS2 VLP in a constrained, surface-exposed loop. Mouse immune sera IgG bound to Ct elementary bodies by ELISA. Immunization with these MS2 VLPs provided protection from vaginal Chlamydia infection in a murine challenge model. These data suggest that short peptide epitopes targeting the MOMP-VD4 could be appropriate for Ct vaccine design when displayed on an immunogenic bacteriophage VLP vaccine platform.</jats:p>"

However, at the initial stage of zinc injection, zinc can introduce a large amount of corrosion products entering into the coolant circuit by displacing other divalent species in oxide. These corrosion products will be carried into the core by the coolant and cause unevenness of the crud on fuel cladding surfaces, which can increase the probability of crud induced power shift (CIPS) and damage to fuel claddings. In this paper, the structural material corrosion model with or without zinc injection is built based on a mixed conduction model. The migration model of corrosion products in the primary circuit is established, and the relationship of crud amount with the time is obtained. The mechanism of interactions between zinc and formed oxide layers is analyzed. The extra amount of corrosion products due to zinc injection is calculated according to the different starting times. It is used to revise the crud mass. The influences of zinc injection on the crud amount are achieved, which can be the foundation of further research on the relationship between zinc injection and CIPS.</jats:p>",

An analysis of mRNA expression data indicated that: (i) GL261 LDH-A KD cells may have an improved ability to metabolize lactate into the TCA cycle; and (ii) that GL261 LDH-A KD cells can upregulate lipid metabolism/fatty acid oxidation pathways, whereas the other glioma cell lines do not have this capacity. These two observations suggest that GL261 LDH-A KD cells can develop/activate alternative metabolic pathways for enhanced survival in a nutrient-limited environment, and that specific nutrient limitations have a variable impact on tumor cell metabolism and proliferation. The phenotypic effects of LDH-A KD were compared to those in control (NC) cells and tumors. LDH-A KD prolonged the doubling time of GL261 cells in culture and prevented the formation of subcutaneous flank tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice, whereas GL261 NC tumors had a prolonged growth delay in C57BL/6 mice. In nude mice, both LDH-A KD and NC GL261 tumors grew rapidly (more rapidly than GL261 NC tumors in C57BL/6 mice), demonstrating the impact of an intact immune system on GL261 tumor growth. No differences between NC and KD cell proliferation (in vitro) or tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice (doubling time) were observed for CT2A and ALTS1C1 cells and tumors, despite the small changes to their LDH isoenzyme profiles. These results suggest that GL261 glioma cells (but not CT2A and ALTS1C1 cells) are pre-programmed to have the capacity for activating different metabolic pathways with higher TCA cycle activity, and that this capacity is enhanced by LDH-A depletion. We observed that the combined impact of LDH-A depletion and the immune system had a significant impact on the growth of subcutaneous-located GL261 tumors.</jats:p>"

However, the effects of the complex pore structure of the matrix on imbibition have not been considered comprehensively at different scales in the scientific literature. This paper reports a study of the mechanisms of influence of different matrix pores on imbibition recovery ratio and defines the concept of a fractal coefficient using the method of combining numerical simulation at the core scale with mathematical methods at a pore scale. A matrix model with different pore fractal dimensions and tortuosity of the capillary was established using Python language programming. Y-type and S-type were used to characterize the fractures, and a two-dimensional fracture-controlled matrix unit core-scale numerical model with complex pore structures was established. Based on phase field theory, an oil-water two-phase imbibition numerical simulation was conducted. Comparisons of numerical simulation results and microscopic analysis indicated that imbibition recovery ratio was 39.28% and 50.94%, respectively. The imbibition law revealed by the numerical simulation results is consistent with the results of the microscopic imbibition experiment, and the imbibition effect of bifurcated fractures was better than that of simple curved fractures. As the pore fractal dimension and tortuosity of the capillary increased, the imbibition recovery ratio decreased. A comparison of results of the mathematical model demonstrated that there was a difference between the pore scale and core scale because the pore fractal dimension and capillary tortuosity changed dynamically with pore structure at the core scale. Thus, a parameter that characterizes the relative change of pore fractal dimension and tortuosity was defined and called the fractal coefficient. When the skeleton particles are 200, 400, and 500, the fractal coefficient were calculated to be 0.625 and 0.6, respectively, indicating that when the pore structure changes, the imbibition recovery ratio should be dominated by capillary tortuosity.</jats:p>",

Thus, a proper evaluation method for aging phenomenon of PV modules is required. Although there already are methods which compare adjusted PV output power based on STC (standard test condition) with initial PV module specification, or perform direct comparison by conducting the test under STC, there are issues with objectivity or efficiency in the existing evaluation method of aging phenomenon due to the data distortion while adjusting measured data or difficulties in implementation. Therefore, in order to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantage of the existing evaluation method for deterioration in PV modules and evaluate the aging characteristics of PV modules based on on-site measurement data in an accurate and efficient manner, this paper implements a test device for aging diagnosis to measure and collect actual data from a PV module section, and presents a modeling of data analysis for aging phenomenon with MATLAB S/W in order to minimize the variability of PV output, communication error, delay, etc. Furthermore, this paper confirms the usefulness of the presented test device for aging diagnosis of the PV modules which is accurately evaluated by considering on-site measurement of PV output power by season.</jats:p>"

Reduced marine survival has been implicated as a key driver of the declines, yet the relative importance of different stressors causing mortality at sea is not well understood. This review presents a synopsis of the principal stressors impacting Atlantic salmon in estuarine and marine environments. It also applies a semi-quantitative 2-D classification system to assess the relative effects of these stressors on English salmon stocks and their likely development over the next decade. Climate change and predation were identified as the biggest threats at present and over the next decade. Poor water quality and bycatch were classified as relatively high impact stressors, but with a lower likelihood of becoming more prevalent in the future due to available mitigation measures. Other, less influential, stressors included tidal barrages, artificial light at night, impingement in power-station cooling waters and thermal discharges, pile-driving noise pollution, invasive non-native species, electromagnetic fields, salmon mariculture, and tidal lagoons. Salmon fisheries exploitation was not regarded as an important stressor currently because effective exploitation rate controls have been implemented to substantially reduce fishing pressure. Future research priorities include addressing knowledge gaps on expanding stressor impacts from climate change, predation, renewable energy developments, and artificial light at night. Local management actions directed towards improving freshwater and estuarine habitats to maximise ecosystem resilience to stressors and minimise their cumulative impacts are recommended.</jats:p>",

The FL is also the unique anatomical site where hematopoietic stem cells expand before colonizing the bone marrow, where they ensure life‐long blood cell production and become mostly resting. The identification of the different cell types that comprise the hematopoietic stroma in the FL is essential to understand the signals required for the expansion and differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cells. We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies to identify FL stromal cells in a 5‐laser equipped spectral flow cytometry (FCM) analyzer. The “Autofluorescence Finder” of SONY ID7000 software identified two distinct autofluorescence emission spectra. Using autofluorescence as a fluorescence parameter we could assign the two autofluorescent signals to three distinct cell types and identified surface markers that characterize these populations. We found that one autofluorescent population corresponds to hepatoblast‐like cells and cholangiocytes whereas the other expresses mesenchymal transcripts and was identified as stellate cells. Importantly, after birth, autofluorescence becomes the unique identifying property of hepatoblast‐like cells because mature cholangiocytes are no longer autofluorescent. These results show that autofluorescence used as a parameter in spectral FCM is a useful tool to identify new cell subsets that are difficult to analyze in conventional FCM.</jats:p>",

SAIA was originally developed to address bottlenecks in HIV care in low-and middle-income countries, but has since been adapted and applied to a variety of care systems including: cervical cancer screening, mental health treatment, hypertension management, family planning, and community-based naloxone distribution. These projects have been implemented across a variety of settings in sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. Given the diversity of implementation experience, our consortium aimed to define the core elements of SAIA, to improve reproducibility, guide future adaptations, and lay the groundwork to evaluate mechanisms of action. <jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: Specification of the SAIA strategy was undertaken over 12 months by an expert panel of SAIA researchers, implementing agents and stakeholders, using a three-round, modified nominal group technique approach to match core SAIA components to the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) list of distinct implementation strategies. Core implementation strategies were then specified according to Proctor’s recommendation for specifying and reporting, followed by synthesis of data on related implementation outcomes linked to the SAIA strategy across projects.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>The four components of the SAIA strategy: (1) SAIA strategy meetings; (2) cascade analysis; (3) process mapping; and (4) continuous quality improvement, mapped to 13 distinct ERIC strategies. The SAIA strategy meetings component mapped to external facilitation, organization of provider implementation meetings, and provision of ongoing consultation. Cascade analysis mapped to facilitating relay of clinical data to providers, use of audit and feedback, and modelling and simulation of change. Process mapping tied to local needs assessment, local consensus discussions, and assessment of readiness and identification of barriers and facilitators. Continuous quality improvement encompassed tailoring strategies, developing a formal implementation blueprint, cyclical tests of change and purposefully re-examining the implementation process.<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Formally specifying the core components of SAIA provides improved conceptual clarity to enhance reproducibility for other researchers and practitioners interested in applying the SAIA across novel settings. Furthermore, this work provides a structured framework to examine potential mechanisms of SAIA and its component implementation strategies.</jats:p>"

Answering these long-standing questions in evolutionary biology is indispensable for both understanding how extant biodiversity has evolved and predicting how organisms and ecosystems will respond to changing environments in the future. Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic diversification and speciation in natural populations is key to properly answering these questions. The leap forward in genome sequencing technologies has made it increasingly easier to not only investigate the genetic architecture but also identify the variant sites underlying adaptation and speciation in natural populations. Furthermore, recent advances in genome editing technologies are making it possible to investigate the functions of each candidate gene in organisms from natural populations. In this article, we discuss how these recent technological advances enable the analysis of causative genes and mutations and how such analysis can help answer long-standing evolutionary biology questions.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘Genetic basis of adaptation and speciation: from loci to causative mutations’.</jats:p>",

In particular, tin dioxide, SnO2, is being frequently used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. However, a systematic study on preparation and characterization of the SnO2-ETL is still lacking, and thus, morphological and electronic-functional roles are not fully understood. In this paper, we systematically investigate the SnO2-ETL prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by a spin-coating technique. Using microscopic observations, we morphologically study how the SnO2 film covers the FTO surface with large unevenness. Optical characterizations are employed for investigating an electronic band alignment of the perovskite/SnO2 interface varied with the SnO2 concentration in a solution. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate photovoltaic properties of FTO-based solar cell devices. A major finding from these investigations is the fact that while the SnO2-ETL prepared at the adequate condition exhibits an ideal band alignment, the excessive SnO2 deposition causes a poor electron extraction and device performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that the spin-coated SnO2-ETL can cover the FTO surface as an ultrathin wrapping layer. These results highlight the importance of the SnO2-ETL and pave the way for optoelectronic device applications of perovskite materials.</jats:p>",

Successive SIOP‐RTSG trial protocols recommended pretreatment biopsy of children with unilateral tumours only where there were features to suggest an increased probability of a non‐WT requiring a change in management. The UK experience in the SIOP WT 2001 trial showed that an alternate approach of performing biopsies on all children with renal tumour masses to determine histology at diagnosis rarely changes management, and can result in misdiagnosis (particularly patients in the age range typical for WT). Although a more selective approach to biopsy has been routine practice in all other countries participating in SIOP‐RTSG trials, there was variation between national groups. To address this variation and provide evidence‐based recommendations for the indications and recommended approach to renal tumour biopsy within the SIOP paradigm, an international, multidisciplinary working group of SIOP‐RTSG members was convened. We describe the resulting recommendations of this group, which are to be incorporated in the ongoing SIOP‐RTSG UMBRELLA study.</jats:p>",

Bifacial absorbers can significantly enhance light absorption by capturing albedo light from the environment. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that free-standing silica-silver core–shell nano-resonator arrays allow bifacial and omnidirectional optical absorption across the visible spectrum. Specifically, resonator arrays can highly absorb light (&amp;gt;80%) with all polarizations from a directional range (−40° to 40°) on both front and rear sides of a surface. Numerical simulations reveal that such bifacial and omnidirectional light absorption results from hybridized excitation of surface plasmons and whispering gallery modes in a symmetrical configuration. The absorption band can be flexibly adjusted by changing the silica core size. In addition, the absorbed optical energy quickly decays as the excitation of plasmonic hot electrons as observed using transient absorption spectroscopy. Our work provides a bifacial absorber for many optoelectronic applications in photodetection, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis.</jats:p>",

Here, we report a coaxial printing method in which double-channel filaments are three-dimensional (3D) extrusion-bioprinted using a customized dual-core coaxial nozzle. The filament in one channel can perform core/shell role and the other channel can play a role in perfusion. These parallel channels within filaments are separated by an interval wall of alginate, whose thickness (∼50 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m) is beneficial to supplement nutrients via perfusion. Different cell-laden hydrogels of weak mechanics were used to test the adaptability and perfusability of our method, and the results showed that dynamic perfusion maintained higher viability and functions than static culture. By combining with a bioprinter, 8-layer perfusable double-channel constructs were fabricated, and the cell viabilities gradually decreased with the reduction in nutrients and oxygen in the downstream medium. Furthermore, the double-channel filaments were tested as a platform to mimic dynamic functions between cells through sequential perfusion by using Mouse insulinoma 6 (Min6) and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as the model cells. These results demonstrated the insulin secreted by Min6 upstream simulated and increased the uptake of glucose by the downstream HepG2 cells. In conclusion, our study provided evidence for the probability of all-in-one fabrication of 3D double-channel perfusable constructs with high simplicity, expansibility, and versability. Our strategy has significant potential for building large-scale tissue constructs for applications in tissue engineering, possibly even in drug screening and regenerative medicine.</jats:p>",

An experimental process for evaluating the touch transfer of aerosol-deposited material is described based on controlling surface, tribological, and soft matter components of the transfer process. A range of high-touch surfaces were evaluated. Under standardized touch parameters (15 N, 1 s), relative humidity (RH) of the atmosphere around the contact transfer event significantly influenced transfer of material to the finger-pad. At RH &lt; 40%, transfer from all surfaces was &lt;10%. Transfer efficiency increased markedly as RH increased, reaching a maximum of approximately 50%. The quantity of material transferred at specific RHs above 40% was also dependent on roughness of the surface material and the properties of the aerosol-deposited material. Smooth surfaces, such as melamine and stainless steel, generated higher transfer efficiencies compared to those with textured roughness, such as ABS pinseal and KYDEX® plastics. Pooled human saliva was transferred at a lower rate compared to artificial saliva, indicating the role of rheological properties. The artificial saliva data were modeled by non-linear regression and the impact of environmental humidity and temperature were evaluated within a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment model using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. This illustrated that the trade-off between transfer efficiency and virus survival may lead to the highest risks of fomite transmissions in indoor environments with higher humidity.</jats:p>"

Light absorption and charge carrier extraction are advantages of optoelectronic memristors with high‐quality SC nanorod arrays. The device achieves a fast response speed and a large response current of up to 40 µs and 0.8 µA.

The R13 Fae predicted showed high identity to the putative esterases and glycosyl hydrolases from <jats:italic>Rahnella</jats:italic> species and some members of the Yersiniaceae family.

The R13 Fae recombinant protein showed activity on α-naphthyl acetate and xylan, but not on starch. This enzyme showed mesophilic characteristics, displaying its optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 25°C. The enzyme was stable at pH from 4.5 to 9.0, retaining nearly 66–71% of its original activity. The half-life of the enzyme was 23 days at 25°C.

The World Health Organization (WHO) identified eight domains as core competencies for clinical nurse educators. However, studies on contemporary clinical education and educators’ role indicate that clinical instructors continuously face challenges in adopting the competences recognized by the WHO. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the challenges of implementing the nurse educator core competencies as perceived by the clinical instructors in Erbil in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Method: The interpretive phenomenological approach of the qualitative study and SWOT analysis was adopted to explore the clinical instructors’ experience of clinical education’s challenges. Result: The main challenges of the academic institutions were shortages of qualified clinical instructors, lack of confidence among instructors, and difficulty in achieving learning outcomes. Challenges reported among health institutions include inappropriate selection for managerial roles, poor recognition of clinical education, and poor teaching environments. Conclusion: The study results highlighted challenges for clinical instructors to carry out their role in a safe and less stressful environment, including inadequate strategic plans for clinical teaching from academic institutions and stakeholder involvement in health institutions.</jats:p>",

In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based methods have made substantial progress in landscape feature extraction. However, the lack of annotated data and the complex scenarios inside alleyways result in the limited performance of the available DL-based methods when extracting landscape features. To deal with this problem, we built a small yet comprehensive history-core street view (HCSV) dataset and propose a polarized attention-based landscape feature segmentation network (PALESNet) in this article. The polarized self-attention block is employed in PALESNet to discriminate each landscape feature in various situations, whereas the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) block is utilized to capture the multi-scale features. As an auxiliary, a transfer learning module was introduced to supplement the knowledge of the network, to overcome the shortage of labeled data and improve its learning capability in the historic districts. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our network achieved the highest accuracy in the case study of Beijing Core Area, with an mIoU of 63.7% on the HCSV dataset; and thus could provide sufficient and accurate data for further protection and renewal in Chinese historic districts.</jats:p>"

Its suitability is assessed using the annually resolved lacustrine sediments of Lake Suigetsu (Japan) for which there is high‐resolution ITRAX µXRF core scanning data, and a detailed crypto‐tephrostratigraphy (formerly established via density separation techniques). The studied core sections contain 10 visible and 30 cryptotephra markers that span a range of glass concentrations (from 1000 to &gt;20 000 shards per gram of dried sediment) and compositions (basalts, trachy‐andesites, phonolites, trachytes and rhyolites), thus providing an ideal case study. The ITRAX core scanner produced recognisable µXRF elemental responses for the visible ash layers, including those just 1 mm thick. However, just 10% of the cryptotephra layers could be unequivocally identified. Although this study demonstrates that µXRF core scanning should not be used as an independent method within a similar geological setting, we show it can provide a powerful tool alongside traditional techniques. Where detected, µXRF profiles can verify and refine cryptotephra positions (here to a sub‐millimetre resolution), and help establish reworking signatures. These insights create possibilities for ultra‐precise synchronisation of records, improved chronological modelling and help generate more complete eruption histories.</jats:p>",

In this setting, liquid biopsy has emerged as a potential alternative for both diagnostic and monitoring purposes. The approaches to liquid biopsy include cell-free DNA/circulating tumor DNA, long and micro noncoding RNAs, proteins/peptides, carbohydrates/lectins, lipids, and metabolites. Other approaches include detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells, extracellular vesicles, and tumor-activated platelets.

The focus is on a comparative analysis of using recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) production, in two densely populated Asian countries of large economies, namely Singapore and India. Of the total 930,000 tonnes of plastic waste generated in Singapore in 2019, only 4% were recycled and the rest were incinerated. In comparison, India yielded 8.6 million tonnes of plastic waste and 70% were recycled. Both countries have strict recycling goals and have instituted different waste and recycling management regulations. The findings show that the waste policies and legislations, responsibilities and heterogeneity in collection systems and infrastructure of the respective country are the pivotal attributes to successful recycling. Challenges to recycle plastic include segregation, adulterants and macromolecular structure degradation which could influence the recyclate properties and pose challenges for manufacturing products. A model was developed to evaluate the economic value and mechanical potential of PET recyclate. The model predicted a 30% loss of material performance and a 65% loss of economic value after the first recycling cycle. The economic value depreciates to zero with decreasing mechanical performance of plastic after multiple recycling cycles. For understanding how TENG technology could be incorporated into the circular economy, a model has estimated about 20 million and 7300 billion pieces of aerogel mats can be manufactured from the PET bottles disposed in Singapore and India, respectively which were sufficient to produce small-scale TENG devices for all peoples in both countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, a hybrid sensor based on a section of hollow square core fiber (HSCF) spliced between two single mode fibers is proposed for the measurement of refractive index of liquids. The sensor, with a length of a few millimeters, operates in a transmission configuration. Due to the HSCF inner geometry, two different interferometers are generated. The first, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, is insensitive to the external refractive index, and presents a sensitivity to temperature of (29.2 ± 1.1) pm/°C. The second one, a cladding modal interferometer, is highly sensitive to the external refractive index. An experimental resolution of 1.0 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> was achieved for this component. Due to the different responses of each interferometer to the parameters under study, a compensation method was developed to attain refractive index measurements that are temperature independent. The proposed sensor can find applications in areas where refractive index measurements are required and the control of room temperature is a challenge, such as in the food and beverage industry, as well as in biochemical or biomedical industries.</jats:p>",

Weight is proportional to the product of volume and density. The theory behind this is to calculate the amount of precursor. The calculated amount is used to prepare the core as well as the shell which is formed by simple wet chemical method and addition polymerization. The XRD studies are used to determine the crystallite size of the core/shell nanocomposites. Thus the desired crystallite size is successfully obtained.

Based on yield criterion, the theoretical solution for rectangular FML sandwich tubes dynamic behavior under low-velocity impact is developed considering the strength and the coupling effect of bending and tension. Finite element study is conducted. Theoretical results are well consistent in the finite element ones. Finally, the influences of material and geometric parameters, and impact position on impact force and maximum deflection of FML sandwich tubes are analyzed systematically. The results reveal that the FML sandwich tubes’ impact forces increase with the increase of the strength, number and thickness of the metal layer, the strength and thickness of the composite layer and foam strength; and impact forces increase with the decrease of the metal volume fraction of FML. Also, the impact force increases with the decrease of the distance between the impact position and the clamp-supported end. </jats:p>",

The implementation of such models—made increasingly urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic—are key to addressing gaps in DR-TB care. We abstracted data of rifampicin-resistant (RR)/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients initiated on treatment at 11 facilities between 2010 and 2017 in Sindh and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan. We analysed trends in treatment outcomes relating to programme expansion to peri-urban and rural areas and estimated driving distance from patient residence to treatment facility. Among the 5586 RR/MDR-TB patients in the analysis, overall treatment success decreased from 82% to 66% between 2010 and 2017, as the programme expanded. The adjusted risk ratio for unfavourable outcomes was 1.013 (95% confidence interval 1.005–1.021) for every 20 km of driving distance. Our analysis suggests that expanding DR-TB care to centralized hubs added to increased unfavourable outcomes for people accessing care in peri-urban and rural districts. We propose that as enrolments increase, expanding DR-TB services close to or within affected communities is essential.</jats:p>",

Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to develop clinically relevant preclinical models so that factors governing immunotherapy responses can be studied in immunocompetent mice. We developed a line of mouse triple knockout (TKO: Trp53, Pten, Rb1) urothelial carcinoma organoids transplanted into immunocompetent mice. These bladder tumors recapitulate the molecular phenotypes and heterogeneous immunotherapy responses observed in human bladder cancers. The TKO organoids were characterized in vivo and in vitro and compared to the widely used MB49 murine bladder cancer model. RNAseq analysis of the TKO tumors demonstrated a basal subtype. The TKO xenografts demonstrated the expression of urothelial markers (CK5, CK7, GATA3, and p63), whereas MB49 subcutaneous xenografts did not express urothelial markers. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resulted in a mixed pattern of treatment responses for individual tumors. Eight immune cell types were identified (basophils, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, NK cells, and T cells) in ICI-treated xenografts. Responder xenografts displayed significantly increased immune cell infiltration (15.3%, 742 immune cells/4861 total cells) compared to the non-responder tumors (10.1%, 452 immune cells/4459 total cells, Fisher Exact Test p &lt; 0.0001). Specifically, there were more T cells (1.0% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.002) and macrophages (8.6% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.0002) in responder xenografts than in non-responder xenografts. In conclusion, we have developed a novel preclinical model that exhibits a mixed pattern of response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The higher percentage of macrophage tumor infiltration in responders suggests a potential role for the innate immune microenvironment in regulating ICI treatment responses.</jats:p>"

Many studies have investigated the impacts of leptin on human cancers, such as proliferation and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying leptin-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain incompletely understood. In the current study, leptin downregulation ameliorated lipid accumulation, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, diminished leptin by siRNA not only inhibited sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a master regulator of lipid metabolism, at the mRNA and protein levels, but also reduced SREBP1 downstream target expressions, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), in NPC cells. In addition, leptin expression could modulate the promoter activity of SREBP1. We also found that pharmacological inhibition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase-γ (PPAR-γ) resulted in increased SREBP1 expression in leptin-depleted NPC cells. Functionally, SREBP1 overexpression overcame the effects of leptin-silencing attenuated triglyceride level, cholesterol level and cell survival in NPC cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that leptin is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in NPC cells and might could be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of NPC patients.</jats:p>"

This offers possibilities of constraining stellar core properties (such as core sizes, abundances, and physics) paving the way for improving the precision of the inferred stellar ages. We employ 16 Cyg A and B as our benchmark stars for an asteroseismic study in which we present a novel approach aimed at selecting from a sample of acceptable stellar models returned from forward modelling techniques, down to the ones that better represent the core of each star. This is accomplished by comparing specific properties of the observed frequency ratios for each star to the ones derived from the acceptable stellar models. We demonstrate that in this way we are able to constrain further the hydrogen mass fraction in the core, establishing the stars’ precise evolutionary states and ages. The ranges of the derived core hydrogen mass fractions are [0.01–0.06] and [0.12–0.19] for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively, and, considering that the stars are coeval, the age and metal mass fraction parameters span the region [6.4–7.4] Gyr and [0.023–0.026], respectively. In addition, our findings show that using a single helium-to-heavy element enrichment ratio, (ΔY/ΔZ), when forward modelling the 16 Cyg binary system, may result in a sample of acceptable models that do not simultaneously fit the observed frequency ratios, further highlighting that such an approach to the definition of the helium content of the star may not be adequate in studies of individual stars.</jats:p>",

Fusarium pseudograminearum megabirnavirus 1 (FpgMBV1) was isolated from the hypovirulent strain FC136-2A of F. pseudograminearum as a novel double-stranded RNA mycovirus belonging to the family Megabirnaviridae. Here we examined the effects of FpgMBV1 on colony morphology and pathogenicity of F. pseudograminearum. Through hyphal tip culture, we obtained virus-free progeny of strain FC136-2A, referred to as FC136-2A-V<jats:sup>–</jats:sup>. FpgMBV1 was transferred horizontally to another virus-free strain, WZ-8A-Hyg<jats:sup>R</jats:sup>-V<jats:sup>–</jats:sup>.

Colony morphology was similar between the FpgMBV1-positive and -negative strains. The ability to penetrate cellophane in vitro was lost, and pathogenicity on wheat plants was reduced significantly in the FpgMBV1-positive strains relative to the FpgMBV1-negative strains. Microscopic observations showed a 6-h delay in the formation of appressoria-like structures in FC136-2A relative to FC136-2A-V<jats:sup>–</jats:sup>.

In addition, expression of five genes that encode cell wall-degrading enzymes differed significantly between FpgMBV1-positive and -negative strains at 12 and 20 hai during early infection of wheat cells by conidia. This study provides evidence for the hypovirulence effect of FpgMBV1 on F. pseudograminearum and suggests that the underlying mechanism involves unsuccessful early infection and perhaps cell wall degradation. </jats:p>",

Monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) synthases catalyse the synthesis of MGDG which is further converted into digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG), later replacing phospholipids in the extraplastidial membranes. However, the roles of these enzymes are not well explored in rice. In this study, the rice MGDG synthase 3 gene (OsMGD3) was identified and functionally characterized. We showed that the plant phosphate (Pi) status and the transcription factor PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2 (OsPHR2) are involved in the transcriptional regulation of OsMGD3. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and overexpression lines of OsMGD3 were generated to explore its potential role in rice adaptation to Pi deficiency. Compared with the wild type, OsMGD3 knockout lines displayed a reduced Pi acquisition and utilization while overexpression lines showed an enhancement of the same. Further, OsMGD3 showed a predominant role in roots, altering lateral root growth. Our comprehensive lipidomic analysis revealed a role of OsMGD3 in membrane lipid remodelling, in addition to a role in regulating diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid contents that affected the expression of Pi transporters. Our study highlights the role of OsMGD3 in affecting both internal P utilization and P acquisition in rice.</jats:p>",

We measured H. pylori status (culture, histology, and rapid urease test) and glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C) levels and followed-up at the 1st year and the 5th year of follow-up.Results: The A1C levels significantly decreased in the eradicated group compared to the negative group and the non-eradicated groups (at the 1st year, p = 0.024; at the 5th year, p = 0.009).

Subsequently, we examined five different latent factor models – a unidimensional model, a first-order correlated factor model, a second-order correlated factor model, a traditional bifactor model, and a bifactor S-1 model, in which the first-order factor AD-Irritability/Emotional Impulsivity (II) was modeled as the general reference factor. A bifactor S-1 model with the <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> defined general reference domain AD-II provided the best fit to our data and was straightforward to interpret.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gas disaster prevention and control is essential to coal mine safety production, with accurate measurement of gas pressure and content being the challenging key aspect. Pressure- and gas-maintaining coring devices can characterize cores in situ to achieve this accurate measurement. As an important part of these devices, the hydraulic structure of the coring bit plays a decisive role in the migration, coring rate, and core disturbance of the bottom-hole cuttings, and studying this structure is thus of great significance. In this paper, the fluid simulation software FLUENT is used to carry out numerical simulation of the bottom-hole flow field to study the cutting movement and core disturbance caused by coring bits with different hydraulic structures. The results show that (1) the best nozzle azimuth angle of 75° is beneficial to bottom-hole cutting discharge and reduces the scouring effect of the drilling fluid on the core. (2) The larger the diameter of the nozzle of the coring bit is, the weaker the cutting removal ability of the drill bit and the smaller the cutting scouring effect of the drilling fluid. The optimal nozzle diameter is 12 mm. (3) Adding a sluice channel inside the water barrier ring can reduce the erosion of drilling fluid on the core. (4) Bits with a rectangular inner passage promote cutting migration. Field application results show that the designed coring bit performs well, and the research results can provide a reference for the structure optimization of coring bits for pressure and gas retention.</jats:p>",

The study we report here is focused on molecular and cellular events that occur within a short period of time, which may be related to gravity sensing by cells. Our assumption is that the gravity-sensing mechanism is activated as soon as cells are exposed to any new gravitational environment. To study the molecular events, we exposed cells to simulated μG (SμG) for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h using a three-dimensional clinostat and made cell lysates, which were then analyzed by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) using a panel of 453 different antibodies. By comparing the RPPA data from cells cultured at 1G with those of cells under SμG, we identified a total of 35 proteomic changes in the SμG samples and found that 20 of these changes took place, mostly transiently, within 30 min. In the 4 h and 8 h samples, there were only two RPPA changes, suggesting that the physiology of these cells is practically indistinguishable from that of cells cultured at 1 G. Among the proteins involved in the early proteomic changes were those that regulate cell motility and cytoskeletal organization. To see whether changes in gravitational environment indeed activate cell motility, we flipped the culture dish upside down (directional change in gravity vector) and studied cell migration and actin cytoskeletal organization. We found that compared with cells grown right-side up, upside-down cells transiently lost stress fibers and rapidly developed lamellipodia, which was supported by increased activity of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). The upside-down cells also increased their migratory activity. It is possible that these early molecular and cellular events play roles in gravity sensing by mammalian cells. Our study also indicated that these early responses are transient, suggesting that cells appear to adapt physiologically to a new gravitational environment.</jats:p>"

The continuum emission at ∼43 GHz shows an elongated jet-like structure perpendicular to the ∼345 GHz observation. We conclude that both emissions could correspond to tracing an isothermal collimated fast wind with constant expansion velocity and being driven by the circumstellar ring traced by ALMA. Although this configuration has been discussed within the scope of planetary nebulae models, there is a remarkable fact: the collimated fast wind shows morphological spatial variability. This supports the idea of a symbiotic binary system within the innermost part of M 2-9, which would be composed of a white dwarf and an AGB star. The latter could explain the mirror symmetry observed at larger scales due to their orbital motion.</jats:p>",

However, MSC-related therapeutics are limited due to poor cell survival, requiring appropriate MSC delivery systems to maximise therapeutic capacity. Biomaterial RGD-hydrogel is a potential cell delivery vehicle as it can mimic the natural extracellular matrix and provide cell adhesion support. The application of RGD-hydrogel in the MSC treatment of respiratory diseases is scarce. This study reports that RGD-hydrogel has good biocompatibility and can increase the secretion of Angiopoietin-1, hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, and interleukin-10 in vitro MSCs. The hydrogel-encapsulated MSCs could further alleviate P-ALI and show better cell survival in vivo. Overall, RGD-hydrogel could improve the MSC treatment of P-ALI by modulating cell survival and reparative activities. It is exciting to see more and more ways to unlock the therapeutic potential of MSCs.</jats:p>",

We, therefore, assessed the association of bifurcation angles with aneurysm progression using a bifurcation-type aneurysm model in rats and anterior communicating artery aneurysms in a multicenter case–control study. Aneurysm progression was defined as growth by ≥ 1 mm or rupture during observation, and controls as progression-free for 30 days in rats and ≥ 36 months in humans. In the rat model, baseline bifurcation angles were significantly wider in progressive aneurysms than in stable ones. In the case–control study, 27 and 65 patients were enrolled in the progression and control groups. Inter-observer agreement for the presence or absence of the growth was excellent (κ coefficient, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61–1.0). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that wider baseline bifurcation angles were significantly associated with subsequent progressions. The odds ratio for the progression of the second (145°–179°) or third (180°–274°) tertiles compared to the first tertile (46°–143°) were 5.5 (95% CI, 1.3–35).

Here, we describe a map of 89,923 InDels from exome sequencing of 262 accessions of a Chinese wheat mini-core collection. Population structure analysis, principal component analysis and selective sweep analysis between landraces and cultivars were performed. Further genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified five QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) that were associated with spike length, two of them, on chromosomes 2B and 6A, were detected in 10 phenotypic data sets. Assisted with RNA-seq data, we identified 14 and 21 genes, respectively that expressed in spike and rachis within the two QTL regions that can be further investigated for candidate genes discovery. Moreover, InDels were found to be associated with awn length on chromosomes 5A, 6B and 4A, which overlapped with previously reported genetic loci B1 (Tipped 1), B2 (Tipped 2) and Hd (Hooded). One of the genes TaAGL6 that was previously shown to affect floral organ development was found at the B2 locus to affect awn length development. Our study shows that trait-associated InDels may contribute to wheat improvement and may be valuable molecular markers for future wheat breeding</jats:p>"

For the rehabilitation of patients with MS, resistance training is considered as a safe and efficient method. In this regard, in recent years, core stability exercise has become one of the common training methods for the rehabilitation of patients with MS. It is defined as the ability to control the position of the trunk over the pelvis to effectively transfer the force to the lower extremities during various activities. This study aims to compare the effects of selected TRX and aerofitness exercises on the core stability of women with MS. Methods In this randomized clinical trial, 30 women with MS aged 20-50 years with expanded disability status scale score &lt;5 referred to MS Association of Isfahan were selected by a purposive sampling method and were randomly divided into two TRX and aerofitness groups. They performed the exercises for 8 weeks, 3 sessions per week, each for 60 minutes. Their core stability was measured using the Biering-Sørensen test, isometric lateral trunk endurance tests, and Planck test. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test. Results The selected TRX and aerofitness exercises had a significant effect on the improvement of core stability in women with MS (P &lt;0.05). Patients in the TRX group showed more significant improvement than in the aerofitness group (P &lt;0.05). Conclusion The selected TRX and aerofitness exercises can improve the core stability of women with MS. However, further studies are needed to use these exercises in patients with MS.</jats:p>"

Here, we examined the role of microtubules (MTs) and actomyosin in this basal body positioning. Exposure of mouse embryos to agents that stabilize or destabilize MTs or F-actin impaired such positioning. Active myosin II was detected at the anterior side of node cells before the posterior shift of the basal body, and this asymmetric activation was lost in Prickle and dachsous mutant embryos. The organization of basal-body associated MTs (baMTs) was asymmetric between the anterior and posterior sides of node cells, with anterior baMTs extending horizontally and posterior baMTs extending vertically. This asymmetry became evident after polarization of the PCP core protein Vangl1 and before the posterior positioning of the basal body, and it also required the PCP core proteins Prickle and dachsous. Our results suggest that the asymmetry in baMT organization may play a role in correct positioning of the basal body for left-right symmetry breaking.</jats:p>",

As opposed to the artificial pinning centers obtained by irradiation with various particles, which is a quite expensive approach, we have studied superconducting samples having self-assembled defects, created during the sample fabrication, that act as effective pinning centers. We introduced a simple, straight-forward method of estimating the frequency-dependent critical current density by using frequency-dependent AC susceptibility measurements, in fixed temperatures and DC magnetic fields, from the positions of the maxima in the dependence of the out-of-phase susceptibility on the amplitude of AC excitation magnetic field. The results are compatible with a model that stipulates a logarithmic dependence of the pinning potential on the probing current. A mathematical derivation allowed us to estimate from the experimental data the pinning potentials in various samples, and in various DC magnetic fields. The resulted values indicate large pinning potentials, leading to very small probability of magnetic flux escaping the pinning wells, hence, leading to very high critical currents in high magnetic fields.</jats:p>"

Methods: TSC was measured in: (1) non-neoplastic brain tissues and (2) three types of manually segmented gliomas (diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma (DIPG), recurrent supratentorial low-grade glioma (LGG), and high-grade glioma (HGG)). In a subset of patients, serial changes in both TSC and BSC (dual echo 23Na MRI) were assessed. Results: Twenty-six pediatric patients with gliomas (median age of 12.0 years, range 4.9–23.3 years) were scanned with 23Na MRI. DIPG treated with RT demonstrated higher TSC values than the uninvolved infratentorial tissues (p &lt; 0.001). Recurrent supratentorial LGG and HGG exhibited higher TSC values than the uninvolved white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) (p &lt; 0.002 for LGG, and p &lt; 0.02 for HGG). The dual echo 23Na MRI suppressed the sodium signal within both CSF and necrotic foci. Conclusion: Quantitative 23Na MRI of pediatric gliomas demonstrates a range of values that are higher than non-neoplastic tissues. Dual echo 23Na MRI of BCS improves tissue conspicuity relative to TSC imaging.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our previous study demonstrated the effect of Bacopa monnieri extract (BME) on behavioural deficits in sodium valproate (VPA)-induced  autism  spectrum  disorder  in  mice.  The  present  study  aims to further investigate the effect of BME on neurobehaviors of  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  in  mice  and  the  biochemical  mechanism(s)  involved.  Female  pregnant  mice  were  divided  into  control and VPA treated groups at 12-13 days of gestation (saline/sodium  valproate  500  mg/kg  respectively,  i.p.).  Control  group  pups of saline-treated mothers received distilled water. The VPA-treated  mothers  received  either  distilled  water  or  BME  (50  mg/kg, p.o.) after birth until 13 days later. Then, from postnatal day 14,  ASD  pups  were  orally  treated  with  BME  (50  mg/kg)/distilled  water for the duration of the study. Behavioural deficits (repetitive behaviour and social behaviour deficit) were measured by a self-grooming test and a three-chamber test on postnatal days 20 and 30. On postnatal day 40, the cerebral cortex of pups was isolated for  evaluation  of    the  expression  level  of  PTEN  protein  using  the  Western  blot  method.  The  results  showed  that  BME  (50  mg/kg,  p.o.)  significantly  improved  repetitive  behaviour  and  social behaviour deficits in ASD mice on postnatal day 20 and 30, and also increased PTEN protein expression level in the brain of ASD mice.  These  results  demonstrated  that  BME  ameliorates  core  behaviours of autism and concurrently restores decreases in PTEN protein expression in the cerebral cortex of valproate-treated mice.</jats:p>",

The rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic>) ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 cause overall repression of these iron‐related genes at the transcript level, but their protein‐level regulation is unclear. We conducted a proteome analysis to identify key regulators whose abundance was regulated by OsHRZs at the protein level. In response to iron deficiency or <jats:italic>OsHRZ</jats:italic> knockdown, many genes showed differential regulation between the transcript and protein levels, including the TGA‐type basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP83. We also identified two glutaredoxins, OsGRX6 and OsGRX9, as OsHRZ‐interacting proteins in yeast and plant cells. OsGRX6 also interacted with OsbZIP83. Our <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> degradation assay suggested that OsbZIP83, OsGRX6 and OsGRX9 proteins are subjected to 26S proteasome‐ and OsHRZ‐dependent degradation. Proteome analysis and our <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> degradation assay also suggested that OsbZIP83 protein was preferentially degraded under iron‐deficient conditions in rice roots. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing <jats:italic>OsGRX9</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>OsbZIP83</jats:italic> showed improved tolerance to iron deficiency.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fulgurites are naturally occurring structures that are formed when lightning discharges reach the ground. In this investigation, the mineralogical compositions of core and shell compartments of a rare, iron-rich fulgurite from the Mongolian Gobi Desert were investigated by X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The interpretation of the Raman data was helped by chemometric analysis, using both multivariate curve resolution (MCR) and principal component analysis (PCA), which allowed for the fast identification of the minerals present in each region of the fulgurite. In the core of the fulgurite, quartz, microcline, albite, hematite, and barite were first identified based on the Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics analyses. In contrast, in the shell compartment of the fulgurite, the detected minerals were quartz, a mixture of the K-feldspars orthoclase and microcline, albite, hematite, and goethite. The Raman spectroscopy results were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis of powdered samples of the two fulgurite regions, and are consistent with infrared spectroscopy data, being also in agreement with the petrographic analysis of the fulgurite, including scanning electron microscopy with backscattering electrons (SEM-BSE) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) data. The observed differences in the mineralogical composition of the core and shell regions of the studied fulgurite can be explained by taking into account the effects of both the diffusion of the melted material to the periphery of the fulgurite following the lightning and the faster cooling at the external shell region, together with the differential properties of the various minerals. The heavier materials diffused slower, leading to the concentration in the core of the fulgurite of the iron and barium containing minerals, hematite, and barite. They first underwent subsequent partial transformation into goethite due to meteoric water within the shell of the fulgurite. The faster cooling of the shell region kinetically trapped orthoclase, while the slower cooling in the core area allowed for the extensive formation of microcline, a lower temperature polymorph of orthoclase, thus justifying the prevalence of microcline in the core and a mixture of the two polymorphs in the shell. The total amount of the K-feldspars decreases only slightly in the shell, while quartz and albite appeared in somewhat larger amounts in this compartment of the fulgurite. On the other hand, at the surface of the fulgurite, barite could not be stabilized due to sulfate lost (in the form of SO2 plus O2 gaseous products). The conjugation of the performed Raman spectroscopy experiments with the chemometrics analysis (PCA and, in particular, MCR analyses) was shown to allow for the fast identification of the minerals present in the two compartments (shell and core) of the sample. This way, the XRD experiments could be done while knowing in advance the minerals that were present in the samples, strongly facilitating the data analysis, which for compositionally complex samples, such as that studied in the present investigation, would have been very much challenging, if possible.</jats:p>"

Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic environmental metal contaminant and constantly exposed to humans. Limited information is available on Cd toxicity after early-life respiratory virus infection. In this study, we examined the effects of low-dose Cd exposure following early-life RSV infection on lung metabolism and inflammation using mouse and fibroblast culture models. C57BL/6J mice at 8 days old were exposed to RSV 2 times with a 4-week interval. A subset of RSV-infected mice was subsequently treated with Cd at a low dose in drinking water (RSV infection at infant age [RSVinf]+Cd) for 16 weeks. The results of inflammatory marker analysis showed that the levels of cytokines and chemokines were substantially higher in RSVinf+Cd group than other groups, implying that low-dose Cd following early-life RSV infection enhanced lung inflammation. Moreover, histopathology data showed that inflammatory cells and thickening of the alveolar walls as a profibrotic signature were evident in RSVinf+Cd. The metabolomics data revealed that RSVinf+Cd-caused metabolic disruption in histamine and histidine, vitamin D and urea cycle, and pyrimidine pathway accompanying with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 activation. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that cumulative Cd exposure following early-life RSV infection has a significant impact on subsequent inflammation and lung metabolism. Thus, early-life respiratory infection may reprogram metabolism and potentiate Cd toxicity, enhance inflammation, and cause fibrosis later in life.</jats:p>",

It has been shown that diet is an important environmental factor that contributes to the risk and mortality of several types of cancers. Intake of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs plays an important role in cancer risk and progression. Current Western populations have high consumption of ω-6 PUFAs with a ratio of ω-6/ω-3 PUFAs at 15:1 to 16.7:1 This high consumption of ω-6 PUFAs is related to increased cancer risk and progression. However, whether a diet rich in ω-6 PUFAs can contribute to tumor aggressiveness has not been well investigated. We used a murine model of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma to study the aggressiveness of tumors in mice fed with a diet rich in ω-6 PUFAs and its relationship with oxylipins. Our results shown that the mice fed a diet rich in ω-6 showed a marked increase in proliferation, angiogenesis and pro-inflammatory markers and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in their tumors. Oxylipin profiling revealed an upregulation of various pro-tumoral oxylipins including PGs, HETEs, DiHETrEs and HODEs. These results demonstrate for the first time that high intake of ω-6 PUFAs in the diet enhances the malignancy of tumor cells by histological changes on tumor dedifferentiation and increases cell proliferation, angiogenesis, pro-inflammatory oxylipins and molecular aggressiveness targets such as NF-κB p65, YY1, COX-2 and TGF-β.</jats:p>"

PCR and Southern blotting analysis showed that the T-DNA was inserted into the genome at precise insertion sites and was stably inherited by the progeny. Expression analysis using qRT-PCR and Western blotting indicated that GmWRI1a and bar driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were significantly upregulated in the transgenic plants at different developmental stages. Transcriptome sequencing results showed there were obvious differences in gene expression between transgenic line and transgenic receptor during seed developmental stages. KEGG analysis found that the differentially expressed genes mainly annotated to metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrated metabolism and lipid metabolism. A 2-year single-location field trial revealed that three transgenic lines overexpressing GmWRI1a (GmWRI1a-OE) showed a stable increase in seed oil content of 4.97–10.35%. Importantly, no significant effect on protein content and yield was observed. Overexpression of GmWRI1a changed the fatty acid composition by increasing the linoleic acid (C18:2) content and decreasing the palmitic acid (C16:0) content in the seed. The three GmWRI1a-OE lines showed no significant changes in agronomic traits. The results demonstrated that the three GmWRI1a overexpression lines exhibited consistent increases in seed oil content compared with that of the wild type and did not significantly affect the seed yield and agronomic traits. The genetic engineering of GmWRI1a will be an effective strategy for the improvement of seed oil content and value in soybean.</jats:p>"

Meantime the ongoing works on the Ahdeb oil field's Mishrif reservoir, several reports have documented the difficulties encountered during stimulation operations, including high injection pressures that make it difficult to inject acid into the reservoir formation; and only a few acid jobs have been successful in Ahdeb oil wells, while the majority of the others have been failures; For this formation, there is a high incidence of oil well stimulation failed.

To reveal the discrepancy between T phase and MgZn2 phase, the lattice parameters, cohesive energy, and electronic structure as well as the elastic properties were investigated based on density functional theory. Four types of T phase unit cell were employed according to symmetry of space group. The calculated lattice constants well-agreed with experimental data. Compared to MgZn2 phase, T phases obtained lower cohesive energy owing to their partial covalent bond, which may result in a higher structure stability. The elastic modulus E of T phase depended on the occupation of Al atom, and the effect of the occupation of Al atom on the structure and properties of T phase was also discussed.</jats:p>"

This is important because acutely injured tubules can trigger inflammation and fibrosis that can lead to irreversible injury and CKD. Using human kidney tubule 3D microphysiologic systems and orthogonal epigenomic approaches, we found that serum, but not its major protein component albumin, directly induces tubular injury and secretion of proinflammatory components. Similar changes were observed in preclinical models and patients with proteinuric kidney disease.

Due to unique tri-peptide bonds and the formyl functional group, the bioassay of MPI8 in plasma was challenged by a strong interference from water MPI8. Using QTOF LC-MS/MS, we identified MPI8•H2O as the major interference form that co-existed with MPI8 in aqueous and biological media. To avoid the resolution of MPI8 and MPI8•H2O observed on reverse phase columns, we found that a Kinetex hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column provided co-elution of both MPI8 and MPI8•H2O with a good single chromatographic peak and column retention of MPI8 which is suitable for quantification. Thus, a sensitive, specific, and reproducible LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of MPI8 in rat plasma was developed and validated using a triple QUAD LC-MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Kinetex HILIC column with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min under gradient elution. The calibration curves were linear (r2 &gt; 0.99) over MPI8 concentrations from 0.5–500 ng/mL. The accuracy and precision are within acceptable guidance levels. The mean matrix effect and recovery were 139% and 73%, respectively. No significant degradation of MPI8 occurred under the experimental conditions. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of MPI8 after administration of MPI8 sulfonate in rats.</jats:p>"

A number of TG and PA parameters that must be known to calculate the mechanical characteristics of the conic  springs  unit are outlined. It is shown that the optimal method of assembling disc springs into blocks in CA is combined (series-parallel). Based on the specified design parameters, the dependence of the force created by the disc spring and the spring block on the spring thickness was obtained.

In the method, the electronic structures are sequentially elongated by repeating (1) the conversion of canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) to region-localized MOs (RLMOs), that is, active RLMOs localized onto a region close to an attacking monomer or frozen RLMOs localized onto the remaining region, and the subsequent (2) partial self-consistent-field calculations for an interaction space composed of the active RLMOs and the attacking monomer. For each ELG process, one can obtain local CMOs for the interaction space and the corresponding local orbital energies. Local site information, such as the local highest-occupied/lowest-unoccupied MOs, can be acquired with linear-scaling efficiency by correctly including electronic effects from the frozen region. In this study, we performed a local electronic structure analysis using the ELG method for various DNA block polymers with different sequential patterns. This benchmark aimed to confirm the effectiveness of the method toward the efficient detection of a singular local electronic structure in unknown systems as a future practical application.

A systematic review was performed to specifically evaluate: (1) clinical results (patient-reported pain as well as functional scores, physician clinical reported assessment); (2) radiographic outcomes (i.e., radiographic progression of collapse); and (3) need for further procedures. Materials and Methods: A search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library found eight reports that fit the inclusion criteria for core decompression or nonoperative management of osteonecrosis of the ankle. Four studies totaling 194 ankles diagnosed with osteonecrosis that underwent core decompression were analyzed. An additional four papers examined 64 ankles diagnosed with osteonecrosis that underwent nonoperative management. Level of evidence of the studies ranged from II to IV. Outcomes of core decompression and nonoperative management analyzed clinical scores such as the American Foot and Ankle Severity Score (AOFASS) and Mazur ankle grading system. Radiographic progression was studied with Ficat and Arlet as well as Hawkins scores.  Results: Overall, there was an improvement in clinical scores and decreased radiographic progression in ankles treated with core decompression. AOFASS scores rose from 41.5 + 0.7 to 89 + 0.7, while the mean Mazur score increased from 34.5 + 0.7 preoperatively to 91.5 + 0.7 postoperatively. After core decompression, only 21% (40 out of 194 ankles) progressed radiographically to Ficat and Arlet stage III or IV postoperatively. Furthermore, core decompression showed less requirement for further surgical management compared to nonoperative management. Conclusions: Osteonecrosis of the ankle is not as commonly encountered in practice compared to other joints, such as the hips and knees. The results of this study suggest that core decompression is a successful option for treating osteonecrosis of the ankle.</jats:p>"

A potential compounding issue, which may serve as an unappreciated, dominant resistance mechanism, is an inherent systemic immune dysfunction that is often associated with advanced cancer. Minimal response to inhibitory receptor (IR) blockade therapy and increased disease burden have been associated with peripheral CD8+ T-cell dysfunction, characterized by suboptimal T-cell proliferation and chronic expression of IRs (e.g., PD1 and LAG3). Here, we demonstrated that approximately a third of cancer patients analyzed in this study have peripheral CD8+ T cells that expressed robust intracellular LAG3 (LAG3IC), but not surface LAG3 (LAG3SUR) due to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) cleavage. This is associated with poor disease prognosis and decreased CD8+ T-cell function, which could be partially reversed by anti-LAG3. Systemic immune dysfunction was restricted to CD8+ T cells, including, in some cases, a high percentage of peripheral naïve CD8+ T cells, and was driven by the cytokine IL6 via STAT3. These data suggest that additional studies are warranted to determine if the combination of increased LAG3IC in peripheral CD8+ T cells and elevated systemic IL6 can serve as predictive biomarkers and identify which cancer patients may benefit from LAG3 blockade.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

NRF2 activation has been reported to alter the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrated that NRF2 alters tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway that is associated with a tumor-promoting, immune suppressed microenvironment. Specifically, proteomic profiles of 47 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines (11 KEAP1 mutant and 36 KEAP1 wild-type) revealed the tryptophan-kynurenine enzyme kynureninase (KYNU) as a top overexpressed protein associated with activated NRF2. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L2, the gene encoding for NRF2, or activation of the NRF2 pathway through siRNA-mediated knockdown of KEAP1 or via chemical induction with the NRF2-activator CDDO-Me confirmed that NRF2 is a regulator of KYNU expression in LUAD. Metabolomic analyses confirmed KYNU to be enzymatically functional. Analysis of multiple independent gene expression datasets of LUAD, as well as a LUAD tumor microarray demonstrated that elevated KYNU was associated with immunosuppression, including potent induction of T-regulatory cells, increased levels of PD1 and PD-L1, and resulted in poorer survival. Our findings indicate a novel mechanism of NRF2 tumoral immunosuppression through upregulation of KYNU.</jats:p>"

In humans, the neural circuit that supports vocal motor control consists of a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortico loop. The basal ganglia regions, striatum and globus pallidus, in this loop play a role in modulating the acoustic features of vocal behavior such as loudness, pitch, and articulatory rate. In PD, this area is implicated in pathogenesis. In animal models of PD, the accumulation of toxic aggregates containing the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein (αsyn) in the midbrain and striatum result in limb and vocal motor impairments. It has been challenging to study vocal impairments given the lack of well-defined cortico-basal ganglia circuitry for vocalization in rodent models. Furthermore, whether deterioration of voice quality early in PD is a direct result of αsyn-induced neuropathology is not yet known. Here, we take advantage of the well-characterized vocal circuits of the adult male zebra finch songbird to experimentally target a song-dedicated pathway, the anterior forebrain pathway, using an adeno-associated virus expressing the human wild-type αsyn gene,<jats:italic>SNCA</jats:italic>. We found that overexpression of αsyn in this pathway coincides with higher levels of insoluble, monomeric αsyn compared to control finches. Impairments in song production were also detected along with shorter and poorer quality syllables, which are the most basic unit of song. These vocal changes are similar to the vocal abnormalities observed in individuals with PD.</jats:p>"

In this research an ultrasonic compound horn was designed with through cutout of uniform diameter. The performance of ultrasonic horn was observed by varying the cutout diameter by modelling horns of four different materials: titanium, aluminum, steel and stainless steel respectively. Modal analysis was performed for computing modal frequencies in the axial direction, whereas harmonic analysis was carried out in order to determine vibration amplitude, stresses and factor of safety. The effect of varying frequency ratio on vibration magnification, stresses, and factor of safety were also investigated. The axial modal frequency was observed to increase, whereas amplitude of vibration and stresses were observed to decrease by increasing the cutout size. Titanium was found to be the most suitable material for ultrasonic horns, because it provided up to 159.4 % more amplitude of vibration and 3 times higher safety factor thus operating life as compared to other materials.</jats:p>"

Understanding how positional cues guide morphogenesis requires the quantification of gene expression and growth dynamics in the context of their underlying coordinate systems. Here, we present recent advances in the MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015⁠) that implement a generalized framework to annotate developing organs with local coordinate systems. These coordinate systems introduce an organ-centric spatial context to microscopy data, allowing gene expression and growth to be quantified and compared in the context of the positional information thought to control them.</jats:p>"

We measured T-cell responses in 108 healthcare workers (HCWs) using the commercialized Oxford Immunotec T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 assay service (OI T-SPOT) and the PITCH ELISpot protocol established for academic research settings. Both assays detected T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Responses were significantly lower when reported by OI T-SPOT than by PITCH ELISpot. Four weeks after two doses of either Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 vaccine, the responder rate was 63% for OI T-SPOT Panels 1 + 2 (peptides representing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein excluding regions present in seasonal coronaviruses), 69% for OI T-SPOT Panel 14 (peptides representing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike), and 94% for the PITCH ELISpot total spike. The two OI T-SPOT panels correlated strongly with each other showing that either readout quantifies spike-specific T-cell responses, although the correlation between the OI T-SPOT panels and the PITCH ELISpot total spike was moderate. The standardization, relative scalability, and longer interval between blood acquisition and processing are advantages of the commercial OI T-SPOT assay. However, the OI T-SPOT assay measures T-cell responses at a significantly lower magnitude compared to the PITCH ELISpot assay, detecting T-cell responses in a lower proportion of vaccinees. This has implications for the reporting of low-level T-cell responses that may be observed in patient populations and for the assessment of T-cell durability after vaccination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, some special populations—groups of early childhood and people with autism, among others—faced more profound challenges than the common people. The lack of real physical contact such as embracing greatly affected the effectiveness of development, psychiatric treatment, and other processes for these populations. This study is aimed at developing clothing with appropriate contact pressure based on the contact comfort principle of psychology and providing a type of pressure clothing that can relieve the wearer’s tension by simulating hugging, alleviating the lack of physical contact for early childhood education and special education groups during the pandemic. First, the elementary requirements of clothing design are attained using a questionnaire survey and test method. The analysis revealed that clothing should fulfill the four requirements of pressure comfort, fabric softness, wearing and taking off comfort, and visual beauty. Second, we realized the performance requirements in the fabric and accessories, style design, structure design, and functional design. Finally, the product experience is proposed through a fitting, and the reasonable opinions were fed back to the product design to enhance the functionality of clothing. The research shows that clothing can simulate hugging and can ease the loneliness of the wearer. This study can be used as a good tool to assist during the pandemic for early childhood education and special psychological symptom groups, as well as a broader group of people living alone at home, to play an adjunctive treatment and loneliness relief functions.</jats:p>",

Joint analysis of multiband photometry from TESS, Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT), MuSCAT3, Sinistro, and KeplerCam confirmed the transit signal to be achromatic as well as refined the orbital ephemeris. High-resolution imaging with Gemini/’Alopeke and high-resolution spectroscopy with the Subaru InfraRed Doppler (IRD) confirmed that there are no stellar companions or background sources to the star. The spectroscopic observations with IRD and Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX were used to determine the stellar parameters, and it was found that the host star is an M4 dwarf with an effective temperature of <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>eff</jats:sub> = 3185 ± 76 K and a metallicity of [Fe/H] =  0.336 ± 0.060 dex.

High-contrast imaging data are used to resolve the stellar host and exclude stellar companions at separations ≳0.″2.

With the discovery of this outer companion, we carry out a detailed exploration of the possibilities that TOI 620 b might instead be a circum-secondary planet or a pair of eclipsing binary stars orbiting the host in a hierarchical triple system. We find, under scrutiny, that we can exclude both of these scenarios from the multiwavelength transit photometry, thus validating TOI 620 b as a low-density exoplanet transiting the central star in this system. The low density of TOI 620 b makes it one of the most amenable exoplanets for atmospheric characterization, such as with the James Webb Space Telescope and Ariel, validated or confirmed by the TESS mission to date.</jats:p>",
