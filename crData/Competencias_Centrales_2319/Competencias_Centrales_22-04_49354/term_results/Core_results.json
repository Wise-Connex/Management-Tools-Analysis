Core analysis is complex containing many stages between the reservoir and the final measurements and interpretation. To ensure the data produced is valid, every step along this phase must be handled with equal attention. Recently developed techniques of measuring certain special core analysis of rock formation are being perfected. The objective of this paper is to provide information that will be of practical value to geologists and engineers involved with preliminary core preparation program. Following is a guideline for preliminary special core preparation. The step by step outline presented below is a suggested guideline and, most certainly, modifications and or changes may be made. However, this guideline has been found to be very successful for laboratory works.</jats:p>"

In this study, a diversity‐oriented assembly of <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>‐mannosyl α‐dystroglycan (α‐DG) glycopeptides has been achieved via a chemoenzymatic strategy. This strategy features (i) gram scale divergent synthesis of core m1, core m2 and core m3 mannosylated amino acids from judiciously designed protecting group strategies and chemical glycosidation; (ii) efficient glycopeptide assembly via the optimized microwave‐assisted solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS); and (iii) enzymatic elaboration of the core glycan structures to install galactosyl and sialyl‐galactosyl moieties. The efficiency and flexibility of this chemoenzymatic approach was demonstrated with the construction of 12 glycopeptides with different core m1, core m2 and core m3 mannosyl glycans, including a core m2 glycopeptide bearing a heptasaccharide for the first time.\n<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/cjoc202200088-gra-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"image\" />\n</jats:p>",

In three dimensions an unambiguous zero crossing for the tree-level form-factor is established, and consistency for all investigated form factors with a power-like divergence towards the infrared is observed. Using very coarse lattices this is even seen towards momenta as low as about 15 MeV. The results in four dimensions are consistent with such a behavior, but do not yet reach deep enough into the infrared to establish it.</jats:p>"

Here, the anisotropic carrier dynamics in optically excited (010) oriented Fe-doped β-Ga2O3 was studied by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. An 800 nm continuous-wave light source was employed to excite carriers from Fe acceptors to the conduction band and to probe an anisotropic interaction with the THz field. The complex THz conductivities fitted with the Drude and Drude–Smith models revealed that the optically excited carriers behave as nearly free carriers along the a-axis, whereas those along the c-axis show a non-Drude type response. The estimated mobility for the c-axis agrees with the reported values, whereas the results suggest much higher mobility along the a-axis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The  notion  that  modern buildings  should  strive to  be  net  zero  energy  buildings  (NZEBs)  is  widely accepted.  One  of  the  causes  leading  to high  energy  usage  for  space  heating,  resulting  in  avoidable carbon  emissions,  is  heat  loss  via  building  windows.  In  order  to  improve window’s insulation in existing buildings, structured-core transparent vacuum insulation panels (TVIPs) are proposed. TVIPs mainly consist of the structured core material, the low-emissivity film, and the transparent gas barrier envelope. TVIPs have high insulation performance and are inexpensive to manufacture and can be easily installed. Therefore, TVIPs have potential to improve window’s insulation in existing buildings with low cost. However, it is necessary to overcome the issue of preventing the pressure rise inside TVIP after vacuum sealing. The authors constructed an experimental setup to quantify the effect of reduction of gas flow rate in TVIP after evacuation by applying pressure-rate-of-rise-method. In this experiment, a gas barrier film with a straw was used as the vacuum chamber. This could reproduce the pressure increase in the TVIP after sealing and the gas flow rate in the TVIP is evaluated. The experimental  result  show  that  the  coated  core  material  and  the  enclosing  getter  agentlowered  the pressure rise and gas flow rate in TVIP by combining concurrent evacuation and heating. Furthermore, after extending the simultaneous vacuuming and heating period to 8 hours and applying the coated core material and enclosing the gettering agent, the internal pressure in TVIP may be lowered to around 1 Pa after  30  minutes after halting vacuuming. It  was confirmed that this  pressure  satisfied the performance required for TVIPs, and the result was much closer to the realization of TVIPs.</jats:p>",

Free Speech: From Core Values to Current Debates traces the development and evolution of the free speech doctrine in the Supreme Court and explores how the Court - with varying levels of success - has applied that doctrinal framework to “hard cases” and current controversies, such as those involving hate speech, speech on the internet, speech on campus, and campaign finance regulation.

Matrix factorization is currently the most popular model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method that achieves high recommendation accuracy. However, similarity computation hinders the development of CF-based recommendation systems. Preference obtained only depends on the explicit rating without considering the implicit content feature, which is the root cause of preference bias. In this paper, the content feature of items described by fuzzy sets is integrated into the similarity computation, which helps to improve the accuracy of user preference modelling. The importance of a user is then defined according to preferences, which serves as a baseline standards of the core users selection. Furthermore, core users based matrix factorization model (CU-FHR) is established, then genetic algorithm is used to predict the missing rating on items. Finally, MovieLens is used to test the performance of our proposed method. Experiments show CU-FHR achieves better accuracy in prediction compared with the other recommendation methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For decades, coaxial printing has been widely applied in 3D tissue engineering scaffold fabrication. However, there are few reports regarding polymeric materials application in shell production due to fabrication constraints. In this study, a combination of cryogenic printing and coaxial printing aims to approach the challenge. Polycaprolactone (PCL) and sodium alginate (SA) were selected as the representative shell and core materials to test the feasibility of the coaxial cryogenic printing by optimizing key parameters, including working temperature, air pressure, PCL, and SA concentration. According to the optical and SEM images, the SA core contracts a string inside the PCL shell, illustrating the shell/core structure of the 3D coaxial PCL/SA scaffolds. Besides, the shell/core 3D scaffold possesses a 38.39 MPa Young’s modulus in mechanical tests; the PCL shell could retain at least 8 h in 5 mol/L HCl solution, leading to a fabricated drug-loaded PCL/SA shell/core “responsive” to acidic pH. In summary, coaxial cryogenic printing was developed to fabricate 3D scaffolds with a PCL/SA shell/core scaffold, broadening the material range of coaxial printing and providing promising applications in drug release.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Whole genome sequencing-based typing methods have become the gold standard for phylogenetic classifications of bacterial populations. The most common approach is to compare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the core genome of a cohort of isolates. Greater confidence in SNP-based population assignments can be gained by extending this analysis to include the accessory genome. This is often accomplished by comparing allelic differences between isolates using whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST). Unfortunately, allele-based methods, like wgMLST, suffer from being highly species-specific, therefore limiting their current application to only commonly studied bacteria. This work aimed to address this limitation by developing an alternative population classification method based on the accessory genome that could be more universally applied, regardless of the bacterial species being studied. This was accomplished by comparing population assignments based on core SNPs to those derived from the phylogenetic analysis of gene presence/absence matrices output by common pangenome assembly software (i.e., Panaroo or Roary). </p>"

Based on full first-principles simulations, we report cooperative diffusion along the longitudinally fast〈111〉directions of body-centred cubic (bcc) iron in temperature ranges of 2000-4000 K below the melting curve and pressures up to 3 TPa. The diffusion is due to low energy barriers in the corresponding direction and accompanied by mechanical and dynamic stability of bcc iron. With the assistance of the diffusion, bcc iron demonstrates strong elastic anisotropy and variations with temperature and pressure, which is consistent with several seismological signatures of the Earth’s inner core, particularly the positive correlation between P wave velocity and attenuation. This finding also has implications for nucleation and growth of the inner core and suggests the exotic state and properties of iron need to be considered in future geophysical and planetary models.</jats:p>"

Among the various types of polymers, electrospun piezoelectric polymers have many potential applications. In this study, a new type of functional microfiber composed of poly(γ-benzyl-α,L-glutamate) (PBLG) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with significantly enhanced electromechanical properties has been reported. Recently reported electrospun PBLG fibers exhibit polarity along the axial direction, while electrospun PVDF fibers have the highest net dipole moment in the transverse direction. Hence, a combination of PBLG and PVDF as a core–shell structure has been investigated in the present work. On polarization under a high voltage, enhancement in the net dipole moment in each material and the intramolecular conformation was observed. The piezoelectric coefficient of the electrospun PBLG/PVDF core–shell fibers was measured to be up to 68 pC N−1 (d33), and the voltage generation under longitudinal extension was 400 mVpp (peak-to-peak) at a frequency of 60 Hz, which is better than that of the electrospun homopolymer fibers. Such new types of functional materials can be used in various applications, such as sensors, actuators, smart materials, implantable biosensors, biomedical engineering devices, and energy harvesting devices.</jats:p>"

Classically, the two mechanisms denoted in the literature that allow individuals to address these environmental changes are either phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolutionary changes. However, phenotypic plasticity itself can evolve rapidly. In this study, we investigated the genetic differentiation between marginal and core populations of a high-trophic level insect,<jats:italic>Leptopilina boulardi</jats:italic>, a<jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>parasitoid, which has exhibited a very rapid progression northward of its geographical range. Several life history traits have been investigated in different populations according to four fluctuating thermal regimes that mimic the thermal conditions in the field. We found that at low developmental temperature, the two northern marginal populations that have to face a colder winter, survive longer than the two core populations. In addition, the northernmost populations exhibit a higher potential fecundity, a higher starvation resistance and a larger amount of energy at low temperatures. These significant genetic differentiations with genotype-by-environment interactions show that a rapid genetic differentiation of the shape of thermal reaction norms is possible when populations have to cope with new environments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Most carbonate reservoirs are oil-wet/mixed-wet and heterogenous at multiple scales. Majority of the injected water flows through the high permeability regions/fractures and bypass the oil in the matrix due the high negative capillary pressure (Pc). To enhance oil recovery from such reservoirs, the sign of the Pc should be changed by wettability alteration (WA) or the Pc should be reduced by lowering interfacial tension (IFT). In this study, surfactants which can either alter wettability or develop ultra-low IFT were identified through laboratory measurements for the target carbonate reservoir. The performance of these two types of surfactants was systematically evaluated at the core scale and scaled-up to the reservoir scale. A reservoir-scale model was developed to simulate injection-soak-production (ISP) tests and evaluate performance of the selected surfactants at the field scale. Experiments showed that quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants have excellent WA ability, while a series of propoxy sulfate anionic surfactants showed intermediate WA and ultra-low IFT. Spontaneous imbibition tests showed that WA surfactants have fast initial oil production, while ultra-low IFT surfactants has low initial oil rate but higher final oil recovery, which was validated by mechanistic simulation. Low IFT results in low Pc and slow imbibition, but also triggers gravity-driven drainage. For ultra-low IFT system, gravity drainage is more dominant than WA, and Pc-alteration is less important than relative permeability (Kr) alteration. As reservoir thickness increases, Kr-alteration is more important than Pc-alteration. Gravity drainage is expected to be scaled up by length of matrix (L), while Pc-driven imbibition is scaled by L2. Field-scale simulation showed that low-IFT surfactant has better injectivity than WA surfactant during injection phase. In soaking phase, spontaneous imbibition by WA surfactant is much more significant than that by low-IFT surfactant. In production phase, post-waterflood achieved higher oil recovery from low-IFT surfactant treated matrix due to its low residual oil saturation and high oil relative permeability.</jats:p>",

This study implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) based lightweight cryptographic core that consists of two encryption protocols, four authentication protocols, and a key generation/exchange protocol for ultra-low-cost devices. The hardware architectures use the concept of resource sharing to minimize the hardware area. The lightweight cryptographic SoC is tested by designing a desktop software application to serve as an interface to the hardware.

We implemented novel multilevel cortical and thalamic mixing, and included local thalamic inhibitory interneurons, and direct layer 5 projections of variable density to TRN and thalamus to investigate the functional consequences of different ratios of core and matrix node connectivity contribution to spindle dynamics. Our simulations showed that spindle power in primates can be modulated based on the level of cortical feedback, thalamic inhibition, and engagement of model core vs. matrix, with the latter having a greater role in spindle dynamics. The study of the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of core-, matrix-, and mix-generated sleep spindles establishes a framework to study disruption of TC circuit balance underlying deficits in sleep and attentional gating seen in autism and schizophrenia.</jats:p>"

Banana microbiomes may provide novel solutions to these constraints but are difficult to manage due to their high diversity and variability between locations. Hence ‘common core’ taxa, which are a subset of the microbiome that frequent all, or most, individuals of a host species, represent logical targets for the development of microbiome management approaches.\nResults\n To identify the common core bacterial microbiome of banana, we first performed a pot experiment to characterise the effects of two factors that are likely to differ between farms (<jats:italic>viz</jats:italic>. edaphic conditions and host genotype) on bacterial diversity in bulk soil and seven plant compartments. As diversity was found to differ between plant compartments and soils, but not genotypes, we identified populations that were frequent across most plants irrespective of the soil in which they were grown. Shortlisted ‘candidates’ were then refined according to whether they were also frequent in a survey of 52 field-grown <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. This led to the selection of 36 ‘common core’ bacteria, that represented 65–95% of the dominant taxa in field-grown plants and were identified as highly interconnected ‘hubs’ using networks – a characteristic shown to be indicative of microbes that influence host fitness in studies of other plants. Lastly, by comparing the sequences of our core taxa with those reported in 22 previous studies, we demonstrated that they are closely related to banana-associated bacteria observed on five other continents.\nConclusions\n Our study provides a robust list of common core bacterial taxa for <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. Further research may now focus on how changes in the frequencies and activities of these most persistent taxa influence host fitness. Notably, for several of our core taxa highly similar populations have already been isolated in previous studies and may be amenable to such experimentation. This contribution should help to accelerate the development of effective <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. microbiome management practices.</jats:p>"

We studied the interdependence of phorbolesters (DAG mimics) with Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Although expression of either Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 stimulated secretion, phorbolester was only stimulatory for secretion when ubMunc13-2 expression dominated, but inhibitory when Munc13-1 dominated. Accordingly, phorbolester stimulated secretion in wildtype cells, or cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2, but inhibited secretion in Munc13-2/<jats:italic>Unc13b</jats:italic> knockout (KO) cells or in cells overexpressing Munc13-1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Serpentinites and peridotites are the predominant lithological components of Oceanic Core Complexes (OCCs), located commonly at triple junctions of slow-spreading oceanic accreting ridges, fracture zones and transform faults. These lithologies differ from the surrounding oceanic brittle lithosphere, built of basalt and gabbro, and the structural evolution of these OCCs is enigmatic. The present investigation suggests that the tectonics of OCCs is derived from the ascent of serpentinic diapirs generated by the unique proximity of shallow asthenosphere, faulted lithosphere and the juxtaposition of oceanic crusts of contrasting densities. Such setting initiated two structural stages in the evolution of the OCC, the first is spontaneous subduction of old and dense oceanic crust under the fresh and lighter basalt at the edge of the MOR across its intersection with transform fault - fracture zone. The sub ducted slab would be affected by the combined effect of the steep thermal gradient and the availability of volatiles there to enhance the alteration of pyroxene into serpentine. Analog and numeric experiments show that spontaneous subduction can initiate spontaneously if the density contrast between the juxtaposed slabs is significant, as is the case between fresh basalt (ρ~2.7 g/cm3 ) and older basalt (ρ~2.9 g/cm3 ). Since the average thermal gradient under the MOR is ca. 130o /km, then at depth of 4-5 km the pyroxene and plagioclase would start their alteration, mostly to serpentine. The abundant faults of MOR normal rifting and strike-slip transform faulting could enable the light and malleable serpentinite to form diapirs, which would ascent to the seafloor at the rift-fracture zone intersections. The friction at the top of the diapirs during their ascent would probably generate breccia at their tops. Highlights a) OCCs are built mostly of serpentinite diapirs that carry peridotite inclusions. b) Serpentinization occurs under low pressure-high temperature conditions. c) OCC source rock is slab of cold oceanic crust sub ducted under fresh crust. d) Such subduction occurs mostly where large density contrast between slabs exists. e) The link between OCCs and detachment normal faults requires support.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Phosphorus (Pi) is a macronutrient essential for plant growth, development, and reproduction. However, there is not an efficient available amount of Pi that can be absorbed by plants in the soil. Previously, an elite line, MSDZ 109, selected from Malus mandshurica, was justified for its excellent tolerance to low phosphorus (low−Pi) stress. To date, however, the genes involved in low−Pi stress tolerance have not yet been unraveled in this species. Currently, the physiological responses of this line for different days to low−Pi stress were characterized, and their roots as well as leaves were used to carry out transcriptome analysis, so as to illuminate the potential molecular pathways and identify the genes involved in low−Pi stress−response. After exposure to low−Pi treatment (32 µmol/L KH2PO4) for 20 day after treatment (DAF) the biomass of shoots was significantly reduced in comparison with that of the stress−free (control), and root architecture diversely changed. For example, the root growth parameters e.g., length, surface area, and total volume somewhat increase in comparison with those of the control. The activity of acid phosphatase (ACP) increased with the low−Pi treatment, whereas the photosynthetic rate and biomass were declining. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), were substantially elevated in response to low−Pi treatment. Many enzyme−related candidate genes e.g., MmCAT1, MmSOD1 and MmPOD21 were up−regulated to low−Pi treatment. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that the processes of photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and MAPK signaling pathway were affected in the low−Pi response. In combination with the physiological characterization, several low−Pi−responsive genes, e.g., PHT, PHO, were identified, and the genes implicated in Pi uptake and transport, such as MmPHT1;5, MmPHO1, MmPAP1, etc., were also obtained since their expression status varied among the exposure times, which probably notifies the candidates involved in low−Pi−responsive tolerance in this line. Interestingly, low−Pi treatment activated the expression of transcription factors including the WRKY family, MYB family, etc. The available evidences will facilitate a better understanding of the roles of this line underlying the high tolerance to low−Pi stress. Additionally, the accessible data are helpful for the use of the apple rootstock M. mandshurica under low−Pi stress.</jats:p>"

One such RNA-binding protein is ZC3H14, which is lost in an inherited intellectual disability. The Drosophila melanogaster ZC3H14 ortholog, Nab2, localizes to neuronal nuclei and cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules and is required for olfactory memory and proper axon projection into brain mushroom bodies. Nab2 can act as a translational repressor in conjunction with the Fragile-X mental retardation protein homolog Fmr1 and shares target RNAs with the Fmr1-interacting RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2. However, neuronal signaling pathways regulated by Nab2 and their potential roles outside of mushroom body axons remain undefined. Here, we present an analysis of a brain proteomic dataset that indicates that multiple planar cell polarity proteins are affected by Nab2 loss, and couple this with genetic data that demonstrate that Nab2 has a previously unappreciated role in restricting the growth and branching of dendrites that elaborate from larval body-wall sensory neurons. Further analysis confirms that Nab2 loss sensitizes sensory dendrites to the genetic dose of planar cell polarity components and that Nab2-planar cell polarity genetic interactions are also observed during Nab2-dependent control of axon projection in the central nervous system mushroom bodies. Collectively, these data identify the conserved Nab2 RNA-binding protein as a likely component of post-transcriptional mechanisms that limit dendrite growth and branching in Drosophila sensory neurons and genetically link this role to the planar cell polarity pathway. Given that mammalian ZC3H14 localizes to dendritic spines and controls spine density in hippocampal neurons, these Nab2-planar cell polarity genetic data may highlight a conserved path through which Nab2/ZC3H14 loss affects morphogenesis of both axons and dendrites in diverse species.</jats:p>"

First, monoplex networks of structural, functional and metabolic connectivity were constructed, and consequently combined into a multiplex SC-FC-MC network by linking the same nodes categorically across layers. Taking into account the multiplex nature using a tensorial approach, we identified a set of core nodes in this multiple network based on a combination of eigentensor centrality and overlapping degree. We introduced a coreness coefficient, which mitigates the effect of modeling parameters to obtain robust results. The proposed methodology was applied onto young and elderly healthy volunteers, where differences observed in the monoplex networks persisted in the multiplex as well. The multiplex core showed a decreased contribution to the default mode and salience network, while an increased contribution to the dorsal attention and somatosensory network was observed in the elderly population. Moreover, a clear distinction in eigentensor centrality was found between young and elderly healthy volunteers.</jats:p>"

Patients’ demographic data and the initial (T1) and final (T2) core temperatures during the operation were compared. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A total of 160 patients were included in the study. The T2 value of the HFA group was significantly lower than the LFA group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.028).

Here, we investigate the properties of photo-excited InP/ZnSe QDs using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. We show that the evolution of the band-edge bleach with increasing exciton number can be interpreted as state filling of the conduction- and valence-band edge states by delocalized electrons and holes. In line with this interpretation, net stimulated emission is observed once the average exciton number exceeds 1. We account for this lower-than-expected gain threshold and for the spectral properties of the gain band by reckoning that the Stokes shift between band-edge absorption and emission is the dominant spectral shift. The underlying exciton-phonon coupling leads to a stimulated emission mechanism, where also single excitons could lead to net optical gain. To fully profit from this advantageous stimulated emission scheme, we argue that InP/ZnSe QDs with more narrow emission lines are needed and spurious trapping of electron-hole pairs at high exciton numbers must be suppressed, for example by better controlling the composition of the core/shell interface.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During meiosis, homologous chromosomes must recognize, pair, and recombine with one another to ensure the formation of inter-homologue crossover events, which, together with sister chromatid cohesion, promote correct chromosome orientation on the first meiotic spindle. Crossover formation requires the assembly of axial elements, proteinaceous structures that assemble along the length of each chromosome during early meiosis, as well as checkpoint mechanisms that control meiotic progression by monitoring pairing and recombination intermediates. A conserved family of proteins defined by the presence of a HORMA (HOp1, Rev7, MAd2) domain, referred to as HORMADs, associate with axial elements to control key events of meiotic prophase. The highly conserved HORMA domain comprises a flexible safety belt sequence, enabling it to adopt at least two of the following protein conformations: one closed, where the safety belt encircles a small peptide motif present within an interacting protein, causing its topological entrapment, and the other open, where the safety belt is reorganized and no interactor is trapped. Although functional studies in multiple organisms have revealed that HORMADs are crucial regulators of meiosis, the mechanisms by which HORMADs implement key meiotic events remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarize protein complexes formed by HORMADs, discuss their roles during meiosis in different organisms, draw comparisons to better characterize non-meiotic HORMADs (MAD2 and REV7), and highlight possible areas for future research.</jats:p>"

Using a hydrodynamic description for cell nuclei as particles interacting initially via an <jats:italic>effective</jats:italic>, attractive force as mediated by the respective, surrounding cytoskeletons, we quantify structure development in brain organoids to determine what physical mechanism regulates the number of cortex-core structures. Regions of cell nuclei overdensity in the linear regime drive the initial seeding for cortex-core structures, which ultimately develop in the non-linear regime, as inferred by the emergent form of an effective interaction between cell nuclei and with the extracellular environment. Individual cortex-core structures then provide a basis upon which we build an extended version of the buckling without bending morphogenesis (BWBM) model, with its proliferating cortex and constraining core, to predict foliations/folds of the cortex in the presence of a nonlinearity due to cortical cells actively regulating strain. In doing so, we obtain asymmetric foliations/folds with respect to the trough (sulci) and the crest (gyri). In addition to laying new groundwork for the design of more familiar and less familiar brain structures, the hydrodynamic description for cell nuclei during the initial stages of brain organoid development provides an intriguing quantitative connection with large-scale structure formation in the universe.</jats:p>"

Given that flexibility, novelty and originality are driving forces in meme culture, the question arises how traditional pragmatic notions like <jats:italic>recipient design</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>common ground</jats:italic> can be said to apply for the interaction with memes.

This modern form of communication oscillates between reference to shared cultural contents and the establishment and perpetuation of conventions on the one hand, and the pursuit of originality on the other hand. This paper will demonstrate how memes can vary with respect to the degree to which they require core common ground or the generation of emergent common ground for their proper usage. The scale presented as a result of the discussion represents a continuum of the prevalence of semantics versus pragmatics involved in the usage and interpretation of memes.</jats:p>",

It is extremely important to search and confirm diverse hub genes that are effective in the advance and prediction of glioblastoma.\nMethods\n We analyzed three microarray datasets (GSE50161, GSE4290, GSE68848), which was derived from the GEO database. GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were performed using the DAVID. PPI network of these DEGs was analyzed based on the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database and visualized by Cytoscape software. Hub genes were identified through PPI network and Robust Rank Aggregation method. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine database were used to perform the validation of hub genes. In addition, the survival curve analysis was also conducted to verify the correlation between the expression of hub genes and prognosis. The human glioblastoma cells and normal cells were collected and then RT-PCR, Western-blot and immunofluorescence were conducted to validate the expression of NDC80. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were used to detect the proliferative of glioma cells. The effects of NDC80 on migration and invasion of GBM cell lines were evaluated by conducting scratch assay and transwell assay.\nResults\n A total of 716 overlapping genes were in the common region, containing 188 upregulated DEGs and 528 downregulated DEGs. Furthermore, we also found among the overlapping DEGs, ten hub genes with a high degree of connectivity. The expression of ten hub genes in TCGA and Oncomine database were significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma compared with normal ones. Besides, the survival analysis showed that the patients with low expression of six genes (BIR5C, CDC20, NDC80, CDK1, TOP2A and MELK) had a significant favorable prognosis (P &lt; 0.01). We firstly discovered that NDC80, an important molecule in other cancers, also plays an important role in malignant gliomas. The RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence results showed that the expression level of NDC80 was significantly higher in human glioblastoma cells than in normal cells. Moreover, we identified that NDC80 up-regulates the proliferation and invasion abilities of human glioblastoma cells.\nConclusions\n The distinguished six genes may be utilized to form a board of progressive and predictive biomarkers of glioblastoma for clinical purpose. Especially, NDC80 was discovered that may play an important role in glioblastoma.</jats:p>"

The results show that it can reduce the concrete from self-compacting concrete beams with percentages from 5.4 to 14.2 with a decrease in the first crack load from 9.1 to 22.7% and the ultimate strength from 2.3 to 10.5% respectively compared to the reference solid beam. The optimization analysis shows that the beam of 46 mm diameter hollow-core is the optimum selection in the concrete volume reduction of 11.1%, cracking load, and ultimate load reduction of 13.6% and 9.3% respectively among all the other beam specimens. While the sustainability analysis reveals that, using longitudinal voids of diameters from 32 to 52 mm leads to a decrease in the embodied energy with percentages from 5.4 to 14.2% and carbon dioxide emission with percentages from 5.4 to 14.1% respectively. Increasing the longitudinal void diameter makes hollow-core self-compacting concrete beams more ductile and exhibits large deflections before failure occurrences.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Article Highlights</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"order\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Tests on hollow-core reinforced self-compacting concrete beams are conducted.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Recycled plastic pipes are used to create hollow-core in the beams and to reduce ineffective concrete.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Reducing ineffective concrete contributes to sustainability with maintaining a good ratio of beam strength.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

This study was conducted in some stages in order to determine the partial effect of organizational learning on the organizationâ€™s core competencies, and organizational performance. The aforementioned aspect contributed to further studies in the strategy management. It concerned the effect of organizational learning on core competencies, and organizational performance, especially in organizing private universities. Previous research was reviewed to aid variables and hypothesis development. The variables used in the research were organizational learning, organizational core competencies, and work performance. The following stages were conducted through the course of the research: browsing articles, separating articles, extracting data, synthesizing data, reporting data. Data analysis method used path analysis. The approach used was quantitative positivists. The populations in this study were all private universities in the scope of Region VIII LLDIKTI Bali and Nusa Tenggara, focusing in East Nusa Tenggara. The sample were university and college in East Nusa Tenggara province: 40 PTS (High Education Institutions) consisting of 12 universities and 28 college. This study focused on the phenomenon occurred in NTT province higher education. The higher education organization management has not been well standardized. It exhibited low quality organizational competency, educational qualifications, lecturer competencies, facilities and infrastructure. Offered study programs were not in accordance with the regional condition. The graduateâ€™s competence did not suit the regional need. The local governments did not focus its effort in higher education. Regardless of this obstacle, the community kept sending their children to higher education institutions. This was indicated by increased number of universities in NTT and high-interest rate in entering higher education. This condition encouraged researchers to determine the phenomenonâ€™s crucial aspects. This research aimed to illustrate how organizational learning and core organization competencies needed to be developed in improving private university institutions performance in NTT province.Keywords: Organizational Learning, Core Organization Competencies, Organizational Performance,      Private Universities Organizations</jats:p>"

The attempt to restore the core material to the initial state (oxidized) after Exp. 2 by exposing the core material to fluids with oxygen was seemingly not successful. The observation was also supported by unsteady state flooding measurements which indicated that as long as the core remained fluid saturated, it behaved as a reduced core, even after extensive exposure to oxygen containing liquids. The crossing point of the oil and water relative permeabilities indicate that the core was more water wet in reduced state compared to before the oxidized state. Differences in chemical composition were also detected between extracts from Exp. 1 - 3.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The conclusion is that significant differences in steady state relative permeabilities of oil and water in oxidized and reduced states were observed for the iron containing core investigated.

Stage one: A longlist of candidate outcomes across CM and DVA was developed through rapid systematic reviews of intervention studies, qualitative and grey literature; stakeholder workshops; survivor interviews. Stage two: Three-panel, three round e-Delphi surveys for CM and DVA with consensus meetings to agree the final COSs.Participants287 stakeholders participated in at least one stage of the process (i.e. either CM or DVA COS development): initial workshops (n=76), two e-Delphi surveys (n=168) and consensus meetings (n=43). Stakeholders included survivors, practitioners, service commissioners, policymakers, and researchers.ResultsStage one identified 335 outcomes categorised into nine areas and 39 domains. Following stage two, the final five outcomes included in the CM-COS were: child emotional health and wellbeing; child’s trusted relationships; feelings of safety; child abuse and neglect; service harms. The final five outcomes in the DVA-COS were: child emotional health and wellbeing; caregiver emotional health and wellbeing; family relationships; freedom to go about daily life; feelings of safety.ConclusionsWe developed two core outcome sets for CM and DVA with two common outcomes (child emotional health and wellbeing; feelings of safety). The COSs reflect shared priorities amongst service users, providers, and researchers. Use of these COSs across trials and service evaluations for children and families affected by CM and DVA will make outcome selection more consistent and help harmonise research and practice.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global plant breeding activities are reliant on the available genetic variation held in extant varieties and germplasm collections. Throughout the mid- to late 1900s, germplasm collecting efforts were prioritized for breeding programs to archive precious material before it disappeared and led to the development of the numerous large germplasm resources now available in different countries. In recent decades, however, the maintenance and particularly the expansion of these germplasm resources have come under threat, and there has been a significant decline in investment in further collecting expeditions, an increase in global biosecurity restrictions, and restrictions placed on the open exchange of some commercial germplasm between breeders. The large size of most genebank collections, as well as constraints surrounding the availability and reliability of accurate germplasm passport data and physical or genetic characterization of the accessions in collections, limits germplasm utilization by plant breeders. To overcome these constraints, core collections, defined as a representative subset of the total germplasm collection, have gained popularity. Core collections aim to increase germplasm utilization by containing highly characterized germplasm that attempts to capture the majority of the variation in a whole collection. With the recent availability of many new genetic tools, the potential to unlock the value of these resources can now be realized. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) cotton breeding program supplies 100% of the cotton cultivars grown in Australia. The program is reliant on the use of plant genetic resources for the development of improved cotton varieties to address emerging challenges in pest and disease resistance as well as the global changes occurring in the climate. Currently, the CSIRO germplasm collection is actively maintained but underutilized by plant breeders. This review presents an overview of the Australian cotton germplasm resources and discusses the appropriateness of a core collection for cotton breeding programs.</jats:p>"

However, the molecular subtype of breast cancer in CNB and surgery is a paradox at times. Analyzing the correlation between ABVS and the difference of molecular subtypes between CNB and surgery specimens has not been reported. The purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of ABVS imaging that affect the discrepancy of molecular subtypes between CNB and surgical specimens in breast cancer patients.<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Eighty-two breast cancer patients (83 lesions) who underwent ABVS examinations were enrolled at Jinling Hospital between November 2014 to October 2020. The molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B (HER-2 positive), luminal B (HER-2 negative), HER-2 overexpression, and triple-negative subtypes) and the discrepancy rate of the specimens via CNB and surgery were determined. The clinicopathological and ABVS imaging features were compared between the discrepancy group (molecular subtypes were different between CNB and surgery specimens) and the consistency group (molecular subtypes were concordant between CNB and surgery specimens). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the diagnostic performance of the significant features. <jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>Of the 83 lesions, a concordance rate of 73.5% (<jats:italic>κ</jats:italic>=0.64) was shown between the CNB specimens and the surgical specimens for molecular subtypes. The presence of clear boundary, irregular shape, well-defined margin, and no retraction phenomenon on ABVS were independently associated with discrepancy in molecular subtypes (all <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for the combination of these four features on ABVS was 0.9 (95% CI:0.8-0.9), yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 41%, respectively.<jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> ABVS is feasible with excellent sensitivity in determining the discrepancy of molecular subtypes between specimens via CNB and surgery. Multipoint puncture during CNB should be advocated for the lesions with the presence of clear boundary, irregular shape, well-defined margin, and lack of retraction phenomenon, thus leading to avoidance of discrepancy in molecular subtypes in clinical diagnosis and treatment processes in breast cancer patients.</jats:p>"

Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah: (1) mengetahui kecepatan angin minimal yang dibutuhkan untuk mengisi energi listrik ke sistem penyimpanan; (2) mengetahui lama waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk melakukan pengisian daya ke sistem penyimpanan sampai penuh; dan (3) mengetahui waktu yang digunakan untuk menghabiskan energi yang tersimpan dan suhu yang dicapai. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa kecepatan angin minimal yang dibutuhkan untuk memutarkan turbin angin yaitu sebesar 16,2 km/jam dan menghasilkan kecepatan putaran turbin sebesar 41,2 rpm. Waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk mengisi akumulator 45 Ah sampai penuh dengan kecepatan angin rata-rata 17,5 km/jam, kecepatan putaran turbin rata-rata 53,6 rpm dan arus listrik rata-rata yang dihasilkan 2,4 ampere adalah 18 jam 45 menit. Waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk menurunkan tegangan akumulator menjadi 6 volt adalah 2 jam 1 menit 59 detik dan menghasilkan suhu sebesar 3,5 °C. Hasil uji coba menunjukkan bahwa angin dapat digunakan sebagai sumber energi alternatif pada mesin pendingin skala kecil yang dirancang.&#x0D;\nKata kunci: angin, refrigerasi, turbin angin</jats:p>"

The purpose of the study was to evaluate and refine CCI by examining whether it attains its training objectives of mental health literacy, gatekeeper training, and fostering positive youth development, while exploring helpful and unhelpful participant experiences of the program. CCI was field-tested during the latter half of the 2017/2018 school year at 3 different locations: a private school, a community centre, and a public school. Using mixed methods, the evaluation yielded information on the strengths and areas of growth for future program development. The quantitative data were collected from a sample of 29 youth, while the qualitative data were collected from 9 youth using the Enhanced Critical Incident Technique. The converging data highlight the importance of connection, the value of critical mental health literacy, and the importance of clarifying expectations. The lessons learned from implementing this program can be applied to other youth mental health promotion programs.</jats:p>"

It focused on leadership commitment, organizational structure, and employee involvement as the core variables influencing strategy implementation.&#x0D;\nMethodology: The researcher used random stratification to select fifteen (15) rural banks from the southern belt, (15) from the middle belt, and 360 participants from these rural and community banks in Ghana. The study used a five-point-Likert scale designed questionnaire to elicit information for data analysis.&#x0D;\nFindings: The results revealed that some of the moderator variables of the predictor variables significantly influenced strategy implementation. Under leadership commitment; the variables found to be significant in influencing strategy implementation were leadership communicating a clear vision to the understanding of employees with statistical significance accepted at P=0.001&gt;0.05,  leadership prioritizing the release of resources with statistical significance accepted at P=0.000&gt;0.05, and leadership behaviours with statistical significance accepted at P=0.001&gt;0.05. Under organizational structure; release of sufficient resources for organisational restructuring had the statistical significance of P=0.000&gt;0.05; clearly defined roles and responsibilities P=0.000&gt;0.05; Knowledge sharing’ P=0.001&gt;0.05; employee involvement in the structural reforms P=0.006 &gt;0.05, and inability to provide technical information on the job had P=0.005&gt;0.05. Under employee involvement: the right environment, good reward systems, and training were variables found to be statistically significant in influencing strategy implementation. The statistical significance was accepted at P=0.001&gt;0.05, P=0.005&gt;0.05, and P=0.030&gt;0.05 respectively. &#x0D;\nContribution to theory, practice, and policy/recommendation: The theoretical contribution made in this study is the investigation into strategy implementation in the rural and community banks in Ghana. There is no current literature that has examined strategy implementation in the rural and community banks in Ghana and examined the key variables used in this study to make predictions and conclusions on factors influencing strategy implementation. The study provides a framework for strategy implementation for the RCBs, with a universal applicability in the varying context of strategy implementation, contributing to the repository of knowledge in strategy implementation. The study recommends that leadership create a conducive environment to encourage creativity and idea generation to facilitate proper strategic activities to advance an effective strategy implementation, a clear vision to establish the nature, form, and content of the organizational structure that will fit the strategy, the release of resources, and a reward package for employee effort in the strategic process. </jats:p>"

Etiology of this disease is characterized by either traumatic events or atraumatic risk factors, such as chronic alcohol consumption or glucocorticoid use. ONFH commonly presents as pain in the groin, gluteus muscles, and/or knee with reductions in internal rotation range of motion of the hip. ONFH pathology can be confirmed with radiographic or advanced imaging and characterized by stage, size and location of the lesion. Treatment for ONFH consists of conservative and therapeutic methods as well as surgical intervention. Historically, ONFH has been treated using total hip arthroplasty (THA), but with increasing incidence in a younger, active population, measures to preserve the native hip joint have been explored. Recent advancements in hip arthroscopy and arthroscopy-assisted core decompression have led to improved outcomes, reduced pain and higher hip survival rate for early onset ONFH compared with more invasive approaches such as THA. Biologic treatments combined with arthroscopic core decompression have also shown improved outcomes and quality of life in few reports, suggesting a potential role for biologic adjuncts. The current study provides a comprehensive review and update on the literature surrounding arthroscopy-assisted core decompression for patients with ONFH.</jats:p>"

Despite few studies, the relationship between unbalanced core strengthening and injuries in dancesport is investigated.  Objective: Study the relationship between unbalanced core strengthening and muscle strength in dancesport athletes.  Methods: An experiment was conducted with 60 students from dance schools. They were randomly divided between an experimental group and a control group, with 30 people each. Each group included 15 males and 15 females. The experimental group used unilateral core stability training. The control group used traditional core stability training.  Results: The results showed that the quality of action improved significantly after core strength training (P &lt;0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: Core strengthening can improve balance ability in athletes. There was no statistical difference between the training, with similar positive balance ability and explosion strength effects in the athletes.

However, there are limited reports on their toxic effects on wild mammals. To predict NNI-induced toxic effects on wild mammals, it is necessary to determine the exposure levels and metabolic ability of these species. We considered that raccoons could be an animal model for evaluating NNI-induced toxicities on wildlife because they live near agricultural fields and eat crops treated with NNIs. The objective of the present study was to estimate the effects of NNI exposure on wild raccoons. Urinary concentrations of NNI compounds (n = 59) and cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of NNIs (n = 3) were evaluated in wild raccoons captured in Hokkaido, Japan, in 2020. We detected either one of the six NNIs or one metabolite, including acetamiprid, imidacloprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and desmethyl-acetamiprid in 90% of raccoons (53/59); the average cumulative concentration of the seven NNI compounds was 3.1 ng/ml. The urinary concentrations were not much different from those reported previously for humans. Furthermore, we performed an in vitro assessment of the ability of raccoons to metabolize NNIs using hepatic microsomes. The amounts of NNI metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry and compared with those in rats. Raccoons showed much lower metabolic ability; the maximum velocity/Michaelis–Menten constant (Vmax/Km) values for raccoons were one-tenth to one-third of those for rats. For the first time, we show that wild raccoons could be frequently exposed to NNIs in the environment, and that the cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of NNIs in the livers of raccoons might be low. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of NNIs on raccoons, leading to better conservation efforts for wild mammals. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;41:1865–1874. © 2022 The Authors.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; including acetate, propionate, and butyrate) are an important class of biological molecules that play a major role in modulating host-microbiome interactions. Despite significant research into SCFA-mediated biological mechanisms, absolute quantification of these molecules in their native form by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is challenging due to their relatively poor chromatographic properties. Herein, we introduce SQUAD, an isotope-based strategy for absolute quantification of SCFAs in complex biological samples. SQUAD uses aniline derivatization in conjunction with isotope dilution and analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We show that SQUAD enables absolute quantification of biologically relevant SCFAs in complex biological samples with a lower limit of detection of 40 nM and a lower limit of quantification ranging from 160 nM to 310 nM. We observed an intra- and inter-day precision under 3% (relative standard deviation) and errors in intra- and inter-day accuracy under 10%. To demonstrate this quantification strategy, we analyzed SCFAs in the caecal contents of germ free versus conventionally raised specific pathogen free (SPF) mice. We showed that acetate was the most abundant SCFA in both types of mice and was present at 200-fold higher concentration in the SPF mice. We also illustrated the use of our quantification strategy in<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>microbial cultures from five different species of bacteria grown in Mueller Hinton media. This study illustrates the diverse SCFA production rates across microbial taxa with acetate production serving as one of the key differentiating factors across the species. In summary, we introduce an isotope dilution strategy for absolute quantification of aniline-dativized SCFAs and illustrate the utility of this approach for microbiome research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fingerprint (FP) representations of chemical structure continue to be one of the most widely used types of molecular descriptors in chemoinformatics and computational medicinal chemistry. One often distinguishes between two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) FPs depending on whether they are derived from molecular graphs or conformations, respectively. Primary application areas for FPs include similarity searching and compound classification via machine learning, especially for hit identification. For these applications, 2D FPs are particularly popular, given their robustness and for the most part comparable (or better) performance to 3D FPs. While a variety of FP prototypes has been designed and evaluated during earlier times of chemoinformatics research, new developments have been rare over the past decade. At least in part, this has been due to the situation that topological (atom environment) FPs derived from molecular graphs have evolved as a gold standard in the field. We were interested in exploring the question of whether the amount of structural information captured by state-of-the-art 2D FPs is indeed required for effective similarity searching and compound classification or whether accounting for fewer structural features might be sufficient. Therefore, pursuing a “structural minimalist” approach, we designed and implemented a new 2D FP based upon ring and substituent fragments obtained by systematically decomposing large numbers of compounds from medicinal chemistry. The resulting FP termed core-substituent FP (CSFP) captures much smaller numbers of structural features than state-of-the-art 2D FPs. However, CSFP achieves high performance in similarity searching and machine learning, demonstrating that less structural information is required for establishing molecular similarity relationships than is often believed. Given its high performance and chemical tangibility, CSFP is also relevant for practical applications in medicinal chemistry.</jats:p>"

Here, we show that the spoof plasmonic structure is able to achieve the switching of directional scattering direction on a subwavelength scale by inserting a perfect electric conductor (PEC) cylinder into the hollow of the spoof plasmonic structure. Based on the modal analysis, it is found that the electromagnetic response of the core–shell structure not only is well excited, but also exhibits the directional scattering by interference between the electric and magnetic dipolar resonances. We also discuss the influence of PEC cylinder radius on the performance of the directional scattering. Finally, the active tunable directional scattering is realized by switching between the two states. This work provides a feasible pathway to the subwavelength manipulation of electromagnetic wave. Moreover, it offers a simple method to switch the directional scattering direction.

This enables proper description of reservoirs with thin layers and fine scale heterogeneities. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) regression model that automatically predicts continuous porosity at a millimeter scale resolution using two-dimensional whole core CT scan images. More specifically, a CNN regression model is trained to learn from routine core analysis (RCA) porosity measurements. To characterize the performance of such approach, we compare the performance of this model with two linear regression models trained to learn the relationship between the average attenuation and standard deviation of the same two-dimensional images and RCA porosity. Our investigations reveal that the linear models are outperformed by the CNN, indicating the capability of the CNN model in extracting textures that are important for porosity estimations. We compare the predicted porosity results against the total porosity logs calculated from the density log. The obtained results show that the predicted porosity values using the proposed CNN method are well correlated with the core plug measurements and the porosity log. More importantly, the proposed approach can provide accurate millimeter scale porosity estimations, while the total porosity log is averaged over an interval and thus do not show such fine scale variations. Thus, the proposed method can be employed to calibrate the porosity logs, thereby reducing the uncertainties associated with indirect calculations of the porosity from such logs.</jats:p>",

To merge these benefits, we created and validated a novel dataset of valenced videos of first-person-view travel through built environments. This dataset was then used to clarify the relationship of core affect (valence and arousal) and architectural experience. Specifically, we verified the relationship between valence and fascination, coherence, and hominess - three key psychological dimensions of architectural experience which have previously been shown to explain aesthetic ratings of built environments. We also found that arousal is only significantly correlated with fascination, and that both are embedded in a relationship with spatial complexity and unusualness. These results help to clarify the nature of fascination, and to distinguish it from coherence and hominess when it comes to core affect.

The asymmetric inner-core structure and its impact on RI are presented using the Advanced Regional Prediction System-3DVAR. The time evolution of the TC inner-core characteristics shows that Meranti experiences two stages of RI: the asymmetric dominant period and the axisymmetric dominant period. The comparison between the two RI stages shows that the vortex intensified more in the asymmetric stage than the axisymmetric stage. The wavenumber-1 component introduced by the vertical wind shear dominates the asymmetric structure. In the moderate-to-strong shear environment, deep convection occurs mainly in the downshear-left quadrant, generating substantial diabatic heating in the downshear region. Under a suitable inner-core structure configuration, the downshear vortices are entrained cyclonically inward, resulting in RI. It is the interaction between the axisymmetric inner-core structure of the TC and the mesoscale vortex that controls the intensification process, which can be replicated by the nondivergent barotropic model with a similar initial field. This infrequent case provided observation of RI during a strong shear period, which suggests that the inner core structure is vital for TC RI.</jats:p>"

Both core genes, which are conserved across strains, and accessory genes have been associated with traits such as biofilm formation and virulence. Much of what we know about core and accessory gene content comes from genome analyses. Here, we use a newly assembled transcriptome compendium to analyze the transcriptional patterns of core and accessory gene expression in PAO1 and PA14 strains across thousands of samples from hundreds of distinct experiments. We found that a subset of core genes were stable, having consistent correlated expression patterns across samples regardless of strain background, with a focus on strains PAO1 and PA14.

From the potential distributions in the core, shell(s), and host medium, and using the modified Drude-Sommerfeld model, we separately obtained the expressions for LFEF of core/shell and core/spacer/shell nanocomposites. By changing the sizes of each of the components of the nanocomposites in these expressions, we found that the LFEF of CdSe@Ag increases with a decrease in the size of the core. At the same time, the resonance peaks are red shifted in the inner interface and blue shifted in the outer interface of the shell. The result also reveals that whether the shell radius is kept constant or decreased, increasing the core size produces a lower field enhancement factor showing that the core size is a crucial parameter to change the field enhancement factor of the dielectric core and metal shell nanoparticle (NP). When the spacer (ZnSe) is placed between the core (CdSe) and the shell (Ag), the resonance peaks increased with increase in the size of the core which was not observed in the case of the two layered core/shell nanocomposites having the same core and shell sizes. We also found that placing the spacer and varying the sizes of the core, the spacer, and the shell show different effects on the LFEF of the nanocomposite. The possibility of obtaining size dependent LFEF by adjusting the sizes of nanoparticles makes these nanocomposites attractive for applications in nonlinear optics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics.</jats:p>",

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi jenis perbekalan, menghitung kebutuhan perbekalan, dan mendeskripsikan penanganan perbekalan pada kapal bouke ami. Penelitian dilakukan dengan menggunakan metode survei melalui pengamatan langsung terhadap aktivitas sampel kapal. Sampel kapal ditetapkan melalui stratified random sampling dengan memilih 13 kapal berukuran &lt;30 GT, 5 kapal berukuran 31-50 GT dan 19 kapal berukuran 51-100 GT. Analisis data dilakukan secara deskriptif, baik secara kuantitatif dan kualitatif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa jenis perbekalan yang dibutuhkan terdiri dari perbekalan operasional kapal (solar, air bersih, dan pelumas) dan perbekalan konsumsi (bahan konsumsi, obat-obatan, dan lain-lain). Kebutuhan perbekalan yang paling besar terdapat pada armada ukuran 51-100 GT yaitu Rp798.765.000/unit/tahun, yang dialokasikan untuk solar 78,87%, air bersih 0,38%, pelumas 2,93%, perbekalan konsumsi 17,82%. Penanganan perbekalan pada kapal bouke ami sudah berjalan dengan baik dengan cara menyimpan perbekalan operasional kapal di bagian belakang kapal sedangkan perbekalan konsumsi disimpan pada palkah pendingin, dapur, dan kamar nakhoda.

These experiences of discrimination contribute to health disparities and poor clinical outcomes for kinksters (Sprott&amp; Randall, 2017; Sprott et al., 2017; Waldura et al., 2016). Cultural competence guidelines help physical and mental health clinicians in preventing this stigma and discrimination (Beach et al., 2005; Butler et al., 2016). In 2021, The Alternative Sexualities Health Research Alliance (TASHRA) created cultural competence guidelines for clinicians serving kink populations. This presentation will briefly present these guidelines and the research and clinical foundations that they are built upon, including preliminary findings from the ongoing 2021 International Kink Health Survey (IKHS). To our knowledge, these are the first cultural competence guidelines developed specifically for working with kink and grounded in both extensive clinical experience and research. These guidelines are based on five primary data sets. First, the preliminary Kink Health Project was a qualitative study conducted in 2015 (n = 115) that identified injuries and health concerns of kink individuals (Waldura et al., 2016). Building on this, the 2016 Kink Health Survey studied kink-involved US adults (n = 1,118). Health disparities higher than national averages noted in this study included 4.1% reported being HIV positive (10x higher), 24% reported attempting suicide (5x higher), 17.98% reported a diagnosis of PTSD (2.6x higher), experiences of stigma hindered healthcare access (19%), and past negative experiences with providers increased the odds 4x of delaying or avoiding health interventions (Sprott &amp; Randall, 2017; Sprott et al., 2021). Third, the 2019 Clinical Practice Guidelines (Moser et al., 2019) was developed after several rounds of feedback from the kink community and specialist providers. Utilizing this feedback, this team designed these guidelines to add to the literature on what constitutes best practices in working with kink populations. Fourth, the preliminary results from the ongoing 2021 IKHS continue to be utilized in refining these cultural competency standards. This study builds upon the prior literature and studies an international audience of 2,000+ participants. The survey is a mixed methods design that has been rigorously constructed by a team of volunteers to cover a wide array of topics in kink healthcare. Finally, these guidelines emerged from decades of clinical practice with the kink population by the diverse array of TASHRA volunteers.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Be familiar with the clinical need for cultural competency standards Understand the research base for TASHRA's recently developed kink core cultural competencies Be familiar with the TASHRA foundational, basic, and advanced core cultural competencies for working with kink populations</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>N/A</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>N/A</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>N/A</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>No</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Our purpose is to promote traffic toward the NJ ACTS Regulatory Cores recently launched website and increase investigator engagement through marketing strategies on LinkedIn. Landscaping to characterize the profiles of researchers on LinkedIn was also completed to estimate the feasibility of engaging with a target population on LinkedIn. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Insight gathering was performed to analyze what percentage of researchers possessed a LinkedIn profile and actively used their accounts. A sample population consisting of 284 NJ ACTS members were analyzed to summarize the type of researchers on LinkedIn, and their likelihood of responding to LinkedIn marketing campaigns. Efforts to launch a company LinkedIn page and collect followers were completed. Different methods of promotion were evaluated, including direct vs. mass email outreach to over 600+ researchers at Rutgers. Effectiveness of our platform was measured by comparing/overlaying Regulatory website traffic with LinkedIn traffic, as well as tracking the metrics of LinkedIn posts. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among 284 NJ ACTS members, 76% (n=215) possess a LinkedIn profile, but only 21% (n=59) are actively interacting with material on LinkedIn, such as creating, commenting, or sharing posts. Among the NJ ACTS LinkedIn users, 27% of individuals (n=57/215) responded to a direct outreach. Retention of the created organizational page was strong, as most users who visited the Regulatory Core page were likely to become followers. Massive email outreach to 600+ researchers within RBHS did not yield a strong LinkedIn following, however it did result in strong signals of website traffic during the days after the promotion was sent. Engagement with posts on LinkedIn can also be amplified and messaging proliferated when colleagues reshare Regulatory posts on their personal feeds. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: 3/4 of academic researchers are likely to be on LinkedIn but may not be active users of the platform. The most effective outreach is through direct messaging as opposed to broader, less individualized tactics (including mass email outreach). Evidence suggests potential to utilize LinkedIn to proactively engage in regulatory-related activities.</jats:p>",

It is a 537 amino acids protein with an 82 residues long hydrophilic cytoplasmic N-terminus followed by a transmembrane part comprising 14 transmembrane helices. We optimized the functional expression of <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2 in the plasma membrane of a salt-sensitive <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic> strain and characterized a set of mutated or truncated versions of <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2 in terms of their substrate specificity, transport activity, localization and protein stability. We identified a highly conserved proline 246, located in the core of the protein, as being crucial for ion selectivity. The replacement of P246 with serine or threonine resulted in antiporters with altered substrate specificity and increased resistance to the <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2-specific inhibitor phloretin that were not only highly active at an acidic pH of 4.0 (like the native antiporter), but also at neutral pH. We also experimentally confirmed the importance of a putative salt bridge between E215 and R432 for antiporter function and structural integrity. Truncations of the first 50 - 70 residues of the N-terminus doubled the transport activity of <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2, whilst changes in the charge at positions E47, E56, K57, or K58 decreased the antiporter’s transport activity. Thus, the hydrophilic N-terminal part of the protein appears to allosterically autoinhibit its cation transport.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between college students' SUPER core competencies, career adaptability, and career barriers, so that college students can recognize the linkage between core competencies for career development and education in the future. For this purpose, SUPER core competencies, career adaptability, and career barriers were measured for 309 university students at J University. The measured results were analyzed with a structural equation model using the SPSS ver 25.0 and AMOS ver 25.0 programs. The analysis results are as follows: First, some core competencies were higher among female students than male students, high in medical science colleges, and low in business colleges. The age problem of career barriers was higher in male students and third year students, and the lack of job information, lack of interest and future anxiety were higher in medical science colleges and lower in culture and tourism colleges. Second, the ‘skewness’ and ‘kurtosis’ criteria were satisfied by verifying whether each variable satisfied the normal distribution. Also, the correlation of each variable showed that core competency and career adaptability had a positive relationship, core competency had a negative relationship with career barriers, and career adaptability and career barriers had a negative relationship. Third, as a result of analyzing the estimability and fit of the structural regression model for the verification of the research model, a good fit was shown, and the suitability of each variable was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. Fourth, the core competency for career adaptability was statistically significant and had an explanatory power of 49.8%. Core competencies for career barriers were not statistically significant. Career adaptability to career barriers was statistically significant and had an explanatory power of 37.8%. This means that the higher the level of core competencies, the higher the career adaptability, and the higher the career adaptability, the lower the career barriers. Based on the results of this study, the conclusions are summarized as follows. First, there are differences in some factors of SUPER core competency, career adaptability, and career barriers according to gender and major. Thus, an approach to core competency and career barriers by gender and college is required. Second, universities should provide opportunities to college students through subjects and non-course curriculum so that they can achieve the core competencies required in the society of the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Industrial Revolution. Third, in order to strengthen and improve the core competencies of college students, it is also necessary for instructors to inform college students of a system that can recognize what core competencies are lacking, as well as to enlighten them on specific methods and guidelines for their cultivation.</jats:p>",

Part of PS provision is publishing PS descriptions in an online catalogue to inform citizens and promote transparency. The European Commission has developed Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP), as a standard European PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and semantic interoperability. However, CPSV-AP is not sufficient to model complex PS with different versions based on rules and citizens’ circumstances (e.g., getting a passport for a child or for an emergency). As a result, citizens cannot obtain personalized information on PS. The aim of this paper is to enhance CPSV-AP in order to support the modeling of complex PS. We illustrate the use of the proposed model in a real-life case study. Specifically, we use the proposed model to develop a knowledge graph and a chatbot that provides personalized information to citizens of the city of Bjelovar (Croatia) regarding the life-event “having a baby”. We believe our research is of interest to researchers on PS data models and public authorities interested in providing personalized PS information to their citizens using chatbots.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is very challenging to accurately understand and characterize the internal structure of three-dimensional (3D) rock masses using geological monitoring and conventional laboratory measures. One important method for obtaining 3D core images involves reconstructing their 3D structure from two-dimensional (2D) core images. However, traditional 2D–3D reconstruction methods are mostly designed for binary core images, rather than grayscale images. Furthermore, the reconstruction structure cannot reflect the gray level distribution of the core. Here, by combining the dimension promotion theory in super-dimension (SD) reconstruction and framework of deep learning, we propose a novel convolutional neural network framework, the cascaded progressive generative adversarial network (CPGAN), to reconstruct 3D grayscale core images. Within this network, we propose a loss function based on the gray level distribution and pattern distribution to maintain the texture information of the reconstructed structure. Simultaneously, by adopting SD dimension promotion theory, we set the input and output of every single node of the CPGAN network to be deep gray-padding structures of equivalent size. Through the cascade of every single node network, we thus ensured continuity and variability between the reconstruction layers. In addition, we used 3D convolution to determine the spatial characteristics of the core. The reconstructed 3D results showed that the gray level information in the 2D image were accurately reflected in the 3D space. This proposed method can help us to understand and analyze various parameter characteristics in cores.</jats:p>"

The 2007 represents both the outbreak of the global financial crisis and the beginning of the enlargement process. The two events have had a very different impact on the stock returns&amp;rsquo; correlation among EMU members. While the enlargement to new countries has reduced the average returns&amp;rsquo; correlation within the Euro area as a whole, the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis have led to an increase in stock returns&amp;rsquo; correlation among old member states. We find that, among old EMU countries, core countries have been particularly affected by stock returns&amp;rsquo; correlation. They reduced their equity investments both in foreign EMU core and in foreign EMU periphery economies after the crisis, with a particularly pronounced contraction witnessed by those country-pairs that displayed highly correlated asset returns.

This article explores how storefronts have transformed into post-transactional functions over the past century in the urban core of The Hague, one of the largest cities in The Netherlands and the\n country's seat of government. Firstly, it explores, through archival study, the forces behind The Hague's storefront retail decline, from legislation meant to curb independent retailers to urban renewal eff orts. Similarly, archival research illustrates that The Hague has a decades-long tradition\n of acknowledging and proactively planning for post-transactional storefront futures. Secondly, a comparison between a 1911 storefront database with that of 2017 demonstrates that about a fifth of storefronts have changed to a post-transactional use. The majority of transformations yielded\n dwellings, followed by offices, parking, vacancy and medical and wellness uses. Many of these new uses have spurred the creative economy of The Hague, illustrating the resilient urban value of storefronts beyond merely hosting consumer transactions.</jats:p>",

According to the numerical results, a graphene-filled layer not only broadens the working bandwidth but also reduces the size of the polarization splitter. Furthermore, the fluorine-doped region and the germanium-doped region can broaden the bandwidth. Also, the 4.78 mm long polarization splitter can achieve an extinction ratio of –98.6 dB at a wavelength of 1550 nm. When extinction ratio is less than –20 dB, the range of the wavelength is 1027 nm–1723 nm with a bandwidth of 696 nm. Overall, the polarization splitter can be applied to all-optical network communication systems in the infrared and near-infrared wavelength range.</jats:p>",

In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the thermodynamic behaviors of the planar stacked nanoparticles (NPs) model and explore the potential capability of the SLS process with nano-sized metal powders in the zero-gravity space environment. A multi-particle model of titanium–aluminum (Ti–Al) core–shell NP with a particle radius of 50 Å was constructed to investigate the characteristics of the melted pattern during sintering. Two patterns with different spatial densities were considered to study the influence of particle stacking on the melting process. Various core volume fractions and heating rates were examined to investigate their effects on the quality of the final sintered product. The stacked-NPs models with core volume fractions (CVFs) of 3%, 12%, and 30% were linearly heated up to 1100 K from room temperature (298 K) with heating rates of 0.04, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 K ps−1. The initial fusion temperature and final sintering temperature for each stacking pattern were obtained via the validation from the radial distribution function, mean squared displacement, and the radius of the gyration analysis. The 30% CVF yields the largest neck size before the melting point, while beyond the melting point, a larger core helps delay the formation of the fully-melted products. It is observed that using the close-packed stacked-NPs model under a slow heating rate (long melting duration) would help form a stable, completely sintered product with a relatively low final sintering temperature.</jats:p>"

A few studies are about the implementations of a multi-lane SpaceFibre core. Even though they exhibit good performance, several limitations still, more or less, exist. We detail an efficient multi-lane SpaceFibre (E-ML-SpFi) core for high-rate and fault-tolerant data communication. The E-ML-SpFi core exploits a hierarchical method to decouple the complex control logic of the retransmission mechanism. The core employs a modified word re-ordering block to map an extended set of words on a real-time variable number of data-sending lanes. Meanwhile, the core introduces the architecture of a fast alignment subsystem to accelerate the alignment process. A hardware implementation on XC7Z100 FPGA shows that the E-ML-SpFi core has complete functionality stipulated by the standard and requires limited resources, with 6290 (2.26%) LUTs and 8252 (1.49%) FFs. The maximum operating frequency of the core is 200 MHz. Moreover, the recovery time is reduced up to 30.9% compared with previous work. Therefore, the core provides a valid solution for future interconnection networks onboard spacecraft.</jats:p>"

We overcame this problem by preparing and testing mechanical properties of 132 artificial fault-core-zone specimens consisting of mixtures of breccia, sand, clay, and water. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus (E), and penetration resistance value (PRV) of these fault-core-zone materials were measured, and the effects of breccia content and water content on mechanical properties were assessed. Results show that UCS is inversely proportional to breccia content and water content, and that E is inversely proportional to water content. Furthermore, the inverse relationship of UCS with water content varies with breccia content. UCS is proportional to both PRV and E, and the relationship for each varies with breccia content. High coefficients of determination (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.62–0.88) between the parameters suggest that breccia content, water content, and PRV are potentially useful parameters for estimating the mechanical properties of fault core zones.</jats:p>"

The main virion component, the core (C) protein, has been linked to several aspects of HCV pathology, including oncogenesis, immune evasion and stress responses. We and others have previously shown that C expression in various cell lines activates Ca2+ signaling and alters Ca2+ homeostasis. In this study, we identified two distinct C protein regions that are required for the activation of Ca2+/NFAT signaling. In the basic N-terminal domain, which has been implicated in self-association of C, amino acids 1–68 were critical for NFAT activation. Sedimentation analysis of four mutants in this domain revealed that association of the C protein into nucleocapsid-like particles correlated with NFAT-activated transcription. The internal, lipid droplet-targeting domain was not required for NFAT-activated transcription. Finally, the C-terminal ER-targeting domain was required in extenso for the C protein to function. Our results indicate that targeting of HCV C to the ER is necessary but not sufficient for inducing Ca2+/NFAT signaling. Taken together, our data are consistent with a model whereby proteolytic intermediates of C with an intact transmembrane ER-anchor assemble into pore-like structures in the ER membrane.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, we devise a novel concept, namely\n            <jats:italic>skyline coreness</jats:italic>\n            , and show that the D-core decomposition problem is equivalent to the computation of skyline corenesses for all vertices. We design an efficient D-index to compute the skyline corenesses distributedly. We implement the proposed algorithms under both vertex-centric and block-centric distributed graph processing frameworks. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the algorithm and message complexities. Extensive experiments on large real-world graphs with billions of edges demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of both the running time and communication overhead.\n          </jats:p>",

Research work has so far been done mainly on Basmati rices giving less importance to the improvement of small and medium grain indigenous aromatic rice genotypes. West Bengal, is a rich source of small and medium grain aromatic rice germplasms with excellent grain quality parameters including aroma. Therefore, enough scope is there for improve these small and medium grain scented germplasms by bringing them in breeding programme with the varieties having desirable traits especially high yield and aroma. In this study, A close relation was maintained by Phenotypic coefficients of variation (PCV) with Genotypic coefficient of variation(GCV) for all the traits though PCV exhibited a bit higher value, this indicates low G×E interaction. Additive gene action was prominent for the traits like plant height, panicle length, number of filled grains per plant and 1000 grain weight. A correlation study showed that grain yield per plant was positive and significantly correlated with panicles per plant and total number of filled grains per plant, emphasizing on these traits help in increasing the grain yield of aromatic rice. Manhattan cluster analysis revealed two distinct clusters i.e. Cluster I(A and B) and Cluster II(A and B), on the basis of the agro-morphological traits taken. Cluster II has the maximum genotypes i.e., 15 and 5 genotypes in Cluster I. The investigation concludes that the total number of filled grains per plant and panicle length influences grain yield. Path analysis revealed that total number of filled grains per plant, panicles per plant and 1000 grain weight directly effects grain yield per plant.</jats:p>"

As a remedy, the regulators and investors turned their eyes to the Islamic Banking. Many people view it as a full substitute to the dominant conventional banking establishments. We hypothesized that the benefits of the Islamic Banking can be fully enjoyed if and only if it is accompanied with the robust regulatory framework. Such a framework could offer room for the national discretion to define ‘alpha’ parameter within the capital adequacy ratio. The novelty of our paper is the largest collected to date set of alpha value embedded in the Islamic Banking jurisdictions.\nPurpose: This research paper aims to able to identify the core driver to locally determine the value of alpha. The credit-to-GDP ratio was shown to be such a driver. We demonstrated that the earlier academic research had offered the Vasicek-based theoretical models for the Islamic Banking that had implied right the opposite values of alpha.\nMethodology: We have eight independent determinants with presenting the alpha values for 11 countries registered in 2007 and in 2016.Those are the four macroeconomic variables. we have collected the input data for the regression model.\nFindings: The credit-to-GDP ratio was shown to be such a driver. We demonstrated that the earlier academic research had offered the Vasicek-based theoretical models for the Islamic Banking that had implied right the opposite values of alpha.

Moreover, chimpanzees use a remarkably extensive repertoire of vocal and nonvocal forms of communication, thought to help convey information in such a socially and spatially dynamic setting. One proposed form of nonvocal communication in chimpanzees is buttress drumming, in which an individual hits a tree buttress with its hands and/or feet, thereby producing a low‐frequency acoustic signal. It is often presumed that this behavior functions to communicate over long distances and is, therefore, goal‐oriented. If so, we would expect chimpanzees to exhibit selectivity in the choice of trees and buttresses used in buttress drumming. Selectivity is a key attribute of many other goal‐directed chimpanzee behaviors, such as nut‐cracking and ant dipping. Here, we investigate whether chimpanzees at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, West Africa, show selectivity in their buttress drumming behavior. Our results indicate that Seringbara chimpanzees are more likely to use larger trees and select buttresses that are thinner and have a greater surface area. These findings imply that tree buttress drumming is not a random act, but rather goal‐oriented and requires knowledge of suitable trees and buttresses. Our results also point to long‐distance communication as a probable function of buttress drumming based on selectivity for buttress characteristics likely to impact sound propagation. This study provides a foundation for further assessing the cognitive underpinnings and functions of buttress drumming in wild chimpanzees.</jats:p>",

Next, by means of cathodoluminescence in situ experiments, we found evidence that the 10 keV electron irradiation of the treated optical fibers induces the generation of GLPC centers, while in nonloaded optical fibers, the irradiation causes the bleaching of the pre-existing GLPC. Ab initio calculations were performed to investigate the reaction of the GLPC with molecular oxygen. Such investigations suggested the stability of the dioxagermirane (DIOG) bulk defect, and its back conversion into GLPC with a local release of O2 under irradiation. Furthermore, it is also inferred that a remarkable portion of the O2 passivated GLPC may form Ge tetrahedra connected to peroxy bridges. Such structures may have a larger resistance to the irradiation and not be back converted into GLPC.</jats:p>"

Constraining properties of the inner core is fundamentally important, yet seismic models do not reconcile body wave and normal mode attenuation properties. Here, we analyse high signal-to-noise ratio core-refracted (PKIKP) and core-reflected (PKiKP) waves generated by earthquakes recorded globally between 1987 and 2021. These phases are excellent indicators of uppermost inner core (UIC) properties due to their low angular separation at the core–mantle boundary and similar ray paths. We analyse their amplitude ratios (ARs) and time delays (DTs) relative to synthetic waveforms and estimate the required attenuation perturbations in a linearized attenuation tomography. The UIC is cylindrically isotropic and heterogeneous in both seismic velocity and attenuation. Contrary to the paradigm that the inner core is seismically hemispherical, we find more complex patterns of attenuation that correlate with seismic velocities, according to both Akaike criterion and Student's t-test. The UIC beneath NE Asia is weakly attenuating and seismically slower, in contrast to the expected properties associated with the quasi-Eastern Hemisphere. Beneath South America, where the core is thought to grow fastest, AR values are more diverse, possibly reflecting interdendritic melt inclusions, and DTs show an E–W gradient. The UIC is seismically slow and weakly attenuating beneath the Atlantic, but strong anomalies emerge near West Africa. Attenuation slightly changes with depth conceivably implying an increase in melt degree or a change in inner core growth rate with time. These 3-D heterogeneities are inconsistent with simple models of core translation or lopsided growth, indicating that more intricate processes are needed to explain inner core structure and evolution.</jats:p>",

We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and performed KEGG analysis, GO analysis with Metascape (https://metascape.org/databae). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to determine the most relevant module associated with atherosclerotic plaque stability.

Finally, immune cell types were identified using CIBERSOFT, the relationship between candidate genes and immune cell infiltration was evaluated.<jats:bold>Results：</jats:bold>MMP9 and MMP12 were been selected as candidate genes from 171 DEGs and turquoise module with 370 genes.ROC curve results showed that MMP9 (AUC=0.899, p=0.00013) and MMP12 (AUC=0.880, p=0.00038) were positively associated with advanced atherosclerotic plaques, and Sal B bound strongly to MMP9 and MMP12. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that naive B cells, memory B cells, regulatory T cells, gamma delta T cells, M0 macrophages, M2 macrophages, activated dendritic cells, and resting mast cells may be involved in development of AS, and the candidate genes MMP9 and MMP12 were associated with these immune cells to different degrees. <jats:bold>Conclusion：</jats:bold>The anti-AS effects of Sal B may be related to MMP9 and MMP12 and associated with immune cell infiltration,which is expected to be used in the early intervention of AS.</jats:p>"

Due to their low density and high stiffness, sandwich composites generate significant interest. The authors conducted static and dynamic tests in order to determine the effect of density and core thickness on the mechanical properties of a sandwich composite. Particular attention was paid to the impact properties of such composites. Herex and Airex polymer foams of different densities were used as cores, whereas the faces were made up of two layers of fabrics: glass and carbon. The matrix base of the tested materials was made of epoxy resin cured with a dedicated hardener. As a result of the study, a significant influence of the core on the strength parameters of the tested spacer materials was found. The examined polymer foams were found to have different adhesive properties, which affected their residual strength after an impact and the nature of destruction of the studied composites. It was observed that sandwich composites with a thicker core of higher density have higher impact strength and resistance to puncture. In the sandwich composites, low-energy impact loads result in damage only to the layer to which the load has been applied and has a core, so repairing such an element is much easier than in classic layered composites without a core. What is very important is that, in contrast to classic laminates, the bottom cover of the composite is not destroyed at low-impact energy values.</jats:p>"

The characteristics of reflection spectra and ultrasonic response of the sensor are analyzed and demonstrated experimentally. Comparative measurements are also carried out to prove the sensor superiority over the conventional weak-reflection one. Moreover, the sensor is used for seismic physical modeling to show its ability of practicable usage. Both the crosswell seismic and surface seismic in seismic exploration are modeled respectively based on reservoir and fault models. Various reservoir velocities are measured and each is consistent with the reported results. The fault features are also well reconstructed in the form of a cross-section model image.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The lithofacies classification research is part of an extended multidisciplinary reservoir characterization and simulation study that has been implemented on the upper shale member/Zubair formation of the southern Iraqi X oil field. This study has been conducted through the Integrated Reservoir Management School (IRMS) at the Basrah Oil Company (BOC). Lithofacies classification is a process to determine rock lithology by analyzing core and well- log data set. Traditionally, lithofacies were classified manually or with the use of some graphing approaches. Many artificial intelligence techniques have recently been adopted to categorize lithofacies. In this work, two robust algorithms were applied to modeling the lithofacies through specific well section (formation), these procedures were adopted and their results were compared to determine more accurate lithofacies classification method. Logistic Boost Regression LBR and Multinomial Logistic Regression MLR were utilized to model the resulting lithofacies as a function of CPI dataset in order to anticipate discrete properties distribution in non-cored depth in wells.\r\nCPI data, which are available for 49 wells in the upper shale Zubair formation, includes: water saturation, porosity (∅_neutron) and volume of shale (V_sh). However, routine core analyses of permeability, porosity and facies are existent for only one well. For that well, the lithofacies types are sand, silty sand and shale. Two supervised statistical learning techniques, LBR and MLR, has been certified to model the discrete lithofacies distribution as a function of the CPI records. The lithofacies classification was then validated through forming the confusion table and computing the accuracy for each method. LBR was observed to be the optimum approach as it led to more accurate lithofacies classification than MLR in clastic reservoirs. The presented workflow demonstrated reasonable facies distribution that leads to strong relationship between porosity and permeability to estimate the petrophysical properties in non-cored wells.\r\nIn addition, the posterior lithofacies distribution were plotted to show the probability of spatial distribution and direction of model. These algorithms implemented through R programming a language commonly used in statistical computing by using software packages. Then, these costs for overall data process acquisition could be reduced.</jats:p>"

In this study, in four locations in Bulgaria differing strongly in environmental conditions and anthropogenic pressure, an assessment was made using several obligatory core symbiont species and genera for reference, such as Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Snodgrassiella alvi, Gilliamella apicola, Frishella perrara, and Commensalibacter sp., as well as an observation of the overall number of species. A snapshot of the relative abundances of the total number of species and the core species was made using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based metagenomic approach using the Illumina 2 × 250 bp paired-end platform. It was found that the two forms of anthropogenic pressure, the agricultural and the urban/industrial, have distinct effects, affecting different core genera and species. It was also demonstrated that both types of anthropogenic pressure cause a reduction in the overall number of bacterial species.</jats:p>"

With nearly 1000 identified CWPs, the Arabidopsis thaliana cell wall proteome is the best described to date and it covers the main plant organs and cell suspension cultures. Other monocot and dicot plants have been studied as well as bryophytes, such as Physcomitrella patens and Marchantia polymorpha. Although these proteomes were obtained using various flowcharts, they can be searched for the presence of members of a given protein family. Thereby, a core cell wall proteome which does not pretend to be exhaustive, yet could be defined. It comprises: (i) glycoside hydrolases and pectin methyl esterases, (ii) class III peroxidases, (iii) Asp, Ser and Cys proteases, (iv) non-specific lipid transfer proteins, (v) fasciclin arabinogalactan proteins, (vi) purple acid phosphatases and (vii) thaumatins. All the conserved CWP families could represent a set of house-keeping CWPs critical for either the maintenance of the basic cell wall functions, allowing immediate response to environmental stresses or both. Besides, the presence of non-canonical proteins devoid of a predicted signal peptide in cell wall proteomes is discussed in relation to the possible existence of alternative secretion pathways.</jats:p>"

However, as an amphiphilic photosensitizer, HMME is easy to aggregate due to the presence of a hydrophobic group, which undesirably reduced its generation of singlet oxygen and bioavailability. In this study, we synthesized the stable conjugate of Au@TiO2 core-shell nanostructure with HMME, and the influence of different factors on PTD efficiency were studied. The results showed that the nanostructure had higher PTD efficiency for KB cells than that of HMME.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Study Aim. With its dynamic and constantly changing characteristics, basketball, which requires more than one movement, is one of the most preferred and popular team sports in the world. It is important to know that basketball requires programs based on speed, agility and strength fitness components, in which endurance and strength parameters are predominant. In this context, resistance training, which provides skill excellence and increased muscle strength, is important for basketball players. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of 4-week specific core training applied to pre-adolescent and adolescent children who do basic basketball training on explosive strength.&#x0D;\nMaterial and Methods. A total of 16 [Control Group (CG): n=8; Experimental Group (EG): n=8] individuals (age 13.29 ± 1.96 years) who did not have any health problems from basketball school and continued basketball basic training were included in the study. The groups continued their usual basketball basic training program (2 days a week, 60 minutes a day). However, in addition to the basic training program, the experimental group was subjected to an isometric training program for 12-minute core strengthening. Training programs were made for a total of 4 weeks. We examined the effects of core training on speed, vertical jump and agility parameters. Statistical analyzes of the data obtained as a result of the research were obtained using the IBM SPSS 23.0 package program.&#x0D;\nResults. There was no difference between the groups for sprint and vertical jump parameters of core and basic basketball training (p&gt;0.05). However, there was a significant difference in favor of EG in the agility test analysis results (p&lt;0.05). As a result, we can say that 4-week core training applied in addition to the basic basketball training program in children improves agility characteristics.&#x0D;\nConclusions. The findings showed that core training programs have positive effects on explosive strength parameters. In addition, strengthening the core area significantly improved the agility parameter, which is important in ground-direction changes. This, in parallel with the studies, supported that core training programs should be an integral part of other training programs. This study also showed that core stabilization training applied in a short time improves explosive strength parameters in children.</jats:p>"

In the present study we used RNA-sequencing to compare the expression of Trichoplusia ni ascovirus 6a1 (TnAV-6a1) core genes during the first week of infection, with emphasis on the first 48 h, comparing transcript levels in major somatic tissues (epidermis, tracheal matrix and fat body), the sites infected initially, with those of the haemolymph, where viral vesicles circulate and most replication occurs. By 48 h post-infection (p.i.), only 26 genes were expressed in somatic tissues at ≥5 log2 reads per kilobase per million, whereas in the haemolymph 48 genes were expressed at a similar level by the same time. Early and high expression of TnAV caspase-2-like gene occurred in all tissues, implying it is required for replication, but that it is probably not associated with apoptosis induction, which occurs in infections of Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus 1 a (SfAV-1a), the ascovirus type species. Other highly expressed viral genes at 48 h p.i. in viral vesicles included a dynein-like beta chain and lipid-modifying enzymes, suggesting their importance to vesicle formation and growth as well as virion synthesis. Finally, as occurs in SfAV expression, we found bicistronic and tricistronic mRNA messages produced by TnAV.</jats:p>",

The growth of CuCo2O4 nanowires was developed on Ni foam as the apposite basis of the conductive scaffold, and the ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanowires were subsequently immobilized to form CuCo2O4-Ni(OH)2 core-shell nanowire arrays (NWAs). The prepared materials were further characterized in structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties. The obtained CuCo2O4-Ni(OH)2 pseudocapacitor electrode, incorporated by unique core-shell heterostructures nanowire arrays, exhibited great specific capacitance of 1201.67 F g-1 at 1 mA g-1, which is much higher than pristine CuCo2O4 nanowire of 638.89 F g-1 at 1 mA g-1. Simultaneously, it also has a high power density of 5.56 kW kg-1 at an energy density of 73.33 Wh kg-1 and good long-term cycling performance (~84 capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). The improved morphological and structural properties have substantiated the CuCo2O4-Ni(OH)2 core-shell nanowire arrays properties owing to higher surface active area and richer redox activity for boosting the electrochemical properties.</jats:p>"

In response to this paper establishes a simulation model of the corresponding current transformer based on SIMULINK and analyzed the error source factors of the current transformer; then, according to theoretical derivation, the simulation established the core size, ratio difference, and angle difference of the current transformer. Finally, a genetic algorithm based on nonlinear programming is used to iteratively optimize the core size of the current transformer, and finally the error of the current transformer after the core is optimized and when the core is not optimized is compared through simulation. The results show that current transformer’s ratio difference and angle difference of the current transformer are significantly reduced. Among them, the ratio difference is reduced to about 50% of the original, and the angle difference of the transformer is reduced to about 60% of the original, which greatly broadens the range of the current transformer.</jats:p>",

Very few of them appear circular in projection. Little, however, is understood about the processes or the physical conditions under which prolate/oblate cores form. We find that an initially subcritical filament experiencing relatively low pressure (≲104 K cm−3) forms prolate cores (i.e. those with axial ratios in excess of unity) via gradual accumulation of gas in density crests. Meanwhile, a filament that is initially transcritical and experiences pressure similar to that in the Solar neighbourhood (between few × 104 and few × 105 K cm−3) forms oblate cores (i.e. those with axial ratios less than unity) via Jeans-like fragmentation. At higher pressure, however, fragments within the filament do not tend to survive as they rebound soon after formation. We also argue that quasi-oscillatory features of velocity gradient observed along the filament axis, and in the direction orthogonal to the axis, are integral to the filament evolution process and arise due to the growth of corrugations on its surface. The axial component of the velocity gradient, in particular, traces the gas flow along the filament length. We therefore posit that it could be used to constrain the filament-formation mechanism. The magnitude of the respective components of velocity gradients increases with increasing external pressure.</jats:p>",

Using CS nanoparticles, a concomitant increase in the peel and shear strengths of the acrylic PSA was achieved, and also the limitation of surface migration of nanoparticles at high volume fractions was overcome. Moreover, CS nanoparticles acted as a compatibilizer for MBC chains, rich in methyl methacrylate (MMA) or butyl acrylate (BA). These MMA‐rich and BA‐rich chains were formed during the synthesis of MBC latex through batch emulsion copolymerization method, due to the difference in the reactivity ratio of BA and MMA radicals. The compatibility of CS nanoparticles with each of the components of MBC was systematically investigated in terms of grafting density, swelling ratio, and thermodynamic affinity and was correlated to the final properties.</jats:p>",

The results revealed that dispositional mindfulness and core self-evaluations significantly predicted mental well-being. It is found that core self-evaluation fully mediates the effect of dispositional mindfulness on mental well-being. Moreover, it is also observed that measures of dispositional mindfulness, core self-evaluation, and mental well-being are indifferent with respect to students’ gender.

If water has been delivered to the CMB, this reaction could enable the exchange of hydrogen and silicon between the mantle and the core. As a result, a H-rich, Si-deficient layer formed at the topmost core would have a lower density, stabilizing the stratification, and a lower velocity, consistent with seismic studies.

Each combination is performed until steady state, when effluent concentrations no longer change significantly with time. Lower injection rate gives the brine more time to react. We also propose shut-in tests where brine reacts statically with the core a defined period and then is flushed out. The residence time and produced brine composition is compared with the flooding experiments. This design allows characterization of the reaction kinetics from a single core. Efficient modeling and matching of the experiments can be performed as the steady state data are directly comparable to equilibrating the injected brine gradually with time and does not require spatial and temporal modeling of the entire dynamic experiments. Each steady state data point represents different information that helps constrain parameter selection. The reaction kinetics can predict equilibrium states and time needed to reach equilibrium. Accounting for dispersion increases the complexity by needing to find a spatial distribution of coupled solutions and is recommended as a second step when a first estimate of the kinetics has been obtained. It is still much more efficient than simulating the full dynamic experiment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experiments were performed injecting 0.0445 and 0.219 mol/L MgCl2 into Stevns Klint chalk from Denmark, and Kansas chalk from USA. The reaction kinetics of chalk are important as oil-bearing chalk reservoirs are chemically sensitive to injected seawater. The reactions can alter wettability and weaken rock strength which has implications for reservoir compaction, oil recovery and reservoir management. The temperature was 100 and 130°C (North Sea reservoir temperature). The rates during flooding were varied from 0.25 to 16 PV/d while shut-in tests provided equivalent rates down to 1/28 PV/d. The results showed that Ca2+ ions were produced and Mg2+ ions retained (associated with calcite dissolution and magnesite precipitation, respectively). This occurred in a substitution-like manner, where the gain of Ca was similar to the loss of Mg2+. A simple reaction kinetic model based on this substitution with three independent tuning parameters (rate coefficient, reaction order and equilibrium constant) was implemented together with advection to analytically calculate steady state effluent concentrations when injected composition, injection rate and reaction kinetic parameters were stated. By tuning reaction kinetic parameters, the experimental steady state data could be fitted efficiently. From data trends, the parameters were determined relatively accurate for each core. The roles of reaction parameters, pore velocity and dispersion were illustrated with sensitivity analyses.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The steady state method allows computationally efficient matching even with complex reaction kinetics. Using a comprehensive geochemical description in the software PHREEQC, the kinetics of calcite and magnesite mineral reactions were determined by matching the steady state concentration changes as function of (residence) time. The simulator predicted close to identical production of Ca as loss of Mg. The geochemical software predicted much higher calcite solubility in MgCl2 than observed at 100 and 130°C for Stevns Klint and Kansas.</jats:p>",

Most of the current RI studies are based on a selected variable (feature) set, which is accumulated based on expert expertise in past studies of TC intensity changes and RI. Are there any more important variables in TC intensity predictions that were not identified in past studies? A systematic and comprehensive search for those variables from vast amounts of gridded data, satellite images, and other historically collected data could be helpful for answering the above question. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the capabilities to distill features in large array data, and it is helpful in identifying new features related to TC intensity changes in general and RI in particular. Here, we leverage the local linear embedding (LLE) dimension reduction techniques to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis data for identifying new variables related to RI. In addition to the well-known features in the SHIPS (statistical hurricane intensity prediction scheme) database, we identified other significant features, such as 400 and 450 hPa meridional wind, 1000 hPa potential vorticity, and vertical pressure speed, that could help the understanding and prediction of RI occurrences. Furthermore, our AI system outperforms our baseline model with SHIPS data only by 26.6% and 8.4% in kappa and PSS (Peirce’s skill score), respectively.</jats:p>"

Splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, a complex molecular machinery which assembles step-wise on mRNA precursors in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. In the last decade, exome sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of point mutations in genes encoding splicing factors as a recurrent hallmark of human cancers, with higher incidence in hematological malignancies. These mutations lead to production of splicing factors that reduce the fidelity of the splicing process and yield splicing variants that are often advantageous for cancer cells. However, at the same time, these mutations increase the sensitivity of transformed cells to splicing inhibitors, thus offering a therapeutic opportunity for novel targeted strategies. Herein, we review the recent literature documenting cancer-associated mutations in components of the early spliceosome complex and discuss novel therapeutic strategies based on small-molecule spliceosome inhibitors that exhibit strong anti-tumor effects, particularly against cancer cells harboring mutations in spliceosomal components.</jats:p>"

Drop of the preformed swollen corn starch (CS) granule suspension into thermal-treated zein ethanolic solution enables antisolvent precipitation of thermal-treated zein on the surface of the preformed swollen CS granules, leading to the formation of core-shell starch/zein microparticles. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images showed that the preformed swollen CS granules were coated by thermal-treated zein shells with a thickness of 0.48–0.95 μm. The volume average particle diameter of core-shell starch/zein microparticles was 14.70 μm and reached 18.59–30.98 μm after crosslinking by transglutaminase. The results of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that an interaction occurred between the preformed swollen CS granules and the thermal-treated zein. The results for thermodynamic characteristics, pasting properties, and swelling power indicated that the compact network structure of core-shell starch/zein microparticles crosslinked by transglutaminase could improve starch granule thermal stability and resistance to shearing forces. Compared to native CS, the peak gelatinization temperatures of core-shell starch/zein microparticles increased significantly (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05), with a maximum value of 76.64°C. The breakdown values and the swelling power at 95°C of core-shell starch/zein microparticles significantly (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05) decreased by 52.83–85.66% and 0.11–0.28%, respectively.

We have previously shown that mTOR activation contributes to AT/RT’s aggressive growth and poor survival. Targeting the mTOR pathway with the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor TAK-228 slows tumor growth and extends survival in mice bearing orthotopic xenografts. However, responses are primarily cytostatic with limited durability. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of mTOR inhibitors on AT/RT signaling pathways and design a rational combination therapy to drive a more durable response to this promising therapy. We performed RNASeq, gene expression studies, and protein analyses to identify pathways disrupted by TAK-228. We find that TAK-228 decreases the expression of the transcription factor NRF2 and compromises AT/RT cellular defenses against oxidative stress and apoptosis. The BH3 mimetic, Obatoclax, is a potent inducer of oxidative stress and apoptosis in AT/RT. These complementary mechanisms of action drive extensive synergies between TAK-228 and Obatoclax slowing AT/RT cell growth and inducing apoptosis and cell death. Combination therapy activates the integrative stress response as determined by increased expression of phosphorylated EIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP, and disrupts the protective NOXA.MCL-1.BIM axis, forcing stressed cells to undergo apoptosis. Combination therapy is well tolerated in mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of AT/RT, slows tumor growth, and extends median overall survival. This novel combination therapy could be added to standard upfront therapies or used as a salvage therapy for relapsed disease to improve outcomes in AT/RT.</jats:p>"

Multicast IP routing is an important topic, covering both theoretical and practical interest in different networks layers. In network layer, there are several multicast routing protocols using multicast routing trees different in the literature. However PIM-SM and CBT protocols remains the most used multicast routing protocols; they propose using a shared Core-based Tree CBT. This kind of tree provides efficient management of multicast path in changing group memberships, scalability and performance. The prime problem concerning construction of a shared tree is to determine the best position of the core. QoS-CS’s problem (QoS constraints core Selection) consists in choosing an optimal multicast router in the network as core of the Shared multicast Tree (CBT) within specified QoS constraints associated. The choice of this specific router, called RP in PIM-SM protocol and core in CBT protocol, affects the structure of multicast routing tree, and therefore influences performances of both multicast session and routing scheme. QoS-CS is an NP complete problem need to be solved through a heuristic algorithm, in this paper, we propose a new core Selection algorithm based on Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm and new CMP fitness function. Simulation results show that good performance is achieved in multicast cost, end-to-end delay, tree construction delay and others metrics.</jats:p>"

However, many of these complexes are too complicated to assemble spontaneously. Instead, their biogenesis is facilitated by dedicated chaperone proteins, which are themselves excluded from the final product. This is the case for the proteasome, a ubiquitous and highly conserved cellular regulator that mediates most selective intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes. The proteasome consists of two subcomplexes: the core particle (CP), where proteolysis occurs, and the regulatory particle (RP), which controls substrate access to the CP. Ten chaperones function in proteasome biogenesis. Here, we review the pathway of CP biogenesis, which requires five of these chaperones and proceeds through a highly ordered multistep pathway. We focus on recent advances in our understanding of CP assembly, with an emphasis on structural insights. This pathway of CP biogenesis represents one of the most dramatic examples of chaperone-mediated assembly and provides a paradigm for understanding how large multisubunit complexes can be produced.</jats:p>",

The sparse coverage of the IC leads to uncertainties in its anisotropy, the directional dependence of seismic velocity. Yet, detailed constraints on anisotropy, such as its magnitude, and spatial distribution, are required to understand the crystallographic structure of IC's iron and its solidification and deformation processes. Here, we present a new method to investigate the IC's anisotropic properties based on Earth's coda‐correlation wavefield constructed from the late coda of large earthquakes. We perform a comprehensive travel time analysis of I2*, an IC‐sensitive correlation feature identified as a counterpart of the direct seismic wavefield's PKIKPPKIKP waves, yet fundamentally different. Namely, I2* is a mathematical manifestation of similarity among specific seismic phases with the same slowness detected in global correlograms in the short inter‐receiver distance range. Our new spatial sampling of the IC overcomes the shortage of direct seismic wavefield paths sensitive to the IC's central volume, also known as the innermost IC (IMIC). The observed I2*’s travel time variations relative to Earth's rotation axis (ERA) support a model of cylindrical anisotropy with 3.3% strength and a zonal pattern of slow axis oriented 55° from ERA. We thus find compelling evidence for a deep IC structure with distinct anisotropy, although we cannot resolve the depth at which the change occurs. This finding reinforces previous inference on the IMIC, with implications for Earth's evolution.</jats:p>",

The presence of a hollow core confines the flow domain to an annular swirling region that extends into a toroid in three-dimensional space. The procedure that we follow is based on the Bragg–Hawthorne framework and a judicious assortment of boundary conditions that correspond to a wall-bounded cyclonic motion with a cylindrical core. At the outset, a self-similar stream function is obtained directly from the Bragg–Hawthorne equation under the premises of steady, axisymmetric, and inviscid conditions. The resulting formulation enables us to describe the bidirectional evolution of the so-called inner and outer vortex motions, including their fundamental properties, such as the interfacial layer known as the mantle; it also unravels compact analytical expressions for the velocity, pressure, and vorticity fields, with particular attention being devoted to their peak values and spatial excursions that accompany successive expansions of the core radius. By way of confirmation, it is shown that removal of the hollow core restores the well-established solution for a fully flowing cylindrical cyclone. Immediate applications of cyclonic flows include liquid and hybrid rocket engines, swirl-driven combustion devices, as well as a multitude of heat exchangers, centrifuges, cyclone separators, and flow separation devices that offer distinct advantages over conventional, non-swirling systems.</jats:p>",

Using the optimized algorithm, two flow rates are determined using power distribution at the beginning of the core life as the sample data and the maximum power of each fuel assembly during the entire life as the sample data. Comparative analysis of two different flow zoning schemes is implemented on a small long-life natural circulation lead-bismuth fast reactor, SPALLER-100. The findings of this study show that the quantum genetic algorithm has the best convergence for the long-life reactor among the three intelligent optimization algorithms, and it can quickly provide optimal results. In flow zoning scheme calculations based on the core power distribution at the beginning of reactor life, the maximum outlet temperature of the fuel assembly exceeds the thermal safety limit of the reactor, and in the flow zoning scheme calculations based on the average core power distribution during the whole reactor life, the maximum outlet temperature of the fuel assembly is 140 K lower than the maximum outlet temperature obtained in the previous scheme, remaining below the thermal safety limit. The optimal number of partitions for the SPALLER-100 reactor is determined to be 5, and increasing the number of zones only slightly improved the thermal safety performance of the reactor.</jats:p>"

The core protein is also found to exert functions to affect host inflammation and immune responses by altering a variety of host pathways. This paper reviews the studies regarding the HCV core protein-induced alterations of host immunity and inflammatory responses, as well as the involvements of the HCV core protein in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine stimulations, host cellular transcription, lipid metabolism, cell apoptosis, cell proliferations, immune cell differentiations, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte steatosis, which leads to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Implications of roles played by the HCV core protein in therapeutic resistance are also discussed.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The sociology of violence has undergone a tremendous change over the past 10 years, increasingly arguing that situational factors are key to violence emergence, rather than context factors. Yet, many key questions regarding this novel situational approach remain unanswered: How can situation and context be conceptually specified? Can context be integrated into a situational explanatory model? And what causal understanding underlies situational approaches? To answer these questions, the paper relies on my empirical studies of officer deadly use of force and of collective violence in protests, as well as other scholars’ empirical work. The article first proposes a specified definition of situation and context. Using these concepts, it then proposes a causal specification of the situational approach through necessary, sufficient, and INUS conditions, as well as context factors as risk factors to violence. Third, in an outlook, it argues that this causal relationship between situation, context, and violence can be theoretically framed through an elaborated symbolic interactionism that integrates context into a situational approach. It also discusses the relevance of the debate for violence avoidance and for other research fields. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Massive multi-core architecture is rapidly becoming the standard in digital technology due to its high and parallel computational capability and performance benefits. To fully utilize the technological capabilities of multi-core systems, system software such as compilers should be re-engineered for parallel processing. Several important contributions have been made in the past to enhance the efficiency of the lexical analysis process by leveraging the innate parallel processing capability of multi-core computers. This trend of implementation shows that a parallel lexical analyzer tends to perform lexing tasks better than a conventional sequential lexical analyzer. This article discusses the way of making the tasks in parallel during the scanning of source program in the phase of lexical analysis. The objective of this study is to explore how to perform lexical analysis in parallel. On multi-core processors, multiple processes of the lexical analyzer program can run concurrently to scan multiple lines in the input stream in parallel for token detection. This is done by allocating tasks line-by-line to the core which is not engaged yet. \nDesign/Methodology/Approach: Developing a theoretical and experimental approach for parallelizing the lexical scanning process on a multi-core system.\nFindings/Result: According to the theoretical and experimental results, the proposed methodology significantly outperforms the sequential approach in terms of tokenization. It considerably reduces the time required for lexical analysis during the compilation process. The result establishes unequivocally that the parallel lexical analyzer's performance should scale linearly with the number of cores. It is clearly observed that the speedup is expected to increase further if the number of CPU cores increases. This enhancement would speed up the compilation process even more.\nOriginality/Value: A dynamic task allocation algorithm is developed for the concurrent execution of a lexical analyzer task on multi-core systems.\nPaper Type: Experimental Research.</jats:p>"

Simultaneously achieving a high strength and a high ductility is a challenging task in the design of MMCs. This article aims to highlight a recent trend: the development of MMCs reinforced with particles of core–shell structure. The core–shell particles can be synthesized in situ upon a partial transformation of metal (alloy) particles introduced into a metal matrix. MMCs containing core–shell particles with cores of different compositions (metallic, intermetallic, glassy alloy, high-entropy alloy, metal-ceramic) are currently studied. For metal core–intermetallic shell particle-reinforced composites, the property gain by the core–shell approach is strengthening achieved without a loss in ductility. The propagation of cracks formed in the brittle intermetallic shell is hindered by both the metal matrix and the metal core, which constitutes a key advantage of the metal core–intermetallic shell particles over monolithic particles of intermetallic compounds for reinforcing purposes. The challenges of making a direct comparison between the core–shell particle-reinforced MMCs and MMCs of other microstructures and future research directions are discussed.</jats:p>"

The CT analysis allowed to directly map and quantify excess ice, gas inclusions, and two distinct sediment phases.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We present investigations of rapidly rotating convection in a thick spherical shell geometry relevant to planetary cores, comparing results from quasi-geostrophic (QG), 3-D and hybrid QG-3D models. The 170 reported calculations span Ekman numbers, Ek, between 10−4 and 10−10, Rayleigh numbers, Ra, between 2 and 150 times supercritical and Prandtl numbers, Pr, between 10 and 10−2. The default boundary conditions are no-slip at both the ICB and the CMB for the velocity field, with fixed temperatures at the ICB and the CMB. Cases driven by both homogeneous and inhomogeneous CMB heat flux patterns are also explored, the latter including lateral variations, as measured by Q*, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the pattern divided by its mean, taking values up to 5. The QG model is based on the open-source pizza code. We extend this in a hybrid approach to include the temperature field on a 3-D grid. In general, we find convection is dominated by zonal jets at mid-depths in the shell, with thermal Rossby waves prominent close to the outer boundary when the driving is weaker. For the thick spherical shell geometry studied here the hybrid method is best suited for studying convection at modest forcing, $Ra \\le 10 \\, Ra_c$ when Pr = 1, and departs from the 3-D model results at higher Ra, displaying systematically lower heat transport characterized by lower Nusselt and Reynolds numbers. We find that the lack of equatorially-antisymmetric motions and z-correlations between temperature and velocity in the buoyancy force contributes to the weaker flows in the hybrid formulation. On the other hand, the QG models yield broadly similar results to the 3-D models, for the specific aspect ratio and range of Rayleigh numbers explored here. We cannot point to major disagreements between these two data sets at Pr ≥ 0.1, with the QG model effectively more strongly driven than the hybrid case due to its cylindrically averaged thermal boundary conditions. When Pr is decreased, the range of agreement between the hybrid and 3-D models expands, for example up to $Ra \\le 15 \\, Ra_c$ at Pr = 0.1, indicating the hybrid method may be better suited to study convection in the low Pr regime. We thus observe a transition between two regimes: (i) at Pr ≥ 0.1 the QG and 3-D models agree in the studied range of Ra/Rac while the hybrid model fails when $Ra\\gt 15\\, Ra_c$ and (ii) at Pr = 0.01 the QG and 3-D models disagree for $Ra\\gt 10\\, Ra_c$ while the hybrid and 3-D models agree fairly well up to $Ra \\sim 20\\, Ra_c$. Models that include laterally varying heat flux at the outer boundary reproduce regional convection patterns that compare well with those found in similarly forced 3-D models. Previously proposed scaling laws for rapidly rotating convection are tested; our simulations are overall well described by a triple balance between Coriolis, inertia and Archimedean forces with the length-scale of the convection following the diffusion-free Rhines-scaling. The magnitude of Pr affects the number and the size of the jets with larger structures obtained at lower Pr. Higher velocities and lower heat transport are seen on decreasing Pr with the scaling behaviour of the convective velocity displaying a strong dependence on Pr. This study is an intermediate step towards a hybrid model of core convection also including 3-D magnetic effects.</jats:p>",

We represent general statistical density fluctuations using a simple model where the initial moment of inertia tensor of the pulsar (taken to be diagonal here) is assumed to get random additional contributions for each of its component which are taken to be Gaussian distributed with certain width characterized by the strength of density fluctuations ϵ. Using sample values of ϵ, (and the pulsar deformation parameter η) we numerically calculate detailed pulse modifications by solving Euler’s equations for the rotational dynamics of the pulsar. We also give analytical estimates which can be used for arbitrary values of ϵ and η. We show that there are very specific patterns in the perturbed pulses which are observable in terms of modulations of pulses over large time periods. In view of the fact that density fluctuations fade away eventually leading to a uniform phase in the interior of pulsar, the off-diagonal components of MI tensor also vanish eventually. Thus, the modification of pulses due to induced wobbling (from the off-diagonal MI components) will also die away eventually. This allows one to distinguish these transient pulse modulations from the effects of any wobbling originally present. Further, the decay of these modulations in time directly relates to relaxation of density fluctuations in the pulsar giving valuable information about the nature of phase transition occurring inside the pulsar.</jats:p>",

High-resolution transition electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to study the size and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles and polymer coated nanoparticles. From the results it is cleared that the average size of the prepared nanoparticles and polymer coated nanoparticles are around 18-20 and 95-100 nm respectively, and the polymer coated nanoparticles are spherical in shape, and form a core shell. The phase purity and microcrystalline behavior of the prepared nano particles, POA coated nanoparticles and gelatin nanocomposites were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the results it was noticed the changes in the peak intensities of nanocomposites films, and a little shift in the peak position towards the lower 2θ values. Scanning electron microscope [SEM] and energy dispersive spectroscopy[EDX] were employed for the analysis of the surface morphology and the elemental composition of the prepared nanoparticles and nanocomposites. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to assess the physical interactions between the components in nanocomposites. The thermal stability and effect of polymer coated nanoparticles inclusions on glass transitions temperatures were studied by using Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) respectively. UV–Visible spectroscopy technique is used to study the optical properties of the Gelatin/POA@K2ZrO3 nanocomposites and the optical constants of nanocomposites were determined. From the results it is clear that, with increase in POA coated K2ZrO3 nanoparticles concentration from 0 to 4 wt % in a gelatin matrix, the band gap energy (Eg) value drops from 4.13 to 2.16 eV, and the refractive index rises from 1.529 to 3.25.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to diagnose and analyze the effects of core competency-based college English classes through the relationship between learners' competency achievement and academic achievement, and to suggest the direction for a more even cultivation of both competency and academic achievement in future general English classes. To this end, the researchers collected the results of the core competency diagnosis, the scores of mid-term and final exams, and the evaluation results of competency-building activities from 145 students. Three classes taking college English at H University in the central region participated in this study for a total of 12 weeks. Independent sample t-validation, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted for the purposes of this study. The results are as follows: First, we found that the teamwork competency level of learners taking this college English class improved. This result shows that students’ experiences performing the competency-building activities led to their competency achievement, and it also indicates that continuous and detailed activity-based teaching design is necessary to create college English classes that can guarantee the competency achievement of the learners. Second, learners who had improved their level of teamwork competency showed high satisfaction with the class, confirming that whether or not their core competencies were improved plays a role when it comes to the learners’ satisfaction with such classes. Finally, we found that learners with higher academic achievement had higher evaluation results regarding competency-building activities. This shows that competency-based college English classes have a positive effect in regards to improving both the core competency and the academic achievement of students. In conclusion, these results suggest that the instructional design for competency-based college English education can be an effective way for learners to develop both competency and academic achievement while putting their competency knowledge to use on their own.</jats:p>",

The scientists have defined key performance indicators and pursued large-scale automation, ambient sensing intelligence, and pervasive artificial intelligence. They put great efforts into implementing new network access and edge computing solutions. However, further progress depends on developing a more flexible core infrastructure according to more complex QoS requirements. Our research aims to provide 5G/6G core flexibility by customizing and optimizing network slices and introducing a higher level of programmability. We bind similar services in a group, manage them as a single slice, and enable a higher level of programmability as a prerequisite for dynamic QoS. The current 5G solutions primarily use predefined queues, so we have developed highly flexible, dynamic queue management software and moved it entirely to the application layer (reducing dependence on the physical network infrastructure). Further, we have emulated a testbed environment as realistically as possible to verify the proposed model capabilities. Obtained results confirm the validity of the proposed dynamic QoS management model for configuring queues’ parameters according to the service management requirements. Moreover, the proposed solution can also be applied efficiently to 5G core networks to resolve complex service requirements.</jats:p>"

In a suppressor screen, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Sm protein SME1 to alleviate photorespiratory H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-dependent cell death in catalase deficient plants. Similar attenuation of cell death was observed upon chemical inhibition of the spliceosome, suggesting pre-mRNA splicing inhibition to be responsible for the observed cell death alleviation. Furthermore, the <jats:italic>sme1-2</jats:italic> mutants showed increased tolerance to the reactive oxygen species inducing herbicide methyl viologen. Both an mRNA-seq and shotgun proteomic analysis in <jats:italic>sme1-2</jats:italic> mutants displayed a constitutive molecular stress response, together with extensive alterations in pre-mRNA splicing of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes and RNA binding proteins, even under unstressed conditions. Using SME1 as a bait to identify protein interactors, we provide experimental evidence for almost 50 homologs of mammalian spliceosome-associated protein to reside in the <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> spliceosome complexes and propose roles in pre-mRNA splicing for four uncharacterized plant proteins. Furthermore, like in <jats:italic>sme1-2</jats:italic>, a mutant in the Sm core assembly protein ICLN resulted in a decreased sensitivity to methyl viologen. Taken together, these data show that both a perturbed Sm core composition and assembly results in the activation of a defense response and enhanced resilience to oxidative stress.</jats:p>"

Herein, a carbon-coated LiMn<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> cathode with core@shell structure (LMO@C) was therefore produced using a mechanofusion method. The LMO@C exhibits higher cycling stability as compared to the pristine LiMn<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> (P-LMO) due to its high conductivity reducing impedance growth and phase transition. The carbon shell can reduce direct contact between the electrolyte and the cathode reducing side reactions and Mn dissolution. Thus, the cylindrical cell of LMO@C//graphite provides higher capacity retention after 900 cycles at 1 C. The amount of dissoluted Mn for the LMO@C is almost 2 times lower than that of the P-LMO after 200 cycles. Moreover, the LMO@C shows smaller change in lattice parameter or phase transition than P-LMO, indicating to the suppression of λ-MnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> phase from the mixed phase of Li<jats:sub>1-δ</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> + λ-MnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> when Li-delithiation at highly charged state leading to an improved cycling reversibility.

Designated leads (n=54) of pharmacist independent prescribing programmes in each United Kingdom (UK) educational provider (n=47) listed on the General Pharmaceutical Council website were invited to participate in March 2021. Following consent, a web-based questionnaire was distributed by email in April 2021 (Round 1). Two subsequent rounds were distributed in May and June 2021 respectively, and comprised the clinical skills for which consensus had not been achieved previously. A 9-point Likert scale was used (ranging from 1=limited importance to 9=critical). The response rate and distribution of scores for each clinical skill were calculated after each round. A clinical skill was included in the core set if 80% or more of participants scored between 7- 9, and 15% or less scored between 1-3.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>From 24 recruited participants (44.4%), 21 participants (87.5%) from 20 providers responded to Round 1 of the questionnaire, and also responded to the second and third rounds (100%). Following Round 1, seven clinical skills met the criteria for inclusion. Two additional clinical skills suggested by participants were added to the list of 11 clinical skills for which no consensus had been reached in the first round, hence, a total of 13 clinical skills were presented in Round 2. Two further skills were added to the core set following the second and third rounds respectively (four in total). The final core set consisted of 11 clinical skills: ‘Measuring heart rate (radial pulse)’, ‘Assessing respiratory rate’, ‘Measuring blood pressure (manual, e.g. with aneroid sphygmomanometer)’, ‘Measuring blood pressure (automated, i.e. electronic blood pressure monitor)’, ‘Measuring peripheral oxygen saturation (using pulse oximeter)’, ‘Measuring temperature’, ‘Undertaking a urinalysis’, ‘Respiratory examination (includes inspection, palpation, percussion and listening to breath sounds)’, ‘Measuring Peak Expiratory Flow Rate’, ‘Screening for/assessment of depression and anxiety using a validated questionnaire (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] scoring)’, and ‘Patient assessment via National Early Warning Score (NEWS)’.

Авторы статьи считают возможным использовать в практике понятие компетентность как совокупность контролируемых и управляемых компонентов человеческого фактора и предлагают для снижения негативного влияния человеческого фактора на аварийность и травматизм использовать комплексную модель компетенций по вопросам охраны труда, включающую такие блоки, как «требования к квалификации», «ответственность», «полномочия», «профессионально-важные качества» для снижения негативного влияния человеческого фактора на аварийность и травматизм. Применение комплексной модели компетенций по охране труда обеспечивает эффективную реализацию компетентностного подхода к управлению персоналом угольной шахты, позволяет определять пригодность работников, занятых на опасных и вредных работах и на работах, требующих повышенного внимания, быстрой реакции и высокой ответственности, а также разрабатывать критерии оценки сотрудников для их отбора, профессионального и карьерного продвижения.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The problem of industrial injuries caused by the human factor in its various manifestations does not lose its relevance.

The authors of the article consider it possible to use in practice the concept of competence as a set of controlled and managed components of the human factor and propose to reduce the negative impact of the human factor on accidents and injuries to use a comprehensive model of competencies on labor protection issues, including such blocks as «Qualification requirements», «Responsibility», «Powers», «Professionally important qualities» to reduce the negative impact of the human factor on accidents and injuries. The use of a comprehensive competency model for labor protection ensures the effective implementation of a competency-based approach to managing coal mine personnel, allows you to determine the suitability of employees engaged in hazardous and hazardous work and work that requires increased attention, quick response and high responsibility, and also develops employee assessment criteria for their selection, professional and career advancement.</jats:p>",

This type of research is qualitative research with a case study approach. The results showed that nursing problems that occurred in patients after ECMO installation included airway disorders, gas exchange disorders, bleeding risks, and the risk of impaired skin integrity due to decreased tissue perfusion. In conclusion, Lydia Hall's nursing theory is dominated by the Cure aspect because the installation of ECMO is a very complex medical procedure and involves teams from various disciplines. Hence, the implementation of the Cure aspect is a collaborative act of nurses. Care and Core aspects also have an essential role in caring for nurses, namely by conducting therapeutic interactions and facilitating patients to get family support so that patients have the spirit to recover and do not experience stress that can affect hemodynamic conditions.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nKeywords: COVID-19, ECMO, ICU, Lydia Hall, Case Study</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Particles with internal inclusions or cores are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. One example is dust particles coated with water-soluble aerosols such as sulfate or nitrate. For these particles, the dust non-sphericity and the core-shell structure of the particle both fundamentally impact the optical properties. However, it is challenging to obtain an accurate and comprehensive parameterization of the optical properties of coated atmospheric particles. Recent studies have found that super-spheroids could provide a robust model for representing the non-sphericity of irregular particles, such as dust, sea salt, and ice particles. This important finding warrants further investigations on coated super-spheroids for the development of mixed-aerosol models. In this study, we developed a GPU version of the invariant imbedding T-matrix program (GPU-IITM) to improve the computational efficiency. This version allows for efficient computation of the optical properties of coated super-spheroids with extensive shape parameters and refractive indices. The GPU-IITM is 8–25 times more efficient than the conventional CPU-IITM, depending on the size parameter of the coated super-spheroids. The single-scattering properties of coated super-spheroids computed from the GPU-IITM allows for close examination of the optical differences between homogeneous and inhomogeneous particles. As an example, we present the linear depolarization ratios (LDRs) of coated super-spheroids, which have implications in active lidar remote-sensing research. We found that the LDR decreases obviously as the real part of the shell’s refractive index increases from 1.3 to 1.6. Greater LDRs occur for particles with a thin coating, while a rounder shape of the particle decreases the LDRs. However, special attention should be given to nearly spherical particles, for which the LDRs could be enhanced. In comparison to homogeneous particles, the degree of enhancement decreases or increases depending on whether the shell’s refractive index is smaller or larger than the core refractive index.</jats:p>"

Because of its low pricing and utilisation of tiny diameter logs from fast-growing trees and thinning logs as raw materials, OSB is anticipated to gain popularity. In chapter, board properties of OSB using smaller strand size of Leucaena leucocephala as core layer had been studied. Small strand size of S3 (length = 75 mm, width = 3.2 to 6.3 mm) was located in the middle layer of the board while bigger strand sizes of S1 (length = 75 mm, width = 12.7 to 19.0 mm) and S2 (length = 75 mm, width = 6.3 to 12.7 mm) were located at the face and back layers. Utilization of smaller strands (S3) in the middle layers may yield boards that have better physical and mechanical properties. Except for MOR in the minor axis, board density and resin content were shown to have a substantial impact on physical and mechanical properties. Except for MOR in the major axis, strand size had little affected on physical and mechanical properties. The effects of board density on mechanical properties were discovered to affect significantly different. With a positive correlation, board density had a significant effect on thickness swelling. Between S1+S3 and S2+S3 strand size, there is no significant effect on bending properties, internal bond strength and thickness swelling. The effect of resin content on bending properties revealed a significant difference of MOR in major axis, as well as MOE values in both major and minor axes. Even when the resin content was as low as 5%, all treatments of OSB passed the general requirement of general purpose OSB.</jats:p>"

The core state plays a vital role in either success or failure of any regional cooperative arrangement. Outside powers, especially the great or superpowers can also affect the fate of regional schemes. Moreover, the nature of relations between the core member state and an outside great or superpower also affects in diverse ways the process of regionalism. Under this theoretical framework, this paper investigates why the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline proposal could not materialize. The paper explores internal and external factors that halted the progress of the project with special reference to the role and behavior of India and the United States. It illuminates how the Indo-US strategic partnership and nuclear deal overshadowed a crucial project that was designed to create interdependence between three states, especially India and Pakistan and establish peace in the region. The study finds that India emphasized its connections with the United States to realize its ambitions of becoming a key player in world affairs. The paper shows how the US distracted India from pursuing a crucial regional cooperation project by providing payoffs and incentives that jeopardized the process of regionalism in South Asia.</jats:p>"

Social influence has been noted as an important factor that may nudge individuals to take more risks (e.g., initiation of substance use), but ironically also help individuals to take safer actions (e.g., successful abstinence). Such bi-directional impacts of social influence hint at the complexity of social information processing. Here, we first review the recent computational approaches that shed light on neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying social influence following basic computations involved in decision-making: valuation, action selection, and learning. We next review the studies on social influence from various fields including neuroeconomics, developmental psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience, and highlight three dimensions of determinants—who are the recipients, how the social contexts are presented, and to what domains and processes of decisions the influence is applied—that modulate the extent to which individuals are influenced by others. Throughout the review, we also introduce the brain regions that were suggested as neural instantiations of social influence from a large body of functional neuroimaging studies. Finally, we outline the remaining questions to be addressed in the translational application of computational and cognitive theories of social influence to psychopathology and health.</jats:p>"

The damage accumulated from deflection in the process of repeated impact will often seriously affect the safety of the structure. In this research, the low-velocity repeated impacts behavior of corrugated core structures was investigated through experimental methods. A series of low-velocity repeated impact tests were carried out to study impact resistance, taking into account the effects of varied impact sites and impact energy levels and the effects of different impact locations and different levels of impact energy. It is also observed from the test that the upper panel played a crucial role and experienced the coupling mode of the local indentations and global bending deformations during the repeated impacts tests. Three different failure modes were observed when changing the impact energies and impact locations. Moreover, the “pseudo-shakedown” phenomenon was also found when the energy of the impacts is 10 J on the short span. The present surveys provide a reliable method and insight into the dynamic response of the aluminum corrugated core structures when subjected to low-velocity repeated impacts, which could be a significant guideline for the investigation and lightweight design of shipping and aviation.</jats:p>",

The present study aimed to assess the value of ultrasound-guided cervical CNB in the diagnosis of lymphoma in suspected patients.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 46 consecutive patients (20 to 82 years) with cervical mass or lymphadenopathy suspected of lymphoma and were candidates for diagnostic evaluation. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies (UGCNB) were done by a single radiologist under guided ultrasonography. The diagnostic value of UGCNB in the diagnosis and determination of specific lymphoma subtypes was assessed.\r\nResults: Using UGCNB led to the diagnosis of lymphoma in 34.8% and non-lymphoma lesions in 43.5%, while the diagnosis remained unclear in other 21.7% with a total UGCNB-based identification rate of 78.3%. No patient with lymphoma was missed. All patients were followed up over a 6-month period. In none of the cases, clinical diagnosis and treatment response were found contrary to the initial pathologic diagnosis. No significant complication such as hematoma or infection was reported.\r\nConclusion: UGCNB has a high diagnostic value for determining the nature of the cervical lesions suspected of lymphoma. \r\n   </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prognosis has not improved over the last decades because of the lack of effective diagnostic and therapeutic methods in the early stage of the disease. METHODS: Several gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We calculated the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEmiRs). Then, we constructed a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network by using the miRWalk database. For the DEGs regulated by DEmiRs, we introduced GEPIA to confirm these DEGs’ expression and effect on overall survival. We used other GEO datasets and mRNA-miRNA target databases to validate these DEGs and their relationship with DEmiRs. All these potential core DEGs regulated by DEmiRs were also analyzed at the single-cell level to confirm their cell type source. RESULTS: CCNB2 and KCNN4, which were regulated by several micro RNAs, showed relatively high expression levels in PDAC patients and significant association with worse overall survival. Furthermore, we identified many DEGs at single-cell level and found that 10 oncogenes were significantly upregulated in type 2 ductal cell type, thereby further demonstrating that type 2 ductal cells might be major sources of malignant cells and are valuable therapeutic targets in PDAC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data added some new insights into the molecular mechanism of PDAC and may be helpful for finding potential biomarkers for diagnosis. These discovery at single-cell level may also be useful for developing new therapeutic targets for PDAC patients.</jats:p>",

In this case, the dispersive Drude dielectric function for the metal was used, and a comparative study between the positions of the resonance frequencies obtained from quasi-static limit and electrodynamic theory was performed.

Relevant pathologic outcomes are paramount in evaluating preclinical models and therapeutic outcomes and require careful advance planning.

Baby Buddy can support the educational role of mother-child healthcare providers (HP); however, antenatal education (AE) may be currently perceived as a formal activity within the physical space of the antenatal class. We aimed to gain an understanding of influences on midwives engaging in an educational role during routine appointments and propose, on the basis of the ‘behaviour diagnosis’, a potential intervention using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework.\nMethods\n This is a formative research study guided by the COM-B model and related Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Complimentary methods were used to collect information from in-training and registered midwives: focus group (N = 11), questionnaire survey (N = 24) and Nominal Group Technique during workshops (N = 40). Deductive content analysis of qualitative data and quantitative survey analysis, tapping on 6 COM-B and 14 TDF domains, guided the design of a multicomponent intervention.\nResults\n AE is viewed as a core function of the professional role, yet neither supported nor prioritized by current practices. Problematic areas relate to organizational context, such as weak interprofessional collaboration and lack of policy, protocols and resources. In addition, medicalization of birth and related socio-cultural norms, pertaining to users and providers, are sustaining alienation of the midwife and conditions of power dynamics. AE was perceived as a means to enhance the autonomy of the profession but there are might be issues with procedural knowledge and the need for skill development was identified. Several intervention functions were identified as promising, however cognitive re-framing through strategic communication and modelling may also be needed both in terms of providing “credible models” for the role itself as well as re-framing AE through the concept of “making every contact count”.\nConclusions\n AE is currently perceived to be a ‘bad fit’ with routine practice. The study proposed an intervention to enhance midwives’ educational role and professional identity, while embedding Baby Buddy in clinical practice to facilitate the process. In addition to designing a theory-driven research-informed potential intervention, the process functioned as a participatory learning experience through collective reflection.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the teacher's ability to manage to learn has increased in each cycle. In cycle 1, it was included in the poor category, then increased in cycle 2 to be good and increased again in cycle 3 to be better. Student learning outcomes increase in each cycle. Individually in cycle 1,.35% complete their learning. Cycle 2 is 60.00% and cycle 3 is 92.00%. Classical completeness in cycle 1 is 42.00%, cycle 2 is 65.00% and cycle 3 is 85.00%.</jats:p>"

In Serious Accidents (SAs), the corium will be retained in the C/SiC ceramic composite spherical shell container and thrown into the pool for passive cooling. In order to investigate the capability of the C/SiC ceramic composites to withstand the high temperature of 1800°C and the huge thermal shock at the initial stage of cooling, in this work, the high-temperature performance of these composites is studied. Furthermore, the compatibility of these composites with corium is investigated, and a retention container design prototype is proposed. The thermal conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, high-temperature tensile strength, and thermal shock resistance of the candidate C/SiC specimens to be used in the manufacturing of the detention container are measured. The FactSage software package is used for the chemical compatibility study and product composition analysis of the composite SiC deposition layer and corium. The corrosion process of the SiC deposition layer of the composite material caused by corium is investigated through high-temperature corrosion tests and the electron microscopy analysis of the SiC specimen with the incorporation of CeO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The results show that the C/SiC ceramic composite can meet the design criteria of the CGC corium retention container, and it is impossible to cause a carbon reaction disaster through the failure of the composite SiC deposition layer.</jats:p>"

Moreover, this stacking of inorganic NPs/NRs in a terminated implementation is progressed into latter layer of TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> NPs functionalized by 1‐aminopyrene molecules representing an example of hybrid organic‐inorganic formation with fluorescence emission. The deposited layers are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM).

Furthermore, a detailed computational approach has been studied to illustrate the effect of geometrical and dimensional parameters on the type of the enhanced texture and the mesomorphic range and stability. The results of the DFT study revealed that the orientation of the mesogen could affect the mesomorphic behavior and this has been attributed in terms of the degree of the polarizability of the linking groups. This result has been confirmed by calculation of the net dipole moment and the molecular electrostatic potential that show how the mesogen orientation and position could impact the molecular charge separation.

The comparative/combined effect of the magnetic core co-precipitation temperature (80 and 95 °C) and ZnO-doping of the silica shell on the photocatalytic and nano-sorption properties of the resulted composite nanoparticles were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy monitoring the discoloration of methylene blue (MB) solution under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and darkness, respectively. The morphology, structure, textural, and magnetic parameters of the investigated powders were evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements, and saturation magnetization (vibrating sample magnetometry, VSM). The intraparticle diffusion model controlled the MB adsorption. The pseudo- and second-order kinetics described the MB photodegradation. When using SiO2-shell functionalized nanoparticles, the adsorption and photodegradation constant rates are three–four times higher than for using starting core iron oxide nanoparticles. The obtained magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were tested for films deposition.</jats:p>"

Preparing a surgical portfolio can start in medical school, however, there is limited guidance on what forms a competitive portfolio with the majority of advice coming from university resources and national societies which are variable throughout the country.

The biomedical applications of nitinol-based devices are, however, limited because of concerns related to leaching and its associated cytotoxicity. In particular, nitinol nanoparticles (NPs), despite being highly promising for biomedical applications such as nano-actuators and biomolecular delivery agents are not explored, owing to the same concerns. Moreover, nitinol nanoparticles and their biological interactions are not fully characterized, and the available literature on their toxicity portrays a divided picture. Surface passivation of nitinol using multiple methods has been explored in the past to reduce the leaching of nickel in implants while also improving the thrombogenic properties. In this work, we reported the preparation of passivized nitinol NPs by laser ablation of nitinol targets, followed by different surface treatments. The effect of different treatments in reducing nickel leaching and its influence on biocompatibility were studied. The biocompatibility and multi-faceted interaction of nitinol NPs with osteoblast cells and associated toxicity were explored. Homogenous nitinol NPs were found to be generated at 25 W of laser power. Also, surface modification using hydrogen peroxide, anodization, and acid etching was found to be effective in waning the nickel leaching and improving biocompatibility. In view of the observed results of cellular interactions, we discussed the possible routes of cellular toxicity of these NPs. The prospective applications of such passivized NPs in the biomedical field are also discussed in this work.</jats:p>"

Holes and electrons coexist on the upper and lower layers of graphene, which are situated at the convex region and edge of corannulene when it has the bowl conformation. In contrast, bilayer graphene has a tiny gap of 4.7 meV at the K point owing to the substantial interaction between graphene and corannulene when corannulene has flat conformation. Electron and hole redistribution in bilayer graphene intercalating corannulene indicated the possibility of all carbon p-n border at an interface between corannulene with convex and concave arrangements. The intercalation substantially decreases the energy difference between the ground state bowl conformation and the metastable state flat conformation by approximately 400 meV. Accordingly, the two-dimensional nano-spacing between the graphene layers changes the molecular conformation of corannulene from a bowl to a flat structure at 139 MPa.</jats:p>",

Since the DNA-binding domain of p53 (p53C) is aggregation-prone, the anti-oncogenic function of p53 is often lost in cancer cells. This tendency is rather severe in some tumor-related p53 mutants, such as R175H. In this study, we examined the effect of salts, including KCl and sugars, on the aggregation of p53C by monitoring two distinct aggregates: amorphous-like and amyloid-like. The amorphous aggregates are detectable with 8-(phenylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence, whereas the amyloid aggregates are sensitive to thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence. We found that KCl inhibited the formation of amorphous aggregates but promoted the formation of amyloid aggregates in a p53C R175H mutant. The salts exhibited different effects against the wild-type and R175H mutants of p53C. However, the ratio of ANS/ThT fluorescence for the wild-type and R175H mutant remained constant. KCl also suppressed the structural transition and loss of the DNA-binding function of p53C. These observations indicate the existence of multiple steps of p53C aggregation, probably coupled with the dissociation of Zn. Notably, amorphous aggregates and amyloid aggregates have distinct properties that could be discriminated by various small additives upon aggregation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a special class of cooperative games with transferable utility (TU), called [Formula: see text]‐ attribute games. Every player in an [Formula: see text]‐attribute game is endowed with a vector of [Formula: see text] attributes that can be combined in an additive fashion; that is, if players form a coalition, the attribute vector of this coalition is obtained by adding the attributes of its members. Another fundamental feature of [Formula: see text]‐attribute games is that their characteristic function is defined by a continuous attribute function [Formula: see text]—the value of a coalition depends only on evaluation of [Formula: see text] on the attribute vector possessed by the coalition, and not on the identity of coalition members. This class of games encompasses many well‐known examples, such as queueing games and economic lot‐sizing games. We believe that by studying attribute function [Formula: see text] and its properties, instead of specific examples of games, we are able to develop a common platform for studying different situations and obtain more general results with wider applicability. In this paper, we first show the relationship between nonemptiness of the core and identification of attribute prices that can be used to calculate core allocations. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which every [Formula: see text]‐attribute game embedded in attribute function [Formula: see text] has a nonempty core, and a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that [Formula: see text] should satisfy for the embedded game to be convex. We also develop several sufficient conditions for nonemptiness of the core of [Formula: see text]‐attribute games, which are easier to check, and show how to find a core allocation when these conditions hold. Finally, we establish natural connections between TU games and [Formula: see text]‐attribute games. </jats:p>",

In recent studies from our group, kynurenic acid (KYNA) derivative 1 was synthesized and found to share the structural features typical of G-quadruplex binders. Herein, structural modifications were conducted on this scaffold in order to assist the binding with a G-quadruplex, by introducing charged hydrophilic groups. The antiproliferative activity of the new analogues was evaluated on an IGROV-1 human ovarian cancer cell line, and the most active compound, compound 9, was analyzed with NMR spectrometry in order to investigate its binding mode with DNA. The results indicated that a weak, non-specific interaction was set with duplex nucleotides; on the other hand, titration in the presence of a G-quadruplex from human telomere d(TTAGGGT)4 showed a stable, although not strong, interaction at the 3′-end of the nucleotidic sequence, efficiently assisted by salt bridges between the quaternary nitrogen and the external phosphate groups. Overall, this work can be considered a platform for the development of a new class of potential G-quadruplex stabilizing molecules, confirming the crucial role of a planar system and the ability of charged nitrogen-containing groups to facilitate the binding to G-quadruplex grooves and loops.</jats:p>"

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), the most common fluoropolymer, can easily react with Al to form aluminum fluoride (AlF3), thus promoting the oxidation of Al powders. In this paper, core-shell structured Al@PVDF powders were synthesized by solvent/non-solvent method. Thermal analysis results show that the weight and exothermic enthalpy of Al@PVDF powders are 166.10% and 11,976 J/g, which are superior to pure Al powders (140.06%, 6560 J/g). A detailed description of the oxidation mechanisms involved is provided. Furthermore, constant volume pressure results indicate that Al@PVDF powders have outstanding pressure output ability in the environment of 3 MPa oxygen. The study provides a valuable reference for the application of Al powders in energetic materials.</jats:p>"

A technical method of restoring the original spatial attitude of nonoriented geological cores on the ground was proposed based on the inherent “trajectory projection consistency” relationship between the borehole and the corresponding core. A prototype machine of core ground reorientation was developed. Using this method and machine, ground reorientation was performed on cores drilled from the deepest shaft in China. Subsequently, the reoriented core acoustic emission (AE) method was conducted to identify the in situ stress within the project area. Meanwhile, measurement accuracy was verified by the stress relief method. The results show that the in situ stress distributions, including the azimuth and the trends in principal stresses by the two methods, are in good agreement and indicate that the historical maximum principal stress in the case of the mine has little abrupt variability with that of the present day. The research results can be used as the design basis for the safe construction of the deepest shaft.</jats:p>"

As a result, we established a synthetic route to the CD ring decahydroquinoline via cyclopropanation followed by ring-opening and reduction, and the AB ring tetracyclic core by ene-yne metathesis. In the ene-yne metathesis, the use of a quaternary ammonium salt solved the issues of the conformation of the substrate as well as the deactivation of the catalyst. The first total synthesis was achieved by stereoselective derivatization of the tetracyclic skeleton. In addition, we investigated the asymmetric cyclopropanation, which introduces an initial chiral center and was found to be effective for a Ru catalyst with vinyloxazoline-type ligands.</jats:p>",

Based on the best-fit results of the [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>] profile, the objects are classified into different morphological groups, and we conclude that the deviation from spherical symmetry is a common feature for all types of SESNe. There is a hint (at the ∼1<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> level) that the distributions of the line profile fractions are different between canonical SESNe and broad-line SNe Ic. A correlation between [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>] width and [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>]/[Ca <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>] is discerned, indicating that the oxygen-rich material tends to expand faster for objects with a more massive CO core.

Further, when [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>]/[Ca <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>] increases, the fraction of objects with Gaussian [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>] profile increases, while those with double-peaked profile decreases.

Our study aimed to describe and contrast the views of multiple stakeholder groups on the core competencies of mental health nurses. Concept mapping is a six‐step mixed‐methods study design that combines qualitative data with principal component analysis to produce a two‐dimensional concept map. Forty‐eight people participated in the study from five stakeholder groups that included service users and clinicians. The final concept map had eight clusters: assessment and management of risk; understanding recovery principles; person‐ and family‐centred care; good communication skills; knowledge about mental disorders and treatment; evaluating research and promoting physical health; a sense of humour; and physical and psychological interventions. There were important differences in how service users and health professionals ranked the relative importance of the clusters. Service users reported the understanding recovery principles cluster as the most important, whilst health professionals ranked the assessment and management of risk group the most important. There may be a disconnect between what service users and other stakeholders perceive to be the core competencies of mental health nurses. There is a need for more research to examine the differing perspectives of service users and health professionals on the core competencies of mental health nurses.</jats:p>",

The Lower Shale, lower sand, middle shale, main pay upper sand, and the upper shale. At the W oilfield, the main pay member is an oil producer. The thickness is of the main reservoir about 100 meters thick. A recent study focused on the Main Pay upper sand, which is divided into three informal units. The upper unit H and lower unit L reservoir units are connected by shale intervals (K unit) that extend throughout the field area laterally. There exist four depositional lithofacies of Zubair Formation fluvial, channel, mouth bar, and prodelta depositional lithofacies. Four Facies were defined according to gamma-ray sandstone, shaly sand, sandy shale, and shale Facies. The Zubair formation has four types of rocks (RRT1, RRT2, RRT3, and RRT4) due to heterogeneity. The RRT1 is characterized by 10%-25% porosities and 10-1000 mD permeability. The RRT2 has a similar porosity range to RRT1, 15%–25%, but an order ofmagnitude lower permeability range from 10-100 mD. RRT3 is considered to have high porosity and low permeability is thought to have great storage but poor flow potential. RRT 3 is characterized by 6%-15% porosities and &lt;10 mD permeability. Meanwhile, RRT4 is considered to have low porosity and low permeability. Various rock types showed in the H unit due to heterogeneity, which composed this unit.

In order to achieve the research purpose, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on 66 cases selected by Institution K from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the analysis, the tasks performed by the case managers were identified as ‘formation of trustworthy and dependable relationships’, “assessment of clients’ current background, possessions, environment, and potential”, ‘case management planning with respect for clients’ participation and choice’, ‘sharing, responsiveness, and accompaniment’, and ‘evaluation of the seemingly imperceptible change in relationships and capabilities’. Case managers reflected on the importance of “support for clients’ rights and for their future courses of life” and ‘changes in the way of practice’. In addition, the significance of case management was reconfirmed through the selected examples and positive changes were experienced by not only clients, but also case managers and the local community. It can be noted that high-quality practice is not solely based on the capabilities of the case manager, and that it necessitates client and community involvement. Based on research results, the environment and effort required to induce high-quality practice among case managers were proposed.</jats:p>",

As interventions to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 are developed and evaluated, there is an urgent need for researchers to agree on the outcomes used when evaluating their effectiveness. Having an agreed set of outcomes that are used in all relevant trials can ensure that study results can be compared.\nObjective\n The aim of the study was to develop a core outcome set (COS) for trials assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for preventing COVID-19 infection and transmission in care homes.\nMethods\n The study used established COS methodology. A list of candidate outcomes was identified by reviewing registered trials to evaluate interventions to prevent COVID-19 in care homes. Seventy key stakeholders participated in a Delphi survey, rating the candidate outcomes on a nine-point scale over two rounds, with the opportunity to propose additional outcomes. Stakeholders included care home representatives (n = 19), healthcare professionals (n = 20), people with personal experience of care homes (n = 7), researchers (n = 15) and others (n = 9). Outcomes were eligible for inclusion if they met an a priori threshold. A consensus meeting with stakeholders resulted in agreement of the final outcome set.\nResults\n Following the Delphi and consensus meeting, twenty-four outcomes were recommended for inclusion. These are grouped across four domains of infection, severity of illness, mortality, and those specific to interventions. Due to the considerable heterogeneity between care homes, residents, and interventions, the relevance and importance of outcomes may differ between trial contexts. Intervention specific outcomes would be included only where relevant to a given trial, thus reducing the measurement burden.\nConclusion\n Using a rapid response approach, a COS for COVID-19 prevention interventions in care homes has been developed. Future work should focus on identifying instruments for measuring these outcomes, and the interpretation and application of the COS across different trial contexts. Beyond COVID-19, the outcomes identified in this COS may have relevance to other infectious diseases in care homes, and the rapid response approach may be useful as preparation for future pandemics.</jats:p>"

The first gripper is composed of a PLA surface layer and a magnetorheological (MR) fluid core and the second gripper is composed of a PLA surface layer bonded to a surface of unimorph piezoelectric Macro Fiber Composite (MFC). The magnetic field is applied by using permanent magnets while the magnetic field strength is varied by changing the distance between the permanent magnets. The electric field is applied by using a micro‐amplifier and regulated using data acquisition systems. The natural frequency and damping ratio of the PLA gripper finger are determined by free vibration analysis using LabVIEW software. The damping ratio and vibration amplitude suppression for the PLA grippers was increased as the magnetic field strength changed from 0G to 600G (MR) and as the electric field changed from 0V to 360V (MFC).</jats:p>",

In order to achieve the desirable qualities, rational construction of the structure and chemical composition of electrocatalysts is of fundamental importance. Herein, petal-like structure Ni0.33Co0.67P shells grown on conductive silver nanowires (Ag NWs) cores as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and phosphorization. The resultant three-dimensional core-shell petal-like structure Ag NWs@Ni0.33Co0.67P possesses excellent catalytic activities in alkaline conditions with the overpotential of 259 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), 121 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a full cell voltage of 1.64 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Highly conductive Ag NWs as cores and high surface area petal-like Ni0.33Co0.67P as shells can endow outstanding catalytic performance for the bifunctional electrocatalyst. Thus, the synthetic strategy of the three-dimensional core-shell structure Ag NWs@Ni0.33Co0.67P considerably advances the practice of Ag NWs toward electrocatalysts.</jats:p>"

The expanding geographical range and rising prevalence of CWD are increasing the risk of pathogen transfer and spillover of CWD to non-cervid sympatric species. As beavers have close contact with environmental and food sources of CWD infectivity, we hypothesized that they may be susceptible to CWD prions. We evaluated the susceptibility of beavers to prion diseases by challenging transgenic mice expressing beaver prion protein (tgBeaver) with five strains of CWD, four isolates of rodent-adapted prions and one strain of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. All CWD strains transmitted to the tgBeaver mice, with attack rates highest from moose CWD and the 116AG and H95+ strains of deer CWD. Mouse-, rat-, and especially hamster-adapted prions were also transmitted with complete attack rates and short incubation periods. We conclude that the beaver prion protein is an excellent substrate for sustaining prion replication and that beavers are at risk for CWD pathogen transfer and spillover.</jats:p>"

It is found that small TCs have higher rainrate with higher axisymmetry than large TCs. Though both small and large TCs have rainfall within a radius of 5° latitudes, the rainfall occurs up to 10 times of the RMW in small TCs compared to within 5 times of the RMW in large TCs. Small TCs have a 6‐hr delayed rainfall decrease compared to large TCs near the landfall. Higher TC intensity may partly contribute to higher rainrate during landfall in smaller TCs than in larger TCs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The coronal-radicular reconstruction is a restoration that involves both the coronal part and the root part of the tooth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical aspects of anterior teeth before performing corono-radicular reconstruction by inclay-core. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study for analytical purposes with prospective data collection at the fixed prosthesis department of the CHU-CNOS over a period of six (6) months from (June 2019 to December 2019). The study population was made up of patients who underwent corono-radicular reconstruction (CPR) on anterior teeth by inlay core in the fixed prosthesis department of the CHU-CNOS. The patients were submitted to a questionnaire relating to general information, the reason for consultation, the oral examination, the type of coronal-radicular reconstruction. In this study, the female sex was the most represented with 61.40% of cases and a sex ratio of 0.62 in favor of women. Dental caries was the most represented pathology, 47.14% of cases. Retro-alveolar radiography was done in the vast majority of patients, ie 91.42% of cases. Aesthetics was the most represented reason for consultation with 95.70% of cases. More than three quarters (80%) of coronal-radicular reconstructions by inlay-core on anterior teeth were performed in the maxilla. All the walls were dilapidated in more than three-quarters of the cases, i.e. 77.15%. Corono-radicular reconstruction was performed to serve as a bridge pillar in 58.30% of cases. In our study, the mechanical principles of reconstitution were good in 91.40% retention and 94.30% stabilization. Lift was also good at 54.3%. The quality of these principles depends on the clinical stage (preparation) and the technical design in the laboratory. This prosthetic element must meet several objectives, hence the need for multidisciplinary care. Efforts must be made at all levels for prosthetic rehabilitation, especially in anterior relief.</jats:p>",

In nanofluidic analytical devices, switching and partitioning reagents in nanochannels without contamination are essential operations. For such operations, we have developed a nanochannel open/close valve utilizing elastic glass deformation. However, owing to a rectangular-shaped nanospace, sample leakage due to diffusion through the remaining open space in the closed valve occurs and causes contamination. Herein, we propose a fabrication method of nanoscale curved structure resembling the glass deflection shape to develop the nanofluidic valve for switching and partitioning operations in nanochannels. After fabricating a four-stepped rectangular nanospace by electron beam lithography and dry etching, the space was plastically deformed using an impulsive force by pressing the chamber more than 20 000 times. A smoothly curved structure with a high aspect ratio of 750 (75 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m width and 100 nm depth) fitting the glass deflection shape, which has been difficult for conventional methods, was successfully fabricated. Utilizing a valve with the curved structure, the solute leakage through the closed valve was reduced to less than 0.5% with a 94% decreased diffusion flux compared to previous valve with the rectangular-shaped structure. The developed valve realized switching of 72 pl reagents in a nanochannel with a response time of 0.4 s, which is sufficient for nanofluidic-chromatography, and it correctly worked even after an interval of 30 min, which is required for repeatable nanofluidic analyses. The newly developed valve will contribute to realizing versatile nanofluidic analytical devices.</jats:p>",

The comparative characteristic of the new type of an employee defines its main components, namely mobility and professional integrated knowledge of the specialty. The conducted comparative analysis of scientific definitions of «professional competence» and «researcher’s competence» gives grounds to formulate the authors’ definition of professional competence of a researcherof  a military research institution. The professional competence of a researcher is a holistic ability that is acquired through training and consists of knowledge, experience, values, and attitudes that can be fully put into practice; consists of three core components – competence of the military research organization itself, competence of the researcher, and competence of the head of the military research organization. In addition, the competence of a researcher of the research department of a higher military educational institution and scientific institution is the level of qualification that allows to successfully solve the outlined tasks taking into account the specifics of military service for an officer and the specifics of the military organization for an employee of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The content of the professional profile of the head of a military science department is revealed as a competency consisting of the following components: decision-making culture, language culture, culture of business communication, physical culture, psychological and pedagogical culture, moral culture and the moral foundations of an officer.

Unlike other recently developed areas in China, urban villages are in dire need of improvement. Consequently, the redevelopment of urban villages has garnered considerable public and academic interest. However, a comprehensive understanding is lacking on the drivers of urban village redevelopment in China. This study aims to fill this gap through a comprehensive survey of existing literature on redevelopment of urban villages. A total of 167 papers have been retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. A bibliometric analysis and a critical content analysis are conducted on the bases of these papers. We found at least three main processes which have driven urban village redevelopment in China. First, the growth of urban population and their income level has created a strong emerging demand to improve urban living conditions, which has triggered the restructuring of urban villages with sub-standard built environment into high-quality urban spaces. Second, from the production side, the market-oriented land reforms and the developers’ pursuit of land-related investment returns from land rent gap is also a strong driving force for demolition and redevelopment of urban villages. Lastly, the states and local governments have played a critical role in promoting urban village redevelopment and integrating informal urban spaces into formal urban areas. This research concludes with an evaluation of current studies on urban village redevelopment and provides suggestions for further research in the future.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, firstly, a glass fiber resin epoxy sandwich panel has been fabricated in the laboratory. In this regard, the vacuum‐assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) method has been used to achieve a laminate without any fault. In order to improve the impact resistance of the composite, the nano‐SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> were added to the resin epoxy matrix as filler with the ratios of 1%, 2%, and 3% of the composite's total weight. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been utilized to observe the microscopic structure of the composites, and it shows an exceptional homogeneous mixture of nano‐SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> particles in the resin epoxy matrix. From the experiment results, it was figured out that by adding 1 to 3 wt% of nano‐SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> into the composite, the output velocity of the projectile decreases. On the other hand, the results showed that when the projectile collides with the core of the sandwich panel, it remains in the sandwich panel and its output velocity will be zero. However, when the projectile does not completely collide with the core, the output velocity of the projectile will not be zero. In order to validate the results, a finite element analysis (FEA) has been developed to simulate the high‐velocity impact test. Then the experimental data has been compared to numerical simulation and good agreement was observed.</jats:p>",

The investigated sandwich structures consist of maize starch-based films as skins and biodegradable 3D-printed polylactic filaments (PLA) as the core. To investigate the tensile properties of the skins, conventional and nanocomposite films were prepared by a solution mixing procedure with maize starch and glycerol as the plasticizer, and they were reinforced with sodium montmorillonite clay, cellulose fibers and fiberglass fabric, with different combinations. Test results indicated a significant improvement in the mechanical and morphological properties of composite films prepared with sodium montmorillonite clay in addition with cellulose fibers and fiberglass fabric, with 20 wt% of glycerol. The morphology of the skins was also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Three orders of hierarchical honeycombs were designed for the 3D-printed core. To investigate how the skin material and the design of the core affect the mechanical properties of the starch-based sandwich, specimens were tested under a three-point bending regime. The test results have shown that the flexural strength of the biodegradable sandwich structure increased with the use of a second order hierarchy core and starch-based skins improved the strength and stiffness of the neat PLA-based honeycomb core. The bending behavior of the hierarchical honeycombs was also assessed with finite element analysis (FEA) in combination with experimental findings. Flexural properties demonstrated that the use of starch-based films and a PLA honeycomb core is a suitable solution for biodegradable sandwich structures.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, through the promotion of the feature pyramid, the top-performing prediction box is obtained. Fire-YOLO attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art object detection networks, notably in the detection of small targets of fire and smoke. Overall, the Fire-YOLO detection model can effectively deal with the inspection of small fire targets, as well as fire-like and smoke-like objects. When the input image size is 416 × 416 resolution, the average detection time is 0.04 s per frame, which can provide real-time forest fire detection.

In China, the ‘decline in both quantity and quality’ of arable land resources, especially in major grain-producing areas, has become increasingly serious. This study uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the core conditions and combinations of paths leading to explicit and implicit abandonment using 30 typical cases in the main grain-producing areas of Hubei Province. The results show that (1) three combined pathways lead to explicit ALA (EALA) and that two pathways lead to implicit ALA (IALA); (2) laborer health (LH) is the core condition leading to EALA; and (3) LH, agricultural laborer (AL), per capita income (PCI) and social relationships (SRs) are the core conditions leading to IALA. To effectively alleviate ALA, the government should improve production conditions, pay attention to laborer health issues, improve agricultural returns and strengthen food security publicity and guidance, thereby promoting the rational use of arable land in these areas. The findings in this study link the changes in arable land use and provide a reference for other developing countries in ensuring food security.</jats:p>"

We retrospectively analyzed receptor profiles of 215 early breast cancer patients with axillary synchronous LNM. Of our cohort, 69% were therapy naive and did not receive neoadjuvant treatment. Using immunohistochemistry, receptor status and Ki67 were compared between core needle biopsy of the tumor (t-CNB) and axillary LNM obtained during surgery. The discordance rates between t-CNB and axillary LNM were 12% for HER2, 6% for ER and 20% for PR. Receptor discordance appears to already occur at the primary site. Receptor losses might play a role concerning overtreatment concomitant with adverse drug effects, while receptor gains might be an option for additional targeted or endocrine therapy. Hence, not only receptor profiles of the tumor tissue but also of the synchronous axillary LNM should be considered in the choice of treatment.</jats:p>"

However, applications in carbonate formations are challenged by the possible high adsorption of anionic polymers such as polyacrylamides and xanthan gum. Non-ionic biopolymers such as guar gum could be used to minimize retention. Many investigations using guar flooding have been conducted, but none targeted carbonate reservoirs. This work compares oil recovery improvement, water production delay, mobility control, injectivity, and polymer utilization in carbonate core flooding at reservoir conditions (salinity of 30,905 ppm and 60 °C) with xanthan (700 ppm) and guar (2500 ppm) solutions. A rheological study was performed to select target polymer concentration and solution viscosity. Indiana limestone and light mineral oil (viscosity of 6.55 ± 0.05 mPa · s at 60 °C) were used to represent the reservoir rock and oil. Guar flooding led to faster oil recovery, water production delay, and better injectivity than xanthan flooding, although the polymer utilization factor was higher. The ultimate oil recovery increased by 12.7 ± 7.0% and 9.0 ± 6.1% over waterflooding after guar and xanthan injections. The inferior performance of xanthan gum can be attributed to higher retention, especially close to the core inlet (residual resistance factor of 28 ± 4), and lower in-situ viscosity. The results suggest that guar may be a promising candidate for polymer flooding in carbonate reservoirs at moderate temperatures and salinities. In contrast, xanthan applications in these reservoirs must be carefully evaluated due to its high retention potential.</jats:p>",

To gain knowledge on the specific functions of gut microbes in this process it is a prerequisite to culture members of the core gut microbiota. Two different cultivation strategies were applied here for this purpose, a dilution-to-extinction cultivation and direct plating using six different media to culture aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. A total of 341 isolates were obtained by the dilution-to-extinction cultivation and 138 isolates by direct plating from guts of BSFL reared on chicken feed. Bacterial isolates were phylogenetically identified at the genus level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (phylotyping) and differentiated at the strain level by genomic fingerprinting (genotyping).

However, the complexity of the human intestinal microbiome and technical challenges in investigating it pose major challenges. In this proof-of-concept study, we rationally designed, assembled and experimentally tested a synthetic Diet-based Minimal Microbiome (Db-MM) consisting of ten core intestinal bacterial species that together are capable of efficiently converting dietary fibres into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Despite their genomic potential for metabolic competition, all ten bacteria coexisted during growth on a mixture of dietary fibres, including pectin, inulin, xylan, cellobiose and starch. By integrated analyses of metabolite production, community composition and metatranscriptomics-based gene expression data, we identified interspecies metabolic interactions leading to production of key SCFAs such as butyrate and propionate. While public goods, such as sugars liberated from colonic fibres, are harvested by non-degraders, some species thrive by cross-feeding on energetically challenging substrates, including the butyrogenic conversion of acetate and lactate. Using a reductionist approach in an in-vitro system combined with functional measurements, our study provides key insights into the complex interspecies metabolic interactions between core intestinal bacterial species.</jats:p>"

In this study, we focused on the synthesis and characterization of magnetic Ni1−xCoxFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with two layers of methionine and polyethylene glycol to increase the loading capacity and lower toxicity to serve as an efficient drug carrier. Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine@PEG NPs were synthesized by a reflux method then characterized by FTIR, XRD, FESEM, TEM, and VSM. Naproxen was used as a model drug and its loading and release in the vehicles were evaluated. The results for loading efficiency showed 1 mg of Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine@PEG NPs could load 0.51 mg of the naproxen. Interestingly, Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine@PEG showed a gradual release of the drug, achieving a time-release up to 5 days, and demonstrated that a pH 5 release of the drug was about 20% higher than Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine NPs, which could enhance the intracellular drug release following endocytosis. At pH 7.4, the release of the drug was slower than Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine NPs; demonstrating the potential to minimize the adverse effects of anticancer drugs on normal tissues. Moreover, naproxen loaded onto the Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine@PEG NPs for breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 showed more significant cell death than the free drug, which was measured by an MTT assay. When comparing both cancer cells, we demonstrated that naproxen loaded onto the Ni1−xCoxFe2O4@Methionine@PEG NPs exhibited greater cell death effects on the MCF-7 cells compared with the MDA-MB-231 cells. The results of the hemolysis test also showed good hemocompatibility. The results indicated that the prepared magnetic nanocarrier could be suitable for controlled anticancer drug delivery.</jats:p>"

A PSII monomeric core consists of 35 Chls a and no Chl b, thus allowing for a clear window to study Chl a Qx dynamics in a large pigment-protein complex. Initial excitation in the Qx band results in a transfer to the Qy band in less than 60 fs. Upon the ultrafast transfer, regardless of the excitation frequency within the Qx band, the quasi-transient absorption spectra are very similar. This observation indicates that Chl a’s Qx to Qy transfer is not frequency selective. Using a simple model, we determined that this is not due to the lifetime broadening of the ultrafast transfer but predominantly due to a lack of correlation between the PSII core complex’s Chl a Qx and Qy bands. We suggest the origin to be the intrinsic loss of correlation during the Qx to Qy internal conversion as observed in previous studies of molecular Chl a dissolved in solvents.</jats:p>",

The involved high cost when using sandwich composite structures has hindered applications in cost-sensitive markets up to now. However, full thermoplastic composite sandwich structures enable a cost reduction using novel processing routes based on fusion bonding of core and facesheet. In order to optimize such full thermoplastic composite sandwich structures and to ensure proper bonding of facesheet and core after manufacture, valid test methods for the quantification of skin-core interfacial bonding are required. This paper reviews existing test methods for the determination of Mode I dominant interfacial fracture toughness of sandwich structures.

Based on a definition of requirements for suitable test methods, their applicability for full thermoplastic composite sandwich structures is evaluated.

Drawing on World Systems Theory (WST) and a novel quasi‐experimental analysis of nationally representative household panel surveys across 20 countries, the study finds a much sharper increase in the likelihood of dropping out of paid work in semi‐periphery and periphery states relative to core states. We establish a causal link between such international disparities and the early trajectories of state interventions in the labor market. Further analysis demonstrates that within all three world systems delayed, less stringent interventions in the labor market were enabled by right‐wing populism but mitigated by the strength of active labor market policies and collective bargaining.</jats:p>",

In this study, we evaluated the rhizosphere microbiome of healthy and bacterial wilt-infected (diseased) flue-cured tobacco plants through amplification of V3-V4 and ITS1-5f variable regions of 16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA. The study was based on the location (Qujing, Shilin, and Wenshan), plant components (rhizosphere soil and roots), and sample types (healthy and diseased) to assess the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities. Bacterial and fungal communities present in roots primarily emanated from rhizosphere soil. Healthy flue-cured tobacco plants exhibit high microbial diversity compared to diseased plants. Among three variables, plant components significantly influence the diversity of microbial communities, whereas rhizosphere soil harbors higher microbial diversity than roots. Bacterial phyla Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were found in high relative abundance in roots and rhizosphere soil samples, respectively. As far as fungi is concerned, a high relative abundance of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota was found in both rhizosphere soil and root. Bacterial genera such as<jats:italic>Bacillus</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Bradyrhizobium</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Ensifer</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Neorhizobium</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>Lysobacter</jats:italic>related to plant growth promotion and disease suppressing abilities were dominant than fungal genera.

In conclusion,<jats:italic>R. solanacearum</jats:italic>significantly influences the microbial diversity of flue-cured tobacco plants and negatively affects the bacterial community composition. Altogether, our study demonstrates the complexity of bacterial and fungal communities that possibly interact with each other (microbe–microbe) and host (host–microbe). This cross-talk could be helpful for healthy flue-cured tobacco plant growth and to induce resistance against bacterial wilt disease.</jats:p>"

Due to the capability to harness the computing power of Graphics Processing Units, the GUARDYAN (GpU Assisted Reactor DYnamic ANalysis) code has been recently upscaled to perform pin-by-pin simulations of power plant scale systems as demonstrated in this paper. A recent rod drop experiment at a VVER-440/213 (vodo-vodyanoi enyergeticheskiy reaktor) type power plant at Paks NPP, Hungary, was considered and signals of ex-core detectors placed at three different positions were simulated successfully by GUARDYAN taking realistic fuel loading, including burn-up data into account. Results were also compared to the time-dependent Paks NPP in-house nodal diffusion code VERETINA (VERONA: VVER Online Analysis and RETINA: Reactor Thermo-hydraulics Interactive). Analysis is given of the temporal and spatial variance distribution of GUARDYAN fuel pin node-wise power estimates. We can conclude that full core, pin-wise DMC power plant simulations using realistic isotope concentrations are feasible in reasonable computing times down to 1–2% error of ex-core detector signals using current GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) High Performance Computing architectures, thereby demonstrating a technological breakthrough.</jats:p>"

Herein, two novel core‐shell electrodes LCCH‐S@PBAs and LCCH‐Se@PBAs are fabricated with a nonmetal (S or Se) bridging the core and shell. Electrochemical tests show that the as‐synthesized electrodes, especially LCCH‐S@PBAs, present higher mass‐specific capacitance with 10.1 C cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> at 1 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, which is much better than that of PBA‐based homologs.

The comparison with LCCH‐C@PBAs, in which the rGO is connected with core and shell by Van der Waals’ forces, also suggests the outstanding role of ionic bonds for electrochemical performance.

To ensure the objective is achieved, sequence stratigraphy interpretation has been done using integrating well log, core, and seismic data to identify the depositional environment. Distribution of coal helps to create well log correlation. Lithofacies and fluid have been interpreted according to core, test and log patterns, such as; gas sand, brine sand, shale, and coal. Based on the characteristic of logs, biostratigraphy and core data, five depositional environments have been interpreted in this study including in-distributary channel, delta plain (flood plain shale), crevasse splay, delta front shale (prodelta), and mouth bar. The interval of the target area is generally influenced by regression systems where on the lower formation is dominated by the transition depositional environment and changed to be dominant of delta plain.</jats:p>",

Results of the model calculations showed that Köhler curves of aerosol particles were different from classical Köhler curves of inorganic particles. Particle size, chemical composition and mass fraction of components all influence the curve shape, and the curve might show one or more extreme points of supersaturation. Critical supersaturation decreased when the mass fraction of the shell increased. This implied that the heterogeneous chemical reaction that happened to suspended particles in air could increase shell mass fraction and make particles more CCN active and hygroscopic. When the three models were compared, particles in model 3 were most CCN active, while those in model 2 were least CCN active.

The article presents a theoretical justification of the convergence criterion of a numerical diagram method for calculating the strength of reinforced concrete bendable elements. The resulting criterion coincides in form with the Chebyshev norm. It implies a criterion for stopping the iterative calculation process and an estimate of the error of the numerical diagram method. Using the example of a reinforced concrete element with a rectangular cross section and double reinforcement, the issue of convergence of iterative strength calculation with varying concrete class and percentage of reinforcement is investigated. It is established that for all the considered design variants, the iterative calculation process converges after the 6th iteration at the initial curvature approximation   and after the 4th iteration at  , with a relative calculation error of δ&lt;1 %. In addition, it is found that with an increase in the percentage of reinforcement, the convergence of the calculation improves: with the number of iterations equal to 4, the error in the design variant B60, µ = 0.5 % is 10.3 %, and with B35, µ = 3.0 %–0.98 %.</jats:p>",

Due to large influence of sulfate caused by volcanic eruptions in the first half of the nineteenth century, the averages of nss‐sulfur‐isotope composition (δ<jats:sup>34</jats:sup>S<jats:sub>nss</jats:sub>) and [SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>2−</jats:sup>]<jats:sub>nss</jats:sub> for the second half (+14.6‰ and 67.6 μg/L), calculated after excluding these prominent signals, were found to differ from those of the first half century (+9.1‰ and 84.1 μg/L).

The HATCN-doped CNT–TFTs exhibited p-type characteristics after exposure to a high-temperature environment of 200 °C, and prolonged heating did not degrade the p-doping performance of HATCN.

Community hospitals in non-metropolitan/rural areas play a crucial role in providing care to patients who desire and are able to receive care locally. However, rural community hospitals typically face challenges to providing comprehensive care due to lack of resources. The University of Kentucky's Markey Cancer Center Affiliate Network (MCCAN) is an effective complex, multi-level intervention, improving cancer care in rural/under-resourced hospitals by supporting them in achieving American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) standards.

It is hence necessary to analyze quantum transport in such nanostructures. Material properties such as a complex dispersion, topology, and charge carriers with multiple degrees of freedom, are appealing for novel device functionalities but complicate their theoretical description. Here, we study quantum tunnelling transport across a few-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot. We demonstrate how to uniquely identify single- and two-electron dot states’ orbital, spin, and valley composition from differential conductance in a finite magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the transport features manifest splittings in the dot’s spin and valley multiplets induced by interactions and magnetic field (the latter splittings being a consequence of bilayer graphene’s Berry curvature). Our results elucidate spin- and valley-dependent tunnelling mechanisms and will help to utilize bilayer graphene quantum dots, e.g., as spin and valley qubits.</jats:p>",

The fore- and aftershock activity was analyzed in an effort to understand the preparation and generation processes of earthquakes; these findings have already been published. The present paper focuses on the stress state in the source region of the mainshock. A 90-m-long borehole across the mainshock fault was drilled ~ 1.5 years after the mainshock and logged by an optical televiewer. The fault can be identified by severe damage to the borehole wall at the point where the borehole intersected the aftershock cluster. Except for a 10-m section in the hanging wall of the fault, borehole cores were fully recovered. Borehole breakout (BO) and core disking (CD) were found to occur. Two stress measurement techniques [Deformation Rate Analysis (DRA) and Diametrical Core Deformation Analysis (DCDA)] were applied to the borehole cores. By combining their results with occurrence criteria for BO and CD, the principal stress state in the source region of the mainshock was determined. The principal directions in the hanging wall of the fault were nearly identical to the virgin stress state, while it was significantly disturbed in the footwall. The vertical stresses were 106 MPa and 40 MPa in the hanging wall and footwall, respectively. The significant difference in the vertical stress between the two sides of the fault can be explained by the stress redistribution associated with a nonuniform slip on a nonplanar fault.</jats:p>",

Thorough spectroscopic characterization showed that oxygen atoms from hydroxyl groups, as well as from the surface, and the lattice of TiO2 was consumed. This caused changes in the surface and even in the bulk of TiO2 when the amount of reducing agent used was increased. Structural, optical, superficial, and textural characteristics were studied using XRD, Raman, DRS UV-Vis-NIR, Mid-DRIFT, XPS, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. A photocatalytic test of the degradation of methylene blue dye was performed. Among different effects on the mentioned characteristics, we found evidence of changes in the surface properties of the blue titania samples and their probable effect on the photocatalytic properties.

To measure this distribution, it is common to take microscopic images and determine manually the thicknesses at particular discrete points. We compare and provide several methods determining the thickness distribution from microscopic images. First, an interpolation scheme is chosen to obtain a continuous function of the interfaces between the layers instead of the discrete pixel data. Afterwards, the methods—ruled surface approach, orthogonal projection, embedded circle scheme, and a dull but simple method—are applied and compared with each other. For very smooth data, most of the schemes show equivalent results. However, the “brute force”—called the dull approach—turns out to be the most robust scheme, particularly, if noisy data is studied. The Gaussian error propagation concept is applied to study the uncertainties resulting from noisy pixel data. The schemes are adapted to finite element simulation results as well so that a direct comparison of experimental and numerical data would be possible.</jats:p>",

Evolutionary adaptation dictates a large variability in the type, number, arrangement, and absorption of the Chlorophylls (Chls) responsible for the early steps of light-harvesting and charge separation. For example, the specific location of long-wavelength Chls (referred to as red forms) in the cyanobacterial core has been intensively investigated, but the assignment of the chromophores involved is still controversial. The most red-shifted Chl a form has been observed in the trimer of the PSI core of the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis, with an absorption centered at ∼740 nm. Here, we apply two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to study photoexcitation dynamics in isolated trimers and monomers of the PSI core of S. platensis. By means of global analysis, we resolve and compare direct downhill and uphill excitation energy transfer (EET) processes between the bulk Chls and the red forms, observing significant differences between the monomer (lacking the most far red Chl form at 740 nm) and the trimer, with the ultrafast EET component accelerated by five times, from 500 to 100 fs, in the latter. Our findings highlight the complexity of EET dynamics occurring over a broad range of time constants and their sensitivity to energy distribution and arrangement of the cofactors involved. The comparison of monomeric and trimeric forms, differing both in the antenna dimension and in the extent of red forms, enables us to extract significant information regarding PSI functionality.</jats:p>",

In this work, the dynamics of free oscillatory deformation and breakup of a single-core compound droplet with an initial ellipsoidal shell was investigated numerically using the volume-of-fluid method. The effects of droplet diameter and the outer droplet initial deformation parameter are considered. Four outcomes are identified: oscillatory deformation, separation, separation breakup, and breakup. The evolution of the kinetic energy and pressure field of the compound droplet for the four typical outcomes is also analyzed in detail. A clear boundary exists between the first and the latter three outcomes (initial deformation parameters of 0.600–0.773), while the critical factor for the latter three outcomes is the inner and outer droplet diameter ratio. The oscillatory deformation is characterized by the inner and outer droplet undergoing a finite deformation and subsequent oscillatory behavior, with the maximum deformation of the inner and outer droplets being related to the energy transfer between the two, and the outer droplet being a periodic decaying oscillation, while the inner droplet is a large deformation oscillation interspersed with a small deformation oscillation. Separation, separation breakup, and breakup are characterized by breakup at the inner or outer interface during deformation; separation and breakup times are largely dependent on droplet diameter and the initial deformation parameter of the outer droplet; and the neck width at separation is also analyzed in detail.</jats:p>",

Herein, for the first time, concave‐nanocubic (CNC) nickel–platinum (Ni–Pt) alloys bounded by high‐index facets (HIFs) are introduced as the core catalyst of sulfur for Li–S batteries. It is demonstrated that the CNC Ni–Pt alloy crystallites dispersed uniformly on graphene exhibit a high electrochemical activity to drive the conversion from intermediate lithium polysulfides to solid discharged products.

The thermal conductivity of core materials is a significant parameter of the dynamo. The lunar core composition is thought to be iron or iron‐alloyed with some light elements (e.g., S, P, Si, and C), but its transport properties remain uncertain. We measured the electrical resistivity of iron and Fe‐3 wt%P alloys at 5 GPa and high temperatures. Apart from the quasi four‐point technique, the four‐probe van der Pauw technique was also employed to measure the resistivity of pure iron. Adding ∼3 wt% phosphorus to iron slightly increases the resistivity at 5 GPa and 1000–1500 K due to the impurity effect. The resistivity of Fe‐3 wt%P alloys increases at the onset of melting. Via the Wiedemann‐Franz law, the thermal conductivity at the lunar core‐mantle boundary (CMB) is estimated to be 28.6–34.2 Wm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for a light‐element free core and 31.5 ± 1.9 Wm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for a phosphorus‐bearing (∼3 wt% P) core. Therefore, small amounts of phosphorus in the lunar core slightly impact its thermal conductivity. The estimated conductive heat flow across the lunar CMB varies from 4.5 to 5.7 GW, and the adiabatic heat flux varies from 3.3 to 4.2 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, depending on the core's composition (Fe or Fe‐3 wt%P).

Multiple studies showed that high levels of HBV DNA and Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) are associated with higher HCC risk in CHB patients. Patients treated with antiviral therapy may have undetectable or low levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg loss. However, HCC may develop in some patients with low‐level HBV DNA and HBsAg seroconversion. In this study, we evaluated the role of HBcrAg in predicting HBV related HCC development. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using keywords (hepatitis B core‐related antigen, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver neoplasm, hepatocellular and hepatic cancer, to identify studies assessing serum level of HBcrAg in patients with CHB and HCC. The search resulted in 184 studies. Seven studies were included: Four of which were retrospective cohort studies, and the rest were prospective cohort, case controls. Six of them reported a higher HBcrAg positivity rate in the HCC group when compared with the HBV DNA assay, yet with similar hazard ratio (HR) in predicting the incidence of HCC. However, four studies found that HBcrAg positivity was an independent risk factor for HCC development with a HR ranging from 3.27 to 7.05. HBV‐related HCC has many proposed biomarkers in its prediction, yet our findings revealed HBcrAg to may have superiority over other biomarkers. High quality studies with bigger sample size research is needed to understand the potential role of HBcrAg in CHB induced HCC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since gas hydrates are unconventional reservoirs, they pose unique challenges for identification, characterization, quantification, and extraction. The conventional approach—elastic logs—can provide a better method for identification through attribute analysis. On the other hand, geomechanical studies for wellbore stability analysis pave the way for the effective exploitation of gas hydrates. It is crucial to predict elastic logs against gas-hydrate-bearing sediments, which requires an effective rock physics model.  In the present work, a study pertaining to the National Gas Hydrate Program-02 (NGHP-02) campaign in the Krishna‐Godavari (KG) Offshore Basin, India, where gas hydrates are deposited primarily in two facies—a shale-dominated shallower one and a sand-dominated deeper one that has been identified by responses of conventional and spectroscopy logs—is discussed. It is commonly known that depositional heterogeneity impacts petrophysical and elastic properties. To address this issue, an innovative approach has been adopted to model compressional and shear log data using rock physics modeling of gas hydrate reservoirs based on the depositional type of gas hydrate. Guidance from the change of compressional velocity data from log and core with an increase of gas hydrate saturation shows gas hydrate deposition in the study area can be explained through a matrix/grain-supported model. The Jason grain-supported rock physics model appeared best suited among different available rock physics models, depending on the clay volume and porosity in our study area. Using input from a robust multimineral petrophysical evaluation and rock physics modeling, the finalized model is propagated to test wells for predicting compressional, shear, and density logs, with the predicted data validated by core-measured compressional and shear data. Model consistency is indicated by a high correlation from multiwell crossplots of modeled and recorded elastic logs (compressional and shear velocity) with acoustic impedance. The developed rock physics model better discriminates gas hydrate in the shaly sand layer and gas hydrate in the sand-dominated layer, calcite, and shale in the VpVs domain.</jats:p>",

Drug repurposing and development of new molecules targeting numerous viral targets have already led to promising drug candidates. To this end, versatile molecular scaffolds with high functionalization capabilities play a key role. Starting with the clinically used conformationally flexible HIV-1 protease inhibitors that inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and bind major protease 3CLpro, we designed and synthesized a series of rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octenes fused to N-substituted succinimides to test whether this core scaffold could support the development of non-covalent 3CLpro inhibitors. Inhibition assays confirmed that some compounds can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease; the most promising compound 11a inhibited 3CLpro in micromolar range (IC50 = 102.2 μM). Molecular simulations of the target-ligand complex in conjunction with dynophore analyses and endpoint free energy calculations provide additional insight and first recommendations for future optimization. The fused bicyclo[2.2.2]octenes can be used as a new potential starting point in the development of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protease inhibitors and the study also substantiates the potential of this versatile scaffold for the development of biologically active molecules.</jats:p>"

RVF affects sheep, goats, cattle and camels, causing a high rate of abortions and death of newborn lambs. Also, humans can be infected, developing a usually self-limiting disease that can turn into a more severe illness in a low percentage of cases. Although different veterinary vaccines are available in endemic areas in Africa, to date no human vaccine has been licensed. In previous works, we described the selection and characterization of a favipiravir-mutagenized RVFV variant, termed 40Fp8, with potential as a RVF vaccine candidate due to the strong attenuation shown in immunocompromised animal models. Compared to the parental South African 56/74 viral strain, 40Fp8 displayed 7 amino acid substitutions in the L-protein, three of them located in the central region corresponding to the catalytic core of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this work, by means of a reverse genetics system, we have analyzed the effect on virulence of these amino acid changes, alone or combined, both <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. We found that the simultaneous introduction of two changes (G924S and A1303T) in the heterologous ZH548-RVFV Egyptian strain conferred attenuated phenotypes to the rescued viruses as shown in infected mice without affecting virus immunogenicity. Our results suggest that both changes induce resistance to favipiravir likely associated to some fitness cost that could be the basis for the observed attenuation <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. Conversely, the third change, I1050V, appears to be a compensatory mutation increasing viral fitness. Altogether, these results provide relevant information for the safety improvement of novel live attenuated RVFV vaccines.</jats:p>"

Due to the topographic locking of the Jet near the edge of the Andes cordillera at Santa Cruz, this experiment allows an assessment of the extension of the spatial impact of InSAR data assimilation in varying circulation conditions. That data improves the model skill at varying locations thousands of kilometers downstream, in both the distribution of water vapor assessed at a large number of well‐distributed GNSS observations and precipitation assessed against the Global Precipitation dataset and ERA5 reanalysis. Gains in the precipitation forecast skill are found to have a larger impact on the forecast of light rain, and lead to an almost cancellation of forecasts of no rain in cases with moderate to heavy rain. Because the distribution of water vapor is a main driver of weather, and InSAR is one of the few sources of data that can look down to mesoscale resolution regardless of daytime or weather, it is suggested that it may have a significant positive impact on short‐range weather forecasting and, maybe more importantly, on the quality of the climate of the forecast model.</jats:p>",

The aim of the study was to identify genetic aetiology in 10 subjects with CPHD from four consanguineous Sudanese families. Medical history, as well as hormonal and radiological information, was obtained from participants’ medical records. Targeted genetic analysis of the POU1F1 gene was performed in two pedigrees with a typical combination of pituitary deficiencies, using Sanger sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing was performed in the other two pedigrees, where hypocortisolism and additional neurologic phenotypes were also initially diagnosed. In POU1F1 gene (NM_001122757.2) a novel homozygous splice-site deletion—namely, c.744-5_749del—was identified in all 10 tested affected family members as a cause of CPHD. Apart from typical pituitary hormonal deficiencies, most patients had delayed but spontaneous puberty; however, one female had precocious puberty. Severe post-meningitis neurologic impairment was observed in three patients, of whom two siblings had Dyke–Davidoff–Masson syndrome, and an additional distantly related patient suffered from cerebral infarction. Our report adds to the previously reported POU1F1 gene variants causing CPHD and emphasises the importance of genetic testing in countries with high rates of consanguineous marriage such as Sudan. Genetic diagnostics elucidated that the aetiologies of hypopituitarism and brain abnormalities, identified in a subset of affected members, were separate. Additionally, as central hypocortisolism is not characteristic of POU1F1 deficiency, hydrocortisone replacement therapy could be discontinued. Elucidation of a genetic cause, therefore, contributed to the more rational clinical management of hypopituitarism in affected family members.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapidly-developed high-power mid-infrared 2-5 µm laser technology requires a compact, flexible low-loss glass fiber for power delivery or laser generation. With the broadest bandwidth of low-loss transmission window in mid-infrared region amongst all mid-infrared glass fibers, chalcogenide glass fiber is the best candidate covering the whole 2-5 µm range. Multi-hundred-watt high-power delivery for 5.4-µm CO laser was previously demonstrated in a multimode chalcogenide fiber with a 1-mm-diameter large core, at the cost of giving up one of the most desirable fiber advantages, the flexibility. Indeed, chalcogenide glass fibers with decent flexibility have never exhibited hundred-watt-level power transmitting capability in the 2-5 µm range. In this paper, we have experimentally demonstrated 100-watt-level power transmission in multimode As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> chalcogenide fibers, using a customized high-power 2-µm thulium doped silica fiber laser source. With effective forced cooling, the multimode As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> fiber with 200 µm core diameter can resist incident laser power of 120 W and deliver transmitted power of 63 W. Nano-sized scattering center related laser damage mechanism and the cylindrical heat transfer model have been proposed to explain the high-power damage process of chalcogenide glass fibers. The calculation is in good agreement with the experiments. It is promising to further enhance the transmitted power above 100 W in flexible chalcogenide glass large-core fibers.</jats:p>",

The proposed physical treatment was successfully conducted by undergoing two stages of carbonization and activation treatment to improve the pore development structure of the material. The carbonized kenaf core (CKC) was prepared by carbonizing the raw kenaf core (RKC) at 800°C with constant nitrogen flow for 5 hours. Activation process took placed by impregnating KOH in the furnace with alternately switching to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> up to 800C for 2 hours. The morphological and structural characterization studies were conducted using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> adsorption process was carried in the gravimetric analyzer by varying the effect of bed pressure and gas flowrate. This study revealed that the AKC has the highest CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> adsorption capacity of 1.70 mmol/g (1 bar) and 2.85 mmol/g (30 bar). Based on the morphology, AKC demonstrated better small micropore development that helps in providing a larger adsorption site; hence attributes to the higher CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> adsorption capacity. This study contributes to the development of knowledge on enhancing the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> adsorption on the physically-modified kenaf core material that would be used as an alternative material for CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> adsorbent.</jats:p>",

The characteristics of the arc root determine the magnitude of the electromagnetic force received by the arc during the movement stage as well as the shape and speed of the arc movement. It will eventually affect the temperature of the contact surface and the ablation situation. This paper studied the arc root characteristics of high-current constricted vacuum arcs between the iron-core cup-shaped transverse magnetic field contacts and put forward the idea of using the ratio of cathode and anode arc root areas to quantitatively analyze the concentration of vacuum arc. The research on the arc root characteristics of the vacuum arc can help to improve the arc characteristics and arcing mechanism, and the proposition of the ratio can provide a new method for the study of constricted arc. This can provide a basis for improving the arc extinction performance of the switch, reducing the ablation of the contact material, and improving the contact life.</jats:p>",

Therefore, RSEs, such as Mo, U, and V, are extensively used to indicate redox states in marine environments. To retrieve the historical redox state in the hypoxic zone near the Changjiang River Estuary and its adjacent waters, the distribution and enrichment degree of Mo, U, and V in a sediment core collected from the recurrently hypoxic region were investigated. The correlation analysis shows that the authigenic enrichment of Mo and U in sediment core 3,050–2 is primarily controlled by redox conditions, rather than sediment grain size, adsorption on organic matters, Fe–Mn (hydr)oxides, and terrigenous detritus input. Mo-U covariation is selected to analyze the evolution of redox conditions in the seasonally hypoxic zone. The Mo<jats:sub>EF</jats:sub>/U<jats:sub>EF</jats:sub> values in this sediment core are almost between 0.1 and 0.3×Mo/U<jats:sub>modern seawater</jats:sub> value and show a general decreasing trend with depth, indicating an overall progressive transition from oxic to suboxic conditions in this area since 2005.

Blood samples were collected pre- and post-exercise to determine plasma IgM, IgA, and IgG concentrations. Overall resting pre-exercise levels for plasma Ig were 173MMU/ml, 37AMU/ml, and 79GMU/ml, respectively. Plasma IgM concentration did not substantially change pre- to post-exercise in all protocols, and the magnitude of pre- to post-exercise change for IgM was not different between protocols (p=0.135). Plasma IgA and IgG increased pre- to post-exercise in P2 only (p=0.017 and p=0.016, respectively), but remained within normative range (35–250MU/ml). P2 resulted in greater disturbances to plasma IgA (p=0.058) and IgG (p=0.037), compared with P1 and P3. No substantial differences in pre-exercise and exercise-associated change was observed for EndoCAb between biological sexes. Exertional and exertional-heat stress resulted in modest disturbances to systemic EndoCAb responses, suggesting EndoCAb biomarkers presents a low sensitivity response to controlled-laboratory experimental designs within exercise gastroenterology.</jats:p>",

Services include access to raw seismic waveforms of thousands of stations together with relevant station and data quality information, parametric earthquake information of recent and historical earthquakes together with advanced event-specific products like moment tensors or source models and further ancillary services, and comprehensive seismic hazard and risk information, covering latest European scale models and their underlying data. The services continue to be available on the well-established domain-specific platforms and websites, and are also consecutively integrated with the interoperable central EPOS data infrastructure. EPOS Seismology and its participating organizations provide a consistent framework for the future development of these services and their operation as EPOS services, closely coordinated also with other international seismological initiatives, and is well set to represent the European seismological research infrastructures and their stakeholders within EPOS.</jats:p>",

The possibility of the growth of high central density in low-mass haloes, accelerated if haloes are subhaloes of larger systems, has intriguing consequences for small-halo searches with substructure lensing. However, following the evolution of ${\\lesssim}10^8 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ subhaloes in lens-mass systems (${\\sim}10^{13}\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) is computationally expensive with traditional N-body simulations. In this work, we develop a new hybrid semi-analytical + N-body method to study the evolution of SIDM subhaloes with high fidelity, from core formation to core-collapse, in staged simulations. Our method works best for small subhaloes (≲1/1000 host mass), for which the error caused by dynamical friction is minimal. We are able to capture the evaporation of subhalo particles by interactions with host halo particles, an effect that has not yet been fully explored in the context of subhalo core-collapse. We find three main processes drive subhalo evolution: subhalo internal heat outflow, host-subhalo evaporation, and tidal effects. The subhalo central density grows only when the heat outflow outweighs the energy gain from evaporation and tidal heating. Thus, evaporation delays or even disrupts subhalo core-collapse. We map out the parameter space for subhaloes to core-collapse, finding that it is nearly impossible to drive core-collapse in subhaloes in SIDM models with constant cross-sections. Any discovery of ultracompact dark substructures with future substructure lensing observations favours additional degrees of freedom, such as velocity-dependence, in the cross-section.</jats:p>",

Functional recovery from the monosynaptic CSP lesion can be achieved through the remaining multisynaptic CSP toward the forelimb segments. In the present study, we applied retrograde transsynaptic labeling with rabies virus to a monkey model of spinal cord injury. By injecting the virus into the spinal forelimb segments immediately after the monosynaptic CSP lesion, we showed that the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), especially its caudal and bank region (so-called “new” M1), was the principal origin of the CSP linking the motor cortex to the spinal forelimb segments disynaptically (disynaptic CSP). This forms a striking contrast to the architecture of the monosynaptic CSP that involves extensively other motor-related areas, together with M1. Next, the rabies injections were made at the recovery period of 3 months after the monosynaptic CSP lesion. The second-order labeled neurons were located in the ipsilateral as well as in the contralateral “new” M1. This indicates that the disynaptic CSP input from the ipsilateral “new” M1 is recruited during the motor recovery from the monosynaptic CSP lesion. Our results suggest that the disynaptic CSP is reorganized to connect the ipsilateral “new” M1 to the forelimb motoneurons for functional compensation after the monosynaptic CSP lesion.</jats:p>"

The adsorbents characterization was obtained by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and determination of the specific area and the point of zero charge (pHpzc). The best conditions for adsorption for this adsorbent was reached through adsorbent mass studies and kinetic and equilibrium assays.

Considering the kinetic aspects, the pseudo-first order model adjusted more satisfactorily to experimental data. Related to isotherms, Langmuir was more efficient to represent experimental data of dye adsorption. ACB, CAB and ACP are potential adsorbents for dyes in effluents, presenting maximum adsorption capacity, in the study conditions, of 52.35 mg.g-1, 16.40 mg.g-1, and 119.00 mg.g-1, respectively.</jats:p>"

Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G‐protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane‐associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single‐ and dual‐immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ‐aminobutyric acid‐ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</jats:p>",

The LCE was intensively sampled using four gliders during 12 months. The LCE is characterized by a strong anomaly of fresh and warm water in the center and strong strain at the periphery. Mixed layers prone to overturning instabilities are diagnosed from the gradients of buoyancy. In the GoM, the reduction of potential vorticity (PV) in the mixed layer is driven by surface cooling by year‐round persistent negative turbulent heat fluxes, eventually reaching −700 W m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> during extreme winter wind events. Lateral buoyancy gradients associated with submesoscale filaments and fronts at the periphery of the LCE enhance the frictional torque supplied by the wind stress when aligned with the geostrophic jet current. Negative PV in the mixed layer occurs simultaneously with negative turbulent heat fluxes and events of Ekman buoyancy fluxes that reduce the stratification. These regions are susceptible to mixed‐layer gravitational‐symmetric instability preferentially in winter. Extreme Ekman equivalent heat flux (≤−10,000 W m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) associated with wind stress of 1.2 N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> coincides with the development of inertial‐symmetric instability across anticyclonic vorticity. These observations might have several implications for the restratification processes, kinetic energy budget, and biogeochemical cycles inside LCEs and can contribute to the formation of low‐PV waters that could feed mode water formation inside the GoM.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a novel process was adopted to develop composite scaffolds with a core-shell structure for bone tissue regeneration, in which the core has the main function of temporary mechanical support, and the shell enhances biocompatibility and provides bioactive properties. An interconnected porous core was safely obtained, avoiding solvents or other chemical issues, by blending poly(lactic acid), poly(ε-caprolactone) and leachable superabsorbent polymer particles. After particle leaching in water, the core was grafted with a gelatin/chitosan hydrogel shell to create a cell-friendly bioactive environment within its pores. The physicochemical, morphological, and mechanical characterization of the hybrid structure and of its component materials was carried out by means of infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and mechanical testing under different loading conditions. These hybrid polymer devices were found to closely mimic both the morphology and the stiffness of bones. In addition, in vitro studies showed that the core-shell scaffolds are efficiently seeded by human mesenchymal stromal cells, which remain viable, proliferate, and are capable of differentiating towards the osteogenic phenotype if adequately stimulated.</jats:p>"

Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) testing is increasingly demanded from lung biopsies. GenCut is a novel blunt tool that can be used to obtain core biopsies. This case series explores prospective performance of the GenCut core biopsy with R‐EBUS. Once Peripheral Pulmonary Lesion was located, GenCut biopsy was performed followed by conventional (forceps ± cytology brush) R‐EBUS biopsies. The overall diagnostic yield for the 16 patients with a mean peripheral pulmonary lesion (PPL) size of 4.1 cm was 100% from multi‐modal R‐EBUS sampling. The diagnostic yield for GenCut tool alone was 13/16 (81.2%) and the ability to perform PD‐L1 from GenCut was 10/16 (62.5%). There were no adverse events recorded. GenCut tool is a novel blunt instrument that can be used safely to obtain a core biopsy suitable for PD‐L1 in combination with R‐EBUS without compromising the high safety profile.</jats:p>",

The thermal equation of state of the Fe‐1.5wt.%C alloy provided here shows that Fe‐1.5wt.%C is ∼1.65% denser than the inner core under conditions relevant to the inner‐core boundary. This study indicates that iron alloyed with an upper bound of ∼2.2 (0.3) wt.% (∼10.7 [1.6] at.%) carbon may match with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) in the Earth’s inner core.

Ice cores offer key evidence to resolve this controversy, but attempts have been hampered by a lack of multivolcanic event synchronization between records. In this study, Antarctic and Greenland ice-core records are synchronized using a double bipolar sulfate marker, and calendar dates are assigned to each eruption revealed within the ‘Thera period’. From this global-scale sequence of volcanic sulfate loading, we derive indications toward each eruption’s latitude and potential to disrupt the climate system. Ultrafine sampling for sulfur isotopes and tephra conclusively demonstrate a colossal eruption of Alaska’s Aniakchak II as the source of stratospheric sulfate in the now precisely dated 1628 BCE ice layer. These findings end decades of speculation that Thera was responsible for the 1628 BCE event, and place Aniakchak II (52 ± 17 Tg S) and an unknown volcano at 1654 BCE (50 ± 13 Tg S) as two of the largest Northern Hemisphere sulfur injections in the last 4,000 years. This opens possibilities to explore widespread climatic impacts for contemporary societies and, in pinpointing Aniakchak II, confirms that stratospheric sulfate can be globally distributed from eruptions outside the tropics. Dating options for Thera are reduced to a series of precisely dated, constrained stratospheric sulfur injection events at 1611 BCE, 1561/1558/1555BCE, and c.1538 BCE, which are all below 14 ± 5 Tg S, indicating a climatic forcing potential for Thera well below that of Tambora (1815 CE).</jats:p>",

In our previous work, the fabrication of electrospun cellulose-acetate (CA)/chitosan (CS) adsorbents for humic-acid (HA) removal guided by the intermolecular interaction mechanism was demonstrated. Herein, a core-sheath structure was designed via one-step co-axial electrospinning, where a mixture of CS and CA was employed as the sheath layer to efficiently adsorb HA, and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) derived from waste cotton fabrics were incorporated into the CA core as load-bearing components. Compared to the non-layered electrospun CS/CA fibers, all the CS/CA–CNC fibers with a core-sheath structure exhibited smaller diameters, greater homogeneity, and significantly improved mechanical strength. Meanwhile, their maximum adsorption capacities towards HA had no significant differences. Even after the complete hydrolysis of CA into cellulose, the electrospun fibers maintained the fibrous structures and showed a higher tensile strength while exhibiting an acceptable adsorption capacity towards HA. Therefore, this work demonstrates the importance of rational design in the efficient preparation of functional materials and the feasibility of using electrospun core-sheath fibers derived from biomass wastes for the removal of water contaminants.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on qualitative job insecurity (QJI) and its spillover effects to the family domain. Despite a positive association between QJI and work-to-family conflict revealed in the literature, research on why and when QJI is related to work-to-family conflict is limited. Drawing from Conservation of Resources theory, this paper empirically examines the mediating role of negative affective process underlying the relationship between QJI and work-to-family conflict as well as the moderating role of core self-evaluations in this process. A four-wave survey study was conducted in a sample of 126 Chinese employees. The results showed that psychological contract violation and job dissatisfaction mediated the relationship between QJI and work-to-family conflict. Unexpectedly, core self-evaluations were found to strengthen (not attenuate) the positive relationships of QJI with employee psychological contract violation and job dissatisfaction. </jats:p>",

The dynamics of the W accumulation process of a hybrid discharge are examined considering the concurrent evolution of the background plasma parameters. It is found that the toroidal rotation and density peaking of the bulk plasma are usually large in the central region, which is particularly prone to the W accumulation. A time slice during the W accumulation phase is modeled, accounting for both neoclassical and turbulent transport components of W, through NEO with poloidal asymmetry effects induced by toroidal rotation, and TGLF, respectively. This modeling reproduces the experimental observations of W accumulation and identifies the neoclassical inward convection/pinch velocity of W due to the large density peaking of the bulk plasma and toroidal rotation in the central region as one of the main reasons for the W accumulation. In addition, the NEO + TGLF + STRAHL modeling can not only predict the core W density profile but also closely reconstruct the radiated information mainly produced by W in the experiment.</jats:p>",

Significant Raman signal enhancement of the model analyte, 4-MBA, was observed. This enhancement demonstrates the functionality of MAuNPs in direct detection of trace contaminants. The magnetic deposition rate of MAuNPs in chloroform and water was explored. The presence of 4-MBA slowed the mass deposition rate, and it was postulated that the rate disparity originated from differing NP-substrate surface interactions.

Since the size of Earth is potentially larger than that of UPB; with diameter &gt;690 km), resulting in higher temperatures at the core‐mantle boundary of Earth, it can be predicted that the terrestrial core formation may not directly cause Ni stable isotope fractionation. On the other hand, we also report high‐precision Cr stable isotope composition of ureilites, including one ureilitic trachyandesite (ALM‐A) that is enriched in lighter Cr stable isotopes relative to the main‐group ureilites, which suggests that the partial melting occurred on UPB.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The function of the pulmonary circulation is truly multi-scale, with blood transported through vessels from centimeter to micron scale. There are scale-dependent mechanisms that govern the flow in the pulmonary vascular system. However, very few computational models of pulmonary hemodynamics capture the physics of pulmonary perfusion across the spatial scales of functional importance in the lung. Here we present a multi-scale model that incorporates the 3-dimensional (3D) complexities of pulmonary blood flow in the major vessels, coupled to an anatomically-based vascular network model incorporating the multiple contributing factors to capillary perfusion, including gravity. Using the model we demonstrate how we can predict the impact of vascular remodeling and occlusion on both macro-scale functional drivers (flow distribution between lungs, and wall shear stress) and micro-scale contributors to gas exchange. The model predicts interactions between 3D and 1D models that lead to a redistribution of blood between postures, both on a macro- and a micro-scale. This allows us to estimate the effect of posture on left and right pulmonary artery wall shear stress, with predictions varying by 0.75–1.35 dyne/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> between postures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types including ciliated airway epithelial cells and macrophages. T2Rs in these two innate immune cell types are activated by bitter products, including those secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to Ca2+-dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). NO enhances mucociliary clearance and has direct antibacterial effects in ciliated epithelial cells. NO also increases phagocytosis by macrophages. Using biochemistry and live-cell imaging, we explored the role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in regulating T2R-dependent NO pathways in primary sinonasal epithelial cells, primary monocyte-derived macrophages, and a human bronchiolar cell line (H441). Immunofluorescence showed that H441 cells express eNOS and T2Rs and that the bitter agonist denatonium benzoate activates NO production in a Ca2+- and HSP90-dependent manner in cells grown either as submerged cultures or at the air–liquid interface. In primary sinonasal epithelial cells, we determined that HSP90 inhibition reduces T2R-stimulated NO production and ciliary beating, which likely limits pathogen clearance. In primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we found that HSP-90 is integral to T2R-stimulated NO production and phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Escherichia coli and pHrodo-Staphylococcus aureus. Our study demonstrates that HSP90 serves as an innate immune modulator by regulating NO production downstream of T2R signaling by augmenting eNOS activation without impairing upstream Ca2+ signaling. These findings suggest that HSP90 plays an important role in airway antibacterial innate immunity and may be an important target in airway diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, or cystic fibrosis.</jats:p>"

Modeling analysis was conducted from quantum theory. Experimental results show that the bending sensitivity of the grating can reach 21.85 dB/m−1, which is larger than the reported sensitivity of similar sensors. In the high temperature range from room temperature to 1000 °C, the temperature sensitivity was 14.1 pm/°C. The doped grating sensor can achieve high temperature measurement without annealing, and it has a distinguished linear response from low temperature to high temperature. The bending resolution can reach 0.0004 m−1, and the temperature resolution can reach 0.007 °C. Two-parameter decoupling measurement can be realized according to the distinctive characteristic trends of the spectrum.

Many works in the literature have built complex networks in software, usually called software networks, to represent software structure. Such software networks and their related graph algorithms have been proved effective in predicting software bugs. However, the software networks used were unweighted and undirected, neglecting the strength and direction of the couplings. Worse still, they ignored many important types of couplings between classes, such as local variable, instantiates, and access. All of these greatly affect the accuracy of the software network in representing the topological detail of software projects and ultimately affect the metrics derived from it. In this work, an improved effort-aware bug prediction approach named CoreBug is proposed. First, CoreBug uses a weighted directed class dependency network (WDCDN) to precisely describe classes and their couplings, including nine coupling types and their different coupling strengths and directions. Second, a generalized k-core decomposition is introduced to compute the coreness of each class in the WDCDN. Third, CoreBug combines the coreness of each class with its relative risk, as returned by the logistic regression, to quantify the risk of a given class being buggy. Empirical results on eighteen Java projects show that CoreBug is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches according to the average ranking of the Friedman test.</jats:p>"

Nucleus accumbens core functions show sex differences and are sensitive to the presence of hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) in normal and pathological contexts. The primary neuron type of the nucleus accumbens core, the medium spiny neuron (MSN), exhibits sex differences in both intrinsic excitability and glutamatergic excitatory synapse electrophysiological properties. Here, we provide a review of recent literature showing how estradiol modulates rat nucleus accumbens core MSN electrophysiology within the context of the estrous cycle. We review the changes in MSN electrophysiological properties across the estrous cycle and how these changes can be mimicked in response to exogenous estradiol exposure. We discuss in detail recent findings regarding how acute estradiol exposure rapidly modulates excitatory synapse properties in nucleus accumbens core but not caudate‐putamen MSNs, which mirror the natural changes seen across estrous cycle phases. These recent insights demonstrate the strong impact of sex‐specific estradiol action upon nucleus accumbens core neuron electrophysiology.</jats:p>",

A performance factor combining performance parameters, including the maximum induced electric field, stimulation depth, focus, and heat loss, is utilized to evaluate the comprehensive coil performance. <jats:italic>Main results.</jats:italic> According to the performance factor, both iron core coils obtain the best overall performance with a fill factor 0.4 and the two legs of the iron core close to the inner sides of the coil. Finally, three prototypes are constructed—the basic, optimized, and full-size slinky iron core coil—and magnetic field detection demonstrates a good agreement with the simulation results. <jats:italic>Significance.</jats:italic> The proposed systematic optimization approach for iron core coil based on Fo8 and slinky basic structure can be applied to improve TMS coil performance, reduce power requirements, and guide the design of other iron core TMS coils.</jats:p>",

The cores cover the whole the South Gharib Formation (upper Miocene). The stratigraphic succession of the Gulf of Suez includes three mega units, recorded from old to young as pre-rift, syn-rift, and post-rift sediments. The syn-rift sediments from old to young are Nukhul, Rudies, Kareem, Belayim Equivalent, South Gharib, and Zeit. The core samples reveal that South Gharib Formation is not a good reservoir. It consists of sulphate-rich beds with few carbonates intercalation, laminated dolomitic limestone and marly limestone. Patchy oil staining is detected in the thin streaks and basal laminated dolomitic limestone. The microfacies are found to be evaporites, carbonates, calcareous marl, and calcareous claystone. Evaporites microfacies are considered the most frequent microfacies. Gypsum and anhydrite are generally represented by nearly equal distribution with parallel variation in content. The core samples differentiated South Gharib Formation into seven zones of depositional environment; they are arranged from base to top as shallow sub-tidal, shallow lagoonal, intertidal, shallow lagoonal, intertidal, shallow lagoonal, and supra-tidal Sabkha cycles. Some samples from South Gharib Formation were measured electrically. We will try to highlight interrelations between electrical (conductivity, permittivity, and impedance) and petrophysical properties with petrography and mineral composition. Electrical properties were measured with a frequency range from 10 Hz to 100 kHz. The dielectric constant decreases with increasing frequency and increases with increasing conductor content (up to percolation threshold). The conductivity increases with the increase in conductor content and with increasing frequency. Many parameters can combine to affect electrical properties. The present research is a trial to relate the surface to subsurface measurements.</jats:p>",

By gaining new knowledge, skills, and values through entering clinical practice, clinical pharmacists should be equipped with certain competencies to meet the expectations of the SSCP clinical pharmacy definition. In 2019, the SSCP established an expert writing task force of clinical pharmacy specialists representing different private and governmental sectors to lead and write a series of position statements relating to clinical pharmacy within SA. This position statement seek to identify the core competencies of clinical pharmacists in SA.

The optical force is split into conservative and nonconservative components, and these components are explicitly calculated for particles in the Rayleigh, Mie and geometrical optics regimes. The results indicate that optical trapping is attributable to the formation of an ‘optical trapping core’. Stable trapping is achieved when the conservative forces are larger than the nonconservative forces in the core region centered at the beam centers for all particle sizes. According to the conventional understanding, stability is a result of the conservative force overcoming the nonconservative force. In comparison, the concept of the optical trapping core more accurately illustrates the physical mechanism of optical trapping, for not only single-beam optical tweezers but also optical trapping settings.</jats:p>",

After approval by the local ethics committee we studied 100 adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. Before induction of anesthesia the TTP sensor unit was attached to the skin above the temporal artery. After induction of anesthesia an esophageal temperature probe was placed in the distal esophagus. Recordings started 10 min after placement of the esophageal temperature probe to allow adequate warming of the probes. Pairs of temperature values were documented in five-minute intervals until emergence of anesthesia. Accuracy of the two methods was assessed by Bland-Altman comparisons of differences with multiple measurements. Core temperatures obtained with the TTP in adults showed a mean bias of -0.04 °C with 95% limits of agreement within − 0.99 °C to + 0.91 °C compared to an esophageal temperature probe.

In the NGT, a numerical rating scale was selected as the optimal approach to symptom monitoring.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Recognition of a range of HF-specific and general symptoms, alongside comorbidities, is an important consideration for admission prevention.

Moreover, disintermediation and decentralization have broken new ground for platform organizations and management mechanisms and instigated the concept of a DAO (<jats:italic>Decentralized Autonomous Organization</jats:italic>). Recent literature on operations management has called for further research on governance issues related to DAOs. In response to this call, we explore the relationship between DAO management efforts and platform performance in this study. Specifically, we propose and theoretically articulate decentralized voting tasks in DAOs as a new form of organizing. Harnessing both online and on‐chain data from seven sources, we empirically examine how voting task division, task allocation, reward distribution, and information provision affect platform performance in the context of MakerDAO (an Ethereum‐based stablecoin issuance platform). Our findings reveal that strategic decisions arrived at through voting have a positive impact on platform operational performance under certain conditions, whereas operational decisions resulting from voting have a negative impact. Moreover, we elucidate the moderating effects of voting task execution characteristics on the relationship between completed decision tasks and operational performance. These findings have important implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We also share all the raw data we use to promote the development of blockchain‐related empirical research.</jats:p>",

OBJECTIVE: The impacts of the neck, core, and combined stabilization practices on pain, disability, and improvement of the neck range of motion in the elderly with chronic non-specific neck pain were examined. METHOD: A quasi-experimental (open label) study was carried out through a cluster sampling in two phases in Tehran-Iran in 2017. Totally, 102 patients were randomly allocated to three groups of specific neck stabilization, specific core stabilization, and combined practices through envelope method. The intervention took 12 weeks. To measure the severity of pain and neck disability, the visual analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and neck pain and disability scale (NPDS) was used. A goniometer was used to measure the range of the motion. To examine data, used SPSS (v.20). RESULT: The results, confirmed a significant decrease in pain over the time in the three therapeutic groups (p = 0.000). In addition, there was a significant difference between neck, core, and combined stabilization groups. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the angle of motion in all treatment groups with different treatment duration (P = 0.000). The highest increase in the angle of motion was after 12 weeks of practice in right lateral flexion (RLF) (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Twelve sessions of the neck, core, and combined stabilization practices can alleviate the pain and improve the strength in the elderly with chronic non-specific neck pain. In addition, compared to two other methods, the combined method was a more efficient way to improve the range of motion in patients.</jats:p>",

Here we employed preclinical syngeneic p53 null mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to develop a treatment regimen that harnessed the immunostimulatory effects of low-dose cyclophosphamide coupled with the pharmacologic inhibition of TAMs using either a small-molecule CSF1R inhibitor or an anti-CSF1R antibody. This therapeutic combination was effective in treating several highly aggressive TNBC murine mammary tumor and lung metastasis models. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes including Th cells and antigen-presenting B cells that were highly enriched in responders to combination therapy. In one model that exhibited long-term posttreatment tumor regression, high-dimensional imaging techniques identified the close spatial localization of B220+/CD86+-activated B cells and CD4+ T cells in tertiary lymphoid structures that were present up to 6 weeks posttreatment. The transcriptional and metabolic heterogeneity of TAMs was also characterized in two closely related claudin-low/mesenchymal subtype tumor models with differential treatment responses. A murine TAM signature derived from the T12 model was highly conserved in human claudin-low breast cancers, and high expression of the TAM signature correlated with reduced overall survival in patients with breast cancer. This TAM signature may help identify human patients with claudin-low breast cancer that will benefit from the combination of cyclophosphamide and anti-CSF1R therapy. These studies illustrate the complexity of the tumor immune microenvironment and highlight different immune responses that result from rational immunotherapy combinations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Immunostimulatory chemotherapy combined with pharmacologic inhibition of TAMs results in durable treatment responses elicited by Th cells and B cells in claudin-low TNBC models.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

As a result, MoO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>@TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> displays outstanding electrochemical performance, especially at high rates (171.0 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 30 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and at high mass loadings (17 mAh cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> at 104 mg cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>). The full cells constructed with MnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> deliver an energy density up to 252.9 Wh kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and a power density of 18.3 kW kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Ex situ X‐ray diffraction and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that protons shuttle back and forth between different monoclinic phases. The results offer a simple way to achieve the high performance of MoO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in a diluted acidic solution.</jats:p>",

Although some of the biological factors have been reported that regulate intestinal permeation of cyclic peptides, the influence of the mucus barrier, a major hurdle to epithelial drug delivery, on cyclic peptide bioavailability is unclear. In this study, we show that the lipophilic cyclic peptide, cyclosporin A (CsA), interacted with, and likely induced aggregation, of polymeric, gel-forming mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC5B) which underpin the mucus gel-networks in the gastrointestinal tract. Under similar conditions, two other cyclic peptides (daptomycin and polymyxin B) did not cause mucin aggregation. Using rate-zonal centrifugation, purified MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins sedimented faster in the presence of CsA, with a significant increase in mucins in the pellet fraction. In contrast, mucin sedimentation profiles were largely unaltered after treatment with daptomycin or polymyxin B. CsA increased MUC5B sedimentation was concentration-dependent, and sedimentation studies using recombinant mucin protein domains suggests CsA most likely causes aggregation of the relatively non-O-glycosylated N-terminal and C-terminal regions of MUC5B. Furthermore, the aggregation of the N-terminal region, but not the C-terminal region, was affected by pH. CsA has partially N-methylated amide groups, this unique molecular structure, not present in daptomycin and polymyxin B, may potentially be involved in interaction with gel-forming mucin. Taken together, our results indicate that the interaction of gel-forming mucins with the cyclic peptide CsA is mediated at the N- and C-terminal domains of mucin polymers under physiological conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the mucus barrier is an important physiological factor regulating the intestinal permeation of cyclic peptides in vivo.</jats:p>"

High amounts of bioactive compounds were extracted from blueberry by solvent extraction. Response surface methodology was applied for the optimization of spray drying conditions. Extract mass percentage of feed mixture (m/m in dry basis 15-50%), air inlet temperature (120-150°C) and solid content of feed (20-40°Brix) were independent variables. Operational efficiency (yield) and phenolic retention were responses. Maltodextrin was used as an encapsulating agent. The optimum extract mass percentage, temperature and solid feed content were estimated as 19.51% (m/m) extract, 120°C and 20.03°Brix, respectively. The maximum levels of responses under optimum conditions were obtained as operational efficiency of 91.20% and phenolic retention of 87.12%. It was found that the most important variable for bioactive compound retention was the extract mass percentage. Encapsulated powder had 3.19% moisture content, and contained 5.54 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE), 1.52 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), and 46.41 μmol Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram dry powder. DPPH free radical scavenging activity value (EC50) of powder was 8.14 mg soluble solids/mL. Bioactive powder obtained could be considered as a possible functional food ingredient. In conclusion, blueberry extract powder could be efficiently produced by spray drying.</jats:p>"

In the first and second parts analysis, the engineering prediction model is built to estimate the dynamic responses of CSPLC. To discuss the responses of CSPLC in more detail, the objective of the present work is to investigate the hydro-elastic responses of rectangular, clamped sandwich plates with lattice core (CSPLC) subjected to water entry via combined a novel semi-analytical approach and multi-physical numerical simulation. In the theoretical approach, the hydro-elastic characteristics are quantified by coupling a hydrodynamic water entry model with a first shear displacement model of elasticity for CSPLC. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effects of water entry are taken into account by dividing the total impact pressure into the rigid water entry pressure and the interacting pressure. To capture the precise responses of CSPLC, both the global displacement field and the local displacement field are considered in the analytical model. The dynamic governing equations are derived from the energy variation principle and solved by employing the modal approach. Furthermore, the 3D FSI finite element simulation is carried out to get the detailed hydro-elastic characteristics of CSPLC. This engineering semi-analytical model is found to yield accurate results for dynamic responses and offers significant savings in computational cost compared to the FSI simulations. As a comparative study, for a same geometrical stiffened panel, the FSI impact pressure and structural deflection are also given respectively. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oxytocin receptors (OTR) have been found in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) for the regulation of feeding and maternal behaviors. However, the functional projections of OTR-expressing PVT neurons remain largely unknown. Here, we used chemogenetic and optogenetic tools to test the role of OTR-expressing PVT neurons and their projections in the regulation of food intake in both male and female OTR-Cre mice. We found chemogenetic activation of OTR-expressing PVT neurons promoted food seeking under trials with a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Using Feeding Experimentation Devices for real-time meal measurements, we found chemogenetic activation of OTR-expressing PVT neurons increased meal frequency but not cumulative food intake because of a compensatory decrease in meal sizes. In combination with anterograde neural tracing and slice patch-clamp recordings, we found optogenetic stimulation of PVT OTR terminals excited neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) as well as local PVT neurons through monosynaptic glutamatergic transmissions. Photostimulation of OTR-expressing PVT-NAcC projections promoted food-seeking, whereas selective activation of PVT-pBLA projections produced little effect on feeding. In contrast to selective activation of OTR terminals, photostimulation of a broader population of glutamatergic PVT terminals exerted direct excitation followed by indirect lateral inhibition on neurons in both NAcC and anterior basolateral amygdala. Together, these results suggest that OTR-expressing PVT neurons are a distinct population of PVT glutamate neurons that regulate feeding motivation through projections to NAcC.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</jats:bold>The paraventricular thalamus plays an important role in the regulation of feeding motivation. However, because of the diversity of paraventricular thalamic neurons, the specific neuron types promoting food motivation remain elusive. In this study, we provide evidence that oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons are a specific group of glutamate neurons that primarily project to the nucleus accumbens core and posterior amygdala. We found that activation of these neurons promotes the motivation for food reward and increases meal frequency through projections to the nucleus accumbens core but not the posterior amygdala. As a result, we postulate that oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the paraventricular thalamus and their projections to the nucleus accumbens core mainly regulate feeding motivation but not food consumption.</jats:p>",

However, the relations between their structural parameters and the properties of the PA spectrum are indirect because most theoretical models have been reported for them in the time domain. In this study, we develop a complete model in the frequency domain to analyze the PA response of core–shell particles. As in the case of solid spheres, the core-shell particles have pronounced resonant modes. The PA mode varies with the thickness of the shell and the radius of the core. Under single-pulse irradiation, PA signals of gold–silica nanospheres obtained by our theory agreed with those of the theory in the time domain and experiments. Under multi-pulse irradiation, the magnitude of the PA signals peaked whether the repeated excitation itself or its harmonic was equal to the PA mode. The structure could thus be monitored by the PA signals. These findings enrich PA theory and may inspire new techniques for the noninvasive characterization of nanoparticles.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a ductile failure analysis has been reported. It has been done following an elastoplastic analysis and a plastic limit load analysis. The crack conditions after 30 and 60 years of operation were evaluated. The results show that the core shroud will keep its structural integrity during sixty years under normal conditions of operation. On the other hand, its operational life is reduced five years under failure conditions. In general terms, the methodology, which has been developed, can be applied for any number of circumferential cracks located in the same cross section. Fast and reliable outputs can be obtained. It can be applied in any moment of the life of the plant, to support the decision on “Use as is”, “Mandatory Repair”, or “Estimation of the remaining life.”</jats:p>",

In this article, we review the SEW literature, the explanatory power of SEW in family firm behavior, and the heterogeneity of family firms. Although we find that SEW distinguishes the behavior of family firms from that of nonfamily firms, the concept has been used and operationalized differently across studies. The few studies that measure SEW directly do not find clear and consistent explanatory power of the construct. Moreover, not many studies are conducted in Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and China, raising the question as to whether the concept applies equally across institutional and cultural contexts. This article takes a pragmatic perspective on SEW by discussing and distinguishing between key dimensions of social wealth and emotional wealth, which we believe can enhance understanding of the behavior and heterogeneity of family businesses. Based on our deconstruction of the SEW concept, we propose various directions of future research.</jats:p>",

VPA model mice (first generation, F1) that were prenatally exposed to VPA exhibited robust core autism-like behaviors, and we found that oral administration of baclofen to F1 mice corrected their autism-like behavioral phenotypes at an early age. Based on a previous epigenetics study, we mated the F1 male offspring with litter females to produce the second generation (F2). The F2 male mice showed obvious inheritance of autism-like phenotypes from F1 mice, implying the heritability of autism symptoms in patients with prenatal VPA exposure. Furthermore, we found prenatal baclofen administration was associated with beneficial effects on the autism-like phenotype in F2 male mice. This may have involved corrections in the density of total/mature dendritic spines in the hippocampus (HC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), normalizing synaptic plasticity. In this research, GABAB receptor agonist administration corrected the core autism-like behaviors of F1 mice and protected against the inheritance of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring of F1 mice, suggesting the potential of early intervention with GABAB receptor agonists in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.</jats:p>"

Herein, a unique concept is introduced for converting the wavefront of multiple structured light beams, which are periodically packed in a microscopic area. An experimental demonstration is provided by using transmissive planar optical elements consisting of a microarray of geometric phase based on nematic liquid crystals. The periodic microstructure is fabricated by the directed self‐organization of topological defects present in a nanoscale relief obtained by area‐selective surface modification. The conversion of multiple wavefronts is realized by using the Talbot self‐imaging effect of the microarray. The integrated geometric phase microarray has potential applications in vortex beam emitters to harness structured light, such as for optical manipulation and lithography.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rise of social media platforms, tourists tend to share their experiences in the form of texts, photos, and videos on social media. These user-generated contents (UGC) play an important role in shaping tourism destination images (TDI) and directly affect the decision-making process of tourists. Among UGCs, photos represent tourists’ visual preferences for a specific area. Paying attention to the value of photos, several studies have attempted to analyze them using deep learning technology. However, the research methods that analyze tourism photos using recent deep learning technology have a limitation in that they cannot properly classify unique photos appearing in specific tourist attractions with predetermined photo categories such as Places365 or ImageNet dataset or it takes a lot of time and effort to build a separate training dataset to train the model and to generate a tourism photo classification category according to a specific tourist destination. The purpose of this study is to propose a method of automatically classifying tourist photos by tourist attractions by applying the methods of the image feature vector clustering and the deep learning model. To this end, first, we collected photos attached to reviews posted by foreign tourists on TripAdvisor. Second, we embedded individual images as 512-dimensional feature vectors using the VGG16 network pre-trained with Places365 and reduced them to two dimensions with t-SNE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). Then, clusters were extracted through HDBSCAN(Hierarchical Clustering and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) analysis and set as a regional image category. Finally, the Siamese Network was applied to remove noise photos within the cluster and classify photos according to the category. In addition, this study attempts to confirm the validity of the proposed method by applying it to two representative tourist attractions such as ‘Gyeongbokgung Palace’ and ‘Insadong’ in Seoul. As a result, it was possible to identify which visual elements of tourist attractions are attractive to tourists. This method has the advantages in that it is not necessary to create a classification category in advance, it is possible to flexibly extract categories for each tourist destination, and it is able to improve classification performance even with a rather small volume of a dataset.</jats:p>"

We investigated dust concentrations from a 22.7 m ice-core recovered from the Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC) in 2018, representing 14 years of snow accumulation. The dust seasonality signal was still preserved with homogenization of the record due to surface melting and percolation. Using a microparticle counter, we measured the dust concentration from 2 to 60 µm and divided the annual dust concentration into three distinct groups: fine particle percentage (FPP, 2–10 µm), coarse particle percentage (CPP, 10–20 μm), and giant particle percentage (GPP, 20–60 μm). Increased dust was associated with the warm stage of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) after 2013 with significant increases in FPP and a relative decrease in CPP and GPP. There was a positive correlation between PDO and FPP (r = 0.70, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-value &amp;lt; 0.005). CPP and GPP were dominant during the mainly PDO cold phase (2003–2012). The FPP increase record occurs during the positive phase of PDO and snow accumulation decrease. We also revealed a potential link between QIC record and Madeira River during the wet season through two relationships: between QIC snow accumulation and runoff during transitional season, QIC dust, and suspended sediments during high-water discharge. The snow accumulation (during September-November) and runoff (during November-January) relationship present similar variability using a time-lag (60 days) while total dust and FPP group are associated with average suspended sediments concentration during February-April. Assessing dust record variability by distinct size groups can help to improve our knowledge of how the Pacific ocean influence dust record in the QIC. In addition, the association of snow accumulation and dust variability with dynamic changes in suspended sediments load and runoff in the Madeira River system demonstrates the potential for future investigation of linkages between QIC record and Amazon basin rivers.</jats:p>"

As the conjunctival bacterial microbiota generates unique alterations with various oculopathies, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of distinguishing MK using machine learning based on the characteristics of the conjunctival bacterial microbiome associated with various types of MK. This study also aimed to reveal which bacterial genera constitute the core of the interaction network of the conjunctival bacterial microbiome.

Tenfold cross validation was adopted. Accuracy was 96.25% using the bacterial microbiota structure and 93.75% using the bacterial gene functional composition.

Obtaining homogeneous high resolution measurements and accounting for diffusion provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of decadal to millennial variability within the past glacial and interglacial periods. We present here a compilation of high resolution (11 cm) water isotopic records with 27 000 δ18O measurements and 7 920 δD measurements (covering respectively 94 % and 27 % of the whole EDC record), including published and new measurements (2 900 for both δ18O and δD) over the last 800 kyrs on the EDC ice core. We show that overlapping measurement series performed over multiple depth ranges over the past 20 years, using different analytical methods and in different laboratories, are consistent within analytical uncertainty, and therefore can be combined to provide a homogeneous data set. A frequency decomposition of the most complete δ18O record and a simple assessment of the possible influence of diffusion on the measured profile shows that the variability during glacial periods at multi-decadal to multi-centennial timescale is higher than variability of the interglacial periods. This analysis shows as well that during interglacial periods characterized by a temperature optimum at its beginning, the multi-centennial variability is the strongest over this temperature optimum.\n                        </jats:p>"

In particular, ESS for demand management is being established for high-voltage customers (300 KVA–1000 KVA) who have placed an Auto Section Switch (ASS) at the connection point within the distribution system. However, a power outage may occur in the Power Receiving System (PRS) when a short-circuit fault due to insulation breakdown occurs at the ESS DC side. The reason for this breakdown is that the fault current is reduced by transformer impedance, and the ASS is opened before the DC power fuse. Therefore, using the Graphic Solution Method (GSM), this paper presents an operation algorithm for protection coordination that isolates the fault section by first operating the DC power fuse with a small fault current. Furthermore, fault analysis modeling for a PRS composed of a switchgear section, a main distribution panel, a Power Conditioning System (PCS), a power fuse, and a battery is performed through PSCAD/EMTDC. From the simulation results, it is confirmed that the fault section is quickly isolated, and power outages for high-voltage customers are prevented because the DC power fuse selected by the proposed operation algorithm of protection coordination is opened before the ASS.</jats:p>"

We aimed to identify the relationship between hepatitis B core‐related antigen (HBcrAg) serum levels and liver fibrosis in treatment‐naive chronic HBV infection patients. A total of 246 treatment‐naive chronic HBV infection patients were enrolled in this study. All of the patients underwent liver biopsies at baseline. Using the METAVIR fibrosis stages, there were 15, 140, 50, 26 and 15 patients in the F0, F1, F2, F3 and F4 stages (METAVIR scoring system), respectively. The biochemical, serological and virological parameters were measured using standard laboratory procedures. The HBcrAg serum levels of the patients were examined via ELISA. HBcrAg serum levels of F2, F3 and F4 stage patients were significantly higher than those of nonsignificant liver fibrosis patients (METAVIR F0‐F1), but there were no significant differences among F2, F3 and F4 stage patients. Serum HBcrAg (OR, 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51–3.16), albumin (ALB) (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.87), prothrombin activity (PTA) (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83) and platelet (PLT) counts (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25–0.57) were associated with significant liver fibrosis (METAVIR F2‐F4). The serum HBcrAg value enabled the correct identification of patients with significant fibrosis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75–0.88). The APRI, FIB‐4 index and ALBI score can identify significant liver fibrosis with an area under the ROC curve of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66–0.81), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65–0.80) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.55–0.72), respectively.

HBcrAg, ALB, PTA serum levels and PLT counts were associated with significant liver fibrosis in treatment‐naive chronic HBV infection patients. HBcrAg serum levels enabled the correct identification of patients with significant fibrosis (METAVIR F2–F4), and HBcrAg was more effective than the FIB‐4 index and ALBI score.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The time course of signaling by peptide hormones, neural peptides, and other neuromodulators depends on their storage inside dense core vesicles (DCVs). Adaptor protein 3 (AP-3) assembles the membrane proteins that confer regulated release of DCVs and is thought to promote their trafficking from endosomes directly to maturing DCVs. We now find that regulated monoamine release from DCVs requires sorting nexin 5 (SNX5). Loss of SNX5 disrupts trafficking of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) to DCVs. The mechanism involves a role for SNX5 in retrograde transport of VMAT from endosomes to the TGN. However, this role for SNX5 conflicts with the proposed function of AP-3 in trafficking from endosomes directly to DCVs. We now identify a transient role for AP-3 at the TGN, where it associates with DCV cargo. Thus, retrograde transport from endosomes by SNX5 enables DCV assembly at the TGN by AP-3, resolving the apparent antagonism. A novel role for AP-3 at the TGN has implications for other organelles that also depend on this adaptor.</jats:p>",

Systemic administration of chemogenetic ligands prolongs movement time and increases spike train variability in the pallidum, but only slightly affects firing rate modulations. Across-trial analyses reveal that the irregular discharges in the pallidum coincides with prolonged movement time. Reduction of subthalamic activity also induces excessive abnormal movements in the contralateral forelimb, which are preceded by subthalamic and pallidal phasic activity changes. Our results suggest that the subthalamic nucleus stabilizes pallidal spike trains and achieves stable movements.</jats:p>"

Different approaches for calculating the thickness of the coating are presented, like a simple numerical modelling or a more complex simulation of the photoelectron peaks. Additionally, modelling of the XPS background for the investigation of coating is discussed. Furthermore, the new possibilities to measure with varying excitation energies or with hard-energy X-ray sources (hard-energy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) are described.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction:  Dysmenorrhea is characterized by pain in the lower abdomen and it is one of the most common complaints seen in women of reproductive age during menstruation. In Primary dysmenorrhea, the abdominal pain is not associated with any underlying pathology of the uterus and secondary dysmenorrhea is caused due to any pathology inside or outside the uterus. It can also lead to nausea, headache, fatigue and diarrhea. The aim of the study is to find the efficacy of core muscle strengthening in women with dysmenorrhea. Method: The samples were selected according to the inclusion criteria and sectioned into groups with convenience sampling technique. Group A (n=30) was prescribed with heating pad and lower abdominal massage in circular motions and Group B (n=30) with core muscle strengthening exercises. The exercise regimen should be followed for a period of 3 months, 4 days a week (except for the first two days of menstruation). The duration of the exercises was 40 minutes per day, with a brief period of warm up and cool down respectively.  Results:  Statistical Analysis was done for all collected data using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Paired t-test. The test shows a significant difference (p&lt;0.01) between the Groups A &amp; B. Group B showed improvement compared to Group A. Conclusion: The experimental study showed that strengthening abdominal muscles helps in reduction in intensity of pain or no pain at all and also improved the quality of life in women with dysmenorrhea.

Novel tungsten oxide-poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-PEDOT) core–shell inverse opal (IO) films are obtained by electrochemical polymerization of PEDOT onto WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> IO templates. The WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> IO templates are prepared through the electrodeposition of WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> into the voids of a polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystal, followed by calcination to remove the polystyrene microspheres. The designed microstructure and chemical composition of the WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-PEDOT IO films are determined by SEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-PEDOT IO films exhibit promising optical contrast ([Formula: see text]52% at 600 nm and [Formula: see text]77% at 1020 nm), indicating their bifunctional potentials in both visible and near infrared (NIR) region modulation. The WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-PEDOT IO films also show excellent EC properties of much shorter response time (6.7 s for coloring and 5.8 s for bleaching) and superior cycling stability than that of the bare WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> IO. These results suggest that the synergistic effect between the WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> IO core and PEDOT shell may greatly increase the electrolyte accessibility to active sites and improve the interaction between the inorganic/organic interfaces to obtain enhanced EC performance. </jats:p>",

Despite its simplicity compared with the conventional measurement-based quantum error correction, it is still a far from practical technique because of significant hardware overhead. We propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme for a rotational symmetric bosonic code in a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator. Our scheme is the simplest possible error correction scheme that can surpass the break-even point—it requires only a single continuous microwave tone. We also introduce an unconditional reset scheme that requires one more continuous microwave tone in addition to that for the error correction. The key properties underlying this simplicity are protected quasienergy states of a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator and the degeneracy in its quasienergy level structure. These properties eliminate the need for state-by-state correction in the Fock basis. Our schemes greatly reduce the complexity of autonomous quantum error correction and thus may accelerate the use of the bosonic code for practical quantum computation.</jats:p>"

The simulations start from identical initial conditions, and we regulate the strength of DM self-interactions and SNF by systematically varying the self-interacting DM (SIDM) momentum transfer cross-section and the gas density threshold for star formation. The DM halo forms a constant density core of similar size and shape for several combinations of those two parameters. Haloes with cores that are formed due to SIDM (adiabatic cusp-core transformation) have velocity dispersion profiles that are closer to isothermal than those of haloes with cores that are formed due to SNF in simulations with bursty star formation (impulsive cusp-core transformation). Impulsive SNF can generate positive stellar age gradients and increase random motion in the gas at the centre of the galaxy. Simulated galaxies in haloes with cores that were formed adiabatically are spatially more extended, with stellar metallicity gradients that are shallower (at late times) than those of galaxies in other simulations. Such observable properties of the gas and the stars, which indicate either an adiabatic or an impulsive evolution of the gravitational potential, may be used to determine whether observed cores in DM haloes are formed through DM self-interactions or in response to impulsive SNF.</jats:p>",

Optogenetics is free from electrical and magnetic artifacts and is an ideal stimulation method for combined use with fMRI. However, the application of optogenetics in nonhuman primates (NHPs) remains limited. Recently, we developed an efficient optogenetic intracortical microstimulation method of the primary motor cortex (M1), which successfully induced forelimb movements in macaque monkeys. Here, we aimed to investigate how optogenetic M1 stimulation causes neural modulation in the local and remote brain regions in anesthetized monkeys using 7-tesla fMRI. We demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of the M1 forelimb and hindlimb regions successfully evoked robust direct and remote fMRI activities. Prominent remote activities were detected in the anterior and posterior lobes in the contralateral cerebellum, which receive projections polysynaptically from the M1. We further demonstrated that the cerebro-cerebellar projections from these M1 regions were topographically organized, which is concordant with the somatotopic map in the cerebellar cortex previously reported in macaques and humans. The present study significantly enhances optogenetic fMRI in NHPs, resulting in profound understanding of the brain network, thereby accelerating the translation of findings from animal models to humans.</jats:p>",

The DFT and TD‐DFT coupled with the Marcus theory are used to look into electronic structures, ground and excited state properties, charge transport mobilities, and charge transfer analyses. It is found that the HTM‐PT shows little differences in planarity, ionization potential, and solubility compared with the original molecule. Additionally, the HTM‐PT exhibits lower frontier molecular orbital (FMOs), smaller bandgap, and red‐shift than HTM‐DP. More importantly, among the four designed HTMs, the HTM‐PT shows a larger hopping rate and mobility. As the charge transfer analyses, the HTM‐PT exhibits a larger intramolecular charger transfer amount and charge transfer distance than the prototypical one, which is conducive to a larger short‐circuit current.

Metallic interdigitated electrodes were fabricated on Si/SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> substrates using a conventional photolithography process. Subsequently, a Cu layer was electrodeposited on top of the metallic interdigitated electrodes. The CuO nanowire arrays (core) were obtained by thermal oxidation in air of the Cu layer. Afterwards, a ZnO thin film (shell) was deposited by RF magnetron sputtering covering the surface of the CuO nanowires. The morphological, structural, compositional, optical, electrical and photoelectrical properties of the CuO nanowire arrays and CuO–ZnO core–shell nanowire arrays grown on metallic interdigitated electrodes were investigated. The performances of the devices were evaluated by assessing the figures of merit of the photodetectors based on self-connected CuO–ZnO core–shell heterojunction nanowire arrays grown on the metallic interdigitated electrodes. The radial p–n heterojunction formed between CuO and ZnO generates a type II band alignment that favors an efficient charge separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs at the CuO–ZnO interface, suppressing their recombination and consequently enhancing the photoresponse and the photoresponsivity of the photodetectors. The electrical connections in the fabricated photodetector devices are made without any additional complex and time-consuming lithographic step through a self-connecting approach for CuO–ZnO core–shell heterojunction nanowire arrays grown directly onto the Ti/Pt metallic interdigitated electrodes. Therefore, the present study provides an accessible path for employing low dimensional complex structures in functional optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aimed to investigate the associations of microRNA (miRs) signatures with cytokines, serum lipids, and disease activity in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In total, 65 patients (PsA n = 25, AS n = 25, RA n = 15) and 25 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled into the study. The expression of miR-223-5p, miR-92b-3p, miR-485-3p, miR-10b-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-26a-2-3p, miR-146b-3p, and cytokines levels were measured in sera. DIANA-mirPath analysis was used to predict pathways targeted by the dysregulated miRs. Disease activity scores were calculated. Lipid profile, uric acid, glucose level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were determined in the blood. Based on lipid profiles, the PsA group had hypertriglyceridaemia, and RA patients revealed mixed dyslipidaemia, while in AS, no specific changes were found. miR expression analysis revealed upregulation of miR-26a-2-3p and miR-10b-5p in PsA, miR-485-3p in AS, and let-7d-5p in RA. Several correlations between disease activity indexes, metabolites levels, and expression of miRs were observed in PsA, RA, and AS patients. Finally, in ROC analysis, miR-26a-2-3p/miR-485-3p, and let-7d-5p/miR-146b-3p tandems revealed high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between PsA, AS, and RA. Our study illustrates the superiority of miR expressions in distinguishing between RA, PsA, and AS. In PsA, a unique regulatory pathway exists through miR-26a-2-3p, miR-223-5p, miR-10b-5p, and miR-92b-3p that converges proatherogenic metabolism and disease activity.</jats:p>"

While cells in the respiratory system are the initial target of SARS-CoV-2, there is mounting evidence that COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often targeted in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood. We employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes, and examined the expression of host factors for binding and processing of the virus. We studied cellular uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as a pseudotyped virus. Infection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed cellular uptake even at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. We found that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. We identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes. These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> via multiple binding interactions and partners, which may underlie the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney tissues. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.</jats:p>"

Using a heat conduction theory incorporating coherence, we demonstrate that the strong phase correlation between local and non-propagating modes, commonly named diffusons in the terminology of amorphous systems, triggers the conduction of heat. By treating the thermal vibrations as collective excitations, the significant contribution of diffusons, predominantly relying on coherence, further reveals interesting temperature and length dependences of thermal conductivity. The propagation length of diffuson clusters is found to reach the micron, overpassing the one of propagons. The explored wavelike behavior of diffusons uncovers the unsolved physical picture of mode correlation in prevailing models and further provides an interpretation of their ability to transport heat. This work introduces a framework for understanding thermal vibrations and transport in amorphous materials, as well as an unexpected insight into the wave nature of thermal vibrations.</jats:p>"

Numerous computational tools for protein quantification, imputation and differential expression (DE) analysis were generated in the past decade and the search for optimal tools is still going on. Moreover, due to the rapid development of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, a vast number of DE analysis methods were created for that purpose. The applicability of these newly developed RNA-seq-oriented tools to proteomics data remains in doubt. In order to benchmark these analysis methods, a proteomics dataset consisting of proteins derived from humans, yeast and drosophila, in defined ratios, was generated in this study. Based on this dataset, DE analysis tools, including microarray- and RNA-seq-based ones, imputation algorithms and protein quantification methods were compared and benchmarked. Furthermore, applying these approaches to two public datasets showed that RNA-seq-based DE tools achieved higher accuracy (ACC) in identifying DEPs. This study provides useful guidelines for analyzing quantitative proteomics datasets. All the methods used in this study were integrated into the Perseus software, version 2.0.3.0, which is available at https://www.maxquant.org/perseus.</jats:p>",

The current evidence about the comparative effectiveness of CFT for CLBP is still scarce. We aimed to investigate whether CFT is more effective than core training exercise and manual therapy (CORE-MT) in pain and disability in patients with CLBP. A total of 148 adults with CLBP were randomly assigned to receive 5 one-hour individualized sessions of either CFT (n = 74) or CORE-MT (n = 74) within a period of 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were pain intensity (numeric pain rating scale, 0-10) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index, 0-100) at 8 weeks. Patients were assessed preintervention, at 8 weeks and 6 and 12 months after the first treatment session. Altogether, 97.3% (n = 72) of patients in each intervention group completed the 8 weeks of the trial. Cognitive functional therapy was more effective than CORE-MT in disability at 8 weeks (MD = −4.75; 95% CI −8.38 to −1.11; <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> = 0.011, effect size= 0.55) but not in pain intensity (MD = −0.04; 95% CI −0.79 to 0.71; <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> = 0.916). Treatment with CFT reduced disability, but the difference was not clinically important compared with CORE-MT postintervention (short term) in patients with CLBP.

The results show that RegCM4-7 does add value to its driving Global Climate Models (GCMs) with a positive Added Value Coverage (AVC) ranging between 20 and 60% at high resolution, depending on the season and the boundary conditions. At low resolution, the results indicate an increase in the positive AVC by up to 20% compared to the high-resolution results, with an up to 8% decrease for instances where an increase is not observed. Typical climate zones such as West Africa, Central Africa, and Southern East Africa, where improvements by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are expected due to strong dependence on mesoscale and fine-scale features, show positive AVC greater than 20%, regardless of the season and the driving GCM. These findings provide more evidence for confirming the hypothesis that the RCMs AV is influenced by their internal physics rather than being the product of a mere disaggregation of large-scale features provided by GCMs. Although the results show some dependencies to the driving GCMs relating to their equilibrium climate sensitivity nature, the findings at low resolutions similar to the native GCM resolutions make the influence of internal physics more important. The findings also feature the CORDEX-CORE RegCM4-7 precipitation simulations’ potential in bridging the quality and resolution gap between coarse GCMs and high-resolution remote sensing datasets. Even if further post-processing activities, such as bias correction, may still be needed to remove persistent biases at high resolution, using upscaled RCMs as an alternative to GCMs for large-scale precipitation studies over Africa can be insightful if the AV and other performance statistics are satisfactory for the intended application.</jats:p>"

The Scientific Council of Pharmacy leads extensive efforts to advance clinical pharmacy practice and training under the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS), the accrediting body for critical care training programs and all other specialties. Despite launching critical care pharmacy programs in 2013, currently available accreditation standards and competency assessments for specialized residency programs in critical care were established in 2020. These accreditation standards and competency assessment modalities have been found to have significant areas of improvement based on the feedback of practicing critical care pharmacy residency program directors and trainees over the past few years. This is an opinion paper based on a consensus of critical care and emergency medicine pharmacy experts which recommends updating the current accreditation standards framework and competency assessment blueprint for specialized critical care pharmacy programs.

Numerical simulation finite element models of structures with different cores under three-point bending were calculated by ABAQUS/Explicit.

So far, the inferred properties have been mostly limited to planetary, orbital, and stellar parameters extracted from, e.g., Kepler, radial velocity, and Gaia data. More recently an increasing number of exoplanet atmospheres have been observed in detail from space and the ground. Generally, however, these atmospheric studies have focused on individual planets, with the exception of a couple of works that have detected the presence of water vapor and clouds in populations of gaseous planets via transmission spectroscopy. Here, using a suite of retrieval tools, we analyze spectroscopic and photometric data of 25 hot Jupiters, obtained with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes via the eclipse technique. By applying the tools uniformly across the entire set of 25 planets, we extract robust trends in the thermal structure and chemical properties of hot Jupiters not obtained in past studies. With the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope and the upcoming missions Twinkle and Ariel, population-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres, such as the one presented here, will be a key approach to understanding planet characteristics, formation, and evolution in our galaxy.</jats:p>",

While most studies investigating mechanistic basis of pathogenesis have focused on successful apoplastic growth, factors important during asymptomatic colonization in the early stages of disease development are not well understood. In this study, we show that tssM gene of the type VI secretion system cluster i3* (T6SS-i3*) plays a significant role during initial asymptomatic epiphytic colonization at different stages during the life cycle of the pathogen. Mutation in a core gene, tssM of T6SS-i3*, imparted higher aggressiveness to the pathogen, as indicated by higher overall disease severity, higher in planta growth, and shorter latent infection period compared with the wild-type upon dip inoculation of 4- to 5-week-old tomato plants. Contribution of tssM toward aggressiveness was evident during vertical transmission from seed to seedling, with wild-type showing reduced disease severity as well as lower in planta populations on seedlings compared with the mutant. Presence of functional TssM offered higher epiphytic fitness as well as higher dissemination potential to the pathogen when tested in an experimental setup mimicking transplant house high-humidity conditions. We showed higher osmotolerance being one mechanism by which TssM offers higher epiphytic fitness. Taken together, these data reveal that functional TssM plays a larger role in offering ecological advantage to the pathogen. TssM prolongs the association of hemibiotrophic pathogen with the host, minimizing overall disease severity yet facilitating successful dissemination. </jats:p>",

However, in the green range, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and emission tunability of nanoplatelets are still inferior to that of quantum dots. In this work, a new synthesis protocol is developed, enabling core/crown nanoplatelets to grow continuously from elementary precursors to their final form. A new heterostructure of CdSe/CdSeS core/alloyed‐crown nanoplatelets is produced that realizes 100% PLQY, the continuous tunability of emission peaks in between 502 and 550 nm, and low full‐width‐at‐half‐maximum (FWHM) of less than 15 nm. Achieving these excellent properties in all three aspects at the same time is unprecedented. In addition, the time‐resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of these nanoplatelets show a mono‐exponential decay characteristic, and the nanoplatelet film can also show 100% PLQY and a mono‐exponential decay characteristic, indicating the suppression of trap states. The high‐quality nanoplatelets achieved in this work provide a solid foundation for developing nanoplatelet‐based light sources, like light‐emitting diodes and lasers, with much higher efficiency, color purity, and lower working thresholds.</jats:p>",

Biallelic RYR1 variants were found in six families (two AR and four sporadic cases) of the 14 molecularly analyzed families (~43%), suggesting a higher frequency of AR inheritance than expected. None of these cases presented a severe phenotype. Facial weakness was more common in biallelic than in monoallelic patients (p = 0.0043) and might be a marker for AR forms. NGS is highly effective for the identification of RYR1 variants in CCD patients, allowing the discovery of a higher proportion of AR cases with biallelic mutations.

In this study we aimed to investigate the role of the HCV‐cAg assay up to 48 weeks after DAA treatment. We enrolled 98 patients with chronic HCV infection who received DAA treatment in this study. Plasma samples were assessed for HCV‐RNA (AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan assay, Roche) and HCV‐cAg (Abbott ARCHITECT HCV‐cAg assay) levels at baseline, 12 weeks (P12) and 48 weeks (P48) after DAA treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of HCV‐cAg were compared with those of HCV‐RNA. A total of 284 samples from 98 enrolled participants were analyzed. HCV‐cAg levels changed in parallel with HCV‐RNA levels in HCV‐infected patients during and after DAA therapy. HCV‐cAg levels showed excellent correlation with HCV viral load (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic> = 0.951, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.905, <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> = 0.951, and <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; .001). The overall sensitivity and specificity for HCV‐cAg in detecting quantifiable HCV‐RNA thresholds were 96.9% and 100%, respectively. Three patients with baseline HCV viremia had nonreactive HCV‐cAg (false‐negative rate was 1.02%); none of the patients were HCV‐cAg positive and HCV‐RNA negative. At 48 weeks after DAA treatment, the HCV‐cAg assay detected all patients with viremia, demonstrating 100% sensitivity and specificity. In conclusions, the HCV‐cAg assay has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pre‐ and post‐DAA treatment viremia and may be a useful tool to confirm viremia at P12 and P48.</jats:p>",

The multilayer GMR structure studied here consists of shallow etched one-dimensional silicon dioxide gratings with a silicon nitride intermediate layer and an amorphous silicon nonlinear medium. Under conical mounting, by restricting the fundamental excitation angles along the grating vector direction, while retaining the angles supported by the objective lens along the grating lines, the resonances are made angle insensitive. The forward detected THG enhancement increases from 2860 in the absence of any pupil plane mask, with a uniform fundamental excitation angular span of 2.3° to 4740 and 1.7 × 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> in the presence of rectangular apertures that selectively reduce the excitation angular span along the grating vector direction to 0.86° and 0.43°, respectively.

Drawing on interviews with 68 individuals, observations of instruction and professional development, and policy documents, findings suggest that high policy alignment represents a fundamental yet insufficient condition for educators to perceive policies as coherent and coordinated. Accountability strength and policy sequence were important factors in educators’ perceptions of coherence.

Recent breakthroughs in ultralow-loss HCF clearly imply that long-haul applications of HCF in communications and lasers are going to appear. Nevertheless, up to now, the HCF technique as a whole is still hampered by the limited length of a single span and the lack of HCF-based functional devices. To resolve these two issues, it is of importance to develop ultralow-loss and plug-and-play HCF interconnections. In this work, we report on HCF interconnections with the lowest-ever insertion losses (0.10 dB for HCF to standard single-mode fiber (SMF) and 0.13 dB for HCF to itself in the 1.5 µm waveband) and in a pluggable means. Two fiber mode-field adapters, one based on a graded-index multi-mode fiber (GIF) and the other utilizing a thermally expanded core (TEC) SMF, have been tested and compared. An extra insertion loss arising from imperfect refractive index distribution in a commercial GIF is observed. Our HCF interconnections also realize a back-reflection of &lt;-35 dB over a 100 nm bandwidth as well as other critical metrics in favor of practical applications. Our technique is viable for any type of HCF.</jats:p>",

On the China Law Research Cup 2019 Judicial Artificial Intelligence Challenge (CAIL-2019) dataset, the final result improves 4.2 points over the method based on the BERT model but without using similarity metrics. This research method makes full use of the semantic information of text, which is essential in the judicial field of document processing.</jats:p>",

When using the SCAM substrate, the diffusion and/or penetration of impurities, including Mg, Sc, O, and Al, from the SCAM substrate poses as a challenge. To address this issue, we introduced an Al0.74In0.26N layer between the SCAM substrate and MQWs, which was lattice-matched to the substrate. The Al0.74In0.26N layer effectively blocked the diffusion of impurities from the SCAM substrate into the adjacent layers during the metal-organic vapor epitaxy (MOVPE) growth. For further suppression, a thick AlN layer was deposited on the back of the SCAM substrate before the MOVPE growth, which effectively suppressed impurity penetration from the growth surface. The structure proposed in this study improved the crystallinity and the surface roughness of MQWs, resulting in the improvement of internal quantum efficiency by approximately three times compared to that of the conventional sample.</jats:p>",

Recent studies have underlined MRV’s ability to alter cellular alternative splicing (AS) during infection, with a limited understanding of the mechanisms at play. In this study, we investigated how MRV modulates AS. Using a combination of cell biology and reverse genetics experiments, we demonstrated that the M1 gene segment, encoding the μ2 protein, is the primary determinant of MRV’s ability to alter AS, and that the amino acid at position 208 in μ2 is critical to induce these changes. Moreover, we showed that the expression of μ2 by itself is sufficient to trigger AS changes, and its ability to enter the nucleus is not required for all these changes. Moreover, we identified core components of the U5 snRNP (i.e. EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200) as interactors of μ2 that are required for MRV modulation of AS. Finally, these U5 snRNP components are reduced at the protein level by both MRV infection and μ2 expression. Our findings identify the reduction of U5 snRNP components levels as a new mechanism by which viruses alter cellular AS.</jats:p>",

At low Bi fluxes, the Ga(As,Bi) shells are smooth, with Bi completely incorporated into the shells. Higher Bi fluxes (Bi/As flux ratio ~ 4%) led to partial segregation of Bi as droplets on the nanowires sidewalls, preferentially located at the nanowire segments with wurtzite structure. We demonstrate that such Bi droplets on the sidewalls act as catalysts for the growth of branches perpendicular to the GaAs trunks. Due to the tunability between zinc-blende and wurtzite polytypes by changing the nanowire growth conditions, this effect enables fabrication of branched nanowire architectures with branches generated from selected (wurtzite) nanowire segments.</jats:p>"

In this specific application context, when multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenarios are considered, the system usually has to manage a large number of communication links among sensors and antennas involving different vehicles and users. Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are one of the key technology enablers toward achieving high data rates in beyond 5G systems (B5G). Communication at these frequency bands usually involves the use of large antenna arrays, often requiring high computational resources. One of the candidate platforms able to manage a huge number of communications is the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ EG Heterogeneous MPSoC, which is composed of a dual-core Cortex-R5, a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53, a graphics processing unit (GPU) and a high-end FPGA. This work analyzes the computational performance that requires a recent mmWave MIMO channel estimation algorithm in a platform of this kind. As a first approach, we will focus our work on the performance that can be achieved via the quad-core ARM Cortex-A53. To this end, we will use the libraries for numerical algebra (BLAS and LAPACK). The results show that our reference implementation is able to manage a large MIMO communication system with 256 antennas without exhausting platform resources.</jats:p>",

It is rich in protein, minerals, and vitamins, and adapts well to a range of production systems. Currently, the lack of improved cultivars limits the use of the crop. Breeding‐improved cultivars requires access to large collections of amaranth biodiversity stored in genebanks. The task of searching such vast collections for traits of interest can be eased by generating core collections, which display the diversity of large collections in a much smaller germplasm set. The World Vegetable Center amaranth collection contains around 1,000 accessions of 13 species; among them, there are 281 accessions of four species important for use as vegetable amaranth in Africa (<jats:italic>A. cruentus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>A. hypochondriacus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>A. caudatus</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>A. dubius</jats:italic>). Based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker genotype diversity, a core collection (CC) of 76 accessions, cultivars, and selections was assembled. To a large extent, it represents the diversity of the whole collection. The CC was evaluated for yield and nutritional parameters during the cool and warm seasons in Tanzania and Taiwan and a pretest for variation of drought tolerance in the CC has been performed. Cultivar Madiira 2, an improved cultivar developed for vegetable production in Africa, outperformed all other tested cultivars in terms of yield stability, but several CC accessions had higher yield, lower wilting score, and higher nutrient content than Madiira 2. This indicates the core collection can be used for further improvement of amaranth cultivars.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Positive-stranded RNA viruses modify host organelles to form replication organelles (ROs) for their own replication. The enteroviral 3A protein has been demonstrated to be highly associated with the COPI pathway, in which factors operate on the ER-to-Golgi intermediate and the Golgi. However, Sar1, a COPII factor exerting coordinated action at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites rather than COPI factors, is required for the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Therefore, further understanding regarding FMDV 3A could be key to explaining the differences and to understanding FMDV’s RO formation. In this study, FMDV 3A was confirmed as a peripheral membrane protein capable of modifying the ER into vesicle-like structures, which were neither COPII vesicles nor autophagosomes. When the C-terminus of 3A was truncated, it was located at the ER without vesicular modification. This change was revealed using mGFP and APEX2 fusion constructs, and observed by fluorescence microscopy and electron tomography, respectively. For the other 3A truncation, the minimal region for modification was aa 42–92. Furthermore, we found that the remodeling was related to two COPII factors, Sar1 and Sec12; both interacted with 3A, but their binding domains on 3A were different. Finally, we hypothesized that the N-terminus of 3A would interact with Sar1, as its C-terminus simultaneously interacted with Sec12, which could possibly enhance Sar1 activation. On the ER membrane, active Sar1 interacted with regions of aa 42–59 and aa 76–92 from 3A for vesicle formation. This mechanism was distinct from the traditional COPII pathway and could be critical for FMDV RO formation.</jats:p>"

Here, we present the 3.4-Å resolution structure of fibrils of full-length recombinant tau protein in the presence of RNA, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). The structure reveals the familiar in-register cross-β amyloid scaffold but with a small fibril core spanning residues Glu391 to Ala426, a region disordered in the fuzzy coat in all previously studied tau polymorphs. RNA is bound on the fibril surface to the positively charged residues Arg406 and His407 and runs parallel to the fibril axis. The fibrils dissolve when RNase is added, showing that RNA is necessary for fibril integrity. While this structure cannot exist simultaneously with the tau fibril structures extracted from patients’ brains, it could conceivably account for the nucleating effects of RNA cofactors followed by remodeling as fibrils mature.</jats:p>",

It is found that W could be well controlled. The causes of no W accumulation are clarified by analyzing the background plasma parameters and modeling the W transport. It turns out that the electron temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>e</jats:sub>) and its gradient are usually high while the toroidal rotation and density peaking of the bulk plasma are small. In this condition, the modeled W turbulent diffusion coefficient is big enough to offset the total turbulent and neoclassical pinch, so that W density profile for zero particle flux will not be very peaked. Combining NEO and TGLF for the W transport coefficient and the impurity transport code STRAHL, not only the core W density profile is predicted but also the radiated information mainly produced by W in the experiment can be closely reconstructed. At last, the physics of controlling W accumulation by electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) is illustrated considering the effects of changed <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>e</jats:sub> by ECRH on ionization balance and transport of W.

Their low temperatures (&lt;10 K) allow the formation of thick icy dust mantles, which will be partially preserved in future protoplanetary disks, ultimately affecting the chemical composition of planetary systems. Previous observations have shown that carbon- and oxygen-bearing species, in particular CO, are heavily depleted in prestellar cores due to the efficient molecular freeze-out onto the surface of cold dust grains. However, N-bearing species such as NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and, in particular, its deuterated isotopologues appear to maintain high abundances where CO molecules are mainly in the solid phase. Thanks to ALMA, we present here the first clear observational evidence of NH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>D freeze-out toward the L1544 prestellar core, suggestive of the presence of a “complete depletion zone” within a ≃1800 au radius, in agreement with astrochemical prestellar core model predictions. Our state-of-the-art chemical model coupled with a non-LTE radiative transfer code demonstrates that NH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>D becomes mainly incorporated in icy mantles in the central 2000 au and starts freezing out already at ≃7000 au.

In plants, ppGpp is synthesized in chloroplasts from GTP and ATP and functions as a regulator of chloroplast gene expression to affect photosynthesis and plant growth. This observation indicates that ppGpp metabolism is closely related to chloroplast function, but the regulation of ppGpp and its role in chloroplast differentiation are not well understood. In rice, ppGpp directly inhibits plastidial guanylate kinase (GKpm), a key enzyme in GTP biosynthesis. GKpm is highly expressed during early leaf development in rice, and the GKpm-deficient mutant, virescent-2 (v2), develops chloroplast-deficient chlorotic leaves under low-temperature conditions. To examine the relationship between GTP synthesis and ppGpp homeostasis, we generated transgenic rice plants over-expressing RSH3, a protein known to act as a ppGpp synthase. When RSH3 was overexpressed in v2, the leaf chlorosis was more severe. Although the RSH3 overexpression in the wild type caused no visible effects, pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer measurements indicated that photosynthetic rates were reduced in this line. This finding implies that the regulation of ppGpp synthesis in rice is involved in the maintenance of the GTP pool required to regulate plastid gene expression during early chloroplast biogenesis. We further investigated changes in the expressions of RelA/SpoT Homolog (RSH) genes encoding ppGpp synthases and hydrolases during the same period. Comparing the expression of these genes with the cellular ppGpp content suggests that the basal ppGpp level is determined by the antagonistic action of multiple RSH enzymatic activities during early leaf development in rice.</jats:p>",

Capacitance measurements revealed that the primary target of WT h-tau is vesicle endocytosis. Blocking MT assembly using nocodazole prevented tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. Immunofluorescence imaging analyses revealed that MT assembly by WT h-tau loading was associated with an increased MT-bound fraction of the endocytic protein dynamin. A synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to dynamin 1-pleckstrin-homology domain inhibited MT-dynamin interaction and rescued tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. We conclude that elevation of presynaptic WT tau induces de novo assembly of MTs, thereby sequestering free dynamins.

Here we integrate high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially resolved microregion transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in primary melanoma. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in situ, and invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor–stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of MHC-II and IDO1, and by PD1–PDL1-mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. A few millimeters away, cytotoxic T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can coexist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance:</jats:title><jats:p>The reorganization of the tumor ecosystem in primary melanoma is an excellent setting in which to study immunoediting and immune evasion.

Fasting, one hour and two hour cut-offs were based on Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO trial) criteria and cases were treated. The sensitivity and specificity of risk-factor-based screening criteria was calculated using OGTT as the gold standard. Risk factors included at least one positive finding among 10 criteria, e.g., obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥27.5kg/m<ns3:sup>2</ns3:sup>), 1<ns3:sup>st</ns3:sup> degree relative with diabetes etc. Adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by GDM status, and risk factors for GDM were explored.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Results:</ns3:bold> GDM prevalence was 13.4% (50/374) (95% CI: 10.3-17.2). Risk-factors alone correctly identified 74.0% (37/50) OGTT positive cases: sensitivity 74.0% (59.7-85.4) and specificity 27.8% (3.0-33.0). Burman women accounted for 29.1% of the cohort population, but 38.0% of GDM cases. Percentiles for birthweight (p=0.004), head circumference (p=0.005), and weight-length ratio (p=0.010) were higher in newborns of GDM mothers compared with non-GDM, yet 21.7% (75/346) of newborns in the cohort were small-for-gestational age. In Burman women, overweight/obese BMI was associated with a significantly increased adjusted odds ratio 5.03 (95% CI: 1.43-17.64) for GDM compared to normal weight, whereas underweight and overweight/obese in Karen women were both associated with similarly elevated adjusted odds, approximately 2.4-fold (non-significant) for GDM. GDM diagnosis by OGTT was highest prior to peak rainfall.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Conclusions:</ns3:bold> Risk-factor-based screening was not sufficiently sensitive or specific to be useful to diagnose GDM in this setting among a cohort of low-risk pregnant women.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The nanoparticles dispersion system has complex migration characteristics and percolation law in porous media due to the interaction between the nanoparticles and porous media. In this paper, lab experiments were carried out to characterize the morphology, particle size distributions, and apparent viscosities of SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticle solution, investigate its migration characteristics in porous media, and probe its capability of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the reservoirs. Quartz microtubule, sand pack, and etched glass micromodels were used as the porous media in the flow and flooding experiments. Gray image-processing technology was applied to achieve oil saturation at different flooding stages in the micromodel for calculating the EOR of the SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticle solution. The results show that The SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles are spherical with diameters ranging from 260 to 300 nm, and the thicknesses of the polymeric layers are in the range of 30–50 nm. As the swelling time increases from 24 to 120 h, the medium sizes of the SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles increase from 584.45 to 1142.61 nm. The flow of the SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles has obvious nonlinear characteristics and a prominent scale effect at a low-pressure gradient, and there should be an optimal matching relationship between its injection mass concentration and the channel size. The flow tests in the sand packs demonstrate that the SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles can form effective plugging in the main flow channels at different permeability areas and can break through at the throat to fulfill the step-by-step profile control. Moreover, the profile control of the SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles strengthens with an increase in their swelling time. The microscopic flooding experiment in the etched glass micromodel confirms that the SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles can block dynamically and alternatively the channels of different sizes with the form of loose or dense networks to adjust the fluid flow diversion, improve the sweep efficiency, and recover more residual oil. The SiO2/P(MBAAm-co-AM) polymeric nanoparticles can achieve an enhanced oil recovery of 20.71% in the micromodel.</jats:p>"

Pil1 is a core eisosome protein and is responsible for MCC‐invaginated structures. In addition, six‐tetraspan membrane proteins (6‐Tsp) are localized in the MCCs and classified into two families, the Sur7 family and Nce102 family. To understand the coordinated function of these MCC proteins, single and multiple deletion mutants of Pil1 and 6‐Tsp were generated and their MCC structure and growth under various stresses were investigated. Genetic interaction analysis revealed that the Sur7 family and Nce102 function in stress tolerance and normal eisosome assembly, respectively, by cooperating with Pil1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using core to conduct laboratory experiments is one of the important methods for wellbore stability research. However, as the objects of petroleum exploration gradually shift to areas with complex geological conditions, core acquisition is restricted by many problems, such as irregular shapes of cores obtained, low core acquisition rate, long construction time, and increasing operational cost. In recent years, exploration work in the southwest Tarim Basin has been further strengthened. Due to the complex strata and the frequent occurrence of complex well conditions during the drilling process, the problem of on-site coring has become more prominent, which seriously limits the analysis of rock properties. Therefore, scientific and effective cuttings analysis technology is urgently needed. This paper used digital core CT scanning technology to reconstruct the rock skeleton and its mineral facies using drill cuttings. The digital core was established, and the Poisson’s ratio and elastic modulus were calculated. The wellbore stability was analyzed, and the well sections, which were prone to wellbore instability, were determined. On this basis, KCl-polysulfonate drilling fluid was introduced. The influence of drilling fluid on rock strength was evaluated by digital core technology, and water immersion experiments were introduced to verify the experimental results. The results obtained by digital core CT scanning technology were compared with those obtained by triaxial compression experiments and well-logging data calculation, and the feasibility of digital core technology in the wellbore stability study and drilling fluid evaluation was verified.</jats:p>",

The cascade of counters and the 3D discrete chaotic system is used to generate three masking factors and update these factors to encrypt the bitstream, constellation, and the information of the subcarriers. Using this structure, the key space is 10<jats:sup>270</jats:sup> and the key is updated in a timely manner. In this work, the encryption scheme solves the dynamic degradation of chaotic cryptography. Experimental results show that there is no significant difference in error performance in comparison with before encryption. Compared with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, the spectrum efficiency of the UFMC system is higher, which reduces out-of-band leakage and interference between services. Considering the complexity constraints of the receiver, the inter-symbol interference caused by fiber dispersion is alleviated by optimizing the distribution of data subbands, and the bit error rate (BER) performance is improved. It is shown that the UFMC system obtains 1.9 dB gain compared with the OFDM system in terms of receiver sensitivity when the BER is 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. This encryption scheme has a promising application prospect in short-distance optical access systems in the future.</jats:p>",

Comprehensive, high-throughput DNA sequencing shows that the human Ig repertoire, including variable gene usage, is well recapitulated in TC-mAb mice. Despite slightly altered B cell development and a delayed immune response, TC-mAb mice have more subsets of antigen-specific plasmablast and plasma cells than wild-type mice, leading to efficient hybridoma production. Our results thus suggest that TC-mAb mice offer a valuable platform for obtaining fully human therapeutic antibodies, and a useful model for elucidating the regulation of human Ig repertoire formation.</jats:p>"

The absolute structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The starting hemihydrate form contains one turinabol molecule in the asymmetric unit, while the others contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Structural features were investigated in terms of the conformational analysis of the steroid skeleton rings and intermolecular interactions. The magnitudes, the nature of the crystal structure energies and the intermolecular interactions were also evaluated. Complexation with β-cyclodextrin was performed and the obtained complex was investigated using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared (FT–IR) spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA).</jats:p>",

Claudin-4 is classically defined as a tight junction protein and is often associated with epithelial cancers. Claudin-4 is aberrantly expressed in nearly 70% of all ovarian cancer tumors and conveys a worse overall prognosis. Elevated claudin-4 expression correlates to increased DNA repair activity and resistance to DNA damaging agents. PARP inhibitors are emerging as an effective therapeutic option for patients with ovarian cancer and function by promoting DNA damage. The study examines the relationship between claudin-4 expression and the response to PARP inhibitors using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of claudin-4 in in vitro and ex vivo models of ovarian cancer to examine DNA repair markers and functional activity. Genetic inhibition of claudin-4 results in the downregulation of several DNA damage repair effectors, including 53BP1 and XRCC1. Claudin-4 knockdown did not change homology-directed repair but inhibited nonhomologous end-joining and reduced 53BP1 foci formation. In 15 primary ovarian cancer tumors, higher claudin-4 expression significantly correlated to a dampened PARP inhibitor-mediated antiproliferation response. Further, claudin-4 inhibition in high claudin-4 tumors sensitized tumor sections to PARP inhibition. These data highlight that claudin-4 expression in ovarian cancer tumors could serve as both a marker of PARP inhibitor response and a therapeutic target to improve PARP inhibitor response.</jats:p>",

In this study, we show that KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer upregulates integrin α6β4 through ERK/MEK signaling. Knocking-out integrin β4 (ITGB4) specifically depleted the expression of integrin α6β4 and this resulted in a reduction in the invasion and migration ability of the cancer cells. We also observed a reduction in the number and area of lung metastatic foci in mice that were injected with ITGB4 knockout KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cells compared with the mice injected with ITGB4 wild-type KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cells, while no difference was observed in liver metastases. Inhibiting integrin α6β4 in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer could be a potential therapeutic target to diminish the KRAS-invasive phenotype and associated pulmonary metastasis rate.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Implications:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Knocking-out ITGB4, which is overexpressed in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer and promotes tumor aggressiveness, diminishes local invasiveness and rates of pulmonary metastasis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The monolayers placed in three dielectric environments are studied, in particular, the ML encapsulated in hexagonal BN (hBN) flakes, the ML deposited on a hBN layer, and the ML embedded between the hBN flake and SiO2/Si substrate. We observe that the brightening rates of the neutral and charged dark excitons depend on the dielectric environment, which may be related to the variation of the level of carrier concentration in the ML. Moreover, the surrounding media, characterized by different dielectric constants, weakly influence the relative energies of the neutral and charged dark excitons in reference to the bright ones.</jats:p>",

The standard catalytic system for iridium-catalyzed borylation uses [Ir(cod)(OMe)]2 as a precatalyst, a bipyridine type ligand, and B2pin2 or HBpin as the borylating agent. Initially, a bipyridine-ligated trisboryl–iridium complex is generated that enables the borylation reaction and the regioselectivity is mainly governed by the sterics of substituents present on the ring. As a result, monosubstituted and 1,2-disubstituted arenes give mixtures of isomers. Significant efforts by several research groups have overcome the selectivity issue for directed proximal C–H borylation by introducing a directing group and newly developed ligands. This short review aims to summarize recent elegant discoveries in directed C(sp2)–H and C(sp3)–H borylation by using heterobidentate ligand (P/N–Si, N–B, and N–C) coordinated iridium catalysts.</jats:p><jats:p>1 \tIntroduction</jats:p><jats:p>2 \tIridium-Catalyzed Directed C–H Borylation of C(sp2)–H Bonds</jats:p><jats:p>3 \tIridium-Catalyzed Directed C–H Borylation of C(sp3)–H Bonds</jats:p><jats:p>4 \tConclusions</jats:p>",

The glycan‐binding properties of rConA were then compared with that of the native ConA isolated from jack bean using glycoconjugate microarray and frontal affinity chromatography. rConA demonstrated a glycan‐binding specificity similar to nConA. Both molecules bound to N‐glycans containing a terminal Man residue. Consistent with previous reports, terminal Manα1‐6Man was found to be an essential unit for the high‐affinity binding of rConA and nConA, while bisecting GlcNAc diminished the binding of rConA and nConA to Manα1‐6Man‐terminated N‐glycans.

In the steady state, the experimental core line-averaged W concentration (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>W</jats:sub>) is about 2 × 10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup>, which is evaluated using the intensity of the W unresolved transition array (W-UTA) spectral structure in the region of 45–70 Å (which is composed of <jats:italic>W</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sup>27+</jats:sup>–<jats:italic>W</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sup>45+</jats:sup> line emissions) through spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet region.

Utilization of such materials for sensing or optical modulation purposes would require a clever optical design, as by itself the 2D materials can offer only a small optical phase delay – consequence of the atomic thickness. To address this issue, we combine films of 2D semiconductors which exhibit excitonic lines with the Fabry-Perot resonators of the standard commercial SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Si substrate, in order to realize topological phase singularities in reflection. Around these singularities, reflection spectra demonstrate rapid phase changes while the structure behaves as a perfect absorber. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such topological phase singularities are ubiquitous for the entire class of atomically thin TMDCs and other high-refractive-index materials, making it a powerful tool for phase engineering in flat optics. As a practical demonstration, we employ PdSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> topological phase singularities for a refractive index sensor and demonstrate its superior phase sensitivity compared to typical surface plasmon resonance sensors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The boom in high-power-density electronics and advanced pulsed power systems has led to a requirement for high-energy-density dielectric capacitors, for which the key enabler is the availability of dielectric materials with high energy densities and high efficiencies. Although antiferroelectric ceramics are promising dielectric materials with high energy densities, they have low efficiencies. In this study, we address this problem through the core–shell structure design. A phase-field model is developed by considering the core as antiferroelectric and the shell as linear dielectric, and the polarization hysteresis loops are determined. The results show that the polarization–electric field loop of the core–shell sample is slanted, with a delayed saturation polarization, decreased maximum polarization, and declined hysteresis loss compared with the pure sample. This phenomenon becomes more distinct with increasing shell fraction and decreasing shell permittivity, and vanished hysteresis is achieved in samples with a high shell fraction and a low shell permittivity. Through deconvolution, it is determined that the underlying mechanism of energy storage is the difference in the antiferroelectric polarization contribution of various shell parameters. It is found that a giant energy density of 15.5 J/cm3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 99.7% at the saturation polarization can be achieved concurrently for a certain core–shell sample; these values considerably exceed the corresponding values (5.0 J/cm3 and 52.8%) for the pure sample. The findings of this study can serve as guidance for engineering core–shell structures, thus paving the way for enhancing the energy-storage performance of antiferroelectric ceramics.</jats:p>",

We used the cortical currents estimated from MEG and MRI to calculate Power in the <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic> (1–3 Hz), <jats:italic>θ</jats:italic> (4–7 Hz), <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> (8–13 Hz), <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> (13–30 Hz), low <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic> (35–55 Hz), and high <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic> (65–90 Hz) bands and FC in the <jats:italic>θ</jats:italic> band. PAC was evaluated using the synchronization index (SI) for eight frequency band pairs: the phases of <jats:italic>δ, θ, α</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> and the amplitudes of low and high <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>. First, we compared the mean SI values for the patients with epilepsy and the healthy participants. Then, using features such as PAC, Power, FC, and features extracted by deep learning (DL) individually or combined, we tested whether PAC improves discrimination accuracy for the two groups. <jats:italic>Main results.</jats:italic> The mean SI values were significantly different for the patients with epilepsy and the healthy participants. The SI value difference was highest for <jats:italic>θ</jats:italic>/low <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic> in the temporal lobe. Discrimination accuracy was the highest, at 90%, using the combination of PAC and DL. <jats:italic>Significance.</jats:italic> Abnormal PAC characterized the patients with epilepsy in the interictal state compared with the healthy participants, potentially improving the discrimination of epilepsy.</jats:p>",

Their systemic administration provides a causal manipulation of the attentional system, allowing measurements of the neuronal population changes that accompany artificially manipulated selective attention. We found that orally administering methylphenidate to rhesus monkeys selectively improved visual performance at only their attended spatial location, and that correspondingly specific changes in the shared variability of groups of neurons in visual area V4 occurred only when attention was directed toward the receptive fields of those neurons. Critically, methylphenidate changed behavior exactly when it changed the shared variability of the neuronal responses, suggesting that it may work through naturally selective cognitive mechanisms.</jats:p>",

However, due to the importance of the relationship between core stability and pectoral girdle, especially in archery athletes, this study aimed to investigate the effect of six weeks of core stability exercises on the internal rotator muscle strength of the glenohumeral joint and its motor function in male archers. Methods: For this purpose, 30 athletes were randomly divided into 2 groups of 15: with core stability exercises (experimental group) and without core stability exercises (control group). The motor function was measured using the upper quarter Y-balance test (UQYBT), and the muscle strength of the lumbar muscles was measured using a hand-held dynamometer (HHD). Then, the experimental group underwent a selected exercise program for 6 weeks. Both groups were tested again (post-test). SPSS software version 21 was used to analyze the collected data; also, independent and dependent samples t-tests were used to compare the data. The significance level in the test was determined at 95%. Results: Changes in posttest results on internal rotator muscle strength (P=0.001) and motor function (P=0.022) showed a significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Therefore, due to the effect of core stability exercises on the above variables, it is recommended that archery athletes, in addition to specific exercises, do such exercises to improve the function of the glenohumeral joint.</jats:p>"

This study investigated the effect of interview format changes (in-person to virtual, one-to-one to multiple-to-one) necessitated by the COVID-19 travel restrictions on preliminary fellowship candidate ranking variabilities. Design. Cross-sectional observational study. Method. In 2018 and 2019, the glaucoma fellowship interviews were conducted in-person in a one-to-one format, whereas in 2020, interviews were virtual and in a multiple (interviewers)-to-one (candidate) format. We compared ranking ranges of interviewers within the same virtual room (WSR) and not within the same virtual room (NWSR) to assess the effect of WSR versus NWSR on ranking variabilities. We also compared ranking categories (“accept,” “alternate,” and “pass”) agreements between 2018, 2019, and 2020 to assess the effect of virtual versus in-person interviews on ranking variabilities. Results. NWSR and WSR mean rankings differed by 1.33 (95% confidence interval difference 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.0003), with WSR interviewers having less variability than NWSR pairs. The variability between 2018/2019 (in-person interviews) and 2020 (virtual interviews) showed no differences between in-person and virtual interviews (weighted Kappa statistic 0.086 for 2018, 0.158 for 2019, and 0.101 for 2020; p &lt; 0.05 for all years). The overall least attractive candidate has the lowest variability; the most attractive candidate has the second lowest variability. Conclusion. Grouping interviewers WSR during the interview decreased ranking variabilities compared to NWSR, while a change from in-person to virtual interview format did not increase the ranking variabilities. This suggests that the decreased nonverbal interactions in virtual interviews do not decrease interviewers’ perceptions as applied to preliminary rankings.</jats:p>",

Methods: Thirty people with major depressive disorder and thirty normal individuals were selected using the convenience sampling method via structured clinical interviews (SCID-I &amp; SCID-II) and the psychiatric symptoms checklist (SCL-90-R) based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bell Object Relations Inventory (BORI) and Central Relationship Questionnaire (CRQ) were used to investigate the study variables. The data were analyzed by multivariate variance analysis. Results: The multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant difference between the depressed and the normal groups in the four subscales of object relationships (egocentricity, insecure attachment, social incompetence, and alienation). Findings of the Central Relationship Questionnaire (CRQ) indicate that depressed patients in all three components of wishes (higher tendency toward aggression and reluctance to intimacy), the response from the other (RO) (perception of significant others being annoying and not receiving love from them) and the Response of Self (RS) (distance and a lack of sense of independence and success) had a significant difference and a higher mean compared to the normal group. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that the style of object relationships and some core conflictual relationship themes in depressed patients is pathological, and these patients can be treated by identifying these styles and themes in therapeutic interventions.</jats:p>"

However, it is unclear how core muscle fatigue can change lower extremity kinematics.  Methods: Sixteen female bodybuilders were included in this one-group pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study. Subjects performed double leg squats twice before and immediately after the core muscles fatigue protocol. Kinematic variables of lower extremity motion in sagittal and frontal planes were recorded using two 21 megapixels digital video cameras with a sampling frequency of 50 Hz. The obtained data were analyzed for kinematics variables by Quinoa Motion Analysis Software. Paired sample t-test was used to compare kinematic variables before and after the fatigue protocol. Results: The results of this study showed that core muscles fatigue can lead to significantly decreased knee flexion (P=0.001) and increased knee valgus angels during double leg squats movement, but no difference was observed in hip flexion and ankle dorsiflexion before and after the fatigue protocol (P=0.001). Conclusion: The results showed that core muscle fatigue can negatively affect the alignment of the lower extremity and increase the risk of injury in female bodybuilders.</jats:p>"

The sensing probe is functionalized through the use of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), niobium carbide (Nb<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CTx) MXene, and creatinase (CA) enzyme. The intrinsic total internal reflection (TIR) mechanism is modified to increase the evanescent field intensity using a heterogeneous core mismatch and tapering probe structure (i.e., convex fiber-tapered seven core fiber-convex fiber (CTC) structure). Strong evanescent fields can stimulate AuNPs and induce the LSPR effect, thereby increasing probe sensitivity. The specific recognition is enhanced by Nb<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CTx MXene adsorbing more active CA enzymes. The developed sensor probe has a sensitivity and limit of detection of 3.1 pm/µM and 86.12 µM, respectively, in the linear range of 0-2000 µM. Additionally, the sensor probe's reusability, reproducibility, stability, and selectivity were evaluated, with satisfactory results obtained with impact for areas like food protein, marine life and healthcare.</jats:p>",

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can be considered a strategy for these disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effect of respiratory and core stability tele-exercises on pulmonary function and functional capacity in survivors discharged and recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was performed in Qom Province, Iran, in 2021. Thirty discharged patients voluntarily participated in this study and were randomly divided into two groups of 15 patients. Eventually, 27 patients in two groups of exercise (13 patients) and control (14 patients) completed this study. The exercise group performed respiratory and core stability tele-exercise for 8 weeks. Before and after the exercise program, pulmonary function, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and six-minute walk test (6MWT) were assessed in both groups. Mixed repeated measures test in SPSS software v. 27, was used to compare the mean of pre-test-post-test information of the groups. The significance level for this study was considered 0.05. Results: In the exercise group, a significant improvement was observed in FVC, FEV1, and 6MWT after the intervention (P≤0.05), but no significant difference was observed in the FEV1/FVC ratio (P&gt;0.05). Furthermore, a significant interaction was observed in 6MWD, FVC, FVC (predicted), FEV1, and FEV1 (predicted). However, in FEV1/FVC ratio, no significant interaction was observed between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: The results of the study showed that in the new crisis resulting from persistent complications of COVID-19, respiratory and core stability exercises by the tele-exercise method could be used as a helpful method in the rehabilitation of patients discharged and recovered from COVID-19 disease.</jats:p>"

A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted with 87 recreational runners randomly allocated to either the control (CG) or intervention (IG) group and assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. The IG underwent foot-core training 3 times/week, while the CG followed a placebo lower-limb stretching protocol. The participants ran on a force-instrumented treadmill at a self-selected speed while foot-segment motion was captured simultaneously with kinetic measurements. After the intervention, there were statistically significant changed in foot biomechanics, such as: IG participants strike the ground with a more inverted calcaneus and a less dorsiflexed midfoot than those in the CG; at midstance, ran with a less plantarflexed and more adducted forefoot and a more abducted hallux; and at push-off, ran with a less dorsiflexed midfoot and a less adducted and more dorsiflexed hallux.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus contributes to learning and memory in the healthy brain but is dysregulated in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular relationships between neural stem cell activity, adult neurogenesis, and global metabolism are largely unknown. Here we applied unbiased systems genetics methods to quantify genetic covariation among adult neurogenesis and metabolic phenotypes in peripheral tissues of a genetically diverse family of rat strains, derived from a cross between the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR/OlaIpcv) strain and Brown Norway (BN-<jats:italic>Lx</jats:italic>/Cub). The HXB/BXH family is a very well established model to dissect genetic variants that modulate metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and we have accumulated deep phenome and transcriptome data in a FAIR-compliant resource for systematic and integrative analyses. Here we measured rates of precursor cell proliferation, survival of new neurons, and gene expression in the hippocampus of the entire HXB/BXH family, including both parents. These data were combined with published metabolic phenotypes to detect a neurometabolic quantitative trait locus (QTL) for serum glucose and neuronal survival on Chromosome 16: 62.1–66.3 Mb. We subsequently fine-mapped the key phenotype to a locus that includes the Telo2-interacting protein 2 gene (<jats:italic>Tti2</jats:italic>)—a chaperone that modulates the activity and stability of PIKK kinases. To verify the hypothesis that differences in neurogenesis and glucose levels are caused by a polymorphism in<jats:italic>Tti2</jats:italic>, we generated a targeted frameshift mutation on the SHR/OlaIpcv background. Heterozygous SHR-<jats:italic>Tti2</jats:italic><jats:sup>+/-</jats:sup>mutants had lower rates of hippocampal neurogenesis and hallmarks of dysglycemia compared to wild-type littermates. Our findings highlight<jats:italic>Tti2</jats:italic>as a causal genetic link between glucose metabolism and structural brain plasticity.

For active long-pulse detachment feedback control, a 30 s H-mode operation with detachment-control duration being 25 s has been successfully achieved in EAST. DIII-D has achieved actively controlled fully detached divertor with low plasma electron temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>et,div</jats:sub> ⩽ 5 eV across the entire divertor target) and low particle flux (degree of detachment, DoD &gt; 3), simultaneously with very high core performance (<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>N</jats:sub> ∼3, <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>P</jats:sub> &gt; 2 and <jats:italic>H</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>98</jats:sub> ∼ 1.5) in the high β<jats:sub>P</jats:sub> scenario being developed for ITER and future reactors. The high-<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>P</jats:sub> high confinement scenario is characterized by an internal transport barrier (ITB) at large radius and a weak edge transport barrier (ETB, or pedestal), which are synergistically self-organized. Both the high-<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>P</jats:sub> scenario and impurity seeding facilitate divertor detachment. The detachment access leads to the reduction of ETB, which facilitates the development of an even stronger ITB at large radius in the high <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>P</jats:sub> scenario. Thus, this strong large radius ITB enables the core confinement improvement during detachment. These significant joint DIII-D and EAST advances on the compatibility of high confinement core and detached divertor show a great potential for achieving a high-performance core plasma suitable for long-pulse operation of fusion reactors with controllable steady-state PWIs.</jats:p>",

Present therapies to treat sleep-wake disturbances in those with TBI (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) are limited by marginal efficacy, poor patient acceptability, and/or high patient/provider burden. Thus, this study aimed to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of morning bright light therapy, to improve sleep in Veterans with TBI (NCT03578003). Thirty-three Veterans with history of TBI were prospectively enrolled in a single-arm, open-label intervention using a lightbox (~10,000 lux at the eye) for 60-minutes every morning for 4-weeks. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes included questionnaires related to sleep, mood, TBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pain; wrist actigraphy as a proxy for objective sleep; and blood-based biomarkers related to TBI/sleep. The protocol was rated favorably by ~75% of participants, with adherence to the lightbox and actigraphy being ~87% and 97%, respectively. Post-intervention improvements were observed in self-reported symptoms related to insomnia, mood, and pain; actigraphy-derived measures of sleep; and blood-based biomarkers related to peripheral inflammatory balance. The severity of comorbid PTSD was a significant positive predictor of response to treatment. Morning bright light therapy is a feasible and acceptable intervention that shows preliminary efficacy to treat disrupted sleep in Veterans with TBI. A full-scale randomized, placebo-controlled study with longitudinal follow-up is warranted to assess the efficacy of morning bright light therapy to improve sleep, biomarkers, and other TBI related symptoms.</jats:p>"

Understanding the complex mechanisms of tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation, as well as managing the tsunami risk, requires multidisciplinary research and infrastructures that cross national boundaries. Recent decades have seen both great advances in tsunami science and consolidation of the European tsunami research community. A recurring theme has been the need for a sustainable platform for coordinated tsunami community activities and a hub for tsunami services. Following about three years of preparation, in July 2021, the European tsunami community attained the status of Candidate Thematic Core Service (cTCS) within the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) Research Infrastructure. Within a transition period of three years, the Tsunami candidate TCS is anticipated to develop into a fully operational EPOS TCS. We here outline the path taken to reach this point, and the envisaged form of the future EPOS TCS Tsunami. Our cTCS is planned to be organised within four thematic pillars: (1) Support to Tsunami Service Providers, (2) Tsunami Data, (3) Numerical Models, and (4) Hazard and Risk Products. We outline how identified needs in tsunami science and tsunami risk mitigation will be addressed within this structure and how participation within EPOS will become an integration point for community development.    </jats:p>",

To perform quantitative proteomics of FFPE samples, paraffin has to be removed and formalin-induced crosslinks have to be reversed prior to proteolytic digestion. A central component of almost all deparaffinization protocols is xylene, a toxic and highly flammable solvent that has been reported to negatively affect protein extraction and quantitative proteome analysis. Here, we present a ‘green’ xylene-free protocol for accelerated sample preparation of FFPE tissues based on paraffin-removal with hot water. Combined with tissue homogenization using disposable micropestles and a modified protein aggregation capture (PAC) digestion protocol, our workflow enables streamlined and reproducible quantitative proteomic profiling of FFPE tissue. Label-free quantitation of FFPE cores from human ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) xenografts with a volume of only 0.79 mm3 showed a high correlation between replicates (r2 = 0.992) with a median %CV of 16.9%. Importantly, this small volume is already compatible with tissue micro array (TMA) cores and core needle biopsies, while our results and its ease-of-use indicate that further downsizing is feasible. Finally, our FFPE workflow does not require costly equipment and can be established in every standard clinical laboratory.</jats:p>"

Human and mouse tissues are used to examine whether systemic targeting of inflammation limits prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia. Evaluation of 112,152 medical records indicates that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) prevalence is significantly higher among patients with AI diseases. Furthermore, treating these patients with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-antagonists significantly decreases BPH incidence. Single-cell RNA-seq and in vitro assays suggest that macrophage-derived TNF stimulates BPH-derived fibroblast proliferation. TNF blockade significantly reduces epithelial hyperplasia, NFκB activation, and macrophage-mediated inflammation within prostate tissues. Together, these studies show that patients with AI diseases have a heightened susceptibility to BPH and that reducing inflammation with a therapeutic agent can suppress BPH.</jats:p>"

These nanobodies can protect mice from the lethal challenge of variants B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, suggesting the therapeutic potential of these nanobodies against COVID-19.

However, many POLE-mutated tumors do not respond to such treatment. To better understand the link between POLE mutation variants and response to immunotherapy, we prospectively assessed the efficacy of nivolumab in a multicenter clinical trial in patients bearing advanced mismatch repair–proficient POLE-mutated solid tumors. We found that only tumors harboring selective POLE pathogenic mutations in the DNA binding or catalytic site of the exonuclease domain presented high mutational burden with a specific single-base substitution signature, high T-cell infiltrates, and a high response rate to anti–PD-1 monotherapy. This study illustrates how specific DNA repair defects sensitize to immunotherapy. POLE proofreading deficiency represents a novel agnostic biomarker for response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>POLE proofreading deficiency leads to high tumor mutational burden with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and predicts anti–PD-1 efficacy in mismatch repair–proficient tumors. Conversely, tumors harboring POLE mutations not affecting proofreading derived no benefit from PD-1 blockade.

Previous work has demonstrated variation in reporting of patient characteristics in PPU studies, making comparison of studies and outcomes difficult. The aim of this study was to standardize the reporting of patient characteristics, by creating a core descriptor set (CDS) of important descriptors that should be consistently reported in PPU research.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Candidate descriptors were identified through systematic review and stakeholder proposals. An international Delphi exercise involving three survey rounds was undertaken to obtain consensus on key patient characteristics for future research. Participants rated items on a scale of 1–9 with respect to their importance. Items meeting a predetermined threshold (rated 7–9 by over 70 per cent of stakeholders) were included in the final set and ratified at a consensus meeting. Feedback was provided between rounds to allow refinement of ratings.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Some 116 clinicians were recruited from 29 countries. A total of 63 descriptors were longlisted from the literature, and 27 were proposed by stakeholders. After three survey rounds and a consensus meeting, 27 descriptors were included in the CDS.

KM3NeT will study atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos with two multi-purpose neutrino detectors, ARCA and ORCA, primarily aimed at GeV–PeV neutrinos. Thanks to the multi-photomultiplier tube design of the digital optical modules, KM3NeT is capable of detecting the neutrino burst from a Galactic or near-Galactic core-collapse supernova. This potential is already exploitable with the first detection units deployed in the sea. This paper describes the real-time implementation of the supernova neutrino search, operating on the two KM3NeT detectors since the first months of 2019. A quasi-online astronomy analysis is introduced to study the time profile of the detected neutrinos for especially significant events. The mechanism of generation and distribution of alerts, as well as the integration into the SNEWS and SNEWS 2.0 global alert systems, are described. The approach for the follow-up of external alerts with a search for a neutrino excess in the archival data is defined. Finally, an overview of the current detector capabilities and a report after the first two years of operation are given.</jats:p>",
