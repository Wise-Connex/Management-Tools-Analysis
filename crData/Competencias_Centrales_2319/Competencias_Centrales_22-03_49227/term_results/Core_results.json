      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artificial Intelligence for Cold Regions (AI-CORE) is a collaborative approach for applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in the field of remote sensing of the cryosphere. Several research institutes (German Aerospace Center, Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Technical University Dresden) bundled their expertise to jointly develop AI-based solutions for pressing geoscientific questions in cryosphere research. The project addresses four geoscientific use cases such as the change pattern identification of outlet glaciers in Greenland, the object identification in permafrost areas, the detection of calving fronts in Antarctica and the firn-line detection on glaciers. Within this presentation, the four AI-based final approaches for each addressed use case will be presented and exemplary results will be shown. Further on, the implementation of all developed AI-methods in three different computer centers was realized and the lessons learned from implementing several ready-to-use AI-tools in different processing infrastructures will be discussed. Finally, a best-practice example for sharing AI-implementations between different institutes is provided along with opportunities and challenges faced during the present project duration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

In this work, motivated by the recent experiment [1], we develop a microscopic quantum treatment using annihilation and creation operator of atoms in deep optical lattices. Using a diagrammatic approach on the Keldysh contour, we derive the cooperative scattering of the light and obtain the general formula for the S matrix. We apply our method to study the trapping effect, which is beyond previous treatment with spin operators. If the optical lattices are formed by light fields with magical wavelength, the result matches previous results using spin operators. When there is a mismatch between the trapping potentials for atoms in the ground state and the excited state, atomic mirrors become imperfect, with multiple resonances in the optical response. We further study the effect of recoil for large but finite trapping frequency. Our results are consistent with existing experiments.</jats:p>"

Thanks to the additivity of the integrated curvature tensor, coarse-graining procedures can be implemented to compute it over arbitrary patches of polygons.

Utilizing our construction for the entanglement wedge cross section we compute the entanglement negativity for such bipartite states through the generalization of an earlier proposal, in the context of the usual AdS/CFT scenario, to flat space holography. The entanglement negativity obtained from our construction exactly reproduces earlier holographic results and match with the corresponding field theory replica technique results in the large central charge limit.</jats:p>"

This study summarizes the steps of hybridizing a new algorithm named Core Classify Algorithm (CCA) derived from K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and an unsupervised learning partitioning algorithm (K-means), aiming to avoid the unrepresentative Cores of the clusters while finding the similarities. This hybridization step is meant to harvest the benefits of combining two algorithms by changing results through iteration to obtain the most optimal results and classifying the data according to the labels with two or more clusters with higher accuracy and better computational efficiency. Our new approach was tested on a total of five datasets from two different domains: one phishing URL, three healthcare, and one synthetic dataset. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of the CCA model in non-linear experiments representing datasets two to five was lower than that of dataset one which represented a linear classification and achieved an accuracy of 100%, equal in rank with Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that hybridization can be used to exploit flaws in specific algorithms to further improve their performance.</jats:p>"

We review systematically the literature on HSPC-GT to describe survival, genotoxicity and engraftment of gene corrected cells. From 1995 to 2020, 55 trials for 14 diseases met inclusion criteria and 406 patients with primary immunodeficiencies (55.2%), metabolic diseases (17.0%), haemoglobinopathies (24.4%) and bone marrow failures (3.4%) were treated with gammaretroviral vector (γRV) (29.1%), self-inactivating γRV (2.2%) or lentiviral vectors (LV) (68.7%). The pooled overall incidence rate of death is 0.9 per 100 person-years of observation (PYO) (95% CI = 0.37–2.17). There are 21 genotoxic events out of 1504.02 PYO, which occurred in γRV trials (0.99 events per 100 PYO, 95% CI = 0.18–5.43) for primary immunodeficiencies. Pooled rate of engraftment is 86.7% (95% CI = 67.1–95.5%) for γRV and 98.7% (95% CI = 94.5–99.7%) for LV HSPC-GT (p = 0.005).

The question is whether or not the order of the core plugs in the composite core make a difference to the absolute and relative permeability measurements? The seminal work by Huppler (1969), proposed ordering individual core samples harmonically in a composite core in order to match the overall permeability. Langaas (1998) proposed ordering the core samples in decreasing permeability for effective relative permeability measurements, based on theoretical framework of North Sea sandstones. In this paper we tested the methods proposed by Huppler and Langaas experimentally. Core samples with permeability ranging from 50 mD to 2 Darcy were used for this work. The orientation of the core samples was tested for permeability and relative permeability and compared with the theoretical model developed by Langaas. In addition to the experimental work, simulations were performed with the three different composite cores and the representative recovery factor was compared to provide the appropriate composite core arrangement.</jats:p>",

This research uses a unique combination of measurements in an ice core and a sediment core collected within the same watershed (Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada) to determine how the relative importance of Hg inputs from atmospheric and terrestrial sources has changed over the last century. Hg accumulation in Lake Hazen sediment began increasing dramatically in the mid- 1990s, exhibiting a decoupling from atmospheric sources (as estimated from the ice core record), due to the increased importance of remobilized terrestrial Hg inputs to Lake Hazen. Increasing glacier melt and permafrost thaw slumping have increased the delivery of catchment Hg, via glacial rivers, into Lake Hazen. These results show that climate change is likely to slow the recovery of glacierized Arctic watersheds from Hg contamination, countering the anticipated benefit from recent international efforts to reduce anthropogenic Hg emissions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Both codes use a Lagrangian vertical coordinate with conservative remapping. The ocean variant solves the incompressible multi-layer shallow water equations with inhomogeneous density layers. Time integration uses barotropic&amp;amp;#8211;baroclinic mode splitting via a semi-implicit free surface formulation, which is about 34-44 times faster than an unsplit explicit time-stepping. The barotropic and baroclinic estimates of the free surface are reconciled at each time step using layer dilation. No slip boundary conditions at coastlines are approximated using volume penalization. The vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients are computed from a closure model based on turbulent kinetic energy. Results are presented for a standard set of ocean model test cases adapted to the sphere (seamount, upwelling and baroclinic turbulence). An innovative feature of WAVETRISK-OCEAN is that it could be coupled easily to the WAVETRISK atmosphere model, thus providing a first building block toward an integrated Earth-system model using a consistent modelling framework with dynamic mesh adaptivity and mimetic properties.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

This study explored and identified potential biomarkers for PA.\nMaterials and methods\n To identify potential core genes in PA that may provide new therapeutic insights, we analyzed three gene chips (GSE50161, GSE66354, GSE86574) screened from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) from the tissues of PA and normal brain were screened using GEO2R. To determine the functional annotation and pathway of DEG, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted using DAVID database. Protein interactions of DEG were visualized using PPI network on Cytoscape software. Next, 10 Hub nodes were screened from the differentially expressed network using DMNC algorithm on CytoHubba software and subsequently identified as Hub genes. Finally, the relationship between Hub genes and the prognosis of PA patients was described using GEPIA2 survival analysis web tool.\nResults\n A total of 37 up-regulated and 144 down-regulated genes were identified through microarray analysis. Amongst the 10 Hub genes selected, SLC12A5 and RAB3C are associated with poor prognosis in a Pilocytic astrocytoma based on the survival analysis.\nConclusion\n Our study suggests that low expression of SLC12A5 and RAB3C are associated with poor prognosis in PA patients, whether they can be used as a new therapeutic target for PA.</jats:p>"

It was found that the mildly cleaned chalk core was slightly water-wet, and the harshly cleaned core appeared to have changed to a more water-wet state. Therefore, the solvent pair, kerosene-heptane, preserved more polar components at the carbonate surface than the toluene-methanol pair, the latter, was more effective in solvating and removing polar components from the rock surface, showing increased capillary forces in the SI test with heptane.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The last stage of the study aimed to reproduce the first induced wettability, this was carried out in two cores after a mild cleaning process. It was possible to closely reproduce the initial wetting of these cores. This was accomplished by controlling the injected amount of mild cleaning solvents and crude oil during the second restoration process. These results represent a successful first phase of research towards wettability reproduction and improved reservoir wettability evaluation. Furthermore, it represents a solid and modern alternative to the traditional SCAL approach.</jats:p>",

The NP–RNA complex constitutes the core structure for the assembly of the nucleocapsid that is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although appropriate interactions among NPs and RNA are required for the formation of nucleocapsid, the structural basis of the helical assembly remains largely elusive. Here, we show the structure of the MARV NP–RNA complex determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.1 Å. The structures of the asymmetric unit, a complex of an NP and six RNA nucleotides, was very similar to that of EBOV, suggesting that both viruses share common mechanisms for the nucleocapsid formation. Structure-based mutational analysis of both MARV and EBOV NPs identified key residues for helical assembly and subsequent viral RNA synthesis. Importantly, most of the residues identified were conserved in both viruses. These findings provide a structural basis for understanding the nucleocapsid formation and contribute to the development of novel antivirals against MARV and EBOV.</jats:p>"

When the FCF was substantially tapered, the asymmetric supermodes were produced to generate interferences through this corner-core excitation scheme. During tapering, the supermodes were excited based on a tri-core structure initially and then transited to a rectangular quadruple-core structure gradually to reach the sensitivity of 185.18 pm/μԑ under a tapered diameter of 3 μm.

How does morality arise in human development? One possibility is that morality is acquired through years of socialization and active learning. Alternatively, morality is instead based on a “moral core”: primitive abilities to make sense of morally relevant behaviors that emerge in infancy. Here, we review evidence that infants and toddlers understand a variety of morally relevant behaviors, and readily evaluate agents who engage in them. These abilities appear rooted in the goals and intentions driving agents’ morally relevant behaviors, and are sensitive to group membership. This evidence is consistent with a moral core, which may support later social and moral development, and ultimately be leveraged for human cooperation.</p>"

As it is clear, the scattering peaks for red, green, and blue are different because of the physics of the scattering that is wavelength-dependent. Thus, the optimum ratio for each color should be obtained. The numerical method of Finite-Difference Time-Domain is used to simulate and calculate the optical properties of the proposed transparent monitor. The effect of different combinations of nanoparticles to have the maximum dispersion at blue, green, and red wavelengths and the minimum absorption at other wavelengths has been investigated.

Coriolis force splits the buoyant heat exchanging liquid into the two, north and south hemispheres, each with its unique handedness of spiraling convection systems. Convection spiraling model of the core fluid revealed that any planetary dynamo with a liquid conducitng core must have a two-component bimodal structure magnetic contribution, where, for Earth, the southern hemisphere is always associated with a dominating normal polarity component and northern hemisphere with a dominating component of reverse magnetic polarity.

This observation of predominance of magnetic polarity durations is constrained by the existing temperature models near the core/mantle boundary (CMB) and we show a novel connection how a lower mantle temperature distribution may reorganize its convection pattern in the core and change the stability of the dipolar field in favor of a specific polarity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The concept of this method is based on a core drill that will be equipped with a multi-probe sensor working at &amp;amp;#160;radio and&amp;amp;#160; microwave frequencies. The objective of the presented research focuses on the study of the multi-probe sensor that was carried out on sandy soils and clay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This solution is based on reflection and transmission measurements using several probes arranged on the circumference of a metal tube. The use of various probes allows us on one hand to detect thresholds of the water in soil and on the other hand to diagnose the homogeneity of the material under test. This sensor is incorporated in a test bench composed of a VNA and a Switch Matrix that allows the VNA to connect with the 6 probes of the sensor. The measurements are the reflection of each probe and the transmission between two identified probes in a band of frequencies between 100MHz and 12GHz.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first series of measurements with the multiprobe sensor was carried out on sand containing 0 to 20% water with increments of 5%. From the reflection coefficient values of each probe and the transmissions between two respective probes, we were able to verify the variation related to the increase of the water content in the sand. This determination of the water content is made from the modulus of the reflection coefficient and the different cases of transmissions between two probes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In conclusion, a new concept of a multi-probe sensor, for the determination of a soil moisture profile in the relatively loose and homogeneous sandy and clayey soil has been developed and tested. Thus, we were able to evaluate thresholds of water content in the sand of around 5% with this sensor. In order to continue the study of the sensor, we now plan to test more complex soils, but especially to extrapolate this multi-probe sensor to a system using a core drill to increase the depth of testing. This is a solution to characterize soils without sampling them. Especially, it is hoped that with the developed sensor a soil profile can be measured down to several meters in depth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Acknowledgment&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; : This work has been supported by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange under Grant No. PPI/APM/2018/1/00048/U/001.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, the effect of core stability training (CST) in CS performance is not clear. Purpose: Evaluating the effect of an eight-week functional CST on young rhythmics gymnasts’ CS performance. Method: A sample of 45 young female rhythmic gymnasts from a competitive team (age = 10.5 ± 1.8 years, height = 144.1 ± 10.6 cm, weight 38.2 ± 8.9 kg, peak height velocity (PHV) = 12.2 ± 0.6 years) participated in the study. The participants were randomly allocated into the control group (CG) and experimental group (EG) and completed pre-tests and post-tests of specific CS tests using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). The CS was assessed by the bent knee fall out (BKFO), the active straight leg raise (ASLR) tests and the pelvic tilt test, all performed on the right and left sides. The EG (n = 23) performed an eight-week functional CST program based on rhythmic gymnastics (RG) technical requirements added to the traditional RG training sessions. Meanwhile, the CG (n = 22) received the traditional RG training sessions. Results: Mixed model analysis showed non-significant interaction effects; however, the ANOVA omnibus test showed a time effect (p &lt; 0.05) in right BKFO (F1,42 = 4.60; p = 0.038) and both pelvic tilt tests (right F1,42 = 22.01, p &lt; 0.001; left F1,42 = 19.13, p &lt; 0.001).

Conclusions: Adding a functional CST to regular training showed a trend in improving the performance of CS-related variables, which could help improve RG-specific performance. Coaches working with rhythmic gymnasts should consider adding a functional CST to regular training to improve CS performance leading to increased specific RG performance.</jats:p>"

Because the CMB is a material boundary between silicate rocks and molten iron, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;CMB&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; cannot be deduced directly from a single phase diagram. Estimates from mineral physics extrapolate either the solidus of mantle rocks to large pressure, or the ICB temperature to lower pressure, assuming that the outer core is adiabatic. Here, we propose a new approach to the determination of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;CMB&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; based on the analysis of observed lateral variations in shear-wave seismic velocity, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;V&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, and attenuation, measured with the quality factor &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Q&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, in the lowermost mantle. Shear velocity is sensitive to the presence of post-perovskite (pPv), a high pressure phase of bridgmanite that is stable at lowermost mantle conditions. Because the stability field of pPv strongly depends on temperature, the presence of this phase and its impact on &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;V&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; provides a constraint on the horizontally averaged temperature in the lowermost mantle. On another hand, seismic attenuation is a thermally activated process, implying that its amplitude depends on temperature. At a given depth, and using an appropriate modeling of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Q&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;S&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, its deviation from a global average can then give access to the average temperature at this depth. Our approach is based on the knowledge of several parameters, of which the temperature of the phase transition to pPv, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;pPv&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, appears to be the most sensitive.

Annual layers, although potentially preserved, can be thinned to a millimeter scale or even below. However, for many palaeoclimate studies these are the most interesting sections. Within the WACSWAIN (WArm Climate Stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet in the last Interglacial) project we aim to investigate particularly the basal part of an ice core recently drilled to bedrock at the Skytrain Ice Rise in West Antarctica. Our aim is to obtain unique information on the state of the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf during the last interglacial (LIG). To achieve this we have set up a system to perform using high-resolution laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma &amp;amp;#8211; mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) measurements using a cryocell stage on selected segments of the ice core. Here we present first results of system performance including assessment of measurement sensitivity and precision with respect to analyses of the most relevant components, including sodium, magnesium, calcium and aluminium. We report on the sample preparation technique as well as the resulting process blank. We evaluate the horizontal variability of the LA-ICP-MS signal across the ice core and the representativity of the high-resolution signal for an overall impurity content for different depth levels in the core. The results of the laser ablation ICP-MS measurements are then compared to low-resolution chemistry data from continuous flow analysis of the Skytrain ice core performed on the ice from the same depth. This comparison aims to evaluate the capabilities of the method in terms of improving depth resolution and annual variability. In a first application, sections of 80cm of ice from five different depth intervals covering time frames from late Holocene to the LIG are analysed via LA-ICP-MS and compared for their overall impurity content as well their signal variability. Finally, the potential of the method for resolving annual layers and fast changing climate signals within the core section covering the time period of the late last interglacial (about 115 - 120 ky before present) is investigated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

One contributing factor may be the continued reliance on listening texts and activities that position the learner as a bystander rather than a participant. In response, the concept of interactive listening has drawn considerable attention in ELT. What has been largely missing, however, is the application of principles drawn from the last twenty years or so of empirical research in fields such as conversation analysis which reveal how interactions actually unfold for listeners. This article identifies five core concepts that may be fundamental to further developing a robust approach to listening in interaction: participation status, meaning as action, projection, participatory listenership, and recipient design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given their small sizes and low central pressures, the cores of most asteroids are expected to have started crystallising at the core mantle boundary (CMB) instead of at their centre, as is the case for the Earth. This so-called top-down crystallisation is thermally unstable but compositionally stable, making the conditions for dynamo generation more difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, modern observations of Ganymede show an active magnetic field, where it has been suggested that solidification occurs away from the CMB as an iron snow. This model proposes that iron crystals grow in a snow zone and subsequently sink into the interior and melt, releasing dense fluid that drives convection and a magnetic field. However, whether this process could have occurred in asteroid cores is uncertain due to the significantly smaller adiabatic temperature difference between the CMB and the centre of their cores. This weak temperature gradient may also prevent crystallisation away from the CMB. Therefore, the power for a compositional dynamo may result from an increase in convective velocities caused by the formation of dense crystals at the CMB or turbulence caused by the settling of the crystals themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To investigate these possibilities, we employ analogue tank experiments to explore the possible mechanisms driving convection during inward asteroid core crystallisation. An ammonium chloride solution is cooled from above with a layer of buoyant propanol separating the solution from the cold plate to prevent the growth of crystals on this boundary. Instead, the crystals form below the buoyant layer in a &amp;amp;#8216;snow zone&amp;amp;#8217;. We vary the temperature difference across this buoyant layer to investigate the different regimes that may exist. At each driving temperature difference, we measure the velocity fields of any fluid flow within the ammonium chloride solution using particle imaging velocimetry. This enables us to compare the convective velocities with and without crystallisation as well as develop scaling laws to apply the results of these experiments to models of core thermal evolution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We find that the mean convective speeds increase by over an order of magnitude when the fluid is crystallising. This increase in speed is driven by an increase in the bulk density of the fluid in the snow zone due to the presence of a small crystal fraction. While the motion of crystals themselves do not induce any turbulence in the fluid due to their small size, they act to locally increase the density of the fluid, causing dense, crystal-rich plumes to emanate from the snow zone, which drive faster convective speeds throughout the fluid. This result provides a new mechanism for dynamo generation in inwardly crystallising cores, especially if remelting of falling iron crystals is delayed until deep within the core&amp;amp;#8217;s interior, as has recently been proposed for Mars, or if there is a nucleation barrier that causes significant undercooling before the onset of crystallisation. We also measure the temperature and composition as a function of depth within the tank, from which we may assess whether thermal equilibrium can be assumed when modelling snow zones in cores.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Waves associated with the magnetic field can leave a signature in the observed geomagnetic field, which may allow one to infer properties of the core. Among those, a balance of magnetic, Coriolis and pressure forces forms a type of waves known as Magneto-Coriolis (MC) waves. Previous studies of MC wave have mostly been focused on the ideal limit (without magnetic diffusion and viscous dissipation) with a columnar ansatz for the flow field. In this study, we investigate this problem by retaining the magnetic diffusion and three-dimensional flows in a full sphere. With several choices of axisymmetric background magnetic field, we analyse various branches of normal modes. The &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;dependence of the normal mode's structure on the background field is clearly seen. A westward propagating branch with perfect columnar flows is found for some background &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;B&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.

All of the constructs rest upon a formalization of the minimal experimental entity—the registered micro-event, detector click.

The transform fault system is consisting of two parallel transform faults, the North and South Ascension Fracture Zone, sandwiching a ~20 km long ridge segment, which we name Ascension Fracture Zone segment. The segment shows strong topographical variations and corrugated surfaces typical for detachment faults that form oceanic core complexes. An elongated massif approximately 50 km east of the ridge axis with transform-parallel striations of over 100 km on top, indicate a detachment fault active for several million years. This would be one of the longest transform-parallel corrugated surface observed anywhere in the oceans. The question arises whether the corrugations belong to one OCC, representing a rather stable crustal accretion, or if several OCCs have been developed, representing a rather variable crustal accretion. Changes in melt supply influence the crustal structure, which in turn can be recognised by seismic methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RV Meteor (cruise M62-4) set out to acquire seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection data along a 265 km long spreading parallel transect to image the crustal velocity distribution and the crustal thickness of the intervening short AFZ segment. Densely spaced, every ~9.25 km, ocean bottom seismometers recorded P-wave and converted S-wave energy emitted from a 64 l G-gun cluster at a shot interval of 60 s, equal to ~125 m shot distance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The results reveal P-wave velocities that vary along the profile from 3.5 km/s to 5 km/s at the seafloor and reach 7.2 km/s in ~6 km depth at the ridge axis and at 3 km to 4 km depth under the ridge shoulders. At larger offsets to the ridge axis. S-wave velocities vary from 2 km/s to 2.5 km/s at the seafloor and increase to 3.5 km/s in ~2 km depth east of the ridge axis, while the S-wave velocities west of the ridge axis show a lower velocity gradient and reach 3.5 km/s in 3 km to 4 km depth. A Vp/Vs ratio &amp;gt;1.9 is observed in areas where seafloor corrugations have been observed. These areas are interpreted as serpentinised mantle material. However, the high Vp/Vs ratio seems to be limited to the upper 1.5 km to 2 km of the subsurface, indicating that the hydration of the seafloor is limited to that depth. The eastern ridge flank is dominated by a high Vp/Vs ratio for offsets larger than 40 km from the ridge axis, however, it is interrupted by small stripes of Vp/Vs &amp;lt;1.9. Thus, in the short AFZ segment, detachment faulting seem to occur continuously over a long period with short interruptions when the magmatic budged exceeds a certain upper limit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Physically, this resonance corresponds to the excitation of free mode whereby the liquid core experiences a global rotation of uniform vorticity, hence its name: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Free Core Nutation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (FCN).&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In parallel, experimental and theoretical studies of fluid dynamics have since long demonstrated that rotating fluids can support oscillatory motions known as inertial waves, which are due to the restoring effect of the Coriolis force. In planetary situations where the fluid domain is bounded by solid boundaries, these oscillations become global, so that they are sometimes referred to as &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;inertial modes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Spin-Over Mode&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (SOM), is the simplest of these inertial mode, with uniform vorticity. Because of this and the fact that the SOM, like the FCN, has a near-diurnal frequency, the two modes have often been identified as one and the same. In a former study, we showed that the FCN is in fact a generalization of the SOM to the case of a (non-steadily) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;freely rotating planet&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (Rekier et al 2020).&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the present work, we analyse the relation between the SOM and the FCN in more details by showing how the two modes can, in fact, coexist together in a planet subjected to external gravitational forcing.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is the most prominent compositional boundary inside the Earth. Its topography provides insight on lower mantle flow and the thermochemical structure above the CMB. Yet, CMB topography remains challenging to observe and estimates from seismology vary substantially. Numerical models of mantle convection provide complementary means to estimate CMB topography. Classically, topography is determined from the normal stresses acting on the CMB. However, this is known to face severe complications when applied to the surface boundary of the mantle, leading to non-Earth-like topographic scales and a different style of subduction. A (quasi-)free surface yields more Earth-like predictions, but for the CMB this comparison has never been made.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here, we compare CMB topography predicted from mantle convection modelling using different treatments of the CMB. Specifically, we test the role of a &amp;amp;#8216;sticky core&amp;amp;#8217;, a quasi-fluid approximation the core. We compare results predicted by different codes (with either sticky core or true free base) and compare to a simple analytical case. Also, we simulate the evolution of subduction and deep thermochemical provinces to compare the topography of the (quasi-)free CMB and the free-slip approach. Initial results indicate that the sticky core approach can reproduce CMB topography reasonably well, but has rather high computational cost (grid resolution, number of particles). In analogy to the sticky air at the surface, the viscosity contrast of the sticky core layer determines the quality of predicted topography, with larger contrasts (&amp;amp;#8805;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) leading to acceptable levels of artificial CMB topography. In dynamic flow cases with vigorous mantle convection, entrainment by plumes further complicates application of the sticky core, but can be tackled with an unmixing procedure. A true free base tends to better accuracy than the sticky core approach and avoids the problem with entrainment, but it also comes with additional computational costs as various forces at the CMB have to be taken into account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

But the timing of the key transition to stronger intensities typical of the Phanerozoic Eon, needed for establishing an exact onset age, has been unclear. We present single crystal paleointensity results from anorthosites of the early Cambrian (~532 million-year-old) Glen Mountains Layered Mafic Complex (Oklahoma).

Our ultimate aim is to improve current constraints on seismic anomalies in the inner core by combining normal mode data and body wave data in a joint tomographic inversion. While the body wave data is sensitive to regional scale seismic P-wave anisotropy in the inner core, normal modes provide long wavelength information on density, P-wave anisotropy and S-wave anisotropy.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have produced a high resolution 3D seismic model of inner core isotropic and anisotropic velocity variations using a transdimensional methodology with body waves. In the transdimensional approach, the inversion itself determines the parameterization. It is encouraging to find many well know features, such as a hemispherical differences between a slow and strongly anisotropic western region and a fast and only weakly anisotropic eastern hemisphere, without a priori imposing those in our parameterization. We are now interested to see if the features seen using body waves are consistent with those seen by normal modes. We measure inner core sensitive normal modes using the splitting function approximation in a way which thoroughly explores the splitting function measurement model space. This then allows us to quantify the uncertainty in individual splitting function coefficients for each mode.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Progress on seismic imaging of the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s inner core (IC) is fairly limited by the uneven distribution of sources and receivers; large earthquakes are primarily confined to plate margins, and seismic stations are unevenly deployed on the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s surface. Advances in data processing techniques and new methods are required to bridge new opportunities to probe the centre of our planet and provide us with valuable information on the IC seismic structure and its surrounding dynamics.&amp;amp;#160;In this study, we present a newly-developed method based on the global earthquake coda-correlation wavefield to investigate the anisotropic structure of the IC. Anisotropy in seismic velocity is the directional dependence of seismic waves. Under IC pressure and temperature conditions, different phases of iron &amp;amp;#8211; the core&amp;amp;#8217;s main mineral constituent can stabilize and form elastic anisotropy. Thus, improved constraints on its strength and distribution are required to understand the crystallographic structure of iron in the IC, which is linked to the evolution of its solidification and deformation processes.&amp;amp;#160;Here, we stack the cross-correlation functions of the late-coda seismic wavefield (the correlation wavefield) that reverberates within the Earth up to 10 hours after large earthquakes. We analyse the travel times of the I2* correlation feature, a mathematical manifestation of similarity among IC seismic phases with the same slowness detected in global correlograms at&amp;amp;#160;small interstation distances (&amp;lt;10&amp;amp;#176;). The I2* spatial sampling offers an unprecedented data coverage of the IC&amp;amp;#8217;s central portion, also known as the innermost IC (IMIC), which overcomes the shortage of the traditional approach using PKIKP ray paths sampling. By comparing the time residuals of different paths of I2* propagating through the IC, we confirm the presence of a deep IC structure with anisotropy fundamentally different from the IC&amp;amp;#8217;s outer layers. Our observations support an IMIC cylindrical anisotropy model with a slow direction oriented 55&amp;amp;#176; from the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s spin axis. This new evidence reinforces previous inferences on the existence of the IMIC, with implications for our understanding of the core&amp;amp;#8217;s geodynamical evolution. In the future, a similar approach could be applied to advance our understanding of anisotropy in the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s mantle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To understand the causal relationship between forcing (orbital parameters, greenhouse gas concentration&amp;amp;#8230;) and the climate change, dating climate archives is crucial. Ice cores are unique archives because they provide a direct record of greenhouse gas concentration. However, dating ice cores is particular since they require two chronologies: one for the ice and one for the younger air trapped in bubbles inside the core. The coherent AICC2012 chronology was established for five ice cores: EPICA Dome C (EDC), EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML), North Greenland Ice core Project (NGRIP), Vostok (VK) and TALos Dome Ice CorE (TALDICE). A sedimentation model was used to reconstruct past variations of three parameters: accumulation of snow at surface, ice layer thinning in depth and Lock-In-Depth (LID), the depth where air is trapped. Ice and gas ages along the core are estimated from these parameters. Then, a Bayesian tool optimised the age scale by constraining the chronology to respect chronological observations (orbital tuning, stratigraphic links between cores, tephra layers&amp;amp;#8230;) and by fitting the three parameters to background scenarios (accumulation deduced from ice isotopes, LID from &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;N, &amp;amp;#8230;). The AICC2012 chronology is associated with an uncertainty which arises up to 6 kyrs due to the discontinuity of the ice core composition records and to the poor knowledge when it comes to choose an optimised target for orbital tuning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since AICC2012, many new data have been obtained to improve the ice core chronology and it is the right period to produce an updated coherent chronology which could also be extended to other ice cores. Here, we present a first step toward the construction of the next coherent ice core chronology by including new dating constraints from recent data on the EDC ice core: 1) air isotopes (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;atm&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; , &amp;amp;#948;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; /N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) and air content used as orbital dating constraints, 2) the &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;N signal used to estimate the background scenario for LID. In addition, we make use of the East Asian stalagmite &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;calcite&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; signal as an alternative synchronisation target for the &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;atm &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;(Extier et al. 2018).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This new dating experiment on EDC ice core aims to lower uncertainty of the chronology while providing a critical look on former hypotheses considered to establish AICC2012. For example, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;N record was discontinuous at the time and it has been reconstructed based on its correlation with &amp;amp;#948;D. Now that we have a continuous &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;N signal, we can evaluate the relevance of this reconstruction. Following this work, we will use new tie point constraints resulting from volcanic synchronisation which has recently been undertaken between Greenland and Antarctica (Svensson et al. 2020) and the ice cores Dome Fuji and WAIS Divide will be further studied to be included in the chronology.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

This article focuses on how the use of digital sharing platforms by customers to share products and services helps to increase the saving of natural resources and support sustainable development.

(1) Literature review: The theoretical part starts with the revision of definitions of sharing activities; descriptions of the links between sharing and sustainable development, policy recommendations, and relevant regulation in the field. Further on, the study emphasises key elements, including ICT ones, that are important for sharing. Finally, the authors investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected sharing activities in previously published studies. (2) Methods: During empirical research, the authors revised a list of 33 variables, among which are 16 indicators describing network infrastructure, internet literacy and online shopping. The study uses data for each of the 27 EU countries from 2011 to 2020. The authors investigated correlations between macroeconomics and other variables to determine key variables for the regression model. (3) Results: The authors constructed a dynamic regression model that can be applied to predict the number of participants visiting digital sharing platforms in the European Union (EU). (4) Conclusions: The study shows that, when seeking to forecast the number of visits to digital sharing platforms, it is necessary to use values of main macroeconomic and ICT variables. Among these variables, ICT based indicators are highly dominating.</jats:p>"

They are often associated to heavy rainfall and flooding, intense wind, and high waves and storm surge, and can be serious threats to human life and infrastructure. Recent studies highlighted that extra-tropical and tropical-like cyclone characteristics can alternate or even coexist in the same cyclonic system, and that only in some cases strong diabatic forcing leads to tropical-like transition (i.e., purely barotropic structure). In this study the satellite measurements from the NASA/JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory (GPM-CO) active and passive microwave (MW) sensors are used to analyze the precipitation structure of the most intense Mediterranean Hurricane (Medicane) on record, named Ianos, which swept across the Ionian Sea between 14 and 18 September 2020. Two GPM-CO overpasses, available during Ianos development and tropical-like cyclone (mature) phase, are analyzed in detail. GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) measurements are used to carry out a comparative analysis of the medicane precipitation structure and microphysics processes between the two phases. The GPM-CO Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) overpass, available for the first time during a medicane mature phase, provides key measurements and products to analyze the 3D precipitation structure in the rainbands, offering further evidence of the main precipitation microphysics processes inferred from the passive MW measurement analysis. Substantial difference in the rainband precipitation structure is observed, with deeper convection and stronger updraft features during development then at the mature phase, when also shallow precipitation/warm rain processes are observed in the inner region around the medicane eye. These features play a key role to explain the substantial drop in lightning activity during Ianos mature phase. Graupel-ice electrification process is inhibited due to the combined effect of strong horizontal wind and the observed limited growth of graupel. Starting from the detailed analysis of Ianos, a comparative study among the medicanes occurred during the GPM era is carried out. The goal is to extract common features from PMW measurements characterizing the different stage of medicanes&amp;amp;#8217; evolution. The study demonstrates the value of the GPM-CO not only to characterize medicane precipitation structure and microphysics processes and convection strength with unprecedented detail, but also to provide evidence of tropical-like characteristics and of similarities with tropical cyclones for those medicanes undergoing tropical-like transition during their mature phase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The study aims to define the core promoter of <italic>CCKAR</italic>, and to identify variants associated with expression activity.<bold>Methods and results</bold>: The 21-kb region around the <italic>CCKAR</italic> was re-sequenced to detect sequence variants. A series of 5’-deleted promoter plasmids were constructed to define the core promoter of <italic>CCKAR</italic>. Effect of sequence variants located in promoter (PSNP) and conserved (CSNP) regions on promoter activity was analyzed by comparing luciferase activity between haplotypes. A total of 182 variants were found in the 21-kb region. But no large structural variants were found. The pNL-328/+183, the one with the shortest insertion, showed the highest activity among six promoter constructs. To find out variants associated with <italic>CCKAR</italic> expression, this study compared promoter activities between haplotypes on each construct. We detected significant difference of promoter activities between haplotypes on four of six promoter constructs. The high-growth haplotype of pNL-1646/+183, pNL-799/+183 and pNL-528/+183 showed lower activities than the low-growth haplotype, which is in the direct with decreased expression of <italic>CCKAR</italic> in high-growth chickens. The expected difference was also detected on the CSNP5-containing construct.<bold>Conclusions</bold>: The data reveals the core promoter of <italic>CCKAR</italic> located within the 328-bp region upstream from the transcription start site. Low promoter activities shown the high-growth haplotypes in the reporter assay suggest that CSNP5 and promoter variants form promising molecular basis for decreased expression of <italic>CCKAR</italic> and high growth of chickens.</p>"

While the ice flow and heat flux regime at the drilling site will largely determine the age, as well as the nominal temporal resolution of the deeper parts of the BELDC core, molecular diffusion in solid ice will play a significant role in the effective temporal resolution of the &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O signal.

While iron-based catalysts are in principle suitable for that purpose, the active metal Fe undergoes complex transformation during the chemical reaction process. However, only little is known on the change in catalytically active species under reaction conditions, primarily caused by structural changes in the catalyst material, so far. By using core-shell model-materials, factors that alter the catalyst structure can be excluded, making it possible to observe the direct influence of the reactants on the activity in the present work. Furthermore, stoichiometric analysis is used as a key tool for the evaluation of individual key reactions in the complex reaction network purely from experimental data and thus, makes it possible to draw conclusions about the catalyst state. In the case of CO hydrogenation, the presumed Boudouard reaction and the associated carburization of the catalyst can be quantified and the main reaction (CO methanation) can be determined. The results of CO2 hydrogenation show that here mainly reverse water-gas-shift reaction takes place, but under ongoing change of the catalytic active iron phase. Due to the systematic exchange between CO and CO2 in the reactant gas stream, a mutual influence could also be observed. The results from stoichiometric analysis provide the basis for the development of kinetic models for the key reactions in future work.</jats:p>"

In the literary domain, as an intentional act that involves trespassing, and the breaking of rules performed in explicit ways, transgression is often linked to language and form, and also to questions of gender, politics, social behaviour. The following articles, while dwelling on transgression, locate it within the area of children’s fiction, thus operating a first preliminary transgression, inasmuch as this kind of literature has been traditionally moulded by the romantic and pastoral fallacy of childhood as an innocent, untainted, happy condition, and, in turn, by the Victorian cult of the child that thrived on aesthetically idealized representations of childhood and youth, teeming with sound moral principles, healthy didacticism, excellent examples of virtue.</jats:p>",

Because numerical simulations and turbulent convection models predict exponentially decreasing radial rms turbulent velocity, a popular treatment for overshoot mixing is to apply a diffusion process with an exponentially decreasing diffusion coefficient. It is important to investigate the parameters of the diffusion coefficient because they determine the efficiency of the mixing in the overshoot region. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of the core overshoot mixing on the properties of the core in solar models. We have constrained the parameters of the overshoot model by using helioseismic inferences and the observation of the solar 8B neutrino flux. For solar-mass stars, the core overshoot mixing helps to prolong the lifetime of the convective core developed at the zero-age main sequence. If the strength of the mixing is sufficiently high, then the convective core in a solar model could survive until the present solar age, leading to large deviations of the sound speed and density profiles compared with the helioseismic inferences. The 8B neutrino flux also favours a radiative solar core. These observations provide a constraint on the parameters of the exponential diffusion model of the convective overshoot mixing. A limited asteroseismic investigation of 13 Kepler low-mass stars with 1.0 &amp;lt; M/M⊙ &amp;lt; 1.5 shows a mass-dependent range of the overshoot parameter. The overshoot mixing processes for different elements are analysed in detail. It is found that the exponential diffusion overshoot model leads to different effective overshoot mixing lengths for elements with different nuclear equilibrium time-scales.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was often shown how the anisotropy (due to turbulence) in the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s outer core strongly influences some convection processes very important in the Core Dynamics. For instance, it was described how some instabilities in rotating magnetoconvection, described as usually by the analysis in term of normal modes, depend strictly on the anisotropic diffusion. Thus, we developed many&amp;amp;#160;models concerning the marginal modes (stationary and oscillating modes) of rotating magnetoconvection with different cases of anisotropy in the viscosity, thermal and magnetic diffusivities. In all cases, an anisotropy greater in the vertical direction parallel to gravity (&amp;amp;#8220;atmospheric anisotropy&amp;amp;#8221;) facilitates the convection, while an anisotropy greater in horizontal directions (&amp;amp;#8220;oceanic anisotropy&amp;amp;#8221;) inhibits some types of convection. This is linked with the balance among Magnetic, Archimedean and Coriolis forces in the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s outer core. &amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After recalling these former results concerning marginal modes, we present new results concerning the most unstable modes, namely the ones with maximum growth rate, with isotropic and anisotropic diffusivities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Firstly, the state of the art about this topic in isotropic conditions is reminded, then our new approach on it is presented. We show that assuming a time-dependence only in the temperature perturbation (we call it T-case), like it was done in some former works, does not describe properly these modes in the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s outer core. Indeed, this implies that some types of convection would occur only with some values of the dimensionless numbers unrealistic for the Earth (e.g., with too huge values of the Ekman numbers). We study the most general isotropic case (and we christen it G-case), namely the most unstable modes of convection with temperature, velocity and magnetic perturbations time-dependent. In this case the convection is much more facilitated than in the T-case: it occurs with much smaller values of Ekman and Elsasser numbers. Another model (named by us Q-case) with very small magnetic Prandtl number, namely with magnetic diffusivity much greater than viscosity, is considered. The Q-case results are very similar to the G-case ones. We demonstrate (and indicate) that Q and G cases can hold for the Earth (and for other planets).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We show that the anisotropy strongly influences the most unstable modes. Indeed, like in the marginal ones, the atmospheric anisotropy facilitates the occurrence of the most unstable modes convection, while the oceanic one inhibits it. Furthermore, we prove that, in contrast with isotropic case, in case of strong oceanic anisotropy the differences between Q and G cases can be significant for the Geodynamo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our approach allows to easily deal with very huge wave numbers and Rayleigh numbers as well as with very small Ekman numbers, what is usually not possible in the standard geodynamo simulations. This aspect and the growth rates search are useful to look for possible connections with small length and time scale analysis of the Geomagnetic field.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Increasing temperatures have induced a prolonged growing season that has enhanced GPP during the spring and autumn seasons. In the summer season, it has resulted in higher ET. Although these findings are reported in multiple studies, we lack investigations that specifically analysed&amp;amp;#160;long-term regional scale changes in GPP and ET in undisturbed core forest areas, which play an important role in the carbon and water fluxes. Analyses of GPP and ET changes across undisturbed forest areas are essential to understand how these areas are adapting to new climate conditions and contribute to the mitigation of human greenhouse gas emissions. In our study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to investigate the trends and changing rates of GPP, ET and water-use-efficiency (i.e., quantity of carbon assimilated by litre of water; WUE=GPP/ET) across undisturbed forest areas in Europe from 2000 to 2020 at monthly basis. We used the Mann-Kendal test to identify the significance of trends and the Theil&amp;amp;#8211;Sen estimator to quantify the monthly rate of change. The results indicated that during early spring and late autumn, approximately half of the total undisturbed core forest areas (3601.5 km&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;), mostly located in eastern Europe, showed an increase in GPP and ET. These areas also showed an increase in WUE because the increase in GPP was greater than the ET. However, most forest areas showed a decrease in GPP during summer, which was not compensated by the GPP increase during spring and autumn. These uncompensated forest core areas were spatially scattered across different forest types in Europe and were responsible for offsetting 20% of the total GPP increase in all European forest core areas. Our results provided evidence that certain forest core areas have limitations to act as carbon sinks, therefore, reducing the capacity to mitigate human carbon emissions. Moreover, by identifying the location of these forests, our results can support the application of management strategies that enhance carbon assimilation.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The Rainbow massif is an oceanic core complex located on a non-transform discontinuity (NTD) in a magma-starved region of the mid-Atlantic Ridge. Despite the low magmatic input, the core complex hosts a high-temperature hydrothermal vent field&amp;amp;#160; (&amp;gt;340&amp;amp;#176;C) that requires a long-lived magmatic heat source. The FWI results show that deep within the massif, &amp;amp;#8764;3-8 km below the seafloor, is a low-velocity body that represents a partially molten sill complex with &amp;gt;20% gabbro intrusions. The complex extends out north to the AMAR Minor N segment suggesting an increased magmatic input into this segment, forcing the NTD to migrate southwards. Extensive magmatic intrusion into the core complex was likely responsible for the termination of slip on the detachment fault. Above the sill complex, we image a channel of lower velocity material that cuts through the main hydration front to the deep sill region. Velocity values and micro-seismicity correlation suggests that this channel consists of 10-30% serpentinized peridotite and fracturing from serpentinization reactions create fluid pathways for fluids to exchange between the deeper partially molten heat source and the fluid network of the hydrothermal vents. A high-velocity chimney below the extinct vent sites of the massif may represent the abandoned stockwork of these extinct hydrothermal systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most researchers believe that large igneous provinces (LIPs) are formed by adiabatic melting of heads of ascending mantle plumes. Because the LIPs have existed throughout the geological history of the Earth (Ernst, 2014), their rocks can be used to probe the plume composition and to decipher the evolution of deep-seated processes in the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s interior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The early stages of the LIPs evolution are discussed by the example of the eastern Fennoscandian Shield, where three major LIP types successively changed each other during the early Precambrian: (1) Archean LIP composed mainly of komatiite-basaltic series, (2) Early Paleoproterozoic LIP made up mainly of siliceous high-Mg series, and (3) Mid-Paleoproterozoic LIP composed of picrites and basalts similar to the Phanerozoic LIPs (Sharkov, Bogina, 2009). The two former types of LIPs derived from high-Mg depleted ultramafic material practically were extinct after the Mid-Paleoproterozoic, whereas the third type is survived till now without essential change. The magmas of this LIP sharply differed in composition. Like in Phanerozoic LIPs, they were close to E-MORB and OIB and characterized by the elevated and high contents of Fe, Ti, P, alkalis, LREE, and other incompatible elements (Zr, Ba, Nb, Ta, etc.), which are typical of geochemically enriched plume sources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to modern paradigm (Maruyama, 1994; Dobretsov, 2010; French, Romanowi&amp;amp;#1089;z, 2015, etc.), formation of such LIPs is related to the ascending thermochemical mantle plumes, generated at the mantle-liquid core boundary due to the percolation of the core&amp;amp;#8217;s fluids into overlying mantle. Thus, these plumes contain two types of material, which provide two-stage melting of the plume&amp;amp;#8217;s heads: adiabatic and fluid-assisted incongruent melting of peridotites of upper cooled margins (Sharkov et al., 2017).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These data indicate that the modern setting in the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s interior has existed since the Mid Paleoproterozoic (~2.3 Ga) and was sharply different at the early stages of the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s evolution. What was happened in the Mid Paleoproterozoic? Why thermochemical plumes appeared only at the middle stages of the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s evolution? It is not clear yet. We suggest that this could be caused by the involvement of primordial core material in the terrestrial tectonomagmatic processes. &amp;amp;#160;This core survived from the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s heterogeneous accretion owing to its gradual centripetal warming accompanied by cooling of outer shells (Sharkov, Bogatikov, 2010).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dobretsov, N.L.

Plumes&amp;amp;#8217; birth, life and death play a fundamental role on the evolution of life on Earth and on plate-tectonic reorganization. La R&amp;amp;#233;union hotspot is known as one of the largest on the Earth, that created the Deccan volcanic traps in India (almost 2 million km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and the death of more than 90% of life on the Earth including dinosaurs ~65Ma ago. So far the origin of the mantle plumes and their role in geodynamics are still unclear in Earth sciences. In that respect, we use the dataset from the French-German RHUM-RUM experiment around La R&amp;amp;#233;union hotspot (2012-2013), from IRIS data center and FDSN to extensively investigate the deep structure of the plume along its complete track from its birth to its present stage, as well as from the upper mantle to the lowermost mantle. Several shear-wave anomalies are resolved underneath Indian Ocean and the upper mantle beneath this region is fed by mantle plume rising from the core-mantle boundary.

North of 30&amp;amp;#186;S REMO2015 and ETA show a statistically significant increase of mean winter precipitation over mountain regions. Another robust signal among the RCMs consists in an increase of extreme winter precipitation north of 35&amp;amp;#186;S over the mountain area. Increases in the maximum and minimum temperatures are significant over all domain for the 3 RCMs, but it is prominent to the north of 35&amp;amp;#176;S (30&amp;amp;#176;S) for REMO2015 and RegCM4-7 for winter (summer), especially over the mountain leeward, while ETA depicts the higher heating in the south of 30&amp;amp;#176;S. The changes are mainly associated with a positive displacement of distribution (changes in location parameter) for temperatures and the amplification of interannual variability (positive changes in scale parameter) for precipitation. The physical processes responsible for these changes are discussed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

History matching of the base case to the real core data was performed using particle swarm optimization machine. The matching parameters were the critical capillary number for de-trapping for both low and high IFT flooding, besides the relative permeability curvature parameter.

The surfactants are carboxybetaine based amphoteric surfactants SS-880 and SS-885. We did previous study to optimize the core-flooding design for SP flooding in the lab but we faced the problem of inconsistency. Because there are some factors that, we cannot control and keep them constant to compare results, like the core permeability and porosity and their distribution and mineralogy. The combination of surfactant and polymer in one slug gives more recovery than the injecting them individually. ATBS gave higher recovery than TVP. There is no difference in recovery due to changing the surfactants because their IFT is close to each other. The observation is that increasing the slug size will increase the recovery so we recommend using diminishing return economic analyses to determine the slug that gives the highest profit. Injecting SW-SP-SW is the best sequence among the other three sequences, taking the advantage of injecting longer slug of viscous fluid, as the increment due to IFT reduction is minor. The viscosity sensitivity study shows higher recovery with more viscous fluids so the limiting factor will be the economics and the pump capacity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Optimizing the SP flooding design for carbonate reservoirs using simulation with the help of lab experiments results for calibration will decrease the uncertainty.

By performing parameter sweep experiments, here we investigate this incoherent HC&amp;amp;#8211;jet change in the LGM-like and global warming-like experiments with a dry dynamical core of the general circulation model where cooling or heating is imposed in tropical upper-troposphere and polar surface. The LGM-like experiments reveal that an incoherent HC&amp;amp;#8211;jet change, i.e., a poleward shift of the jet latitude but an equatorward shift of the HC edge, appears when the polar forcing is substantially stronger than the upper-tropospheric tropical cooling, indicating the broadened baroclinic zone. This broadened baroclinic zone is explained by the separate roles of fast and slow waves. As polar cooling is enhanced, fast waves contribute to the poleward shifted jet in the midlatitudes. However, slow waves in the subtropics do not change much in response to polar cooling due to an equatorward shifted critical latitude by the upper tropospheric cooling, resulting in the HC edge located on the equatorward side compared to the control simulation. Such an incoherent HC&amp;amp;#8211;jet change is also found in the global warming-like experiments, suggesting that a poleward HC shift but an equatorward jet shift may occur in the future climate with accelerated Arctic amplification.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The current practice utilizes clay and silty materials for the core of the rock-fill dam. In Oman, clay is not abundantly available, so there is a need to propose a local alternative material as a potential source for the core of the rock-fill dam. Dredged sediment is believed to have properties like clay but is a waste material deposited in reservoirs. The samples of wadi sediments were grouped from the reservoir of Wadi Jizzi Dam, located a few kilometers away from the city of Sohar. A detailed laboratory-testing program investigates the physical characteristics, grain size distribution, liquid and plastic limits, specific gravity, compaction, hydraulic conductivity (permeability), swelling potential, and unconfined compressive strength. All the tests were performed following the British Standard. The pure dredged sediment has a hydraulic conductivity of 7.11x10<jats:sup>-6</jats:sup> cm/s, which is comparable to the requirements of the core of the dam. To improve the other properties of the dredged sediment, it is mixed in different proportions with dune sand collected from the Al-Sharqia Desert of Oman. The test results suggest that a mixture ratio of 50% of sediment to the dune sand gives optimal strength, durability, and permeability. On the other hand, for the comparison purposes, bentonite was mixed with sand by various percentage. The microscopic investigation and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis tests on dredged sediments suggest that the material can be utilized without causing any environmental concerns. The outcomes of this study is expected to assist the practitioners in achieving cost-effectiveness and sustainability in the design.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Histone variants are paralogs that replace canonical histones in nucleosomes, often imparting novel functions. Despite their importance, how histone variants arise and evolve is poorly understood. Reconstruction of histone protein evolution is challenging due to high amino acid conservation and large differences in evolutionary rates across gene lineages and sites. Here we combined amino acid sequences and intron position data from 108 nematode genomes to trace the evolutionary histories of the three H2A variants found in <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</jats:italic>: the ancient H2A.Z<jats:sup>HTZ-1</jats:sup>, the sperm-specific HTAS-1, and HIS-35, which differs from canonical H2A by a single glycine-to-alanine C-terminal change. We find disparate evolutionary histories. Although the H2A.Z<jats:sup>HTZ-1</jats:sup> protein is highly conserved, its gene exhibits recurrent intron gain and loss. This pattern suggests that it is intron presence, rather than specific intron sequences or positions, that may be important to H2A.Z functionality. In contrast, for HTAS-1 and HIS-35, we find variant-specific intron positions that are conserved across species. HIS-35 arose in the ancestor of <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis</jats:italic> and its sister group, including the genus <jats:italic>Diploscapter</jats:italic>, while the sperm-specific variant HTAS-1 arose more recently in the ancestor of a subset of <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis</jats:italic> species. HIS-35 exhibits gene retention in some descendent lineages but also recurrent gene loss in others, suggesting that histone variant use or functionality is highly flexible in this case. We also find that the single amino acid differentiating HIS-35 from core H2A is ancestral and common across canonical <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis</jats:italic> H2A sequences and identify one nematode species that bear identical HIS-35 and canonical H2A proteins, findings that are not predicted from the hypothesis that HIS-35 has a distinct function. Instead, we speculate that HIS-35 enables H2A expression across the cell cycle or in distinct tissues; genes encoding such partially-redundant functions may be advantageous yet relatively replaceable over evolutionary times, consistent with the patchwork pattern of retention and loss of both genes. Our study shows the evolutionary trajectory for histone H2A variants with distinct functions and the utility of intron positions for reconstructing the evolutionary history of gene families, particularly those undergoing idiosyncratic sequence evolution.</jats:p>"

Methods: We reviewed 318 cases of\ncervical carcinoma with available pathology reports from preoperative\nCNB assessment and from final postoperative evaluation of the\nhysterectomy specimen. Setting the postoperative comprehensive\npathological evaluation as reference, we analysed CNB assessment of\nhistological tumor characteristics. In addition, we performed\nmultivariable logistic regression to identify factors influencing the\naccuracy in identifying lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and tumor\ngrade. Main outcome measures: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and\npredictive values of CNB assessment of histological tumor\ncharacteristics and the variables influencing these. Results: CNB was\nhighly accurate in discriminating histological subtype. Sensitivity and\nspecificity were 98.8% and 89% for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),\n92.9% and 96.6% for adenocarcinoma (AC), 33.3% and 100% in\nadenosquamous carcinoma respectively. Neuroendocrine carcinoma was\nalways recognized correctly. The accuracy of the prediction of\nlymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) was 61.9% and was positively\ninfluenced by tumor size in preoperative MRI and negatively influenced\nby strong peritumoral inflammation. High tumor grade was diagnosed\naccurately in 73.9% of cases and was influenced by histological tumor\ntype. Conclusions: CNB is an accurate sampling technique for\nhistological classification of cervical cancer and represents a\nreasonable alternative to other biopsy techniques.

TNAU soybean core set comprising of 50 soybean germplasm (thirty national and twenty international lines) was evaluated for variability pattern, trait association and adaptability using ten quantitative and twenty-one qualitative characters over environments, years and seasons to identify potential parents for utilization. Both quantitative and qualitative traits-based diversity analyses indicated the presence of adequate variability. The principal component analysis based on quantitative traits reduced the total variation into three major components (73.72%). Genotypes JS9305, JS(SH)99-02, IC16009 and TNAU20048 were tagged as highly divergent lines. Single plant yield (0.92) and number of pods per plant (0.92) contributed the maximum for the rotated PC1. The association analysis revealed that number of pods per plant (r = 0.88) and number of clusters per plant (r = 0.81) contributed significantly to the single plant yield. The qualitative cluster analysis divided the core set into eight clusters. A good variability was observed for plant type, pod color, seed coat color, and hilum color. In the validation experiments, a higher yield was witnessed in the hybridization involving distantly related accessions (14.1%) than the closely related parents (7.5%). It is concluded that the TNAU soybean core set has real breeding potency for future exploitation. The parents JS9305, JS(SH)99-02, IC16009 and TNAU20048 possessed a higher degree of divergence, heterosis with better adaptability and offers scope of breeding utility. © 2022 Friends Science Publishers</jats:p>",

The sedimentary evolution and paleoclimatic significance of these poorly exposed deposits often remain largely unexplored. Here we present a suite of high-resolution x-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning data from southern Germany covering the Upper Toarcian and Aalenian stages. The overall objective of this study is to identify Transgressive-Regressive cycles based on the analysis of three cores obtained during scientific drilling campaigns in 2019-2021. Cores have been analyzed with an Avaatech XRF Core Scanner at a 10 mm sampling interval, an energy of 10 keV and a current of 500 &amp;amp;#181;A to measure element intensities ranging from aluminium through iron. Resulting trends in elemental ratios indicative for subtle grain-size variations such as Si/Al are used to reconstruct shoreline trajectories and establish a sequence stratigraphic framework (see Th&amp;amp;#246;le et al. 2020). Particularly the thick and largely homogenous Opalinuston Formation appears suitable in that respect, likely resulting from extraordinarily high sedimentation rates during the lower Aalenian in southern Germany, thus providing a complete but unexplored archive of paleoclimatic signals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Th&amp;amp;#246;le, H., Bornemann, A., Heimhofer, U., Luppold, F.

Consistent with theory, we find that noisier performance measures receive less weight. We find that this negative relation strengthened following the adoption of ASC 718 (formerly SFAS 123R), which equalized the accounting treatment for options and other share-based awards. We further find that firms that increased non-price incentives for CEOs realized improvements in ROA and in Tobin's Q.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the calculation of core-ionization energies (IE), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), a commonly applied approach is to use non-Aufbau reference states with a core-hole as either final (IE and XPS) or initial (XES) state. However, such reference states can introduce numerical instabilities for post-HF methods, relating to the denominator of the energy corrections involved. This may become arbitrarily close to zero if a negative virtual MO is present, e.g. a core-hole, leading to near-singularities. The resulting instabilities lead to severe convergence issues of the calculation schemes and, in addition, can strongly affect both energies and intensities, with oscillator strengths seen to reach values up to 4 × 10^7. For the K-edge we propose freezing the highest-energy virtual orbitals which contribute to any denominator below a threshold of 0.1 Hartree. Stable and reliable spectra are then produced, with minimal influence due to freezing energetically high-lying virtual orbitals (typically removing &lt;5% of the total number of MOs). The developed protocol is here tested for Møller–Plesset perturbation theory and for the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator, but it is also relevant for coupled cluster theory and other related methods.</jats:p>"

Judo players perform various movements during training or matches, such as bending, rotation, and flexion, which depend heavily on the muscles around the torso as well as the balance requirements during throwing to reach the optimal position of the throw. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of intense training during the preparation period to strengthen the core muscles on the static balance of the judo players. In total, 24 judo players participated in the study to form two groups: an experimental group (12 players), who were trained via intense core muscle workouts (8 exercises) according to specific instructions (three times per week / 6 weeks), and a control group (12 players), who were trained on various muscle groups (three times per week / 6 weeks). The Flamingo test (European Fitness Test–Euro Fit) was applied to measure the static balance of the players (pretest–posttest). The results showed an improvement in the static balance for both groups, the comparison between the two groups showed the experimental group indicated statistically significant changes (p  0.05) than the control group in terms of static balance because of core muscle strengthening workouts. The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of core muscle strengthening workouts in improving the static balance of judo players. Therefore, coaches can use these workouts during the preparation period and can manage training loads according to the characteristics of the players by regularly measuring the static balance through field or laboratory, results of this tests can be help in planning training programs.</jats:p>"

The mechanical behavior of the saturated FGP is assumed based on Biot’s theory, the shell is modeled via the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), and the governing equations and boundary conditions are derived utilizing Hamilton’s principle. Three different porosity distribution patterns are studied including one homogenous uniform distribution pattern and two non-homogenous symmetric ones. The porosity parameters in mentioned distribution patterns are regulated to make them the same in the shell’s mass. The equations of motion are solved exactly in the circumferential direction via proper sinusoidal and cosinusoidal functions, and a numerical solution is provided in the meridional direction utilizing the differential quadrature method (DQM). The precision of the model is approved and the influences of several parameters such as circumferential wave number, the thickness of the FGP core, porosity parameter, porosity distribution pattern, the compressibility of the pore fluid, and boundary conditions on the shell’s natural frequencies are investigated. It is shown that the highest natural frequencies usually can be achieved when the larger pores are located close to the shell’s middle surface and in each vibrational mode, there is a special value of the porosity parameter which leads to the lowest natural frequencies. It is deduced that in most cases, natural frequencies decrease by increasing the thickness of the FGP core. In addition, reducing the compressibility of the porefluid a small growth in the natural frequencies can be seen.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Current diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia place emphasis on delusions and hallucinations, whereas the classical descriptions of schizophrenia by Kraepelin and Bleuler emphasized disorganization and impoverishment of mental activity. Despite the availability of antipsychotic medication for treating delusions and hallucinations, many patients continue to experience persisting disability. Improving treatment requires a better understanding of the processes leading to persisting disability. We recently introduced the term classical schizophrenia to describe cases with disorganized and impoverished mental activity, cognitive impairment and predisposition to persisting disability. Recent evidence reveals that a polygenic score indicating risk for schizophrenia predicts severity of the features of classical schizophrenia: disorganization, and to a lesser extent, impoverishment of mental activity and cognitive impairment. Current understanding of brain function attributes a cardinal role to predictive coding: the process of generating models of the world that are successively updated in light of confirmation or contradiction by subsequent sensory information. It has been proposed that abnormalities of these predictive processes account for delusions and hallucinations. Here we examine the evidence provided by electrophysiology and fMRI indicating that imprecise predictive coding is the core pathological process in classical schizophrenia, accounting for disorganization, psychomotor poverty and cognitive impairment. Functional imaging reveals aberrant brain activity at network hubs engaged during encoding of predictions. We discuss the possibility that frequent prediction errors might promote excess release of the neurotransmitter, dopamine, thereby accounting for the occurrence of episodes of florid psychotic symptoms including delusions and hallucinations in classical schizophrenia. While the predictive coding hypotheses partially accounts for the time-course of classical schizophrenia, the overall body of evidence indicates that environmental factors also contribute. We discuss the evidence that chronic inflammation is a mechanism that might link diverse genetic and environmental etiological factors, and contribute to the proposed imprecision of predictive coding.</jats:p>"

The Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW) states that consciousness is instantiated through global broadcasting of information across the prefrontal-parietal regions, whereas the integrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness requires the posterior cortex to produce maximally irreducible integrated information. As both theories seem to partially agree on that the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) require globally integrated brain activity across a network of functionally specialized modules, it is not known yet whether brain regions with such functional configurations would align with the NCC distribution predicted by the GNW or the IIT. We scanned resting-state fMRI data from 21 subjects during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation and anesthesia. Graph-theoretical analysis were conducted on awake fMRI data to search for the NCC candidates as brain regions that exhibit both high rich-clubness and high modular variability. Another independent dataset of 10 highly-sampled subjects were used to validate the NCC distribution at individual-level. Brain module-based dynamic analysis was conducted to estimate temporal stability of the NCC candidates. Alterations in functional connectivity and modular variability from awake to propofol-induced anesthesia were assessed to test the involvement of the NCC candidates in conscious processing. NCC candidates that are characterized by both high functional interconnectivity and high modular variability were identified to locate in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices, which covered brain structures predicted by the GNW as well as the IIT. The identified NCC was found to mainly attributed to higher-order cognitive functions, and associated with genes enriched in synaptic transmission. Dynamic analysis revealed two discrete reoccurring brain states, which were characterized by their difference in temporal stability — the state dominated by the NCC candidates appearred to be temporally more stable than the other state predominately composed of primary sensory/motor regions, suggesting that the identified NCC members could sustain conscious contents as metastable network representations. Finally, we showed that the prefrontal GNW regions and posterior IIT regions within the identified NCC was differentially modulated in terms of functional connectedness and modular variability in response to loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia. This work offers a framework to search for neural correlates of consciousness by charting the brain network topology, and provides new insights in understanding the distinct roles of the frontoparietal and posterior network in underpinning human consciousness.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlights</jats:title><jats:p>Studies suggest that there are neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) we experience subjectively everyday.

The identified NCC architecture was significantly modulated in terms of functional connectedness and modular varibility during propofol anesthesia, demonstrating its critical role in supporting consciousness.

To facilitate standardized prospective molecular surveillance, we established a novel core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme. Over 2000 isolates of Mab, covering all subspecies and main dominant circulating clones as well as extra-pulmonary outbreak strains and sequential isolates of chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients, were used to validate the scheme and set genetic distance thresholds to delineate transmission events and global population structure. Most global clonal complexes previously classified using cgSNP were confirmed by our cgMLST approach, and also correlated well with traditional 7-loci MLST sequence types. 99% of pairwise comparisons between epidemiologically linked isolates were below 25 alleles and 90% below 10 alleles. These thresholds can be used for initial cluster analysis and to guide further epidemiological investigations. Overall, the scheme will help to unravel the apparent global spread of certain clonal complexes and as yet undiscovered transmission routes.</jats:p>"

Not much is known about the mechanisms responsible for biofilm formation by this pathogen, and most current knowledge is based on results of experiments conducted using the related <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic> pathogen that forms biofilm in the flea gut.

The comparison of differential expression of genes in biofilm versus planktonic bacteria showed a set of 54 core genes that were similarly regulated, independent of inducing condition. This set included many genes that were previously shown to be associated with biofilms, such as <jats:italic>hutG, hsmF, hmsT</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>cpxP</jats:italic> that were upreg-ulated and other genes such as <jats:italic>hmsP</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>rfaH</jats:italic> that were downregulated. There were also novel biofilm-associated genes, including genes encoding hypothetical proteins. To identify the genes involved in inducing biofilm formation, the gene expression of bacteria during an early initial phase when biofilm starts to form after induction by bile or amino acid depletion was determined. Comparisons of the resulting gene expression profiles with the profiles of non-induced bacteria incubated for the same period of time showed a set of core genes associated with early biofilm formation. This set included genes involved in quorum sensing, pili biogenesis and genes indicative of a potential metabolic shift involving nitrogen utilisation. Genes encoding components of sugar phosphotransferase systems were also up-regulated during biofilm induction. Assays of biofilm formation by bacteria deleted of some of these core genes showed that strains lacking <jats:italic>hpr</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>luxS</jats:italic>, which are known to be important for functional sugar phosphotransferase systems and quorum sensing, as well as <jats:italic>glnL</jats:italic> encoding a sensory histidine kinase were most negatively affected.

In this study, we assess the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) core-scanning to reconstruct high-resolution variations in anoxygenic phototrophic communities using sediment cores from meromictic Lake Cadagno, Switzerland. Three different pigment groups were detected&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and each pigment group is&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;diagnostic of different phototrophic communities. Mixolimnetic aerobic primary production is recorded by chlorophyll &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;a &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;(and derivatives), whereas anoxygenic phototrophs are split into two groups &amp;amp;#8211; purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) represented by bacteriochlorophyll &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, and green sulfur bacteria (GSB) represented by bacteriochlorophylls &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;c, d, e&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. Spectrophotometer and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analyses were used to validate the HSI-inferred pigment data. Near-continuous presence of bacteriochlorophylls confirms previously published geochemical evidence for persistent anoxic/sulfidic conditions at Lake Cadagno throughout the past 9.8 ka [2]. Furthermore, major shifts in the anoxygenic phototrophic communities appear to be related to environmental factors that affect lake stratification and light penetration at the chemocline. PSB and GSB became established after ca. 9.8 ka BP, and high abundances of both groups are inferred from 9.8-8.8 ka BP. PSB became dominant during the mid-Holocene from 8.8-3.4 ka BP, likely indicating a stable and shallow chemocline with high light penetration to the sulfidic chemocline. From 3.4-1.4 ka BP, PSB were substantially reduced and GSB became more dominant, likely due to a combination of cooler temperatures and land cover changes in the catchment that led to weakened lake stratification and more frequent turbid underflows. The high-resolution data show GSB established prior to PSB during the initial development of sulfidic conditions at 9.8 ka BP, and show that GSB tend to re-establish more quickly following mass movements and floods. This study demonstrates for the first time the capability of hyperspectral imaging to detect GSB related pigments, and shows the strong potential for high-resolution reconstruction of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria communities using this technique.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.

The WAIS is believed to be susceptible to collapse as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Modelling studies and palaeoclimatic evidence have suggested at least partial WAIS collapse and resulting sea level rise during previous warm periods, therefore understanding the stability of the WAIS during warm periods is important. The WACSWAIN project successfully drilled a 651 m ice core on Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to the Ronne Ice Shelf, in 2018, some data from which are now being published. The second WACSWAIN drilling project took place in 2020 on Sherman Island in the Abbott Ice Shelf, where the British Antarctic Survey&amp;amp;#8217;s (BAS) Rapid Access Isotope Drill (RAID) was deployed. The team drilled a 323 m deep borehole, with discrete samples of ice chippings collected from the entire depth range of the drilled ice. The samples were analysed for water isotopes and major ion content at BAS from 2020-2022. Validation of the RAID-ice data is confirmed through comparison with a shallow core drilled on Sherman Island during the same field campaign. Using annual layer counting of chemical records and volcanic horizon identification, an age scale for the record of 1724 discrete samples is presented. The Sherman Island ice record extends back to at least 1000 years before present, providing the oldest ice-derived continuous palaeoclimate record for the coastal Amundsen-Bellingshausen sector to date. An estimation of accumulation history at the site is presented. A comparison of the longer chemical and water isotope records with other regional ice cores provides insights into the spatial variability of change over recent centuries.

The CMB topography is usually considered to have a smooth spherical or elliptical shape, however, in reality it is bumpy and there are mountains and valleys representing local height differences of the order of a kilometer. The existence of a topography induces inertial waves that need to be considered in the flow of the core. This is in addition to the Poincar&amp;amp;#233; fluid motion when the nutations are computed and in addition to a relative rotation of the fluid opposite and of the same amplitude as that of the mantle for LOD variations. The additional pressure and the topographic torque depend on the shape of the CMB and can be related to the spherical harmonic coefficients of the CMB topography. We follow the philosophy of the computation of Wu and Wahr [Geophys. J.

We used an analytical approach instead of a numerical one.

Salah satu kontruksi bubu yang banyak digunakan adalah bubu lipat diantaranya bubu payung. Bubu payung banyak digunakan di Belitung Timur untuk menangkap organisme air seperti lobster air tawar. Bubu payung standar memiliki kekurangan yaitu sulit dimasuki lobster. Lobster yang telah terperangkap juga mudah keluar dari pintu masuk, sehingga bubu standar tidak efektif untuk menangkap lobster air tawar. Salah satu upaya yang dilakukan untuk mengoptimalkan bubu adalah dengan memperbaiki konstruksi pintu masuk agar lobster mudah memasuki bubu dan sulit ketika meloloskan diri. Penelitian bertujuan unutk menentukan konstruksi pintu yang tepat dan membandingkan hasil tangkapan antara bubu pintu standar dengan pintu modifikasi. Seluruh penelitian dilakukan pada skala laboratorium. Penelitian menggunakan akuarium dan kolam. Uji konstruksi pintu bubu dilakukan di akuarium sedangkan uji makanan dan uji bubu dilakukan di kolam. Hasil Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa konstruksi pintu bubu yang tepat adalah memiliki pintu luar menyentuh dasar bubu, sudut lintasan 40˚ dan bentuk pintu bagian dalamnya persegi panjang. Bubu modifikasi mampu memerangkap lobster sebanyak 76,92%, sedangkan bubu standar sebanyak 23,08% dari seluruh hasil tangkapan. Bubu standar mampu meloloskan lobster sebanyak 78,79%, sedangkan bubu modifikasi hanya sebanyak 21,31%. Umpan yang disarankan untuk uji coba adalah ikan laisi (lemuru).&#x0D;\nKata kunci: bubu payung, lobster air tawar, umpan</jats:p>"

With the increasing demands for high power density, the PMSM often operates at high speed and high frequency, leading to high power loss and temperature rise. Consequently, proper consideration of power loss, including the core loss, has attracted much attention for the modelling, designing, controlling and optimizing of PMSMs. However, the widely used equivalent circuit model, capable of providing good analysis results with fast calculation, often ignores the core loss, which may lead to unsatisfactory motor performance. This paper aims to investigate the development of equivalent circuit models, with predictable core loss for PMSMs, and proposes novel equivalent circuit models, which improve the core loss prediction accuracy in the load conditions. Some thoughts about the further improvement of the models are proposed and discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have recorded consistent (but low) numbers and a diverse range of diatom taxa (siliceous algae) over a 400-year period in the RECAP ice core, drilled from the Renland ice cap on the east coast of Greenland. This is an exciting initial step in attempting a diatom-based environmental reconstruction for an Arctic ice core for the first time, since Greenland&amp;amp;#8217;s inland ice cores (e.g. NGRIP, GRIP) do not appear to contain diatoms in enough numbers. Our novel study investigated the period 1528 - 1940 AD (encompassing the Little Ice Age (LIA)) and we developed a method for extracting diatom taxa from the ice-core meltwater samples for identification. This was done by microscopy using standard taxonomic techniques. In summary, the RECAP LIA assemblage comprises 93 species, 36 genera and 11 families where &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Thalassiosira/Coscinodiscus&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Aulocoseira,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Pinnularia, Nitzschia, Luticola, Diadesmis, Staurosira, Achnanthidium, Psammothidium spp&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; are the dominant genera. In this interval we found that Renland received air blown diatoms from both planktonic/benthic freshwater (80%) and planktonic marine (20%) sources. The freshwater species included aerophilic species (from damp environments), key indicators of exposed, environments and found widely in the Arctic. We observe that both total diatom numbers and species composition changes rapidly over time (i.e. decadal timescales), similar to other ice-core proxies, and with higher total numbers/yr between about 1780 and 1850 AD. Further analysis is required to establish a link to specific environmental variables, which could include aridity, wind strength or sea ice cover. We hypothesise that similar lower altitude, coastal ice cores from Greenland and Canada could be useful diatom repositories in the Arctic region.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the promise conservation paleobiology holds for using geohistorical data and insights to solve conservation problems, training in the field typically does not equip students to be competent environmental problem solvers. The intention of this perspective piece is to start a conversation about how we might train conservation paleobiology students better, focusing on the competencies needed to promote deep engagement with “wicked” conservation problems that are difficult to solve. Ongoing conversations regarding design of academic programs in sustainability, a field allied with conservation science, can inform our discussion. The sustainability literature has defined an interrelated set of “core competencies” that go beyond general academic competencies to enable real-world sustainability problem solving: systems thinking, temporal thinking, normative thinking, strategic thinking, and interpersonal competence. Conservation paleobiology is usually taught within geology programs, where students are exposed to systems thinking and temporal thinking. However, the remaining competencies typically are absent or insufficiently developed. To infuse these competencies into conservation paleobiology curricula, we recommend: (1) enhancing connections with sustainability programs and encouraging a more cross-disciplinary approach to training; (2) developing a “menu” of concepts and methodologies for each competence from which to choose; and (3) recognizing that different skills are appropriate at different levels of education and experience. The proposed competency-based framework serves as a shared reference that can be used to develop pedagogies to better prepare conservation paleobiology students to navigate the wicked conservation challenges of our time.</jats:p>"

However, the core maximization problem has been theoretically proven to be NP-hard even APX-hard for\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            ≥ 3. Existing heuristic approaches suffer from the limitation of inefficiency on large graphs. To address this limitation, in this paper, we revisit this challenging yet important problem of core maximization, that is, given a graph\n            <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>\n            , a number\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            , and a budget\n            <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\n            , to insert\n            <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\n            new edges into\n            <jats:italic>G</jats:italic>\n            such that the corresponding\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            -core is maximized. We propose a novel algorithm FastCM+ based on several fast search strategies. The core idea is to apply graph partition to divide (\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            - 1)-shell into different components. Then, FastCM+ considers each (\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            - 1)-shell component independently to convert different layered vertices into\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            -core, in two manners of completely and partially. Based on the complete/partial conversions, FastCM+ is generalized to further handle (\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            - λ)-shell conversions for 2 ≤λ\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            . Leveraging dynamic programming combinations of different components' potential answers, FastCM+ finds a good-quality answer for edge insertions. Experimental results on eleven datasets demonstrate that our algorithm runs much faster than state-of-the-art methods on large graphs meanwhile achieving better answers.\n          </jats:p>",

The researchers are developing long-life, high-performance bi-functional catalyst particles that can be mounted on rechargeable metal-air batteries, and are also\n proposing positive particles coated with a solid electrolyte for use in all-solid state lithium-ion batteries.

However, the technology of the metal-air battery is still in progress and key concerns are the reliability of the\n cathode as well as the harsh effects of charging at high cathodic potentials. Ohno and Hirai are working to overcome these challenges by using chemical reaction and powder engineering techniques to add thin films of protective materials for the potential catalysts that could help stabilise\n the cathode. So far, the researchers have found that the protective layer on the bi-functional catalyst particles that were mounted on the metal-air secondary battery significantly improved the stability.

No less than 5 working groups on thermodynamics, clouds, ABL height, wind and turbulence, and aerosol profiling reported on key ABL parameters, their applications and end-user requirements.

Also less known (&amp;amp;#8220;hidden&amp;amp;#8221;) networks were identified. 5 specific instrument task groups (on microwave radiometers, cloud radars, doppler lidars, automatic lidars and ceilometers, and drones) are developing recommendations for configuration, operation, calibration, and quality control procedures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the remaining period of the PROBE COST action (until fall 2023), the partners will continue to develop a solid literature (technical reports and scientific publications) on the topic of ABL profiling, improving content through short term scientific visits (either in person or virtual) and focused working groups (mostly virtual). Some partners will participate in a large international effort to better characterize the ABL in urban environments through an intensive measurement campaign to be held in the Paris region (France) in summer 2022 while others are involved in the TEAMx collaboration initiative observing the mountain boundary layer. Finally, the PROBE community is launching an inter-journal special issue, offering an opportunity for the advances in ABL profile observations and applications to gain visibility. For example, a very detailed review paper on ABL height retrievals from ground-based remote sensing was just submitted, resulting from several years of intense review work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The presentation will provide an overview of recent achievements and upcoming activities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Aside from point-based geochronological measurements, the only available proxy to query past ice-sheet processes on large spatial scales is Internal Reflecting Horizons (IRHs) as sounded by ice-penetrating radar. When isochronal, IRHs can be used to determine palaeo-accumulation rates and patterns, as previously demonstrated using shallow, centennially dated layers. Whilst similar efforts using deeper IRHs have previously been conducted over the East Antarctic Plateau where ice-flow is slow and ice thickness has been stable through time, much less is known of millennial-scale accumulation rates over the West Antarctic plateau due to challenging ice dynamical conditions in the downstream section of the ice sheet. Using deep and spatially extensive ice-core dated IRHs over Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and a local layer approximation model, we quantify Holocene accumulation rates over the slow-flowing parts of these sensitive catchments. The results from the one-dimensional model are also compared with modern accumulation rates from observational and modelled datasets to investigate changes in accumulation rates and patterns between the Holocene and the present. The outcome of this work is that together with present and centennial-scale accumulation rates, our results can help determine whether a trend in accumulation rates exists between the Holocene and the present and thus test to what extent these glaciers are controlled by ice dynamics rather than changes in accumulation rates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Considering the capabilities of mesh-free Lagrangian numerical methods in the simulation of highly deformed free surfaces, the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics approach is employed. The results of this numerical model are validated with the experimental data of the current study, including the depth over the intake at which vortex forms (critical submergence) and the velocity field. Experiments were also conducted in a rotating cylinder while water was draining from an outlet at its bottom center. The particle image velocimetry technique was used for measuring the velocity field in planes perpendicular to the vortex axis. The numerical results including the velocity distribution and water level variations as well as the depth at which an air-core forms were in acceptable agreement with the experimental data. In addition, vortex formation and the corresponding velocity and pressure distribution as well as the streamlines are analyzed based on the numerical results. The results indicate that as the flow depth decreases, high values of vorticity and low pressures are generated at the vicinity of the outlet, and over time, the generated vorticity develops in depth toward the free surface, and an air-core vortex forms.</jats:p>",

Physiotherapy technology in the form of dry needling and laser after both have received core stability exercise has not been widely applied in physiotherapy measures to reduce pain in complaints of myogenic low back pain. Therefore, further research is needed to compare the effectiveness of dry needling and laser with a combination of core stability exercises on low back pain myogenic complaints. &#x0D;\nMethods: Experimental study design with two groups of pre-test and post-test designs. The research was conducted in 2021 at Sunafa physiotherapy practice, Colomadu, Karanganyar. Subjects with myogenic low back pain complaints who met the study criteria. Analysis of the research data obtained, the data is not normally distributed, therefore tested with a non-parametric test, namely the Wilcoxon test and Mann-Whitney test.&#x0D;\nResults: Has the effect of dry needling with core stability exercise on pain reduction in myogenic low back pain complaints (p = 0,000), has the effect of a laser with core stability exercise on pain reduction pain in myogenic low back pain complaints (p = 0,000), there is a different effect between dry needling and core stability exercise and laser with core stability exercise to reduce pain in myogenic low back pain complaints (p = 0.002), dry needling with core stability exercise was more effective than laser with core stability exercise in reducing pain in myogenic low back pain complaints with a mean difference of 8.94 mm more significant in the group I.&#x0D;\nConclusion: Dry needling is more effective than laser after both have undergone core stability exercise to relieve pain with myogenic low back pain complaints equations.

Meanwhile, the banking sector has a role to play in controlling the growing poverty, one of which is through financial inclusion. In some areas, the financial inclusion index has improved, indicated by the number of people who have switched from traditional savings to financial institution savings and have also reached the infrastructure of conventional commercial banks, but the fact has not yet reached the “usefulness of banking services”. So that financial inclusion is not really felt by the community. This study uses data from the March 2020 National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) and Podes 2020 to determine the effect of financial inclusion on core poverty. From the results of the logit regression estimation, it was found that financial inclusion had a strong effect on the status of core poverty in households when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in East Java (2020). Ownership of bank accounts has a strong and negative effect on poverty. The farther the distance to banking facilities, the greater the chance of experiencing poverty. Access to formal credit has the opportunity to move away from poverty. Education remains a key variable if you want to be free from poverty. The added value of farming households is still not optimal in increasing welfare, because they still have the opportunity to experience poverty. Access to information technology in households can increase opportunities to be more prosperous. From these results, the government should seek to increase public participation in having a bank account through banking literacy, through formal education, adding infrastructure for financial institutions evenly to villages, expanding access to formal credit services, and adding cellular/internet network infrastructure up to suburbs (rural/remote areas).</jats:p>"

Different approaches of dating are available like annual layer counting, radioactive decay and stratigraphic markers like tephra from volcanic eruption. In combination, they enable accurate dating back to 800,000 years. Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are formed in the atmosphere by condensation of oxidized highly volatile organic compounds and their chemical profile is highly complex due to the variety of emission sources and reactions in the atmosphere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Well-known SOA markers include pinic acid, pinonic acid or terebic acid from monoterpene oxidation. Another class of important atmospheric markers are biomass burning products.

While the lignin burning products provide important information on paleo-fire history, intact polymeric lignin offers a deeper insight into the type and abundance of vegetation. By alkaline oxidation, the polymeric lignin is degraded into the lignin oxidation products (LOP) and the ratios of these products are related to wooden and non-wooden, as well as angiosperm and gymnosperm vegetation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this work, an analytical approach is presented covering a variety of SOA markers, biomass burning markers, and polymeric lignin, using UHPLC-HRMS and an elaborate sample preparation procedure.

Those participants practicing cognitive distancing showed heightened learning from negative events as well as an increased integration of previous choice values. These differences seemed to represent an evolving shift in strategy by the distancing participants during the task, from exploiting optimal choices earlier in the task (as indicated by greater inverse temperature parameters), to a late-stage increase in learning from negative outcomes (represented as higher loss learning rates).

Two slabbed cores from the Canadian Montney and Bakken formations, covering multiple geological intervals (tight siltstones/sandstones units), were analyzed for validation purposes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reasonable agreement is found between log- and lab-derived (ultra)sonic velocity data, indicating similar trends with depth. However, the exact log- and lab-derived (ultra)sonic velocity values are different due to the differences in stress conditions between the field and laboratory measurements and the direction of wave travel. A maximum variation of ±20 m/s is observed for both P- and S-wave velocities when measurements were repeated on the same points, providing evidence of experimental repeatability and reproducibility. Relationships exist between laboratory-measured profile ultrasonic velocities (S-wave), profile permeability, mechanical hardness, and clay content (inferred from elemental composition data). The profile S-wave velocities decrease with increasing permeability (R2 = 0.6, n = 230). Advanced statistical methods (e.g., genetic algorithms) are employed to improve the velocity-permeability relationship and develop models for indirect estimation of permeability from S-wave velocities. The performance of these models is dependent upon lithology and rock fabric (e.g., silt vs. sand, degree of cementation), with a better correlation achieved for intervals with lower porosity and permeability (&amp;lt;±15% maximum discrepancy between measured and predicted permeability values; R2 = 0.78, n = 230).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This study introduces a new experimental apparatus, and a practical ‘screening’ workflow, that can be used for permeability prediction using S-wave velocities collected on slabbed cores. This predictive model can be used to estimate permeability below the lower limit (0.001 md) of pressure-decay profile permeability measurements. The findings are beneficial to operators developing tight siltstone/sandstone resources by allowing them to characterize permeability in low-permeability (&amp;lt;0.001 md) intervals for applications such as optimizing stimulation design and subsurface fluid injection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, accurate observations of the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) can only be obtained by the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique. The differences among the observed CIP and that derived from IAU 2006/2000A precession-nutation model are the Celestial Pole Offsets (CPO). CPO contain the free core nutation (FCN), trends, and harmonics due to limitations of IAU precession-nutation model, geophysical excitations, etc. as well as the noise of observations. FCN is a free rotational mode of the Earth and, in principle, cannot be predicted. It can be determined from CPO time series with the use of different empirical models. The development of such models, and the enhancing of the existing ones, has been suggested in the IAU/IAG Joint Working Group &amp;amp;#8221;Improving Theories and Models of the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s Rotation (ITMER)&amp;amp;#8221;, since FCN contribution is the main one of CPO. The accurate estimation of the free core nutation (FCN) period of about 430 days is a challenging prospect. Comparison of the FCN period obtained by different authors and methods shows slight discrepancies. But, is there any evidence that the period of the FCN varies with time? If so, then this would complicate making a model of it. The FCN phase drift in 2000 could be related to that, but the is no clear evidence. In this study, we tested different FCN periods using several subsets of the observed nutations derived from VLBI analysis with the purpose of finding the optimal configuration that provides the lowest residuals. That is why a large quantity of empirical FCN models were also estimated and tested with different sliding window lengths and FCN periods. This analysis could bring us significantly closer to meet the accuracy goals pursued by the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), i.e. 1 mm accuracy and 0.1 mm/year stability on global scales in terms of the ITRF defining parameters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;This research&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;was&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;supported&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; partially &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;by&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Generalitat&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Valenciana &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;(SEJIGENT/2021/001) and the European Union&amp;amp;#8212;NextGenerationEU (ZAMBRANO 21-04) (S.B).

This is a porous talus made of andesitic basaltic columns affected by chimney circulation that seems to allow for a extrazonal permafrost of low altitude in a temperate climate much lower than the regional limit of alpine permafrost. In the postdoctoral project FrozenCORE electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and seismic refraction tomography (SRT) were applied in October 2020 in order to check permafrost presence at the end of the warm season and to determine the internal structure of the deposit. The two methods indicated contradictory results, as ERT indicated a high resistive layer in the first 10-15 m while the SRT indicated a high velocity layer at depths greater than 15 m.

In this study, we use a simulation with REGional Climate Model v4.7 (RegCM4.7) output to attempt to better understand one of the major modes of ISO during the period 1981 to 2016. The model forced with EIN75 initial and boundary condition and EIN75 SST forcing is found to successfully capture the major signals of MISO. The propagating features of the MISO circulation pattern are broadly characterized using extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) and two major MISO indices (MISO-1 and MISO-2). The regions between the Indian subcontinent and the Indian ocean (IO) are found to be crucial for the MISO propagation during the 25–90 day oscillation. Half of the lifecycle of the MISO is found to be 15 days, i.e., the period necessary for the alteration from break phase to active monsoon phase. Simulated MISO indexes in phase space diagrams also reveal northward propagating signals that further help to explain potential mechanisms behind the MISO rainfall propagation from the IO to the Himalayan foothills.</jats:p>"

The influence of the core/shell size ratio and the dimers separation gap on these spectra have been studied using boundary element method (BEM). The scattering sections of various core/shell size ratio (= 10–80%) with different separation gap (2 to 16 nm) have been numerically determined via Maxwell equations. We have examined the scattering sections along a wide wavelengths range, 250–1500 nm, in visible and IR domain. The edge lengths of 60, 80, 100 and 120 nm of the shell nanocubes have been considered. We revealed the formation of Fano resonance line shape through the investigation of the scattering section variation within the entire wavelengths. The Fano resonance line shape emerges with the variation of the gap between the dimer as well as of the core/shell size ratio. The trace of the Fano interference dip is slightly blue shifted and it is lost above gap separation equal 4 nm. The core/shell dimer with varied core/shell size ratio manipulate and image easily the trace of the Fano resonance dip up to core/shell size ratio equal 50% for gap separation above 4 nm. We demonstrate the important duality of the gap separation and core/shell ratio variation in designing Fano resonance interface. This has a potential effect on applications in nonlinear optics, metamaterial, tunable nanophotonic devices such as filters, wave-guiding, subwavelength optical imaging, chemical and biological sensing.</jats:p>"

However, the aspect limiting the application of the sandwich material is its poor impact resistance. Therefore, understanding the impact properties of the sandwich structure will determine the ways in which it can be used under the conditions of impact loading. Sandwich panels with different combinations of carbon/Kevlar woven monolithic face sheets, inter-ply face sheets and intra-ply face sheets were fabricated, using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer process. Instrumented low-velocity impact tests were performed using different energy levels of 5 J, 10 J, 20 J, 30 J and 40 J on a variety of samples and the results were assessed. The damage caused by the modes of failure in the sandwich structure include fiber breakage, matrix cracking, foam cracking and debonding. In sandwich panels with thin face sheets, the maximum peak load was achieved for the inter-ply hybrid foam core sandwich panel in which Kevlar was present towards the outer surface and carbon in the inner surface of the face sheet. At an impact energy of 40 J, the maximum peak load for the inter-ply hybrid foam core sandwich panel was 31.57% higher than for the sandwich structure in which carbon is towards the outer surface and Kevlar is in the inner surface of the face sheet. The intra-ply hybrid foam core sandwich panel subjected to 40 J impact energy demonstrated a 13.17% higher maximum peak load compared to the carbon monolithic face sheet sandwich panel. The experimental measurements and numerical predictions are in close agreement.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the TALDICE ice core drilled at Talos Dome (East Antarctica, 72&amp;amp;#176;49&amp;amp;#8217;S, 159&amp;amp;#176;11&amp;amp;#8217;E), which covers more than 343k years of climate history. A comparison is presented between samples analyzed through two different techniques: low background instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). While the former is used to investigate only the insoluble fraction of dust, as it can only be applied to solid samples, the latter is used to assess the elemental composition of both the total and the soluble fraction of dust. We thus observe how different elements partition between soluble and insoluble phase at different depths of the ice core and link the geochemical patterns of the considered elements to the main climatic oscillations covered in the Talos Dome ice core.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We determined 45 elements through ICP-SFMS and 39 through INAA, with a good overlapping of the elements between the two techniques. Besides the determination of major elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe), which is important in the assessment of the impact of dust on the ecosystem (e.g. source of nutrients in the Southern Ocean), the high sensibility of both techniques also permitted the determination of trace elements. Among these, rare earth elements (REE) are of particular importance as they have been widely used as a geochemical tracer of aeolian dust sources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We present enrichment factors and correlation matrices to assess the crustal or non-crustal origin of the considered elements. The high correlations and low enrichment factors found among insoluble elements confirm a prevalent crustal composition for mineral dust. Regarding solubility, the majority of elements exhibits a minimum in solubility during the last glacial maximum. This is the result of higher fluxes of mineral dust transported to the Antarctic continent during cold climate periods and is consistent with the crustal origin we documented for most of the elements considered.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The average equivalent thickness of extrusive basalt deduced from the magnetic anomalies, a proxy for magma supply, decreases from west to east, from the Yuhuang (49.25°E) to Longqi (49.65°E) to Junhui (51.75°E) OCCs. Conversely, serpentinite outcrops become more abundant, the domal OCC morphology flattens as the footwall rotation (measured by the magnetization vector inclination) increases, and hydrothermal evidence becomes sparse.

During their operation, an electric force acting on the electrodes of the power capacitors actuates mechanical vibrations and radiates an audible noise. Considering a power capacitor as a general system, the frequency response with the electric force as the input and mechanical vibration as the output have been measured by engineers in recent years and used to evaluate the acoustic and mechanical features of products. Accidentally, it was found that the frequency of the capacitor vibration was not consistent with its excitation due to electro-mechanical coupling. This electro-mechanical coupling had not been considered in previous vibration models of power capacitors. Therefore, a new vibration model of power capacitors was built up in this paper and a so-called multi-frequency vibration characteristic was revealed. A theoretical analysis showed that the electric force and mechanical vibration of the power capacitors were coupled, which resulted in the multi-frequency vibration. The vibration frequency response was measured and the result was consistent with the vibration model proposed in this paper. Once the frequency of the electric force was near half the natural frequency of the power capacitor, a predominant multi-frequency vibration was triggered and the power capacitor was in a superharmonic resonance.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to assess categories underlying SHL in older\nadults using the ICF-BCS-HL tool. Design: A cross-sectional study.\nOne-hundred and thirty-one independent-living older adults (Mage=72.32,\nSD=6.83), who completed the speech, spatial, and quality of hearing\n(SSQ) scale and a set of clinically accepted outcome measurements linked\nwith selected categories listed in the ICF BCS-HL. Results: A linear\nregression analysis model was fitted with the outcome measurements after\ncontrolling for age, sex, education, multimorbidity, and hearing aid\nuse. The model showed 5 significant predictors underlying the SSQ-total\nscore: HL, dizziness handicap, cognitive decline, multimorbidity, and\nindividuals’ ability to accept the noise level. Predictors varied across\nthe SSQ-subscales scores, however. While predictors underlying the\nSSQ-Quality subscale scores were like the SSQ-total score, individuals’\nability to accept noise level was not one of the predictors underlying\nthe SSQ-Speech subscale scores. Whereas PTA, dizziness handicap and\nmultimorbidity were the predictors underlying the SSQ-Spatial subscale\nscores. Conclusion: SHL, measured by SSQ, in older adults is a\nmulti-layer structure in nature and is associated with a range of\nadverse health outcomes. A link of SHL with HL, cognitive deficits,\nreduced ability to accept background noise level, and multimorbidity,\ncollectively or individually, were well-established. So far, little\nattention has been paid to the impact of dizziness handicap of elderly\npatients when evaluating their SHL.</jats:p>"

Knowing the thermophysical properties of the subsurface as accurately as possible is of great importance in the design and configuring of a borehole heat exchanger field as a thermal energy storage system. In this study, a subsoil drill core from a BHE, with a depth of 80 m, was used to determine temperature dependent effective thermal conductivity based on the heat flow meter method, the specific heat capacity based on differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal expansion based on dilatometry in moist and dry states. The results have shown that the actual moisture content of the subsoil sample has a strong impact on the thermal conductivity, as well as on the heat capacity. Thermal expansion measurements have shown the influence of the drying process on the shrinkage of drill core samples and the low thermal expansion of the dry subsoil itself.</jats:p>"

In our approach, we extracted cache hit and miss concurrencies and applied concurrent average memory access time to more accurately determine the cache system performance. We conducted least recently used cache policy-based simulation for cache system with L1, with L1/L2, and with L1/shared bus cache. Our simulation results show that an average system throughput improvement of 2.5x can be achieved by using system with L1/shared bus cache system compared to using only first level L1 or L1/L2. Further, we show that the throughput degradation for the proposed cache system is only within 5% for a single bus fault, suggesting a good bus fault tolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This paper has used as many early classical textual references as possible from a variety of sources to establish precisely and clearly what the various ancient philosophies were and how they were used. The paper not only compares their theories but also their techniques of cultivation. Comparisons are made between, the idea of a self/soul or no-self, the notion of liberation, the use of breathing techniques, the theories of sending energy in a certain direction and the different key textbooks used by the varying philosophical systems. The key findings are that even though each system is different to the other, they have also taken ideas and concepts from each other and mixed them into their own systems of cultivation. They do though seem to all share one common denominator which is at their base and this is that they all follow some form of theory related to the concept of non-action.</jats:p>"

In this system, dual core spun yarn is produced with a view to combining the advantageous aspects of two components, namely (i) Lycra and polyester filament as dual core elements and (ii) cotton fibres as sheath component that form a structured yarn. The main aim is to combine the good characteristics of two different fibers in a single yarn. Tensile properties, elastic recovery behaviour and stress decay of these dual core spun yarns are studied and a comparative analysis with conventional ring spun yarns are presented in this article.

A wide range of temperatures is used to check the quality of products and materials, since they are constantly being improved. However, there is no literature on how the components of the climatic chamber panels react under high temperatures. The present work therefore sets out to perform a thermal and mechanical characterisation of four core materials often used in sandwich panels: balsa wood, mineral wool, and polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane rigid foams. The thermal characterisation focused on thermal conductivity and the specific heat was characterised using an indirect method developed previously by the authors to simulate a real application scenario where one surface of the sandwich panels was subjected to high temperature, while the opposite surface was kept at room temperature. Steady and unsteady conditions were analysed up to 200 °C. Balsa and mineral wool exhibited a nonlinear increase in thermal conductivity with temperature, and the polymeric foams showed linear behaviour. The specific heat results also increased with temperature, and the relation was nonlinear for all the tested materials except for polyethylene terephthalate, which showed linear behaviour. Higher temperatures had the least effect on the specific heat for balsa wood and mineral wool. The polyethylene terephthalate foams were the most affected by temperature. Temperature variation was tested using the impulse excitation technique. The polymeric foams and balsa wood were studied up to 100 °C and 160 °C, respectively. The elastic modulus decreased with temperature. After 24 h of cooling, the tests were repeated and the elastic modulus had regained or even increased its initial value, for all the materials.</jats:p>"

For some abundance ratios ([N,Al,S/Fe]), VMP DLAs constrain the metal yields of the first SNe more reliably than VMP stars. We compile a large sample of high-S/N VMP DLAs from over 30 yr of literature, most with high-resolution spectral measurements. We infer the initial-mass-function-averaged CCSNe yield from the median values from the DLA abundance ratios of C, N, O, Al, Si, S, and Fe (over Fe and O). We assume that the DLAs are metal-poor enough that they represent galaxies in their earliest stages of evolution, when CCSNe are the only nucleosynthetic sources of the metals we analyze. We compare five sets of zero- and low-metallicity theoretical yields to the empirical yields derived in this work. We find that the five models agree with the DLA yields for ratios containing Si and S. Only one model (Heger &amp; Woosley 2010, hereafter HW10) reproduced the DLA values for N, and one other model (Limongi &amp; Chieffi 2018, hereafter LC18) reproduced [N/O]. We found little change in the theoretical yields with the adoption of an SN explosion landscape (where certain progenitor masses collapse into black holes, contributing no yields) onto HW10, but fixing explosion energy to progenitor mass results in wide disagreements between the predictions and DLA abundances. We investigate the adoption of a simple, observationally motivated initial distribution of rotational velocities for LC18 and find a slight improvement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For thorough understanding of the dynamics of mountain building processes, it is crucial to reconstruct the youngest crustal deformation history over time. Low-angle normal faults are features caused by orogen-parallel extension, which occurs in the last stage of collision. Low-angle normal faults play a key role in the exhumation of the lower crust and they are the reason for most of the seismicity within the chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We carried out microstructural analyses on an outcrop in the footwall of one of the major normal faults of the Alpine chain, the Simplon Fault Zone. This low-angle normal fault extended the crust by tens kilometers and it caused exhumation of its footwall, the deeper lower crust of the Alps, i.e. the Penninic nappes. The Simplon Fault Zone itself consists of a thick mylonitic zone overprinted by a narrow cataclastic zone, with the same kinematics. Its timing evolution history from ductile to brittle deformation is still under discussion. This study shows a new microstructural analysis from a fault gouge within the footwall of the northern part of the Simplon Fault Zone, and how it can reconstruct the different stages of exhumation history of this shear zone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results from micro-structural analyses show grain boundary migration features on folded quartz veins. This suggests that the protolith of the fault zone was at high temperature conditions, T&amp;gt;600&amp;amp;#176;C, during dynamic deformation. This folding belongs to extension-parallel folds that affect only the ductile shear zone. The presence of greenschist facies minerals suggests that the rock was exposed to low temperature and pressure conditions (T=300-400&amp;amp;#176;C, P=0.2GPa). Pressure-solution mechanisms affect both quartz and greenschist paragenesis, indicating formation in a shallow position of the shear zone. The last deformation was purely brittle, as shown by vertical calcite veins or fractures in quartz. It suggests a near-surface position of the fault.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Altogether, these multiple deformation phases within the gouge samples indicate a continuous exhumation history from high to low temperatures, with clear cross-cutting relationships. However, the lack of cataclasite features can be related to an involvement of the rocks within the fault core in a subsequent stage of deformation. To explain this we suggest a model in which the footwall maintained a high temperature over a long time, which inhibited cataclastic processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The recursive core for network function form games generalises the recursive core for such environments. We present two simple examples to illustrate positive and negative externalities.

Two accident scenario that causes the draining process were loss of freeze valve coolant and loss of secondary coolant. This study used basic design of the MSFR with the salt fuel compositions of LiF (77.5%) â€“ ThF4 (19.985%) â€“ 233UF4 (2.515%). The criticality calculation has been analyzed from the value of the effective multiplication factor obtained from Open MC (Monte Carlo base) calculation. The effective multiplication factor was calculated with a variation on the number of freeze valves open; 1, 8, and 16 valves. The calculation has resulted in the value of effective multiplication factor decreasing exponentially during the draining process. Results from this study could be used as basic for the future study of the accident condition in MSFR, since there are still many MSRs accident scenarios that still haven't been taken into account.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Here, we question the ways in which the preponderance of international students as tuition-paying consumers of public (and private) schools in the core is shifting the model of education, and the vision of citizenship, in the world system. Although significant work has been done to illuminate these dynamics in higher education, we argue that the nascent market at the secondary level is particularly instructive of global trends in late capitalism. A thoughtful consideration of the presence of tuition-paying high school students in U.S., British, Australian, and Canadian public-school systems demands an engagement with the cultural colonization of periphery knowledge systems that accompanies the extraction of all surplus commodified value in service of the idea of development. In the high stakes globalized free market—in which the gap between core and periphery grows ever-larger—core secondary schools become places to attain core credentials, core values, and core belonging. The students’ tuition dollars represent an increasing proportion of underfunded school districts’ revenues in austerity regimes, blurring the line between education as a public good and education as a salable commodity. We empirically demonstrate the dynamics of the market in international secondary education using existing public data, and we explore its contingencies, beneficiaries, and victims. We posit a world system in which commodified children are coerced consumers of core value systems and are credentialed as honorary members of the “haves.” We argue that, in the increasingly zero-sum competitions for artificially scarce resources, inequality drives demand for international secondary school education, which in turn drives inequality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In light of Bill C-92, which establishes a framework for delegating child and family service provision to Indigenous communities, this article addresses the contested regulation of employment and labour relations in Indigenous social service workplaces. It approaches this subject by looking back at NIL/TU,O Child and Family Services Society v. B.C. Government and Service Employees’ Union, a case in which employees at a First Nations child and family services provider attempted to unionize. NIL/TU,O set in motion a legal battle over the jurisdiction of Indigenous labour relations that ultimately reached the Supreme Court of Canada in 2010. The SCC’s determined that the labours of the Indigenous workers at NIȽ TU,O Child and Family Services are a matter of provincial jurisdiction because they fall outside of the “core of Indianness,“ a contested legal  concept used to designate federal legislative power over First Nations peoples. Using Indigenous feminisms and a feminist political economy approach, we argue that this decision rests on gendered appraisals – and, indeed, obfuscations – of social reproduction labour.  Bill C-92 necessitates revisiting the case history in NIL/TU,O because of the ways in which it seems to conflict with the new Act.  We suggest that the uncertainty surrounding jurisdiction over Indigenous labour has the dual potential of, on the one hand, being used strategically for exploitative or dis-possessive purposes, or, on the other hand, taken up as a opening for increased self-determination by Indigenous peoples.</jats:p>"

This paper presents an algorithm to improve the adaptability of multi scene feature signal recognition based on the smart switch core board, and designs the local communication interaction flow design based on topology recognition function from the station area intelligent terminal to the smart switch. The identification technology combining power frequency distortion and characteristic current is adopted. In the identification process, there is no need for the master station to participate in analysis and control. Multiple stations in the same community can be carried out concurrently to automatically identify the connection relationship between distribution network equipment and line topology, and dynamically build a clear and complete household transformer relationship and distribution network topology to help operation inspection, marketing The lean management level of distribution network such as regulation and control has been improved.</jats:p>",

The inert core/active shell/inert shell design improved the upconversion luminous efficiency of the new material several times. FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy)characterization showed that the surface of activated upconversion nanoparticles was modified with silicon shell and amino group. Combined with the characteristics that aminoated polystyrene magnetic microspheres could be separated by the magnetic field, an upconversion magnetic separation immunoassay method for the detection of pyrethroid pesticide residues was established. The capture probe competed with the pyrethroid standard, combined the signal probe, and measured the fluorescence signal value formed by the capture probe signal probe complex at 542 nm under 980 nm excitation light. The LOD (limit of detection)of fenpropathrin was 0.01 μg/L, cypermethrin was 0.015 μg/L, and fenvalerate was 0.011 μg/L. Through the actual sample detection of apple, cabbage and other samples, the recovery rate of pyrethroids was between 83.4~97.8%.

Kesebelas kapal yang ada terbagi dalam 3 ukuran yang berbeda yakni 6 GT (3 unit), 13 GT (2 unit) dan 25 GT (6 unit). Hanya kapal berukuran 6 dan 13 GT yang aktif digunakan untuk penangkapan ikan. Hal ini dikarenakan mahalnya biaya operasional kapal berukuran 25 GT. Pemberian kapal hibah telah dirasakan berpengaruh positif bagi masyarakat nelayan di Kabupaten Subang. Hal ini dapat terlihat dengan adanya peningkatan produksi perikanan tangkap sebesar 433,05 ton pada tahun 2020 jika dibandingkan dengan tahun 2018. Kapal hibah dilengkapi dengan alat tangkap jaring insang milenium yang dimaksudkan untuk mensosialisasikan penggunaan alat tangkap yang ramah lingkungan untuk menggantikan pukat hela dan pukat tarik yang telah dilarang.

Using a randomized allocation, nine recreationally trained, young adults (18–26 years) performed two sets each of quadriceps and hamstrings FR as well as supine/reverse and prone static planks for 30-s each with 1-min rest between sets and 5-min rest between exercises. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the lower abdominals (LA), external obliques (EO), lumbosacral erector spinae (LSES), upper lumbar erector spinae (ULES) muscle groups were normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction and analyzed. Quadriceps FR exhibited a very large magnitude greater LA activity compared to reverse plank (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.033, <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = 4.42) and hamstrings FR (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.020, <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = 3.49), respectively.

To date the Silurian lacks in (cyclostratigraphic) age constraints and in understanding in the way astronomical cycles modulate the Silurian climate, which hinders our understanding of Silurian climate dynamics. To assess the role of astronomical cycles in the pacing of the Silurian climate, we study the imprint of astronomical cycles on the record of the Sommerode-1 core from Bornholm, Denmark (53.65-118.66m).The core contains a near continuous Telychian record including the SOCIE and Valgu carbon isotope excursions/events&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4-5-6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.&amp;amp;#160; The core was scanned at University of Bremen/ MARUM (November 2021) using the Bruker M4 Tornado &amp;amp;#181;XRF scanner, enabling for a high-resolution cyclostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic study of the Telychian.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;XRF core measurements provided semi-quantitative element data, spaced at 0.5 mm, were converted into element concentrations (ppm) using a set of reference standards. A Principal Component Analysis simplified the variability in our dataset into 3 components. PC1 has high loadings for Al, Si, K, Ti, Fe and Co, and is interpreted as a detrital component. PC2 has high loadings for Ca and Mn, and is interpreted as an indicator of oxygenation conditions. PC3 has high loadings for S, indicative for the sulphides/dysoxic/anoxic conditions&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-8-9&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Peaks for Mn at 69-85m and S at 85-104m, indicate that part of the core (69-85 m) was deposited under oxic conditions while another part of the core (85-104 m) was deposited under anoxic/dysoxic conditions. We note that the transition to oxic conditions at 90 m coincides with the Valgu isotopic event&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; while the SOCIE&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (80-70 m) event occurs during oxic conditions. Spectral analysis (wavelet, MTM and Evolutive Harmonic Analysis (EHA)) on the 3 components reveals the imprints of long and short eccentricity, obliquity and precession. An EHA spectra of the detrital component was used to trace the long eccentricity in the depth domain which was used to infer changes in sedimentation rates. The sedimentation rates are used to convert the record from the depth to time domain. Astronomical cycles filtered from the record in the time domain show that astronomical cycles exert a great control on the depositional record.&amp;amp;#160; Indicating the astronomical cycles modulated the Telychian climate which in term paced oxygenation conditions at the sea-floor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.Melchin et al.

The developed core consists of three basic elements: an NdFeB magnet, Terfenol-D, and a specifically developed metallic alloy prepared by means of a suction casting method. The main goal of proposing a new type of core in the event of rapid demagnetization is to partially replace the permanent magnet with another material to reduce the rare-earth material while keeping the amount of generated electricity at a level that makes it possible to power low-power electrical devices. To “capture” the rapid change of magnetic flux, a small number of coils were made around the core. However, the very low voltage level at very high current required the use of specialized electronic transducers capable of delivering a voltage level appropriate for powering a microprocessor system. To overcome this problem, a circuit designed by the authors that enabled voltage processing from low impedance magnetic circuits was used. The obtained results demonstrated the usefulness of the system at resonant frequencies of up to 1 MHz.</jats:p>"

The record of soluble and insoluble impurities represents an important part of the paleoclimate proxy set in ice cores but is known to be affected post-depositionally through interaction with the ice matrix, diffusion and chemical reactions. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been recognized for its micron-scale resolution and micro-destructiveness in ice core impurity analysis. Important added value comes from employing LA-ICP-MS for state-of-the-art 2D chemical imaging. The latter has already revealed a close relationship between the ice grain boundary network and impurity signals with a significant soluble component, such as Na. Here we show the latest improvements in 2D chemical imaging of ice with LA-ICP-MS, by increasing the spatial resolution from 35 to 20 and even 10 &amp;amp;#181;m and extending the simultaneous analysis to cover also mostly insoluble impurity species, such as Al. The latter reveal clear signals of insoluble particle aggregates in samples of Greenland ice cores. Combining the chemical images with computer vision-based image analysis allows to separate the geochemical signals of grain boundaries and insoluble particles. Considering intensities as well as elemental ratios, this classification further highlights important differences in the geochemical signals depending on the location of the impurities in the ice matrix. Ultimately, we discuss how this refined approach may serve to investigate post-depositional changes occurring with increasing depth to the soluble and insoluble impurity components, based on grain growth and chemical reactions, respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Herein, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing method to generate single, double, and triple Tet-deficient mouse ESCs (mESCs) and differentiated these cells toward cardiac progenitors. By using emerald green fluorescent protein (GFP; emGFP) expression under the control of Nkx2.5 promoter as marker for cardiac progenitor cells, we discovered that Tet1 and Tet2 depletion significantly impaired mESC-to-cardiac progenitor differentiation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis further revealed that Tet deletion resulted in the accumulation of mesoderm progenitors to hamper cardiac differentiation. Re-expression of the Tet1 catalytic domain (Tet1CD) rescued the differentiation defect in Tet-triple knockout mESCs. Dead Cas9 (dCas9)-Tet1CD mediated loci-specific epigenome editing at the Hand1 loci validated the direct involvement of Tet-mediated epigenetic modifications in transcriptional regulation during cardiac differentiation. Our study establishes that Tet-mediated epigenetic remodeling is essential for maintaining proper transcriptional outputs to safeguard mESC-to-cardiac progenitor differentiation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The processing power of machines will continue to accelerate massively. Modern eras of computing are driven by elevated parallel processing by the revolution of multi-core processors. This continuing trend toward parallel architectural paradigms facilitates parallel processing on a single machine and necessitates parallel programming in order to utilize the machine's enormous processing power. As a consequence, scanner generator applications will eventually need to be parallelized in order to fully leverage the throughput benefits of multi-core processors. This article discusses the way of processing the tasks in parallel during the scanning stage of lexical analysis. This is done by recognizing tokens in different lines of the source program in parallel along with auto detection of keyword in a character stream. Tasks are allocated line-by-line to the multiple instances of the lexical analyzer program. Then, each of the instances is run in parallel to detect tokens on different cores that are not yet engaged. Design/Methodology/Approach: Developing a theoretical and experimental approach for parallelizing the lexical scanning process on a multi-core system. Findings/Result: Based on the developed model, the theoretical and practical results indicate that the suggested methodology outperforms the sequential strategy in terms of tokenization consistently. It significantly decreases the amount of time spent on lexical analysis during the compilation process. It is clearly observed that the speedup should increase at or close to the same rate as the number of cores and keywords in the source program increases. This enhancement would improve the overall compilation time even more. Originality/Value: A hybrid model is developed for the concurrent execution of a lexical analyzer on multi-core systems using a dynamic task allocation algorithm and an auto-keyword detection method.

For extending their service life or to evaluate these for new demands (loads), assessment of strength of concrete in existing structure becomes necessary, a task generally performed with nondestructive tests (NDT); ultrasonic pulse velocity (USPV) and rebound hammer being most commonly executed. Compressive strength is estimated using empirical expressions relating NDT to partially destructive tests (PDT) such as core test. For the development of structure-specific expressions, results of adequate number (depending on variability and desired confidence level) of PDT are essential but these might not be available due to operational constraints. Correlation expressions from literature could be used in such cases but having been developed for different ingredients, curing regimes, and environmental exposure conditions, there would be associated uncertainties. A practical method for the estimation of these uncertainties is not readily available in the literature. This article proposes the statistical approach of resampling for quantifying the uncertainty of indirect strength estimates using expressions from literature. Parametric (probability distribution) and nonparametric (bootstrap) tools are employed and demonstrated with a case study from India. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches could capture across-member variability whereas overall uncertainty incorporation, as well as repeatability, was better in nonparametric approach. Parametric approach is traditionally used and well accepted by practitioners in contrast to nonparametric methods, which have certain advantages. The detailed methodology enumerated in the article would be very useful for practitioners across the world.</jats:p>",

The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) is a prime example, with schools expected to implement online assessments and use online resources for instruction. Yet there is little known about the extent to which local education agencies (LEAs) and schools are taking advantage of policies that subsidize spending on internet connectivity. This article assesses the gaps in LEA access to subsidies for internet connectivity provided under the Federal Communication Commission’s E-Rate program. This analysis is situated in California, an early-adopting state of the CCSS and one of the largest recipients of E-Rate subsidies. This article focuses on Category 2 subsidies earmarked for building high-density, wireless internal connectivity networks necessary for supporting multiuser, online testing in schools. Drawing on longitudinal data from the 2006–07 to 2016–17 school years, the growing LEA demand for Category 2 subsidies following California’s adoption of the CCSS in 2010–11 is documented. At the same time, there are notable gaps in LEA applications and funding for these subsides across attributes such as enrollment size, rural location, per-pupil revenues, prior success in funding, and for LEAs with lower enrollments of free and reduced-price lunch eligible students. In further analysis, this article shows that LEAs that were denied Category 2 subsidies incurred greater spending on non-capitalized equipment post-CCSS adoption and experienced a decline in ELA and math test scores that started even prior to the denial of funding for Category 2 subsidies, suggesting a somewhat challenging transition to the CCSS. However, unfunded LEAs did not perform as poorly in ELA and math once online testing for the CCSS started. This article discusses how the FCC’s Modernization Order has addressed funding gaps in E-Rate and considerations for future reforms to the program. </jats:p>",

From June 2020 to December 2020, consecutive patients with LNs were randomly assigned into low- or standard-dose groups. The primary outcome was diagnosis accuracy, while secondary outcomes encompassed technical success, diagnostic yield, operative time, radiation dose, and CNB-related complications. This RCT was listed within ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04217655), registered 3 January 2020.\nResults\n A total of 200 patients were randomly assigned to low-dose (n = 100) and standard-dose (n = 100) groups. All patients achieved technical success of CT-guided CNB and the definite final diagnoses. No significant difference was found for operative times (n = 0.231) between 2 groups. The mean dose-length product was markedly reduced within low-dose group in comparison to standard-dose group (34.6 ± 11.1 vs. 351.4 ± 107.4 mGy-cm, P &lt; 0.001). Within low-dose group, the diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosis accuracy were 68%, 91.5%, 100%, and 94%, respectively. Within standard-dose group, the diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosis accuracy were 65%, 88.6%, 100%, and 92%, respectively. There were no significances in diagnostic yield (P = 0.653) and diagnostic accuracy (P = 0.579) between 2 groups. No significant differences within rates of pneumothorax (P = 0.836) and lung hemorrhage (P = 0.744) between 2 groups were observed.\nConclusions\n Compared with standard-dose CT-guided CNB for LNs, low-dose CT can significantly reduce radiation dose, while yield comparable safety and diagnostic accuracy.</jats:p>"

To decode circuit activity, imaged neurons must be individually segmented and tracked. This is particularly challenging when the brain itself moves and deforms inside a flexible body. The field has lacked general methods for solving this problem effectively. To address this need, we developed a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) Awith specific enhancements which we apply to freely moving <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</jats:italic>. For a traditional CNN to track neurons across images of a brain with different postures, the CNN must be trained with ground truth (GT) annotations of similar postures. When these postures are diverse, an adequate number of GT annotations can be prohibitively large to generate manually. We introduce ‘targeted augmentation’, a method to automatically synthesize reliable annotations from a few manual annotations. Our method effectively learns the internal deformations of the brain. The learned deformations are used to synthesize annotations for new postures by deforming the manual annotations of similar postures in GT images. The technique is germane to 3D images, which are generally more difficult to analyze than 2D images. The synthetic annotations, which are added to diversify training datasets, drastically reduce manual annotation and proofreading. Our method is effective both when neurons are represented as individual points or as 3D volumes. We provide a GUI that incorporates targeted augmentation in an end-to-end pipeline, from manual GT annotation of a few images to final proofreading of all images. We apply the method to simultaneously measure activity in the second-layer interneurons in <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic>: RIA, RIB, and RIM, including the RIA neurite.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The processing power of machines will continue to accelerate massively. Modern eras of computing are driven by elevated parallel processing by the revolution of multi-core processors. This continuing trend toward parallel architectural paradigms facilitates parallel processing on a single machine and necessitates parallel programming in order to utilize the machine's enormous processing power. As a consequence, scanner generator applications will eventually need to be parallelized in order to fully leverage the throughput benefits of multi-core processors. This article discusses the way of processing the tasks in parallel during the scanning stage of lexical analysis. This is done by recognizing tokens in different lines of the source program in parallel along with auto detection of keyword in a character stream. Tasks are allocated line-by-line to the multiple instances of the lexical analyzer program. Then, each of the instances is run in parallel to detect tokens on different cores that are not yet engaged. Design/Methodology/Approach: Developing a theoretical and experimental approach for parallelizing the lexical scanning process on a multi-core system. Findings/Result: Based on the developed model, the theoretical and practical results indicate that the suggested methodology outperforms the sequential strategy in terms of tokenization consistently. It significantly decreases the amount of time spent on lexical analysis during the compilation process. It is clearly observed that the speedup should increase at or close to the same rate as the number of cores and keywords in the source program increases. This enhancement would improve the overall compilation time even more. Originality/Value: A hybrid model is developed for the concurrent execution of a lexical analyzer on multi-core systems using a dynamic task allocation algorithm and an auto-keyword detection method.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Global biosphere primary productivity via photosynthesis is the largest carbon uptake flux from the atmosphere. The Earth biosphere currently absorbs near half of the carbon emitted by anthropogenic activities (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Therefore, for a better projection of future carbon cycle, it is important to understand how the global biosphere would respond to abrupt climate changes which occurred in the past. The last glacial period is punctuated by a number of rapid shifts between relatively cold (stadial) and warm (interstadial) stages named Dansgaard-Oeschger events (DO). Some stadials are also associated with abrupt, massive iceberg discharge event and are called Heinrich Stadials (HSs). The high-resolution CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; reconstruction from polar ice cores demonstrated millennial-scale CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; variations over HS-DO events (Bauska et al., 2021). The gradual rising of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; over HS has been attributed to ventilation changes in Southern Ocean (Gottschalk et al., 2016; Menviel et al., 2018) and/or reduced biological uptake (Ahn et al., 2012; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Schmittner and Lund, 2015). However, the role of the global biosphere is not well understood because of difficulties in estimating global biosphere productivity from local reconstructions based on indirect tracers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To address this, here we use the triple isotopic composition of air oxygen (&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;17&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#916; = ln(&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;17&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O+1) - &amp;amp;#955;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;ref&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#183;ln(&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O+1), &amp;amp;#955;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;ref&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.516), which is a biogeochemical tracer of global biosphere primary productivity (Luz et al., 1999). We measured &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;17&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#916; of trapped air in the NEEM ice core over 36 to 42 ka interval, covering HS4 and DO8 events. The new NEEM &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;17&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#916;&amp;amp;#160;data show no significant change over HS4, while CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; records from multiple ice cores indicate near ~20 ppm increase (e.g., Ahn and Brook, 2014; Bauska et al., 2021). By using the box models describing &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;17&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#916; systematics between biosphere-troposphere-stratosphere (e.g., Landais et al., 2007; Blunier et al., 2012), our preliminary results suggest that global biosphere productivity increases during HS4. This result is inconsistent with previous estimates based on ice-core records of non-sea-salt Na and Ca (Fischer et al., 2007), and the marine sediment core opal flux record (Gottschalk et al., 2016), both indicating a reduction of Southern Ocean biological productivity. More &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;17&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#916;&amp;amp;#160;samples remain to be measured up to the General Assembly 2022 and we hope to have a clearer picture by then.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

If we evaluated by neglecting wood species, strip width was an effective factor in the bending strength and ineffective modulus of elasticity. In addition, the bending strength of the end-grain core oriental beech blockboard is 79 MPa and that of the end-grain core black poplar blockboard is 57 MPa, regardless of the width of the core strip.

This three-dimensional model is created by using the fiber-beams for members and multi-layer shell elements for RC core walls. The numerical simulation has been examined under the thirteen sets of strong ground motion records which are scaled with the design and maximum seismic levels, Design-Basis Earthquake (DBE) and Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) level hazards respectively. In consequence, the desirable performance of high-rise steel moment frame building with RC shear core consisting of coupling beams and rectangular shear walls is shown. The outcome of nonlinear time history analyses reports the acceptable seismic performance of tall buildings designed.  Results showed that maximum inter-story drift is significantly lower than allowable drift.  Also, the RC core wall absorbed almost two-third of the total shear forces from the base level to one-third of height. However, the shear values of the core wall were significantly reduced by increasing the height while the shear values of the steel moment frame stayed constant.</jats:p>"

In this study, Si@C/SiC@C core–shell nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 10–40 nm were produced by pulsed laser irradiation (wavelength = 1070 nm; pulse width = 10 ms) of a mixture of graphite powder and waste Si powder discharged from the grinding process of Si wafers. High‐speed camera observations of the laser‐induced plume were conducted to elucidate the nanoparticle generation mechanism, and it was determined that Si/SiC nanoparticles were formed within the laser‐induced plume in the early stage of laser irradiation. Si and C demonstrated different plume propagation patterns and plume decay times, and the time difference enabled the coating of the generated Si/SiC nanoparticles with a thin layer of graphene, forming core–shell hybrid structures. The electron diffraction results revealed that the generated nanoparticles were mainly composed of 3C‐SiC@C core shells, which is a novel nanomaterial with promising applications as anode materials for future lithium‐ion batteries.</jats:p>",

The participants comprised 153 nurses who worked at tertiary hospitals and general hospitals throughout South Korea. Turnover intention was measured using the Nurse Turnover Intention Scale. Organizational justice was measured using the Justice Scale, and nursing core competency was measured using the Korean Nursing Core Competency Scale. Data were collected via an online survey and analyzed using multiple regression. Among nurses with less than 3 years of clinical experience, a lower distributive justice score (β = −0.47, p &lt; 0.001) was associated with high turnover intention. Among nurses with 3 to 6 years of clinical experience, a lower interactional justice score (β = −0.37, p = 0.042) and high nursing core competency (β = 0.31, p = 0.034) were associated with high turnover intention. The type of organizational justice that influenced turnover intention differed depending on clinical experience. These results highlight the need to understand the professional characteristics of nurses according to their clinical experience and to provide targeted organizational support and effective competency-based human resource management.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to elucidate the patterns of genetic diversity within and among different structural groups, and measure the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of 383 globally distributed rapeseed germplasm using 8,502 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We divided the germplasm collection into five subpopulations (P1 to P5) according to geographic and growth habit-related patterns. All subpopulations showed moderate genetic diversity (average <jats:italic>H</jats:italic> = 0.22 and <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> = 0.34). The pairwise <jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>st</jats:italic></jats:sub> comparison revealed a great degree of divergence (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>st</jats:italic></jats:sub> &gt; 0.24) between most of the combinations. The rutabaga type showed highest divergence with spring and winter types. Higher divergence was also found between winter and spring types. Admixture model based structure analysis, principal component and neighbor-joining tree analysis placed all subpopulations into three distinct clusters. Admixed genotype constituted 29.24% of total genotypes, while remaining 70.76% belongs to identified clusters. Overall, mean linkage disequilibrium was 0.03 and it decayed to its half maximum within &lt; 45 kb distance for whole genome. The LD decay was slower in C genome (&lt; 93 kb); relative to the A genome (&lt; 21 kb) which was confirmed by availability of larger haplotype blocks in C genome than A genome. The findings regarding LD pattern and population structure will help to utilize the collection as an important resource for association mapping efforts to identify genes useful in crop improvement as well as for selection of parents for hybrid breeding.</jats:p>"

However, neural substrates and/or brain regions that play a role in the aversive effects of nicotine have not been fully identified. Previous work done in our laboratory showed that systemic administration of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) agonist ±U50488 increased the aversive effects of nicotine. In this study, we assessed the effects of KOR activation in specific brain regions, namely, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core and ventral tegmental area (VTA) on the aversive effects of nicotine using the conditioned taste aversion model. Separate groups of Wistar rats were implanted with cannulae above either the NAcc core or the VTA. KOR agonist (±U50488) was bilaterally infused in the NAcc core (0, 0.3, and 3 ug/0.5 ul/side) or VTA (0, 0.3, 1.5, and 3 ug/0.5 ul/side) prior to receiving nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, base; s.c.) during conditioning. Bilateral infusion of the KOR agonist (3 ug/0.5 ul/side) in the NAcc core or the VTA increased the aversive effects of nicotine compared with respective saline controls. Together, these results suggest that pharmacological activation of the KORs in the NAcc core and VTA dose dependently modulate the aversive effects of nicotine. Because aversive effects of nicotine determine susceptibility to development of nicotine dependence, we can conclude that KOR activity in the NAcc and VTA after administration of nicotine may determine susceptibility to the development of nicotine dependence.</jats:p>",

LEED–C-and-S version 3 (v3) and version 4 (v4) were considered. The absolute effect size is used to evaluate the performance of the LEED–C-and-S points. To assess the difference between Finland and Spain, we use the natural logarithm of the odds ratio and Fisher’s exact 2 × 2 test with Lancaster’s mid-p-value when analyzing the dichotomous data, and Cliff’s &amp;delta; and the exact Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests when analyzing ordinal data. As a result, in order to achieve the Gold level in LEED–C-and-S office-type projects, Finland and Spain demonstrated similarities and differences in credit values in v3 and v4. In v4 (latest version), the similarly high credits were location and transportation (LT) and water efficiency (WE) and similarly low credits were material and resource (MR) and environmental quality (EQ); different credit values were in the energy and atmosphere (EA) category, in which Finland outperformed Spain, and the sustainable sites (SS) strategy category, in which Spain outperformed Finland. Thus, Finland used the LT-WE-EA strategy, whereas Spain used the LT-WE-SS strategy. Knowing these strategies can be helpful in better understanding green building development in these countries.</jats:p>",

The present paper aims at a historical and evolutionary recovery of the concept of change in the school organization, with emphasis on identifying strategies and techniques for managing the process of developing and changing the manager, taking into consideration his professional competences and his personal abilities, considered as core and trigger agent for effective change in the organization.  Personal change involves dynamics, which implies personal development, becoming, training. In order to complete the process of personal change of a school manager it takes a long time, of involvement in one's own development in order to trigger  induce support the change of the school organization. In order to adopt the most appropriate organizational strategy (maintaining/restricting/developing or diversifying the organization), the manager must constantly evaluate his own abilities/competencies, to value those that bring performance to his organization.  The methodology consisted in the rigorous analysis of the specialized literature and the empirical research, instrumented by a survey based on a questionnaire applied to the managers of 15 early education organizations in Dâmboviţa county. The main conclusions from the study focus on the process of becoming a manager, with an emphasis on the triggering moment of his personal change, transposed into behaviors that will have implications for the culture of his organization.</jats:p>",

Calculations were performed using the continuous energy transport code Serpent 2 with ENDF/B-VIII.0 nuclear data. Integral reactivity measurement was done by compensating method with control rod bank, regulating rod, and reactivity meter. Calculations are carried out for each method used in control rod measurement data with an aim to validate calculated results to experimental data. Compared with the measured experiment data, there are no significant differences in calculation results of integral reactivity. The maximum difference of the control rod's total reactivity is 1.26% compared to the measurement carried out by compensating method with regulating rod.</jats:p>"

The progress of this temperate crop in the sub-tropical country relies strongly on improvement activities utilizing the genetic resources acquired over a time period. However, proper maintenance, evaluation and utilization of germplasm resources is a cumbersome task. Creation of core set of conserved genetic resources is an efficient and cost effective method of management of conserved germplasm and its use in breeding program. Indian collection of potato (Solanum tuberosum ssp tuberosum) constitutes 1399 accessions emanating from the five continents maintained under ex situ conservation. A core subset of 140 potato germplasm was developed using Power Core software based on 19 morphological traits. Majority of entries in the core subset were from South America (42.14%). Comparison of mean data using Newman-Keul's test and variances using Levene's test for different traits revealed representation of actual diversity of base population by the core subset. Correlations among the traits governed by co-adapted gene complexes were conserved in the core subset. Shannon-Weaver diversity indices indicate that the potato core subset maximized the phenotypic diversity of the potato germplasm. Validation of core subset using principal component analysis reveals that the first 4 PCs represents 55.27% of total variations in core subset compared to 52.50% that in entire collection. The identified core subset can be used in Indian potato improvement programs as well as in genomics studies.</jats:p>"

The data can be used to highlight the presence of unusual patterns and to relate them to Ni, Cu, PGE or other mineralization.

This study proposes a core ontology for Vietnamese legal documents which covers general legal domain called as ViLO. The ViLO ontology mainly consists of related institutions of Vietnamese political system, types and structures of legal documents. The method of the NeOn-based collaborations among domain experts and ontology engineers was conducted to build up the ViLO ontology. Through FOCA-based validation results, the proposed method was shown to be effective and efficient. The resulting ontology was demonstrated to be reliable and enriched. The ViLO ontology is supposed to be a basis for further constructions of domain ontologies and artificial intelligence applications in Vietnamese law. </jats:p>",

The traditional high-rise building design method generally assumes the structure is fixed at the base because the influence of soil–structure interaction is considered to be beneficial to the response of structures under the earthquake excitation. However, recent earthquakes and studies indicated that SSI may exert detrimental effects on commonly used structural systems. In this study, a numerical soil–structure model is established in <jats:italic>Abaqus</jats:italic> software to explore the impacts of SSI on high-rise frame-core tube structures. The seismic response of frame-core tube structures with various structural heights, height–width ratios, foundation types and soil types is studied. The numerical simulation results including maximum lateral deflections, foundation rocking, inter-storey drifts and base shears of rigid-base and flexible-base buildings are discussed and compared. The results reveal the lateral displacement and inter-storey drifts of the superstructure can be amplified when SSI is taken into account, while the base shears are not necessarily reduced. Increasing the stiffness of the foundation and the subsoil can generally increase the seismic demand of structures. It has been concluded that it is neither safe nor economical to consider only the beneficial effects of SSI or to ignore them in structural design practice.</jats:p>",

Based upon calls to investigate the psychometric properties of the multi-item (“Ages of Me”) operationalization of subjective age, we conducted a series of tests that evaluated the stability and incremental predictive validity of this construct. Using a 3-wave longitudinal design with a sample of working adults (T1 N = 1,182, T2 N = 975, T3 N = 875), we identified that the multi-item composite measure of subjective age (feel-age, do-age, interest-age, and look-age) has stable psychometric properties over time. Regression analyses revealed that the multi-item subjective age operationalization had stronger associations with job performance, the achievement of personal workplace goals, and work-related flow than the single-item version; however, when controlling for prior levels of outcomes the majority of effects dissipated. Moreover, core self-evaluations had incremental predictive validity over subjective age and prior levels of outcomes. Relative weights analysis confirmed that the core self-evaluations construct is a more important predictor than either subjective age operationalization. Results are discussed in the context of debates surrounding the utility of subjective age and core self-evaluations for aging research. We offer theoretical and practical considerations for future studies on subjective age and core self-evaluations at work.</jats:p>",

To uncover the mechanism behind the anti-tumour effects we have performed a transcriptional analysis of AM630 activity both in the tumour core cells (U87) and the invasive margin cells (GIN-8), the latter representing a better proxy of post-surgical residual disease. Results: The core and invasive margin cells exhibited markedly different gene expression profiles and only the core cells had high expression of a potential AM630 target, the CB1 receptor. Both cell types had moderate expression of the HTR2B serotonin receptor, a reported AM630 target. We found that the AM630 driven transcriptional response was substantially higher in the central cells than in the invasive margin cells, with the former driving the up regulation of immune response and the down regulation of cell cycle and metastatic pathways and correlating with transcriptional responses driven by established anti-neoplastics as well as serotonin receptor antagonists. Conclusion: Our results highlight the different gene sets involved in the core and invasive margin cell lines derived from GBM and an associated marked difference in responsiveness to AM630. Our findings identify AM630 as an anti-neoplastic drug in the context of the core cells, showing a high correlation with the activity of known antiproliferative drugs. However, we reveal a key set of similarities between the two cell lines that may inform therapeutic intervention.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The cranio-orbito-zygomatic (COZ) approach is a workhorse of skull base surgery, and each of its steps has a precise effect on target exposure and surgical freedom. The present study overviews the key techniques for execution and tailoring of the COZ approach, focusing on the quantitative effects resulting from removal of the orbitozygomatic (OZ) bar, orbital rim, and zygomatic arch. Methods: A PRISMA-based literature review was performed on the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases using the main keywords associated with the COZ approach. Articles in English without temporal restriction were included. Eligibility was limited to neurosurgical relevance. Results: A total of 78 articles were selected. The range of variants of the COZ approach involves a one-piece, two-piece, and three-piece technique, with a decreasing level of complexity and risk of complications. The two-piece technique includes an OZ and orbitopterional variant. Superolateral orbitotomy expands the subfrontal and transsylvian corridors, increasing surgical freedom to the basal forebrain, hypothalamic region, interpeduncular fossa, and basilar apex. Zygomatic osteotomy shortens the working distance of the pretemporal and subtemporal routes. Conclusion: Subtraction of the OZ bar causes a tremendous increase in angular exposure of the subfrontal, transsylvian, pretemporal, and subtemporal perspectives avoiding brain retraction, allowing for multiangled trajectories, and shortening the working distance. The COZ approach can be tailored based on the location of the lesion, thus optimizing the target exposure and surgical freedom and decreasing the risk of complications.</jats:p>"

These different phases are characterized not only by varying frequency of use but also by degree of standardization and distinguishability. The Levallois method, a sophisticated Middle Paleolithic technology aimed at producing desired stone items of predetermined morphology, is one such innovation. It has been repeatedly suggested that the Levallois method originated within earlier Lower Paleolithic Acheulian industries, and this work contributes to this discussion. We analyze the reduction trajectory of prepared cores and predetermined blanks from the late Acheulian sites of Jaljulia and Revadim, adding important new evidence for the Lower Paleolithic origins of the Levallois method and its adoption and assimilation in the human stone-tool repertoire of this period in the Levant. Revadim and Jaljulia also provide a rare opportunity to study patterns in the early assimilation of technological innovations. These sites yielded rich lithic assemblages typical of the late Acheulian in the Levant. The assemblages include handaxes but are mostly dominated by flake production technologies and flake-tools. The early appearance of prepared cores at both sites signals, in our view, the inception of concepts related to the Levallois method, termed here proto-Levallois, in the late Acheulian Levant. Through a detailed analysis of prepared cores and their products, we are able to characterize the early stages of assimilation of this method, using it as a case study in a broader discussion of the adoption and assimilation of technological innovations during Lower Paleolithic times.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Lancaster Sound is currently one of the pathways for Arctic water and ice entering Baffin Bay. However, this gateway was blocked by the coalescing Laurentide and Innuitian Ice Sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum and only opened during the early Holocene after the various ice sheets had retreated (Dyke et al., 2002; Dalton et al., 2020). Core GeoB22336-4 is a well radiocarbon-dated sediment record from the Lancaster Sound Trough Mouth. Sedimentological and geochemical (elemental and mineralogical) properties of this core revealed four major units: (i) the deglacial unit (~14.5 &amp;amp;#8211; 9.7 ka BP) with a dense, foraminifera-free, gravel-rich diamict (&amp;gt;14.0 ka BP) that captures proximal ice-margin conditions, probably deposited under an extended thick ice-shelf environment, overlain by rapidly deposited gravel-bearing sandy-silty mud with intercalated turbidite layers reflecting strong input of ice-rafted material and mass wasting, likely resulting from the fast landward retreat of bordering ice sheets in response to regional warming; (ii) the early Holocene unit (~9.7 &amp;amp;#8211; 8 ka BP) characterized by a drop in sedimentation rate and the absence of ice-rafted material and reduction in detrital carbonates, suggesting a switch from tide-water to predominately land-terminating glaciers during glacial retreat; (iii) the unit deposited contemporaneously with the regional Holocene Optimum (~8 &amp;amp;#8211; 5.9 ka BP; Ledu et al., 2010; Jennings et al., 2011; St-Onge &amp;amp; St-Onge 2014) consists of rapidly deposited rather fine-grained sediments (up to 52 cm ka&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) possibly related to enhanced meltwater- and/or sea-ice-driven sediment input; and (iv) the neoglacial unit (&amp;lt;5.9 ka BP) with reduced sedimentation rates, a sediment provenance switch from calcite-dominated to dolomite-dominated detrital carbonates, and an increased organic matter flux to the seafloor, which led to a four-fold increase in bioturbation. This diverse sedimentary record reflects the complex ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions controlling the sedimentary dynamics and sediment provenance in northwestern Baffin Bay from the last deglaciation through the Holocene. It sheds light on the complex interaction between sediments delivered by local meltwater sources, mass wasting, iceberg and sea ice-rafting, the opening of the Arctic gateways through Lancaster Sound and Nares Strait, and the influence of warm Atlantic Water (AW). In addition, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) possibly governs surface waters and primary production in northern Baffin Bay including the development and extension of the North Water Polynya (NOW).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

In addition, and particularly over Holocene timescales, high-precision annually resolved chronologies have been developed for these records and permit ages to be assigned to eruptions. The identification of tephra in ice cores in direct association with chemical indicators of volcanism, such as sulphate, can significantly enhance volcanic reconstructions as tephra can be linked to an eruptive source. Such source attributions can provide information on the location of the eruptions, the magnitude of aerosol emissions at the source and help assess any climatic impact. In addition, they can aid the reconstruction of volcanic histories and the assessment of future hazard risk.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The tephra record for the interior of East Antarctica over the last 5,500 years is potentially underexploited as a prior focus on visible horizons and exploring the deep ice cores that cover longer time spans has resulted in only one horizon, dated to ~3.5 ka BP, being identified in these records. Here we discuss ongoing tephrochronological investigations of two ice-cores, B53 and B54, retrieved from the interior of the East Antarctic Plateau. High-resolution, sub-annual chemical records have been measured from both cores using a continuous melter system. These data were used to develop a sampling strategy to identify cryptotephra horizons with ice-core sections containing coeval peaks in fine insoluble particles and non-sea-salt sulphur targeted and &amp;gt;50 events were directly sampled. This approach recently has been used to identify cryptotephras in both Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. When glass tephra shards were identified thin sections were created and individual glass shards were geochemically analysed using electron-probe microanalysis to help identify their volcanic source and permit correlations between records.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thus far, more than 10 cryptotephra horizons have been identified and linked to regional sources such as the South Sandwich and South Shetland Islands and the ~3.5 ka BP event has been traced in both cores as a visible layer. More detailed investigations are being conducted on samples from specific volcanic signals of interest that may derive from eruptions of ultra-distal volcanic sources. Such eruptions could have deposited very small glass tephra shards over Antarctica, which poses significant analytical challenges and necessitates the use of innovative approaches for tephra identification and geochemical analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

A small core plug was imaged in the original and chemically altered states. The morphology of the resolved pore space was quantified using various approaches, such as sample‐spanning cluster analysis, capillary drainage transform (CDT), and Minkowski functionals. In particular, we carefully evaluated the changes in macropore connectivity by calculating the fraction of percolated cluster, the Euler characteristic of macroporous phase, and the critical pore diameter in pre‐ and post‐alteration states. We observed that the reactive flow mainly affected larger pores in the macropore region of the sample. More importantly, a huge increase in macropore connectivity, as indicated majorly by the CDT measurements and the Euler characteristic, was observed such that the poorly connected original macropore phase was converted to well‐connected ones after the reactive flow. In addition, the increases in the macropore surface area and integral mean curvature indicated that the oomoldic and interooidal pores of the rock were dominantly enlarged by the reactive fluid. Based on direct numerical simulations on the main flow paths (i.e., the macro‐connected pore phase), strong correlations were found between changes in transport properties and the evolution of connectivity and length scales of the macropore phase, such that simple power‐law models could be used to predict with acceptable accuracy. This suggests that the evolution of transport properties of the rock was mainly controlled by the changes in the macro‐connected porosity and the critical pore diameter.</jats:p>",

The main aim of this study was to gain insights into the understanding of ‘inclusion’ within the context of PE policy in Finland and particularly focuses on the inclusion of students with special educational needs (SEN). This research focuses on PE, because the subject is still shaped by underlying sentiments representing traditional values such as nationalism and given gender roles which seem to contrast with the conceptualization of inclusion. Therefore, the current Finnish NCC (of PE) has been qualitatively content analysed adopting a deductive‐inductive approach. The findings demonstrate that the official documents build upon a broad understanding of inclusion and diversity, which is not only restricted to students with disabilities. However, the PE curricula provide few practical implications for teaching in diverse classes which may stem from inconsistency across the analysed documents in considering diversity issues. We conclude that the Finnish curriculum leaves room for teachers' pedagogical autonomy, but further research is needed to explore how it frames their possibilities to work inclusively in practice.</jats:p>",

In North America, given the widespread occurrence of Grenville basement, Grenville DZs are commonly viewed as nondiagnostic with regard to source region in provenance studies. Systematic recovery of DZ core-rim U-Pb ages makes it possible to identify and differentiate previously indistinguishable basement source terranes by leveraging their multistage tectono-magmatic evolution. Our analysis demonstrates that Grenville DZs exhibit distinct rim ages in different parts of the North American Paleozoic Appalachian-Ouachita-Marathon foreland. Whereas Grenville DZ grains in the eastern foreland, sourced from the southern Appalachian orogen in the eastern United States, exhibit Taconian and Acadian (490–350 Ma) rims, grains in the western foreland, derived from Mexico, mainly show Neoproterozoic (750–500 Ma) rim ages. This difference permits differentiation of nondiagnostic core ages by their distinctive rim ages. Furthermore, core-rim paired ages can illuminate potential genetic relationships among coexisting age components in DZ spectra, thereby indicating whether the DZs are derived from separate sources or from a single source with multistage tectono-magmatic histories. Thus, DZ rim-core ages can provide critical insights into reconstructing global source-to-sink systems and elucidating genetic linkages within multistage orogenic systems.</jats:p>",

Unlike snakes, in which enzymes play a primary role in envenomation, in scorpions, their function appears to be ancillary in most species. Due to this, studies on the diversity of scorpion venom components have focused primarily on the peptides responsible for envenomation (toxins) and a few others (e.g., antimicrobials), while enzymes have been overlooked. In this work, a comprehensive study on enzyme diversity in scorpion venoms was performed by transcriptomic and proteomic techniques. Enzymes of 63 different EC types were found, belonging to 330 orthogroups. Of them, 24 ECs conform the scorpion venom enzymatic core, since they were determined to be present in all the studied scorpion species. Transferases and lyases are reported for the first time. Novel enzymes, which can play different roles in the venom, including direct toxicity, as venom spreading factors, activators of venom components, venom preservatives, or in prey pre-digestion, were described and annotated. The expression profile for transcripts coding for venom enzymes was analyzed, and shown to be similar among the studied species, while being significantly different from their expression pattern outside the telson.</jats:p>"

Despite this, high annual DSP turnover rates are problematic. DSP turnover is disruptive to people who receive supports as the lack of stable, reliable supports can negatively impact their important day-to-day outcomes (e.g., safety, community participation, and choice). Turnover also comes at a cost to provider organization in the hiring and training of new employees. To retain DSPs, organizations offer incentives (e.g., bonuses, retirement plans, health insurance). This study utilized National Core Indicators® (NCI®) Staff Stability Survey 2018 data to examine the relationships between wages, different types of incentives, including benefits (e.g., paid time off, access to health insurance, disability insurance, wage bonuses, health incentives programs, etc.) to annual turnover in participating states in the United States. Results indicated that incentives were not positively associated with DSP retention. Staff wages were the most notable factor associated with differences in DSP retention rates, along with the state in which the organization was located as well as organization vacancy rates.</jats:p>",

The mirrors are monolithically installed on a stage, which is driven with five-axis motion, and are vibrationally separated from the ARPES measurement system. Spatial mapping of the Au photolithography pattern on Si signifies the beam spot size of 10 µm (horizontal) × 12 µm (vertical) at the sample position, which is well suited to resolve the fine structure in local electronic states. Utilization of the micro-beam and the high precision sample motion system enables the accurate spatially resolved band-structure mapping, as demonstrated by the observation of a small band anomaly associated with tiny sample bending near the edge of a cleaved topological insulator single crystal.</jats:p>",

Exploring the role of the trunk muscles in bowling performance affords us the opportunity to uncover potential mechanisms to improve bowling performance.\nObjectives: To investigate the association between bowling performance and trunk muscle stability, strength-endurance and thickness in adolescent pace bowlers.\nMethods: Adolescent pace bowlers participated in this crosssectional study. Trunk muscle stability was measured using Sahrmann’s Stability Scale, strength-endurance using the Bourbon Trunk Muscle Strength Test and thickness of the abdominal wall and lumbar multifidus muscles using ultrasound imaging.\nResults: Forty-six pace bowlers with a mean age of 15.9 ±1.2 years participated. The average ball release speed was109.2±11.8 km.h-1 . This measurement was higher in level four of stability than in level two (mean difference 22.2 ± SD 6.8 km.h-1; p= .018). No link between ball release speed and strength-endurance could be found. Multiple correlations of moderate strength (r &gt; 0.4) exist between ball release speed and absolute trunk muscle thickness with height and weight as confounding factors. The relationship between accuracy and the trunk muscle variables investigated in this study is weak.\nConclusion: Bowlers with better trunk muscle stability bowled faster than those with a lower level of trunk stability,irrespective of their age, height and weight. Trunk muscle thickness correlated with ball release speed; however,confounding factors such as height and weight play a role and therefore, findings need to be interpreted with caution.</jats:p>"

Digital image watermarking technology is used to secure and ensure digital images’ copyright by embedding hidden information that proves its copyright. In this article, the color images Parallel Robust watermarking algorithm using Quaternion Legendre-Fourier Moment (QLFM) in polar coordinates is implemented on Raspberry Pi (RPi) platform with parallel computing and C++ programming language. In the host image, a binary Arnold scrambled image is embedded. Watermarking algorithm is implemented and tested on Raspberry Pi model 4B. We can combine many Raspberry Pi’s into a ‘cluster’ (many computers working together as one) for high-performance computation. Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP for parallel programming to accelerate the execution time for the color image watermarking algorithm implemented on the Raspberry Pi cluster.</jats:p>",

Few QTL (quantitative trait loci) studies using biparental mapping populations have identified QTL for seed dormancy and seed grade traits. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to detect marker–trait associations for seed germination, dormancy, and seed grading traits in peanut. A total of 120 accessions from the U.S. peanut mini-core collection were evaluated for seed quality traits and genotyped using Axiom SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array for peanut. We observed significant variation in seed quality traits in different accessions and different botanical varieties. Through GWAS, we were able to identify multiple regions associated with sound mature kernels, seed weight, shelling percent, seed germination, and dormancy. Some of the genomic regions that were SNP associated with these traits aligned with previously known QTLs. For instance, QTL for seed dormancy has been reported on chromosome A05, and we also found SNP on the same chromosome associated with seed dormancy, explaining around 20% of phenotypic variation. In addition, we found novel genomic regions associated with seed grading, seed germination, and dormancy traits. SNP markers associated with seed quality and dormancy identified here can accelerate the selection process. Further, exploring the function of candidate genes identified in the vicinity of the associated marker will assist in understanding the complex genetic network that governs seed quality.</jats:p>"

We then compare the radar-derived SMB records to the ice core SMB records to determine the surface area that the ice core record is representative of, in terms of mean SMB as well as SMB temporal variability on historical timescales. We examine ice core records situated over the coastal ice rises of East Antarctica, where SMB is high and spatially heterogeneous, as well as over the interior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where SMB is more uniform spatially.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In an era of increasing energy demand, declining oil fields, and fluctuating crude oil prices globally, most oil companies are looking forward to implementing cost-effective and environmentally sustainable enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques such as low salinity waterflooding (LSWF) and microbial EOR (MEOR). The present study numerically investigates the combined influence of simultaneous LSWF and microbial flooding for in-situ MEOR in tertiary mode within a sandstone core under spatiotemporally varying pH and temperature conditions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The developed black oil model consists of five major coupled submodels: nonlinear heat transport model; ion transport coupled with multiple ion exchange (MIE) involving uncomplexed cations and anions; pH variation with salinity and temperature; coupled reactive transport of injected substrates, Pseudomonas putida and produced biosurfactants with microbial maximum specific growth rate varying with temperature, salinity, and pH; relative permeability and fractional flow curve variations owing to interfacial tension (IFT) reduction and wettability alteration (WA) by LSWF and biofilm deposition. The governing equations are solved using finite difference technique. Operator splitting and bisection methods are adopted to solve the MIE-transport model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The present model is found to be numerically stable and agree well with previously published experimental and analytical results. In the proposed MIE-transport mechanism, decreasing injection water (IW) salinity from 2.52 to 0.32 M causes enhanced Ca2+ desorption rendering rock surface toward more water-wet. Consequently, oil relative permeability (kro) increases with &amp;gt;55% reduction in water fractional flow (fw) at water saturation of 0.5 from the initial oil-wet condition. Further reducing IW salinity to 0.03 M causes Ca2+ adsorption shifting the surface wettability toward more oil-wet, thus increasing fw by 52%. Formation water (FW) salinity showed minor impact on WA with &amp;lt;5% decrease in fw when FW salinity is reduced from 3.15 to 1.05 M. During low-salinity augmented microbial flooding (LSAMF), biosurfactant production is enhanced by &amp;gt;63% on reducing IW salinity from 2.52 to 0.32 M with negligible increase on further reducing IW and FW salinities. This might be owing to limiting nonisothermal condition (40 to 55°C), dispersion, sorption, and microbial decay. During LSAMF, maximum biosurfactant production occurs at microbial maximum specific growth rate of 0.53 h-1, mean fluid velocity of 2.63×10-3 m h-1 and initial oil saturation of 0.6, thus resulting in significant WA, increase in kro by &amp;gt;20%, and corresponding fw reduction by &amp;gt;84%. Moreover, the EOR efficiency of LSAMF is marginally impacted even on increasing the minimum attainable IFT by two orders of magnitude from 10-3 to 10-1 mN m-1. Though pH increased from 8.0 to 8.9, it showed minor impact on microbial metabolism. Formation damage owing to bioplugging observed near injection point causing increase in fw by ~26% can be mitigated by adopting suitable well-stimulation strategies during the LSAMF run time.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The present study is a novel attempt to show synergistic effect of LSAMF over LSWF in enhancing oil mobility and recovery at core scale by simultaneously addressing complex crude oil-brine-rock (COBR) chemistry and critical thermodynamic parameters that govern MEOR efficiency within a typical sandstone formation. The present model with relatively lower computational cost and running time improves the predictive capability to preselect potential field candidates for successful LSAMF implementation.</jats:p>",

The concept captures important aspects of Norwegian school leaders’ task preferences. To gain further insight into the process of developing the capacity for instructional leadership, this study links instructional leadership to school leaders’ core practices. The multidimensional concept of core practices views school leaders as goal oriented and actively involved in teachers’ collaboration and professional development, observation, and supervision. Moreover, the concept covers school leaders’ efforts to redesign and improve their schools’ instructional programs. In this study, school leaders assessed instructional leadership related to three distinctive core practices: observation and supervision, collaborative learning engagement, and time allocation for data use. Multiple regression analyses were conducted, and overall, the regression model, with all the predictors included as a set, was significant. 28.5% of the variance in school leader's capacity for instructional leadership is explained by the three distinct factors. The results indicate that when school leaders adapt core practices of leadership to their work context, their capacity as instructional leaders increases. The findings and implications will be discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We use observations of hydraulic fractures in core, outcrop attributes of natural hydraulic fractures, and analogue models, to address how hydraulic fracture networks evolve. A slant core from the Wolfcamp Formation—an unconventional shale hydrocarbon reservoir in the Permian Basin of West Texas—collected within 18 m and 30 m of two hydraulically stimulated horizontal wells, provided an opportunity to examine hydraulic fractures directly. In approximately 183 m of core, 309 calcite-sealed natural opening-mode fractures and 375 hydraulic fractures were identified. Many hydraulic fractures in the core show complex morphology, including twist-hackle segmentation, diversion, and bifurcation; these structures most commonly develop at lithological bed boundaries and mechanical heterogeneities such as natural fractures and concretions. An outcrop of bed-parallel pavements in the Cretaceous Boquillas Formation in West Texas contains opening-mode fractures that likely formed by natural hydraulic fracturing. Fracture traces provide evidence of twist-hackle segmentation, and are typically associated with bed boundaries and preexisting bed-parallel stylolites. A laboratory study of hydraulic fracturing of 33 synthetic blocks of gypsum and hydrostone revealed fracture steps, diversions, twist hackles, and multiple overlapping fractures together with information on fracture growth directions. These complexities in the fracture network were dominantly nucleated at inclusions used to simulate pre-existing fractures, and as a result of mechanical heterogeneity introduced by the wellbore and perforations. Collectively, our results show that complex fracture networks are produced in hydraulic fracturing of self-sourced reservoir strata. Mechanical stratigraphic boundaries and other heterogeneities are likely to enhance fracture network complexity through the processes of segmentation, diversion, and bifurcation. These processes create multiple fracture strands, resulting in an increased number of hydraulic fractures over those initiated, thereby increasing total fracture surface area. Our study provides insight into hydraulic fracture network propagation, and has applications for evaluation, completion, production, and fracture modeling of unconventional reservoirs.</jats:p>"

The problem is solved using HPM (homotopy perturbation method). The numerical calculations of flow parameters (like flow resistance, wall shear stress) are performed and are discussed graphically.

Moreover, the velocity profiles are increasing in the radial direction with the enhancement of viscosity of the fluid in the peripheral layer but decrease with permeability.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Menderes Massif in Turkey represents one of the largest metamorphic core complexes in the world. It is regarded as a section of lower continental crust exhumed along low-angle detachment faults in the Late Miocene during a period of extension that affected the entire Aegean province. Syn-extensional magmatic activity within the Menderes metamorphic core complex is predominantly felsic forming several plutons, whereas mantle-derived magmatism has not been known so far. Here, we present a detailed study of the petrology and geochemistry of previously unreported mafic to intermediate lamprophyres within the Menderes Massif and assess their role in the geodynamic evolution of the core complex. The Menderes lamprophyres are mostly kersantites, with 49–60 wt % SiO2, 3.2–8.4 wt % MgO, 100–360 ppm Cr, 32–132 ppm Ni and Mg# of 37–50. Positive Pb and negative Ti–Nb–Ta anomalies suggest a clear orogenic affinity. Isotopes of Sr and Pb are relatively radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70609–0.71076; 206Pb/204Pb = 18.88–19.03, 207Pb/204Pb &amp;gt; 15.71), while Nd is unradiogenic (εNd =  −1.4 to −3.2). Most phenocrysts are sharply zoned with a primitive core (Mg# 77–85, up to 0.95 wt % Cr2O3 in clinopyroxene; Mg# 72–76 in amphibole) and a more evolved rim (Mg# 68–74, &amp;lt;0.25 wt % Cr2O3 in clinopyroxene; Mg# 69–71 in amphibole). Trace element ratios between different cores may vary significantly (e.g. Dy/Yb 2–5 in amphiboles), whereas rims show less variation but are more enriched than the cores. U–Pb dating of zircons provides an age of 15 Ma for the lamprophyres, coeval with the syn-extensional granite magmatism. The Hf isotopic composition of magmatic zircons is variably unradiogenic (176Hf/177Hf15Ma = 0.28248–0.28253, εHf15Ma = −8.6 to −10.5), while zircon xenocrysts with dominantly Cadomian and older ages show highly variable Hf isotopic signatures at the time of lamprophyre emplacement (εHf15Ma = −7.6 to −46.7). The orogenic geochemical signature of the lamprophyres’ parental melts is similar to nearby orogenic lavas from the West Anatolian Volcanic Province. Variation in bulk-rock εNd and in Dy/Yb ratios of phenocryst cores reflect moderate mantle heterogeneity. The chemical heterogeneity of phenocrysts and zircon εHf values implies intense hybridisation of proto-lamprophyre melts with felsic crustal melts, most probably derived from the melting of augen gneisses of the Menderes basement. We propose that fluid released from the lamprophyre primary melt had a decisive impact on crustal melting and the formation of granitic plutons within the Menderes core complex.</jats:p>",

This study aims to investigate the shear span-to-depth ratio impact on the performance of sandwich core steel girders with corrugated web. Three span-to-depth ratios (a/d): 1.0, 1.833 and 2.5, were examined. The test includes three girders with sandwich web thickness of 30 mm, three girders with 60 mm sandwich web thickness, and three girders with conventional flat webs. A total of nine simply supported steel girders subjected to a concentrated load were fabricated and tested up to failure. The responses of the examined girders are presented in term of the load deflection curves, the ultimate load, and the maximum displacement. Among the conclusions drawn in this study that girders with sandwich core thickness of 30 mm demonstrate higher ultimate load capacity than girders with sandwich core of 60 mm, the maximum difference in the ultimate load capacity was about 20% and can be seen at a/d equals to 1.0.

Although the beneficial effects of compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs have been recognized for decades, only limited research has been focusing on this effect in prestressed concrete members, like hollow core slabs. Therefore, a novel real‐scale test set‐up has been developed in order to assess this phenomenon in real‐scale hollow core slabs. The results indicate that, despite the presence of the large hollow cores, compressive membrane action can significantly improve the load‐carrying capacity of hollow core slabs under excessive loading. In parallel, a numerical finite element model has been established in order to model the structural behavior (i.e., compressive membrane action) as per the investigated test program. The model was able to correlate the results from the experiments very well, and emphasized the large influence of the concrete tensile strength on the ultimate failure load of concrete hollow core slabs in compressive membrane action.</jats:p>",

The multivariate analyses were conducted including principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis. In addition, the current and future geographical distribution of pomegranate in Iran was predicted to identify suitable locations using the MaxEnt model. The results showed high diversity in the studied morphological and metabolic traits. The PCA results indicated that FFS, NFT, JA, and AA are the most important traits in discriminating the studied genotypes. A constructed core collection using maximization strategy consisted of 20 genotypes and accounted for 13.16% of the entire collection. Shannon-Weaver diversity index of a core collection was similar or greater than the entire collection. Evaluation of the core collection using four parameters of MD, VD, CR, and VR also indicated the maintenance of the genetic diversity of the original set. According to the MaxEnt model, altitude, average temperature of coldest quarter, and isothertmality were the key factors for the distribution of pomegranate. The most suitable areas for pomegranate cultivation were also determined which were located in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. The geographic distribution of pomegranate in the future showed that the main provinces of pomegranate cultivation would be less affected by climatic conditions by the middle of the century.

We identify three core attributes of adaptive capacity: (1) diversity, (2) connectivity, and (3) flexibility. For each attribute, we describe key strategies, including enhancing mechanisms of ecological memory, facilitating the generation of beneficial novelty, and developing governance structures that are flexible and anticipatory. These core attributes can also lead to maladaptive outcomes; careful consideration of a social‐ecological system's resilience and vulnerabilities to environmental change will likely be critical to avoid unwanted outcomes.

In addition, the senior author’s extensive experience with the care of professional, collegiate, and elite athletes was analyzed and compared with established treatment algorithms. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> The differential diagnosis of groin pain in the athlete should include core muscle injury with or without adductor longus tendinopathy. Current scientific evidence is lacking in this field; however, consensus regarding terms and treatment algorithms was facilitated with the publication of the Doha agreement in 2015. Pain localized proximal to the inguinal ligament, especially in conjunction with tenderness at the rectus abdominis insertion, is highly suggestive of core muscle injury. Concomitant adductor longus tendinopathy is not uncommon in these athletes and should be investigated. The diagnosis of core muscle injury is a clinical one, although dynamic ultrasonography is becoming increasingly used as a diagnostic modality. Magnetic resonance imaging is not always diagnostic and may underestimate the true extent of a core muscle injury. Functional rehabilitation programs can often return athletes to the same level of play. If an athlete has been diagnosed with athletic pubalgia and has persistent symptoms despite 12 weeks of nonoperative treatment, a surgical repair using mesh and a relaxing myotomy of the conjoined tendon should be considered. The most common intraoperative finding is a deficient posterior wall of the inguinal canal with injury to the distal rectus abdominis. Return to play after surgery for an isolated sports hernia is typically allowed at 4 weeks; however, if an adductor release is performed as well, return to play occurs at 12 weeks. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title><jats:p> Core muscle injury is a diagnosis that requires a high level of clinical suspicion and should be considered in any athlete with pain in the inguinal region. Concurrent adductor pathology is not uncommon. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this study, a process has been established for successfully coating the surface of Nd2Fe14B powders with a FeCo layer using the galvanic displacement method. Initially, a binary phase magnetic powder was synthesized containing Nd2Fe14B and Nd2Fe17 phase. Subsequently, the powders were coated using a Co precursor at 303 K. During coating, the metastable Nd2Fe17 phase was dissolved, and the Fe ions were released into the solution. Subsequently, the Fe ions deposited together with the Co ions on the surface of Nd2Fe14B powder to form a FeCo shell.

ISAC has lately been proposed for a variety of new applications such as automotive networks, environmental monitoring, remote sensing, IoT, smart cities, and indoor services such as human activity and gesture detection, all of which benefit from these two benefits.

It is elevated in different prostatic pathologies apart from carcinoma.\nA cohort of 932 prostatic core needle biopsies was selected after necessary exclusions. The routine haematoxylin &amp; eosin and immunohistochemistry slides were retrieved along with the histopathologic diagnosis rendered. The diagnosis was then correlated with PSA.\nThe mean age for diagnosis of prostatic disease and carcinoma was 68.39 years and 70.21 years respectively. 50.50% cases were premalignant or malignant whereas the remaining 49.50% cases were benign. A cut-off of 4 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 99.78% and a specificity of 7.33%. Gleason score 8 and 9 were most common, accounting for 56.39% of the malignant cases.\nThe present study showed a statistical correlation of age and PSA with prostatic carcinoma. PSA is a valid and sensitive marker and may be continued as an early marker for the screening of prostate cancer. The risk of cancer is minimal with a PSA less than 4 ng/ml whereas an elevated PSA is associated with pathology and hence even a borderline elevation should not be ignored. Due to a low specificity, PSA needs to be corroborated with DRE and transrectal ultrasonography followed by biopsy in cases with PSA &gt; 4ng/ml.\n\nKey words: Prostate, Prostate - Specific Antigen, Prostatic Adenocarcinoma, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve a better understanding of the effect of the extension of the lipid core into the artery wall on the change of flow field and its effect on plaque vulnerability, we have studied the hemodynamic parameters by utilizing a finite element method and taking into account the fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Four groups of stenosis models with different sizes of lipid core were used in the study. The fully developed pulsatile velocity profile of the right coronary artery was used as the inlet boundary condition, and the pressure pulse was applied as the outlet boundary condition. The non-Newtonian Carreau model was used to simulate the non-Newtonian behavior of blood. Results indicate that the extension of the lipid core into the artery wall influences the flow field; subsequently, creates favorable conditions for additional development of the lipid core which can lead to a higher risk of plaque rupture.</jats:p>",

Several parameters including the variance of phenotypic value (VPV), Shannon–Weaver diversity index (H), coefficient of variation (CV), variance of phenotypic frequency (VPF), ratio of phenotype retained (RPR), the mean difference percentage (MD%) and the variance difference percentage of traits (VD%), the range coincidence rate (CR%) and the variable rate of quantitative traits (VR%) were used to evaluate the level of representation of the primary core collections developed by the different sampling schemes. Based on the optimal sampling strategies of prior selecting accessions, a primary core collection was constructed that maintained &gt; 99.5% of the VPV and a CR% of 100%. This study indicates that the optimal sampling scheme consisted of prior and deviation sampling methods (PD) combined with a logarithmic proportional sampling strategy (LG) of 37.4% of the actual sampling ratio. Sampling before clustering can improve several parameters including the H, CV, RPR, VPF, and CR%. Sampling strategies including the genetic diversity index (G), logarithmic proportional (LG) and the square root proportional strategy (SG) can improve the H, whilst the constant strategy (C) can improve the RPR and VPF when the sampling scale was &gt;30%.

We argue that this can be used to estimate the central densities of these stars, and potentially to measure the amount of core overshooting during the main sequence part of the evolution. We also investigate a puzzling subsample of red giants that are located below the RGB sequence, in contradiction with stellar evolution models. After checking the measurements of the asymptotic period spacing for these stars, we show that they are mainly intermediate-mass red giants. This is doubly peculiar because these stars should have nondegenerate cores and they are expected to be located well above the RGB sequence. We show that these peculiarities are well accounted for if these stars result from the interaction between two low-mass (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> ≲ 2 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>) close companions during the red giant branch phase.

Chemoradiotherapy is the primary treatment modality. Outcomes used in anal cancer trials vary which hinders evidence synthesis. Using a systematic review, patient interviews and a 2-stage Delphi consensus survey, the first CORMAC project brought together patients and healthcare professionals from across the world to agree shared priorities and make sure that studies of chemoradiotherapy treatments for anal cancer report outcomes that are meaningful to patients and health care professionals. CORMAC-1 established an internationally ratified core outcome set (COS) of 19 outcomes across 4 domains. These 19 outcomes are an agreed minimum that all clinical trials in chemoradiotherapy anal cancer trials should report. CORMAC-2 is the next phase which seeks to reach international agreement on the definitions for the 11 core outcomes in the domains of disease activity and survival. Agreeing definitions for these core outcomes will facilitate utilisation of the core outcome set, increasing outcome standardisation across trials thereby increasing the quality of data available for clinical decision-making and ultimately enhancing patient care.<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>The original CORMAC systematic review will be updated, focusing on 2 of the 4 COS domains, disease activity and survival domains. An international steering committee composed of international anal cancer trial experts will be formed. The committee will review the updated search results to develop a 2-stage Delphi consensus survey. The survey will be publicised through conferences, email lists, domestic and international bodies and will target healthcare and allied healthcare professional involved in the design, running, recruitment and publication of anal cancer trials. Following the 2-stage survey, a stakeholder meeting composed of the steering committee and selection of survey participants will ratify the results and agree a final set of core outcome definitions.<jats:bold>Ethics and dissemination</jats:bold>CORMAC-2 results will be disseminated through journal and conference publications to inform clinical teams and patient support groups to raise awareness and implementation of the core outcome set. Results will feed into the DECREASE study and it is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (1,2). As per the University of Manchester ethic decision tool, no ethical approval is required. Further information is available at https://cormacstudy.wordpress.com.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To meet the numerous application demands of lead-bismuth reactors, different design optimization tasks need to be conducted on these reactors based on the existing reactor core solutions. However, the design optimization of lead-bismuth reactors is a challenging task because it is a complex, multi-dimensional, and nonlinear constrained problem. To resolve these issues and improve the efficiency of design optimization, a new method, called the KSM-OLHS-SEUMRE method, based on the Kriging surrogate model (KSM), orthogonal Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), and space exploration and unimodal region elimination (SEUMRE) algorithm is proposed in this study. Based on this method, a design optimization program of lead-bismuth reactors (DOPPLER-K) is developed, which realizes functions like sample point generation, optimization analysis, pre-post processing of reactor calculation, coupling of the Reactor Monte Carlo (RMC) calculation code and the Steady-state Thermal-hydraulic Analysis Code (STAC). Further, taking lead-bismuth reactors SPALLER-4 and URANUS as prototypes, the proposed intelligent optimization method for preliminary design of lead-bismuth reactor core is verified. The results show that this method can rapidly and accurately find the target scheme satisfying the optimization conditions, and it is three orders of magnitude faster than pure Monte Carlo calculation. Compared with the initial core scheme of URANUS, the optimization rates of fuel loading, total core mass, active zone volume, and total core volume are reduced by 10.8, 11.5, 18.1, and 17.1%, respectively. These results validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method for design optimization of lead-bismuth reactor core.</jats:p>"

Herein, gecko‐, petal‐, and lotus‐like SHPO surfaces, composed of ZnO tetrapods and polydimethylsiloxane, are realized by adjusting the roughness factor and length scale of roughness, while keeping the surface chemistry the same. Afterward, water droplet sliding and impacting are investigated. The surfaces behave similarly in spreading but deviate from each other in sliding, receding, jetting, and rebounding due to their different adhesive properties. Moreover, the disparity between surfaces with petal and lotus effects is well explained by Furmidge's and Young–Dupre equations. On the other hand, these formulas fail to elucidate the surface with gecko effect because of its inside sealed air that produces negative pressure upon droplet motion. This paper provides a facile topography evolution path and a manifest correlation between topography and performance in water droplet dynamics for SHPO surfaces with gecko, petal, and lotus effects.</jats:p>",

A challenging property to gain control over is the interaction of the FONs’ surface with biological systems. Indeed, most types of nanoparticles tend to interact with biological membranes. To address this limitation, we recently reported on two-photon (2P) absorbing, red to near infrared (NIR) emitting quadrupolar extended dyes built from a benzothiadiazole core and diphenylamino endgroups that yield spontaneously stealth FONs. In this paper, we expand our understanding of the structure-property relationship between the dye structure and the FONs 2P absorption response, fluorescence and stealthiness by characterizing a dye-related series of FONs. We observe that increasing the strength of the donor end-groups or of the core acceptor in the quadrupolar (D-π-A-π-D) dye structure allows for the tuning of optical properties, notably red-shifting both the emission (from red to NIR) and 2P absorption spectra while inducing a decrease in their fluorescence quantum yield. Thanks to their strong 1P and 2P absorption, all FONs whose median size varies between 11 and 28 nm exhibit giant 1P (106 M−1.cm−1) and 2P (104 GM) brightness values. Interestingly, all FONs were found to be non-toxic, exhibit stealth behaviour, and show vanishing non-specific interactions with cell membranes. We postulate that the strong hydrophobic character and the rigidity of the FONs building blocks are crucial to controlling the stealth nano-bio interface.</jats:p>"

We propose a photonic on-line implementation of reinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-based reservoir computing, both experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate reinforcement learning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no required learning process for the internal connection weights in reservoir computing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks, to evaluate the proposed scheme.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Power transformers play an important role in the safe and reliable operation of the whole power grid. Once a fault occurs, it will endanger the normal operation of the transformer, and even result in power grid accidents. Accurate and practical methods of transformer fault monitoring and type identification have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrical engineering. However, it is difficult to obtain a large number of measurement data for different fault types on a large power transformer. The vibroacoustic characteristics of transformer faults have significant asymmetry. For the power transformer in service, it is complex and uneconomic to obtain the vibroacoustic signals under different fault conditions. To handle this problem, this paper proposes simulation methods of several common transformer core faults, based on multi-physical field coupling, and then analyzes the vibroacoustic signals generated by the operating transformer. Finally, it verifies the results of acoustic and vibration signals under several faults, through physical experiments. The results show that the transformer fault simulation method is reasonable and accurate. Furthermore, a change in the transformer core state will cause a change in the transformer vibroacoustic characteristics, and different types of core faults can be distinguished by the analysis of vibroacoustic characteristics.</jats:p>"

For concurrently executing applications on such a platform, this paper aims to study how to appropriately apply the three system configurations (mapping, DVFS, and DPM) to reduce both dynamic and static energy. To this end, this paper first formulates the dependence of the three system configurations on heterogeneous cluster-based systems as a 0–1 integrated linear programming (ILP) model, taking into account run-time configuration overheads (e.g., costs of DPM mode switching and task migration). Then, with the 0–1 ILP model, different run-time strategies (e.g., considering the three configurations in fully separate, partially separate, and holistic manners) are compared based on a hierarchical management structure and design-time prepared data. Experimental case studies offer insights into the effectiveness of different management strategies on different platform sizes (e.g., #cluster × #core, 2 × 4, 2 × 8, 4 × 4, 4 × 8), in terms of application migration, energy efficiency, resource efficiency, and complexity.</jats:p>"

Here, we report that the SiC quantum dots (QDs) with dimensions lying in the strong quantum confinement regime can be naturally oxidized at a much lower temperature of 220 °C to form core/shell and heteroepitaxial SiC/SiO2 QDs with well crystallized silica nanoshells. The surface silica layer enhances the radiative transition rate of the core SiC QD by offering an ideal carrier potential barrier and diminishes the nonradiative transition rate by reducing the surface dangling bonds, and, as a result, the quantum yield is highly improved. The SiC/SiO2 QDs are very stable in air, and they have better biocompatibility for cell-labeling than the bare SiC QDs. These results pave the way for constructing SiC-based nanoscale electronic and photonic devices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Light--matter coupling in plasmonic nanocavities has been widely studied in the past years. Yet, for core--shell particles, popular electromagnetic models that use the classical Lorentz oscillator to describe the shell predict extinction spectra with three maxima, if the plasmon and the shell absorption are in resonance. In contrast, experiments exhibit only two peaks as also expected from simple quantum models of hybrid states. In order to reconcile the convenient and widely used classical electromagnetic description with experimental data, we connect it to the quantum world by conceiving a heuristic quantum model. Our model is based on the permittivity of a two-level system in a classical electric field derived from the optical Bloch equations. The light--matter coupling is included via the collective vacuum Rabi frequency $\\Omega_0$. Using our model, we obtain excellent agreement with a series of experimental extinction spectra of particles with various coupling strengths due to a systematic size variation. The suppression of the third maximum, which mainly stems from the absorption in the shell, can be interpreted as a vacuum induced power broadening, which may occur in lossy (plasmonic) cavities below the strong-coupling regime.</jats:p>"

The number of SMA wires, their location, and their pre-strain percentage are the parameters studied in this investigation. The sandwich specimens were made by woven glass fibers/epoxy composite face-sheets strengthened by the SMA wires and Aluminum corrugated core and prepared using the wet hand lay-up method. Their behavior is evaluated under high-velocity impact test by a gas gun impactor testing machine. According to the results obtained, a significant change in the amount of energy absorption of the specimens containing SMA wires is observed. By increasing the number of the SMA wires, the energy absorption by the specimen is increased, but by pre-straining the SMA wires, the effect in energy absorption is significant. Also, when the projectile hits the SMA wire in CCCS, better properties in energy absorption can be observed. The results show that the energy absorption increased from 117.247 J for the specimen without the SMA wire to 128.749 J for the six SMA wires specimen. On the other hand, by applying the pre-strain to the SMA wires, the residual stresses in the specimens and hence the energy absorption in the specimen with six SMA wires with 3% pre-strain increased to 142.57 J. </jats:p>",

Here, the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of Si@MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> core–shells and extensive structural characterization are presented. Compared with traditional plasmonic cores, the silicon dielectric Mie resonator core offers low Ohmic losses and a wider spectrum of optical modes.

Using transmission electron microscopy and correlative single‐particle scattering spectroscopy, MD mode splitting is experimentally demonstrated in this unique Si@MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> core–shell structure. This is evidence for resonance coupling, which is limited to theoretical proposals in this particular system. A coupling constant of 39 meV is achieved, which is ≈1.5‐fold higher than previous reports of particle‐on‐film geometries with a smaller interfacial area.

In this case, the thickness of the entire structure is taken into account analytically using unit column functions. Purpose of the study: We aimed to build a mathematical model of deformation and develop a method for the analysis of the stability of thin-walled elastic isotropic three-layer plates and wall panels with a discrete core. Methods: Based on the mathematical apparatus of generalized functions using the Bubnov–Galerkin method, an eigenvalue problem is solved to determine the critical parameters of a compressed three-layer wall panel with a discrete core. Results: According to the suggested method, we perform a stability analysis of three-layer wall panels with different values of core stiffness and study the impact of the discrete core parameters on the buckling load, consumption of materials, and efficiency of three-layer engineering structures.</jats:p>",

These good mechanical features are suitable for aviation, automotive, and protective construction applications. These structures, whose most significant disadvantages are production difficulties, have become easier to produce with the development of 3D production technology and have been the subject of many studies in recent years. In this presented study, two conventional core geometries and three different auxetic geometries, commonly used in sandwich structures, were designed and produced with 3D printer technology. The strength and energy absorption capabilities of prototype sandwich structures investigated experimentally under bending loads with static and dynamic compression. Except for the re-entrant (RE) type core, the auxetic core foam sandwich structures demonstrate higher rigidity and load-carrying capacity than classical sinusoidal corrugated (SC) core and honeycomb (HC) core sandwich structures under both quasi-static and impact-loaded compression and three-point bending experiments. Double arrowhead (DAH) and tetrachiral (TC) auxetic cores outperformed honeycomb core in terms of specific quasi-static and impact load-bearing performance under compression by 1.5 ± 0.25 times. In three-point bending experiments under both quasi-static and impact loading conditions, the load-carrying capacity of the double arrowhead and tetrachiral auxetic cores was found to be more than 1,86 ± 0.38 times that of the honeycomb core sandwich panels. </jats:p>",

As conventional GB model generation uses the CSL of superimposed grains as the starting point, our totally different approach allows systematic treatment of diverse grain boundary systems that was previously not possible. Candidates of a pair of GB planes for a selected rotation axis, constituting a symmetrical or asymmetrical tilt GB, are thoroughly obtained by computational search that is applicable to any crystal structure. A GB interface for feasible computational analysis would have two-dimensional (2D) periodicity shared by the 2D lattices of the two GB planes, hence surface-slab supercells (slab-and-vacuum models) with common in-plane basis vectors of the shared 2D lattice are obtained. Finally, a procedure to obtain a GB-model supercell with alternately stacking such slabs is given. Symmetry operations of each slab may be considered such that the iterated interfaces are symmetrically equivalent, which is beneficial in <jats:italic>ab initio</jats:italic> calculations. The proposed algorithms allow streamlined generation of GB models, both symmetric and asymmetric, with or without an exact 3D-CSL relation.</jats:p>",

However, a Si anode is subjected to the huge volume expansion–contraction in the charging–discharging process, which can touch off pulverization of the bulk particles and worsens the cycle life. Herein, to reduce the volume change and improve the electrochemical performance, a novel Si@SiO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>/C anode with a core–shell structure is designed by spray and pyrolysis methods. The SiO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>/C shell not only ensures the structure stability and proves the high electrical conductivity but also prevents the penetration of electrolytes, so as to avoid the repetitive decomposition of electrolytes on the surface of Si particle. As expected, Si@SiO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>/C anode maintains the excellent discharge capacity of 1,333 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Even if the current density reaches up to 2,000 mA g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, the capacity can still be maintained at 1,173 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

Rock petrophysics measurements involve some degree of uncertainty because conventional well logging and nuclear magnetic resonance data are indirect measurements.  Data from core samples are more accurate, depending on the laboratory conditions, but this information belongs to a specific depth and does not represent an entire formation, especially when carbonate formations are present. Carbonate formations are characterized by their variation in porosity systems. Such porosity can be defined as intercrystalline, intergrain, moldic, vuggy and fracture and this parameter is linked with permeability values in different ways. In this work we compare the results obtained from the applications of neural network and fuzzy logic using conventional well logging, nuclear magnetic resonance data and information from core samples for permeability prediction. After using these two techniques, which can be considered efficient tools for uncertainty evaluation, a statistical coefficient called R2 shows better results when using logical fuzzy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magneto-rheological (MR) fluids viscosity can be varied by changing the magnetic field intensity. Therefore, they can improve structural rigidity and damping property. The current study presents a free vibration analysis of a multilayer rectangular plate with two layers of MR fluid  and a flexible core layer, rested on a Winkler-Pasternak foundation based on exponential shear deformation theory (ESDT). In this theory, the exponential functions are applied in terms of thickness coordinates to include the effect of transverse and inertial rotational shear deformation. The flexible core displacement is modeled via the second-order Frostig model. The Hamilton’s principle is used to derive the equations of motion. These equations are solved using the Navier method to obtain the natural frequencies of the plate. The accuracy of the derived equations is validated, and the obtained results are compared with a specific case. Finally, the results show that by applying and increasing the magnetic field intensity, the natural frequencies and loss factor increase. With the increase in the mode number for each specific magnetic field intensity, the natural frequency increases and the loss factor decreases. The natural frequencies and loss factor decrease with the increase of the MR layer thickness to overall thickness ratio and the flexible core layer thickness to overall thickness ratio. The natural frequencies increase when the parameters of the foundation increase.</jats:p>"

Both core complexes consist of mylonites exposed in the footwall of corrugated, low-angle detachment faults. The Late Cretaceous Orocopia Schist and early Miocene intrusions dominate the mylonitic footwall of the northern Plomosa Mountains. The Orocopia Schist was emplaced during low-angle subduction of the Farallon plate and exhibits the hallmarks of the underplated Laramide subduction complexes, including blocks of metasomatized peridotite encased in quartzofeldspathic schist. In the Buckskin-Rawhide Mountains, carbonate-rich metasedimentary rocks that were buried to midcrustal depths by Mesozoic thrust faults preferentially absorbed Miocene footwall strain and localized the Buckskin detachment fault. A correlation between distinct granodiorite in the footwall of the Buckskin detachment fault in the eastern Bouse Hills and a hanging-wall conglomerate sourced from this granodiorite provides constraints on middle Miocene displacement across the detachment fault and indicates that displacement increased northeastward in the slip direction. The termination of slip on the Buckskin detachment fault also younged northeastward, largely ending by ca. 19 Ma in the western Bouse Hills and ca. 17 Ma in the westernmost Buckskin Mountains, but continuing to &amp;lt;16 Ma in the southern Buckskin Mountains and to ca. 12 Ma in the eastern Buckskin Mountains. Late stages of slip on the detachment fault record minor NW-SE shortening during amplification of corrugation folds. Postdetachment faulting across the region was dominated by dextral and oblique-dextral slip on NW-striking faults influenced by the Pacific–North America plate boundary. Locations visited on this three-day field trip highlight the structural evolution of these metamorphic core complexes.</jats:p>",

We investigated six core outcomes derived from NETS1HD study by comparing the groups dichotomized by four time points using age at diagnosis (44-week gestation, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years).

The definition of LDHD was found to be HD diagnosed at 1 year of age or later because 3/6 core outcomes were significantly worse than TDHD. Nine patients (18%) had LDHD—median age at diagnosis 42 months (12–89) and PT performed at 57 months (12–103), mostly Soave (73%); a covering stoma was performed in 7/9, significantly higher than TDHD in 10/40 (p = 0.001). LDHD was associated with increased unplanned surgery (78% vs. 30%, p = 0.019), fecal incontinence (100% vs. 62%, p = 0.01), and permanent stoma (33% vs. 5%, p = 0.037).

In patients who are proned for ventilation or surgery, such damage may occur in the superficial chest tissues that are compressed between the rib cage and the support surface. Prophylactic dressings have been previously proven as generally effective for pressure ulcer prevention. In this study, our goal was to develop a novel computational modelling framework to investigate the biomechanical efficacy of a dressing with a soft cellulose fluff core in protecting proned surgical patients from chest pressure ulcers occurring on the operating table, due to body fixation by the Relton‐Hall frame. We compared the levels of mechanical compressive stresses developing in the soft chest tissues, above the sternum and ribs, due to the trunk weight, whilst the body is supported by the Relton‐Hall frame pads, with versus without the prophylactically applied bilateral dressings. The protective efficacy index for the extremely high stresses, above the 95th‐percentile, were 40.5%, 25.6% and 24.2% for skin, adipose and muscle, respectively, indicating that the dressings dispersed elevated soft‐tissue stresses. The current results provide additional support for using soft cellulose fluff core dressings for pressure ulcer prophylaxis, including during surgery.</jats:p>",

In summer, when both the vertical atmospheric mixing and anthropogenic ammonia emissions dominated by agriculture sector are strengthened, a moderate an increase of ammonium already took place from 1774 and 1880. The summer ammonium increase accelerated a first time at the beginning of the 20&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century, and a second time after 1950, levels reaching a plateau between 1980 and 2010. This ice-core trend is compared to estimated past anthropogenic NH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emissions in Europe by using state-of-the-art atmospheric transport (FLEXPART model driven with 0.5&amp;amp;#176;x0.5&amp;amp;#176; ERA-5 reanalysis data) simulations of submicron aerosol. It is shown that the ammonium Elbrus ice core trend is in excellent agreement with estimates of past NH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emissions from south-eastern Europe (South european Russia, Turkey, southern Ukraine). The ammonium level of ice deposited prior to agricultural activities is found to represent ~11-15% of the 1980-2010 level.

The well-marked 3-fold increase seen in the Elbrus ice core between 1950 and 1980 followed by a stabilization of levels between 1980 and 2010 is consistent with estimated past emissions of NO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; from south-eastern Europe. In agreement with the partitioning at the global scale of natural and anthropogenic emissions of NO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, nitrate levels in Elbrus ice deposited prior to 1940 represent 26% of those deposited at the end of the 20&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Study supported by the Megagrant project (agreement &amp;amp;#8470; 075-15-2021-599, 8.06.2021)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Methods. A practical method for constructing magnetomodulation sensors of magnetic induction with a fixed magnetic displacement field, which corresponds to the maximum steepness of the nonlinear characteristic of an oscillatory circuit with an amorphous ferromagnetic core in the region of autoparametric resonance, is considered. Results. It has been shown that the stable conversion factor of a 35 mm long sensor based on an oscillatory circuit with autoparametric amplification at a modulation frequency of 256 kHz can reach 10 mV/nT, which allows, with the available element base, to record signals of a weak alternating magnetic field with an amplitude of 0.03 pT/Hz1/2 in the frequency range 10...1000 Hz. It is noted that the excitation of the sensor by a weak harmonic magnetic field of a high frequency and the constant presence of the amorphous ferromagnetic core near the state of technical saturation significantly reduces the level of intrinsic magnetic noise of the magnetomodulation sensor. Conclusion. Magnetomodulation sensors with autoparametric amplification of the magnetic induction signal can find application in geophysics, magnetobiology and biomedicine.</jats:p>",

Throughout recent years, there has been a decline in the number of Earth science students in the UK. In 2018 and 2019, we developed outreach activities and resources to introduce the scientifically engaged general public to palaeomagnetism and raise awareness of how geomagnetism affects society today, thus putting palaeomagnetism, and Earth sciences, in the spotlight. We tested our ideas at local events that were visited mostly by families with small children, with tens to hundreds of participants. Our project culminated in the Magnetic to the Core stand at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in 2019, which is visited by members of the general public, students and teachers, scientists, policymakers and the media. At this event, we communicated the fundamentals of palaeomagnetism through hands-on activities and presented our recent research advances in a fun and family- friendly way. To test the impact of our exhibit on knowledge of palaeomagnetism and Earth's magnetic field on visitors, we designed an interactive quiz and collected results from 382 participants over 8 d. The results show a significant increase in median quiz score of 22.2 % between those who had not yet visited the stand and those who had visited for more than 10 min. The results from school-aged respondents alone show a larger increase in the median score of 33.5 % between those who had not yet visited and those who had spent more than 10 min at the stand. These findings demonstrate that this outreach event was successful in impacting visitors' learning. We hope our Magnetic to the Core project can serve as an inspiration for other Earth science laboratories looking to engage a wide audience and measure the success and impact of their outreach activities.\n                    </jats:p>"

It is thus interesting to compare these models in the core where they will be coupled. The main difference between these models is the presence of the zeroth order term on the right-hand side of the total-f gyrokinetic equation. This term is responsible for driving a radial electric field that is also associated with Geodesic acoustic mode-like oscillations. To investigate the coupling between these models, the subsequent large-scale gyrokinetic 3D turbulence simulations have been performed starting from an already saturated gyrokinetic axisymmetric equilibria (collisions are not included). This work has also been extended to couple different axisymmetric and turbulent models available in XGC. It is shown that the radial electric field and its drive have to be taken care of consistently while coupling different models together.</jats:p>",

Understanding how developers become inactive or why they take breaks can help communities prevent abandonment and incentivize developers to come back. In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify developers’ inactive periods by analyzing the individual rhythm of contributions to the projects. Using this method, we quantitatively analyze the inactivity of core developers in 18 OSS organizations hosted on GitHub. We also survey core developers to receive their feedback about the identified breaks and transitions. Our results show that our method was effective for identifying developers’ breaks. About 94% of the surveyed core developers agreed with our state model of inactivity; 71% and 79% of them acknowledged their breaks and state transition, respectively. We also show that all core developers take breaks (at least once) and about a half of them (~45%) have completely disengaged from a project for at least one year. We also analyzed the probability of transitions to/from inactivity and found that developers who pause their activity have a ~35 to ~55% chance to return to an active state; yet, if the break lasts for a year or longer, then the probability of resuming activities drops to ~21–26%, with a ~54% chance of complete disengagement. These results may support the creation of policies and mechanisms to make OSS community managers aware of breaks and potential project abandonment.</jats:p>",

We used the procedure of spatial randomization test to evaluate the coincidence of striped hyaena road crossing with the predicted corridors. The results revealed that elevation, distance to conservation areas, categorical climate and grasslands density were the most influential variables for predicting the occurrence of the striped hyaena in the study area. In the estimated dispersal distance of 70 km, four core habitats were identified. The largest core habitat was located in the northeast of the study area with the highest connectivity contribution. Only about 12% and 1.5% of core habitats and corridors were protected by conservation areas, respectively. Predicted corridors, crossed by roads represented a high risk for striped hyaenas. Adaptive management plan throughout the landscape (conservation of core habitats and corridors, and reducing species mortality on the roads) must be considered by wildlife managers in Iran.</jats:p>"

Synthesis, structural and optical properties of core-shell nanostructures with a large number of two kinds of fluorophores bound to the shell are presented. As fluorophores, strongly fluorescent rhodamine 101 and rhodamine 110 chloride were selected. The dyes exhibit significant spectral overlap between acceptor absorption and donor emission spectra, which enables effective FRET. Core-shell nanoparticles strongly differing in the ratio of donors to acceptor numbers were prepared. This leads to two different interesting cases: typical single-step FRET or multistep energy migration preceding FRET. The single-step FRET model that was designed and presented by some of us recently for core-shell nanoparticles is herein experimentally verified. Very good agreement between the analytical expression for donor fluorescence intensity decay and experimental data was obtained, which confirmed the correctness of the model. Multistep energy migration between donors preceding the final transfer to the acceptor can also be successfully described. In this case, however, experimental data are compared with the results of Monte Carlo simulations, as there is no respective analytical expression. Excellent agreement in this more general case evidences the usefulness of this numerical method in the design and prediction of the properties of the synthesized core-shell nanoparticles labelled with multiple and chemically different fluorophores.</jats:p>"

The accessory Hfq interactome includes most mRNAs encoding Type III Secretion System (T3SS) components and secreted toxins in two strains, as well as a cluster of CRISPR guide RNAs in one strain. Conserved Hfq targets include the global virulence regulator Vfr and metabolic pathways involved in the transition from fast to slow growth. Furthermore, we use rGRIL-seq to show that RhlS, a quorum sensing sRNA, activates Vfr translation, thus revealing a link between quorum sensing and virulence regulation.

Estimations of their typical frequencies make them perfect targets for the current network of advanced, ground-based detectors. A successful detection could potentially reveal the underlying explosion mechanism through the analysis of the waveform. This has been illustrated using the Supernova Model Evidence Extractor (SMEE), an algorithm based on principal component analysis and Bayesian model selection. Here, we present a complementary approach to SMEE based on (supervised) dictionary-learning and show that it is able to reconstruct and classify CCSN signals according to their morphology. Our waveform signals are obtained from (a) two publicly available catalogues built from numerical simulations of neutrino-driven (Mur) and magneto-rotational (Dim) CCSN explosions and (b) from a third ‘mock’ catalogue of simulated sine-Gaussian (SG) waveforms. All of these signals are injected into coloured Gaussian noise to simulate the background noise of Advanced LIGO in its broad-band configuration and scaled to a freely specifiable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that our approach correctly classifies signals from all three dictionaries. In particular, for SNR = 15–20, we obtain perfect matches for both Dim and SG signals and about 85 per cent true classifications for Mur signals. These results are comparable to those reported by SMEE for the same CCSN signals when those are injected in only one LIGO detector. We discuss the main limitations of our approach as well as possible improvements.</jats:p>",

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported a higher risk of ADHD in children with atopic diseases; however, the relationship between ADHD symptoms and atopic diseases remains unclear. We systematically reviewed observational cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to investigate the relationship between atopic diseases and ADHD symptom severity (hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention). The majority of studies showed a statistically significant association between atopic diseases and both ADHD symptoms, with substantial heterogeneity in the outcome of hyperactivity/impulsivity. Remarkably decreased heterogeneity and statistical significance were observed in the second meta-analysis of ADHD-related behavior symptoms in atopic patients without ADHD. Our study indicated that atopic diseases not only associated with ADHD but also ADHD symptoms severity. This association was even observed in children with subthreshold ADHD, indicating that atopic diseases may play a role in the spectrum of ADHD symptom severity. <jats:bold>Trial registration</jats:bold>: This study was registered on PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42020213219).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the growing popularity of hybrid yarn techniques, the micro-braided yarn is becoming a good choice as one kind of intermediate materials for thermoplastic biocomposites, by presenting favorable morphology during the preform process and lowering the resin flow distance during the thermo-compression process. In this article, different flax/polypropylene (PP) based multi-core micro-braided hybrid yarns with the similar total number of flax core fibers were manufactured, by varying the parameters: multi-core configuration and braiding angle; both dry-and thermo- states tensile tests on yarns were carried out, since it is necessary to simulate the deforming behavior of a single hybrid yarn during the thermoforming process. The objective is to determine the cover factor especially for multi-core micro-braided yarn as a comprehensive textile indicator; and to study the influence of the cover factor parameters on mechanical tensile properties at the yarn scale. It has been observed that the cover factor parameters contributed the braider effect (friction and compression) on flax cores in the dry-state and lubricant effect (distribution and viscosity) in the thermo-state; further influenced the characterizations. Increasing multi-core configuration and braiding angle can both increase the tensile strength; larger cover factor results in greater tensile stiffness both in dry-and thermo-states. </jats:p>",

Using both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final (NCEP-FNL) operational global analysis dataset and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation, a sophisticated SWV with dual-core structure (DCSWV) over the Sichuan Basin in 2010 was studied. The DCSWV system consisted of two cores, one near Leshan City (named “C1”) and another near Langzhong City (named “C2”). The high-resolution WRF model reproduced the life cycle of the DCSWV well. The diagnostic analysis of the vorticity budget indicated that the stretching and tilting terms played important roles in the development stage of “C1”, while the stretching and vertical advection of vorticity were the major contributors to the formation and development stage of “C2”, which implied the importance of moisture convergence and ascending motion. Sensitivity experiments showed that the DCSWV was closely associated with the release in latent heat as well as the effect of topography. The great release in latent heat provided significantly positive feedback to the DCSWV system, which was decisive to the formation and development stages of “C2”. The topography of the Tibetan Plateau and the Yun-Gui Plateau affected the location and duration of the DCSWV.</jats:p>"

The ensuing SN explosion launches ejecta that may subsequently collide with this CSM, producing shocks that can power emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work we explore the thermal signatures of dense CSM interaction when the CSM density profile is truncated at some outer radius. CSM with optical depth &gt;<jats:italic>c/v</jats:italic> (where <jats:italic>v</jats:italic> is the shock velocity) will produce primarily ∼blackbody optical/UV emission, whereas lower optical depth CSM will power bremsstrahlung X-ray emission. Focusing on the latter, we derive light curves and spectra of the resulting X-ray transients that include a detailed treatment of Comptonization. Due to strong photoelectric absorption, the X-ray light curve is dominated by the postinteraction phase that occurs after the shock reaches the CSM truncation radius. We treat this regime here for the first time. Using these results, we present the phase space of optical, UV, and X-ray transients as a function of CSM properties, and discuss detectability prospects. We find that ROSAT would not have been sensitive to CSM X-ray transients but that eROSITA is expected to detect many such events. Future wide-field UV missions such as the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite will dramatically enhance sensitivity to large optical depth CSM configurations. Finally, we present a framework within which CSM properties may be directly inferred from observable features of X-ray transients. This can serve as an important tool for studying stellar mass loss using SN X-ray detections.</jats:p>",

We constrain the physical properties of the CME’s core material as a function of height along the corona by using the spectra taken by the single-slit coronagraph spectrometer at heliocentric distances of 2.6 and 3.1 solar radii. We use plasma diagnostics from intensity ratios, such as the O <jats:sc>vi</jats:sc> doublet lines, to determine the velocity, density, temperature, and nonequilibrium ionization states. We find that the CME core’s velocity is approximately 250 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and its cumulative heating energy is comparable to its kinetic energy for all of the plasma heating parameterizations that we investigated. Therefore, the CME’s unknown heating mechanisms have the energy to significantly affect the CME’s eruption and evolution. To understand which parameters might influence the unknown heating mechanism, we constrain our model heating rates with the observed data and compare them to the rate of heating generated within a similar CME that was constructed by the MAS code’s 3D MHD simulation. The rate of heating from the simulated CME agrees with our observationally constrained heating rates when we assume a quadratic power law to describe a self-similar CME expansion. Furthermore, the heating rates agree when we apply a heating parameterization that accounts for the CME flux rope’s magnetic energy being converted directly into thermal energy. This UVCS analysis serves as a case study for the importance of multislit coronagraph spectrometers for CME studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Shot peening has become a well-established technique for the introduction of beneficial compressive Residual Stresses (RS) into the near-surface layers of metallic materials for the purpose of preventing or suppressing fatigue crack nucleation and growth. Ti-alloys are widely used to fabricate compressor blades of aeroengines. Titanium blades that may be susceptible to different modes of damage under cyclic loading (high cycle fatigue, fretting fatigue) are often subjected to shot peening to extend their safe operating time. The control and monitoring of residual stresses in titanium blades is of great importance to assure the safety of aeroengines. The techniques for residual stress evaluation include mechanical methods (material removal) as well as physical methods such as X-ray diffraction. Perhaps the most common and practically accessible form of the latter is the method. Conventional laboratory X-ray diffractometers typically probe samples to the depths up to ~20 &amp;micro;m that correspond to 1x...5x the average grain size for typical metals and alloys. The limitations of the method have been identified and reviewed in the literature, motivating the use of other semi-destructive approaches to evaluate the residual stresses in deeper layers and at more sharply defined locations. In the present report we present a case study of the comparison between non-destructive and semi-destructive evaluation techniques, namely the X-ray diffraction method against the mechanical and FIB-DIC ring-core drilling applied to the samples of VT6 (Russian designation of Ti-6Al-4V) titanium alloy after shot peening with 1 mm steel balls. Mechanical drilling of circular holes of ~2 mm diameter with laser speckle interferometry monitoring of strains gives a rough spatial resolution of a few millimeters, while the Korsunsky FIB-DIC method of Ga-ion beam micro-ring core milling within FIB-SEM with Digital Image Correlation (DIC) deformation analysis delivers spatial resolution down to a few micrometers. Good agreement has been found between the X-ray and FIB-DIC estimates of RS variation profiles as a function of depth in shot peened titanium alloy samples. Some advances in the FIB-DIC method are presented and discussed in terms of the acceleration of data acquisition and interpretation.</jats:p>"

The four-dimensional local ensemble transform Kalman\nfilter (4D-LETKF) data assimilation system for the whole neutral atmosphere\nis updated to better represent disturbances with wave periods shorter than 1 d in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region. First,\nincremental analysis update (IAU) filtering is introduced to reduce the\ngeneration of spurious waves arising from the insertion of the analysis\nupdates. The IAU is better than other filtering methods, and also is\ncommonly used for middle atmospheric data assimilation. Second, the order of\nhorizontal diffusion in the forecast model is changed to reproduce the more\nrealistic tidal amplitudes that were observed by satellites. Third, the\nSounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) and\nSpecial Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) observations in the\nstratosphere and mesosphere also are assimilated. The performance of the\nresultant analyses is evaluated by comparing them with the mesospheric winds\nfrom meteor radars, which are not assimilated.

Herein, we present the controlled plasmon-mediated oxidation of para-aminothiophenol (p-ATP) by employing Au@Ag core–shell nanostars with tunable tip plasmons in visible–near-infrared range as reactors. In-situ Raman measurements indicate that Au@Ag core–shell nanostars essentially promote the conversion of p-ATP to 4,4′-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) due to hot carriers excited by localized surface plasmon resonance. Au@Ag nanostars with plasmon modes under resonant light excitation suggested higher catalytic efficiency, as evidenced by the larger intensity ratios between 1440 cm−1 (N=N stretching of DMAB) and 1080 cm−1 shifts (C–S stretching of p-ATP). Importantly, the time-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra showed that the conversion efficiency of p-ATP was mainly dictated by the resonance condition between the tip plasmon mode of Au@Ag core–shell nanostars and the excitation light, as well as the choice of excitation wavelength. These results show that plasmon bands of metal nanostructures play an important role in the efficiency of plasmon-driven photocatalysis.</jats:p>"

Both the RA27/3 vaccine and wild-type RuV strains were highly sensitive to a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), in vitro. However, NTZ treatment, used as a salvage therapy, resulted in little or no improvements of RuV-associated cutaneous granulomas in patients. Here, we report investigations of possible causes of treatment failures in two ataxia-telangiectasia patients. Although a reduction in RuV RNA in skin lesions was detected by real-time RT-PCR, live immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived rubella viruses (iVDRV) were recovered from granulomas, before and after the treatments. Tizoxanide, an active NTZ metabolite, inhibited replications of all iVDRVs in cultured A549 cells, but the 50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations were 10–40 times higher than those for the RA27/3 strain. There were no substantial differences in iVDRV sensitivities, neither before nor after treatments. Analysis of quasispecies in the E1 gene, a suspected NTZ target, showed no effect of NTZ treatments on quasispecies’ complexity in lesions. Thus, failures of NTZ therapies were likely due to low sensitivities of iVDRVs to the drug, and not related to the emergence of resistance, following long-term NTZ treatments.</jats:p>"

A new type of elastic core-spun yarn which is called tri-core (elastane/T400/elastane) yarn is introduced and tested for elastic properties after cyclic loading. The other yarn structures used are single-core/T400, single-core/lycra, dual-core (elastane/T400) yarn, and yarn without a core component (conventional). The five types of yarn structure were produced at three levels of yarn counts (10, 14, and 18 Ne). Elastic properties after cyclic loading including stress decay, permanent deformation, elastic recovery, and relaxation rate were calculated and statistically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance. The scanning electron microscopy images of the five structures used were produced to illustrate the structure of these yarns. The results determined that elastane/T400/elastane core-spun and single-core/T400 yarns have higher values for most of the elastic properties. It was found that yarn count and yarn structure significantly affect stress decay, while the yarn structure significantly affects permanent deformation and elastic recovery. On the other hand, yarn count significantly affects the relaxation rate. Data showed that the number of cyclic tests significantly influences yarn elastic recovery. </jats:p>",

In this work, the assessment of designed virtual core‐shell NP (VNP) models leads to the new designs of UCNPs, such as …@Er, Yb@Er, Yb@YbEr, which are experimentally evaluated as donor NPs and compared to the simulations. Moreover, the luminescence rise and decay kinetics in UCNP donors upon RET is discussed in newly proposed disparity measurements. The presented studies help to understand the role of energy‐transfer and energy migration between lanthanide ion dopants and how the architecture of core‐shell UCNPs affects their performance as FRET donors to organic acceptor dyes.</jats:p>",

Metformin (dimethyl‐biguanide) is a first‐line treatment for type II diabetes that, among other mechanisms, is involved in the activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). Cocaine self‐administration and extinction is associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated AMPK within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Previously, it was shown that increasing AMPK activity in the NAcore decreased cue‐induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Decreasing AMPK activity produced the opposite effect. The goal of the present study was to determine if metformin in the NAcore reduces cue‐induced cocaine seeking in adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were trained to self‐administer cocaine followed by extinction prior to cue‐induced reinstatement trials. Metformin microinjected in the NAcore attenuated cue‐induced reinstatement in male and female rats. Importantly, metformin's effects on cocaine seeking were not due to a general depression of spontaneous locomotor activity. In female rats, metformin's effects did generalize to a reduction in cue‐induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking. These data support a potential role for metformin as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorder but warrant caution given the potential for metformin's effects to generalize to a natural reward in female rats.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the exceedingly high integration density of VLSI circuits and the resulting high power density, thermal integrity became a major challenge. One way to tackle this problem is Dark silicon. Dark silicon is the amount of circuitry in a chip that is forced to switch off to insure thermal integrity of the system and prevent permanent thermal-related faults. In many-core systems, the presence of Dark Silicon adds new design constraints, in general, and on the communication fabric of such systems, in particular. This is due to the fact that system-level thermal-management systems tend to increase the distance between high activity cores to insure better thermal balancing and integrity. Consequently, a designing dilemma is created where a compromise has to be made between interconnect performance and power consumption. This study proposes a hybrid wire and surface-wave interconnect (SWI) based Network-on-Chip (NoC) to address the dark silicon challenge. Through efficient utilization of one-hop cross the chip communication SWI links, the proposed architecture is able to offer an efficient and scalable communication platform in terms of performance, power, and thermal impact. As a result, evaluations of the proposed architecture compared to baseline architecture under dark silicon scenarios show reduction in maximum temperature by 15∘C, average delay up to 73.1%, and energy-saving up to ∼3X. This study explores the promising potential of the proposed architecture in extending the utilization wall for current and future many-core systems in dark silicon era.</jats:p>",

This has resulted in changes in the aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, but historical records on the composition of the past vegetation on centennial scale are scarce. In this study, we examined changes in the terrestrial and aquatic plant communities in and around Lower Lake Constance using metabarcoding of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) of three cores from different sub‐basins covering the past, up to 300 years. We successfully identified an average of <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 3000 sequence variants (molecular operational taxonomic units ‐ MOTUs) and obtained a taxonomically annotated dataset of 127 species, 104 genera, and 72 families.

For example, alpha diversity decreased in the last <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 100 years, and this decrease was more pronounced in the terrestrial than in the aquatic plant community. Unlike the terrestrial plant community, the current aquatic plant‐community composition partially resembles the community from before the 20th‐century eutrophication phase of the lake. In addition to changes that can be attributed to anthropogenic impacts, we also captured the effect of DNA sedimentation on the terrestrial DNA diversity representation in sediments during periods of extensive flooding and potentially as a consequence of extremely cold winters. With sedDNA from Lower Lake Constance, we provide a new local dataset to investigate and extend the historical changes of different shoreline habitats and to identify characteristic and invasive plant species. Such highly resolved datasets spanning the past centuries can provide detailed information on human environmental history in densely populated regions that have undergone severe changes in the recent past.</jats:p>",

We propose a DL approach for segmenting and grading epithelial tissue using a novel training methodology that learns domain agnostic features. In this retrospective study, we analyzed WSI from three cohorts of prostate cancer patients. 3741 core needle biopsies (CNBs) received from two centers were used for training.

The system showed an accuracy of 83.1% and κquad of 0.93 on 1303 WSI from the third institution (blind evaluation).

This is realized by structured pattern projections on the incoherent source structure and implementing measurement of the cross-covariance of the intensities by a single-pixel detector. This technique, named structured transmittance illumination coherence holography (STICH), helps to reconstruct the complex coherence from the intensity measurement in a single-pixel detector without an interferometric setup and also keeps advantages of the intensity correlations.

It offers speeds of several gigabits per second, with small latencies less than 5ms, ultra-reliable transmission medium, while it is able to handle a huge quantity of nodes simultaneously connected to the network. 6G will be accepted for commercial launch within 10 years. 6G will be industrialized in retort to progress the dispersed radio access network (RAN) and longing to use terahertz band to increase the number of users. On proposing an adaptive hybrid transmission (AHT) arrangement about 6G with mobile internet protocol television network (MIPTVN), the proposed algorithm uses a hybrid mechanism. The AHT mechanism is the combination of the multichannel multicast and unicast process which increases the service over service probability of blocking the service and reduces the overall bandwidth consumption of MIPTVN on demand over 6G. </jats:p>",

This has led to a large amount of variability in approaches to research, limiting direct comparison and synthesis of findings. In a recently published systematic review of quantitative studies on RGCS, we found that few studies incorporated patient-reported outcomes. In response to this gap, we conducted a sequential systematic review of qualitative studies to identify outcomes exploring the patient experience of RGCS. In conjunction with the review of quantitative studies, these outcomes will be used to inform the development of a core outcome set. Text excerpts relevant to outcomes, including quotes and themes, were extracted verbatim and deductively coded as outcomes. We conducted a narrative synthesis to group outcomes within domains previously defined in our review of quantitative studies, and identify any new domains that were unique to qualitative studies. Seventy-eight outcomes were derived from qualitative studies and grouped into 19 outcome domains. Three new outcome domains were identified; ‘goals of pre- and post-test genetic counselling’, ‘acceptability of further testing and alternative reproductive options’, and ‘perceived utility of RGCS’. The identification of outcome domains that were not identified in quantitative studies indicates that outcomes reflecting the patient perspective may be under-represented in the quantitative literature on this topic. Further work should focus on ensuring that outcomes reflect the real world needs and concerns of patients in order to maximise translation of research findings into clinical practice.</jats:p>",

The design complies with the minimum code requirements of the current California Building Code, which is based on ASCE 7–16 and ACI 318–14. The computational representation of the building, which accounts for the material nonlinearities of all structural components, employs the beam‐truss model (BTM) for the walls and floor slabs. Analyses of the building model are conducted for static monotonic and cyclic lateral loads using the program FE‐MultiPhys, which provides a user‐friendly implementation of the BTM as an assemblage of rectangular shell macroelements. Two different load patterns, that is, lateral load distributions along the building height, are considered. The analyses provide insights into the evolution of damage and lateral strength degradation and their dependence on the load pattern, while also elucidating the complex interaction between the webs and flanges of the core wall and the system effects associated with coupling between the walls, beams, slabs, and columns. The presentation of the analytical results is accompanied by a discussion on the advantages of the BTM over seismic analysis methods used in current code‐minimum and performance‐based seismic design (PBSD) practice.</jats:p>",

The use of neutralization lines as conducting strip allows the antenna to function at the upper resonance-3.5GHz and the incorporation of complementary split ring resonator at the rear of the substrate benefits in the antenna's compact size. Due to the incorporation of a quarter wave transformer with a semicircular ring construction, the ring antenna produces better dual-band response. The upper resonance 3.5GHz is obtained due to the combination of tuned semicircular ring and circular ring along with the conducting strip in the structure. The fabricated antenna is printed on FR4 substrate with dimensions 10×10×1.6 mm3. The simulated results are verified by experimenting the fabricated antenna. It offered 14.6% bandwidth in the lower resonance 2.4 GHz and 8.5% bandwidth at upper resonant frequency 3.5GHz with radiation characteristics suitable for the WLAN/WiMAX applications. </jats:p>",

There are 2 types of soaring: thermal soaring, used by condors and frigatebirds, which involves the use of updrafts to ascend and then glide horizontally; and dynamic soaring, used by albatrosses, which involves the use of wind speed differences with height above the sea surface. Previous studies have suggested that P. sandersi used dynamic soaring, while A. magnificens and Quetzalcoatlus used thermal soaring. For Pteranodon, there is debate over whether they used dynamic or thermal soaring. However, the performance and wind speed requirements of dynamic and thermal soaring for these species have not yet been quantified comprehensively. We quantified these values using aerodynamic models and compared them with that of extant birds. For dynamic soaring, we quantified maximum travel speeds and maximum upwind speeds. For thermal soaring, we quantified the animal's sinking speed circling at a given radius and how far it could glide losing a given height. Our results confirmed those from previous studies that A. magnificens and Pteranodon used thermal soaring. Conversely, the results for P. sandersi and Quetzalcoatlus were contrary to those from previous studies. P. sandersi used thermal soaring, and Quetzalcoatlus had a poor ability both in dynamic and thermal soaring. Our results demonstrate the need for comprehensive assessments of performance and required wind conditions when estimating soaring styles of extinct flying species.</jats:p>",

The ability of the RCMs to simulate the spatial distributions of observed extreme precipitation was assessed using multiple datasets. The spatially averaged performance of the CORDEX‐CORE ensemble mean (CORE‐ENS) and RCM ensembles (RCM‐ENSEMBLES developed from different combinations of CORE‐ENS ensemble members) was evaluated using statistical metrics. The results showed similarities in the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation among the observations. However, there were considerable differences in the magnitude of extreme precipitation among the observations. The frequency of days with very heavy precipitation (R20) showed the largest differences in magnitude among the observations. Although there are differences in magnitude, CORE‐ENS, its ensemble members, and RCM‐ENSEMBLES can capture the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation. Specifically, CORE‐ENS, its ensemble members, and RCM‐ENSEMBLES overestimated (underestimated) the frequency of rainy days (RR1) and maximum consecutive wet days (CWD) (maximum consecutive dry days [CDD]). In contrast, some members of CORE‐ENS overestimate, while others underestimate, the simple daily intensity index (SDII), the frequency of days with heavy precipitation (R10), and R20, depending on the choice of reference data. The Consortium for Small‐scale MOdelling in CLimate Mode (CCLM) and Regional MOdel (REMO) performed better than the Regional Climate Model (RegCM4.7) in simulating the spatial distributions of extreme precipitation. The regionally averaged uncertainties (biases) of the CORE‐ENS, its ensemble members, and RCMENSEMBLES were within the range of those in the observational datasets, except for CWD (CWD and RR1). Overall, CORE‐ENS performed better than its ensemble members in simulating extreme precipitation.</jats:p>",

Despite a cultural resurgence in fermented foods and interest in microbiomes, there is little knowledge on the microbial diversity represented in fermented ‘hairy’ tofu, known locally in China as Mao tofu. High-throughput metagenomic sequencing of the ITS, LSU and 16S rDNA was used to determine Mao tofu’s fungal and bacterial community diversity across four wet markets in Yunnan, China. The results show that hairy tofu in this region consists of around 170 fungal and 365 bacterial taxa, and that microbial taxa differ between markets. Diversity also differed based on the specific niche of the tofu block, comparing the outside rind-like niche to that of the inside of the tofu block. Machine learning random forest models were able to accurately classify both the market and niche of sample origin. An over-abundance of yeast and Geotrichum was found, and Mucor (Mucoromycota) was abundant in the outside rind-like niche, which consists of the visible ‘hairy’ mycelium. The majority of the bacterial OTUs belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, with Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, Sphingobacterium and Flavobacterium the most abundant genera. Putative fungal pathogens of plants (Cercospora, Diaporthe, Fusarium) and animals (Metarhizium, Entomomortierella, Pyxidiophora, Candida, Clavispora) were also detected, as were putative bacterial pathogens identified as Legionella. Non-fungal eukaryotic taxa detected by LSU amplicon sequencing included soybean (Glycine max), Protozoa, Metazoa (e.g., Nematoda and Platyhelminthes), Rhizaria and Chromista, indicating that additional biodiversity exists in the hairy tofu microbiome.</jats:p>"

The associations of HBcrAg level with CHB phase, and nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-induced hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion were analyzed. In total, 387 patients (median follow-up of 82.4 months) were included. The CHB phases of patients were defined histologically as immune-tolerant (IT, n = 32, 8.3%), HBeAg-positive and immune-active (PIA, n = 211, 54.5%), HBeAg-negative and immune-active (n = 125, 32.3%), and inactive (n = 19, 4.9%), respectively. In HBeAg-positive patients, the mean HBV DNA levels were comparable between the two groups (p = 0.990). However, the mean HBsAg (7.4 log IU/mL and 6.9 log IU/mL, p = 0.002) and HBcrAg levels (8.2 log U/mL vs. 7.6 log U/mL, p &lt; 0.001) of IT patients were significantly higher than that of PIA patients. In multivariate analysis, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.949, p = 0.025), lower alanine aminotransferase (OR 0.988, p = 0.002) and higher HBcrAg level (OR = 2.745 p = 0.022) were independent predictors of the IT phase. Of the patients in the PIA phase, 194 received NA after liver biopsy, and 61 (31.4%) had achieved HBeAg seroconversion after antiviral therapy. In Cox regression analysis, the higher HBcrAg level was the only independent predictor of the NA-induced HBeAg seroconversion (hazard ratio 1.285, p = 0.028). The HBcrAg level is useful for predicting clinical phase of CHB and NA-induced HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The next generation 6G era is considered to be highly coupled with intelligent network management and orchestration, while 5G is completely renowned for micro-service architecture-based network cloudification. 6G has been revolutionized for satisfying the mandatory services and carry forwarding the potentialities of 5G to superior and intelligent level. 6G network structure is determined to be dynamic, densely deployed and extremely heterogeneous, and when integrated with a high degree of Quality of Service (QoS) completely transforms the complex architecture into a seamless operating process of classical networks. The immense role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is required for improving the paradigm of 6G for learning information from uncertain and dynamic environments. This integration of AI and 6G resembles a double-edged sword since the application of AI may positively influences the privacy or security of 6G on one side, and negatively introduces the possibility of security infringement into 6G on the other side. In specific, the self-sustaining networks in 6G are obtained by guaranteed application of intelligent security attack mitigation schemes and proactive threat discovery approaches that facilitate end-to-end future network automation. In this Chapter, a comprehensive review of AI and ML-based security enforcement techniques are contributed for improving reliability during robust data dissemination in 6G communications. It presents consolidated and solidified role of AI and ML towards the enforcement of security in 6G networks. In addition, it also demonstrates the challenges and solutions that are handled by the inclusion of AI and ML-based attack mitigation approaches concerning energy and security-based ultra-massive access. </jats:p>",

The deformability of the matrix phase was varied using two types of curing agents, dicyandiamide (DICY) and piperidine, wherein the matrix phase cured with DICY has lower deformability than that cured with piperidine. Tensile and compression tests were conducted for the DICY‐ and piperidine‐cured epoxies. Under tensile load conditions, typical for CSR‐ and CLR‐modified epoxies, the DICY‐cured epoxies were brittle, whereas the piperidine‐cured epoxies failed under plastic deformation. Under compression loads, the 0.2% proof stresses of both rubber‐modified epoxies cured by DICY were higher than those cured by piperidine, wherein the proof stresses for both the DICY‐ and piperidine‐cured epoxies decreased with increasing rubber content. The results of fracture toughness tests for both types of cured epoxies indicated that the <jats:italic>J</jats:italic>‐integral (<jats:italic>J</jats:italic><jats:sub>c</jats:sub>) values of the DICY‐cured epoxy containing rubber particles were ~0.3–0.5 times that of the piperidine‐cured epoxy, which implied that the fracture toughness of the rubber‐modified epoxies decreased with decreasing deformability of the matrix phase.

A custom-built system was used to fabricate AgNP aggregates of four sizes, 48, 86, 151, and 218 nm, from drying droplets containing AgNPs atomized from an AgNP suspension. Sample solutions of Rhodamine B (RhB) at 10<jats:sup>–6</jats:sup>, 10<jats:sup>–8</jats:sup>, and 10<jats:sup>–10</jats:sup> M concentrations were dropped onto the AgNP aggregates as probe molecules to examine the enhancement of the Raman signals of the RhB. The ordering of the analytical enhancement factors (AEFs) by aggregate size at a 10<jats:sup>–6</jats:sup> M RhB was 86 nm &gt; 218 nm &gt; 151 nm &gt; 48 nm. When RhB concentrations are below 10<jats:sup>–8</jats:sup> M, the 86 and 151 nm AgNP aggregates show clear RhB peaks. The AEFs of the 86 nm AgNP aggregates were the highest in all four aggregates and higher than those of the 218-nm aggregates, although the 218-nm aggregates had more hot spots where Raman enhancement occurred. This finding was attributable to the deformation and damping of the electron cloud in the highly aggregated AgNPs, reducing the sensitivity for Raman enhancement. When RhB was premixed with the AgNP suspension prior to atomization, the AEFs at 10<jats:sup>–8</jats:sup> M RhB rose ~ 100-fold compared to those in the earlier experiments (the post-dropping route). This significant enhancement was probably caused by the increased opportunity for the trapping of the probe molecules in the hot spots.</jats:p>"

The online detection and classification of apple moldy core plays a vital role in apple postharvest processing. In this paper, an online non-destructive detection system for apple moldy core disease was developed using near-infrared transmittance spectroscopy in spectral range of 600–1100 nm. A total of 120 apple samples were selected and randomly divided into a training set and a test set based on the ratio of 2:1. First, basic parameters for detection of apples with moldy core were determined through detection experiments of samples in a stationary state. Due to the random distribution of the diseased tissue inside diseased apples, stationary detection cannot accurately identify the diseased tissue. To solve this problem, the spectra of apples in motion state transmitted forward by the transmission line were acquired. Three placement orientations of the apple in the carrying fruit cup were tested to explore the influence of fruit orientation on spectral characteristics and prediction. According to the performance of the model, the optimal preprocessing method and modeling method were determined (fixed orientation model and arbitrary orientation model). SPA was used to select the characteristic wavelengths to further improve the online detection speed. The overall results showed that the multi-spectra model using mean spectra of three orientations was the best. The prediction accuracies of multi-spectra model using SPA for three orientations were 96.7%, 97.5% and 97.5% respectively. As a conclusion, the arbitrary orientation model was beneficial to improve the online detection of apple moldy core disease.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the continuous development of the network, the number of network assets continues to increase. Despite the convenience diversified network assets bring, it also poses new challenges to IP-based network asset management. Traditional asset discovery technologies mainly analyze network traffic, and detect relevant information (operating system, running software, etc.) of IP-based assets through methods such as active discovery, passive discovery, and discovery methods based on cyberspace search engines. These methods assign the same weight to all network IP-based network assets, and it is difficult to effectively analyze diversified network assets. In this paper, we propose the concept of IP-based core network assets, and collect the data of the relevant network assets based on this concept. Then, we construct a dataset and establish feature engineering for data preprocessing. As there is currently no relevant IP-based core network asset detection method, we propose an IP-based core network asset discovery technology based on pretraining of multiple autoencoders, MAE-CAD. The results show that our method can achieve 95.74% in Acc and 95.04% in F1 in the experimental environment (Acc = 98.11% and F1 = 97.16% in the actual network environment because of duplicate samples). In addition, MAE-CAD has excellent robustness. In an environment where the proportion of data is extremely unbalanced, when the IP-based core network asset data in the training set only accounts for 1/200 (0.5%), MAE-CAD can still obtain 92.91% in Acc and 91.57% in F1.</jats:p>",

However, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors showed a low response rate and were effective for only a small number of cancer patients. Thus, it is important to figure out the issue about the low response rate of immunotherapy. Here, we performed ssGSEA and unsupervised clustering analysis to identify three clusters (clusters A, B, and C) according to different immune cell infiltration status, prognosis, and biological action. Of them, cluster C showed a better survival rate, higher immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapy effect, with enrichment of a variety of immune active pathways including T and B cell signal receptors. In addition, it showed more significant features associated with immune subtypes C2 and C3. Furthermore, we used WGCNA analysis to confirm the cluster C-associated genes. The immune-activated module highly correlated with 111 genes in cluster C. To pick candidate genes in SD/PD and CR/PR patients, we used the least absolute shrinkage (LASSO) and SVM-RFE algorithms to identify the targets with better prognosis, activated immune-related pathways, and better immunotherapy. Finally, our analysis suggested that there were six genes with KLRC3 as the core which can efficiently improve immunotherapy responses with greater efficacy and better prognosis, and our study provided clues for further investigation about target genes associated with the higher response rate of immunotherapy.</jats:p>"

In this research, the coolant channel will be placed within the yoke of the stator core to enhance the heat transfer between the stator core and the coolant. Hydrophobic coating is applied to replace the metal tube for increasing the utilization of the cross area of the coolant channel. The impact of the coolant channel on the performance of the permanent magnet motor is analyzed. A general design method of the coolant channel is presented. The result shows that the change of the stator core loss is within about 10% as the coolant channel is moved away from the slot along the radial direction while the back electromotive force of the motor could keep constant through appropriate design. The impacts of the coolant channels on the magnet performance and the heat dissipation performance could be divided completely with the design method. The method can be applied on various PMSM including SPM (surface-mounted permanent magnet motor) and IPMSM (interior permanent magnet synchronous motor). Sufficient coolant flow could be provide to help conduct the temperature rise of the motor. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review concerning the effects of balance and core stability training on postural control in individuals who are visually impaired. This article comprehensively reviewed studies on balance in individuals who are blind from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus from 2007 to 2021. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were people who were blind or visually impaired (acquired and congenital), men and women, all ages, and at least 6 weeks balance or core stability training program. Twelve articles were included in this review. Individuals with visual impairment and blindness from all ages were included in this study. According to this review, all balance and core stability protocols in this article have positive effects on balance and postural control for individuals with visual impairments. Therefore, balance and core stability intervention for at least 6 weeks is one of the more well-established protocols for improving balance and postural control in people with visual impairment and can have a positive impact in risk of falling regardless of age, gender, or severity of visual impairment. </jats:p>",

However, additional\nhurdles, including raw materials shortages, need be overcome to improve\nfurther the industry’s agility. During the development of a SARS-CoV-2\nvaccine candidate, such supply limitations necessitated the\ndetermination of a cleaning in place (CIP) strategy for a multimodal\ncore-shell resin both rapidly and efficiently. This is a challenging\ntask with its complexity depending on the nature of the resin and the\ncomposition of the feed stream. Here, we describe the deployment of high\nthroughput (HT) techniques to screen CIP conditions for cleaning Capto™\nCore 700 resin exposed to clarified cell culture harvest of a SARS-CoV-2\nvaccine candidate produced in Vero adherent cell culture. The best\nperforming conditions, comprised of 30% n-propanol and ≥0.75 N NaOH,\nwere deployed in cycling experiments, completed with miniature\nchromatography columns, to demonstrate their effectiveness. The success\nof the CIP strategy was ultimately verified at laboratory scale. Here,\nits impact was assessed across the entire purification process which\nalso included an ultrafiltration/diafiltration step. It is shown that\nthe implementation of the CIP strategy enabled the re-use of the Capto\nCore 700 resin for up to ten cycles without any negative impact on the\npurified product. Hence, the strategic combination of HT and laboratory\nscale experiments can lead rapidly to robust CIP procedures, even for a\nchallenging to clean resin, and thus help to overcome supply shortages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and objectives: Kidney biopsy (KB) is the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of nephropathies and it is a diagnostic tool that presents a low rate of complications. Nowadays, biobank collections of renal tissue of patients with proven renal pathology are essential for research in nephrology. To provide enough tissue for the biobank collection, it is usually needed to obtain an extra kidney core at the time of kidney biopsy. The objective of our study is to evaluate the complications after KB and to analyze whether obtaining an extra core increases the risk of complications. Material and methods: Prospective observational study of KBs performed at Vall d’Hebron Hospital between 2019 and 2020. All patients who accepted to participate to our research biobank of native kidney biopsies were included to the study. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed and we studied risk factors associated with complications. Results: A total of 221 patients were included, mean age 56.6 (±16.8) years, 130 (58.8%) were men, creatinine was 2.24 (±1.94) mg/dL, proteinuria 1.56 (0.506–3.590) g/24 h, hemoglobin 12.03 (±2.3) g/dL, INR 0.99 (±0.1), and prothrombin time (PT) 11.86 (±1.2) s. A total of 38 patients (17.2%) presented complications associated with the procedure: 13.1% were minor complications, 11.3% (n = 25) required blood transfusion, 1.4% (n = 3) had severe hematomas, 2.3% (n = 5) required embolization, and 0.5% (n = 1) presented arterio-venous fistula. An increased risk for complication was independently associated with obtaining a single kidney core (vs. 2 and 3 cores) (p = 0.021). Conclusions: KB is an invasive and safe procedure with a low percentage of complications. Obtaining an extra kidney core for research does not increase the risk of complications during the intervention, which remains low in concordance with previously published reports.</jats:p>"

The current hypothesis predicts simultaneous excitation of cataplexy-inhibiting orexin neurons and cataplexy-inducing amygdala neurons. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activity of putative orexin neurons in orexin-knockout mice during cataplexy episodes using fiber photometry. We created two animal models of orexin-knockout mice with a GCaMP6 fluorescent indicator expressed in putative orexin neurons. We first prepared orexin-knockout mice crossed with transgenic mice carrying a tetracycline-controlled transactivator transgene under the control of the orexin promoter. TetO-GCaMP6 was then introduced into mice via an adeno-associated virus injection or natural crossing. The resulting two models showed restricted expression of GCaMP6 in the hypothalamus, where orexin neurons should be located, and showed excitation to an intruder stress that was similar to that observed in orexin-intact mice in our previous study. The activity of these putative orexin neurons increased immediately before the onset of cataplexy-like behavior but decreased (approximately − 20% of the baseline) during the cataplexy-like episode. We propose that the activity of orexin neurons during cataplexy is moderately inhibited by an unknown mechanism. The absence of cataplexy in wild-type mice may be explained by basal or residual activity-induced orexin release, and emotional stimulus-induced counter activation of orexin neurons may not be necessary. This study will serve as a basis for better treatment of cataplexy in narcolepsy patients.</jats:p>",

Current research had three objectives as; firstly, the prevalence estimation of muscular endurance; secondly, to provide the normative reference standards of plank test by Lambda (?), Mu (µ) and Sigma (?) ‘LMS’ technique and lastly, to provide the status of healthy and un-healthy zones of aged 12 to 16 years old adolescents of South Punjab for the very first time. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive research design with a total of 2970 students aged 12–16 contributing almost equally in numbers from 60 public high schools. Muscular endurance was estimated from Plank to Fatigue (PTF) test. LMS method/technique was deployed to acquire reference norms for muscular endurance by the plank test. Results: The plank endurance test calculated age and gender-specific smoothed percentile curves (5th, 20th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 80th, and 95th). Overall, results reflected that boys were found higher in average plank values than their counterparts; meanwhile, the international comparison showed that current outcomes are similar to the preceding studies. The result showed that 60.1% of the population is falling in the poor, medium and very poor categories. Conclusion: The present study exhibited the earliest age-gender specific plank endurance test normative reference values, percentile curves and health-benefit zones of 12 to 16 years old adolescents of South Punjab Pakistan.\r\nPak J Physiol 2022;18(1):3?8</jats:p>"

In this context, it should be kept in mind that a more extensive presence of targeting ligands on the surface of nanomedicines may affect their pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profile. Thus, we suggest a relatively low cRGD decoration density as most suitable for in vivo application.</jats:p>"

Designing highly efficient electrocatalysts with a core–shell like structure for accelerating polysulfide conversion is vital for the development of Li–S batteries.

The electrocatalysis of MoSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is confirmed by the analysis of symmetric batteries, Tafel curves, changes of activation energy, and lithium‐ion diffusion. Density functional theory calculations also prove the low Gibbs free energy of the reaction pathway and the lithium‐ion diffusion barrier.

However, QHT involves kinetic energy functionals, the practical implementation of which typically induces significant numerical instabilities, particularly in nonlinear optical phenomena. To mitigate this problem, we develop a numerical solution to QHT that is quite stable, even in a nonlinear regime. The key to our approach is to rewrite the dynamical equation of QHT using the effective Schrödinger equation. We apply the new method to the linear and nonlinear responses of a metallic nanoparticle and compare the results with fully quantum mechanical calculations.

Stage 2 will build on Stage 1 findings to identify and select intervention functions and behaviour change techniques to enhance COS use in trials. Stage 3 will involve an online stakeholder consensus meeting including trialists, healthcare professionals, and patient/public representatives. The purpose of the meeting is to prioritise identified intervention approaches that will inform future research to increase COS use.</ns7:p><ns7:p> </ns7:p><ns7:p> <ns7:bold>Discussion: </ns7:bold>The findings of this study<ns7:bold> </ns7:bold>will provide an understanding of the behavioural factors that influence COS use in trials, what strategies might be used to target these factors to increase COS use, and what strategies key stakeholders perceive as especially important in future research to enhance COS use in trials.<ns7:bold>  </ns7:bold></ns7:p>"

Multiple access is a key technique in the wireless technological evolution that provides access to multiple users with the available resources. Even though 5G system promises data rate in Gbps and latency below 1 ms with a wide bandwidth ranges from 30 GHz to 300 GHZ, its range of coverage was limited. Hence, the infrastructure needs to be rebuilt to overcome the limitation. NOMA is the key enabler for bringing down the interference effects and sharing the spectrum among multiple users in an efficient way. Cooperative communication is another promising technology that can improve coverage and capacity of the wireless system. Cell free communication with cooperative NOMA architecture is proposed in this chapter to meet 6G requirements at THz band. </jats:p>",

These technologies can be applied to subsurface data to reliably predict a host of properties where only few are available. Among the numerous sources of subsurface data, rock and fluid analysis stand out as the means of directly measuring subsurface properties. The challenge in this work is to maximize information gain from legacy pdf reports and unstructured data tables that represented over 70 years of laboratory work and investment. The implication of modeling this data into an organized data store means better assessment of economic viability and producibility in frontier basins and the capability to identify bypassed pay in old wells that may not have rock material.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents innovative and agile technologies that integrate data management, data quality assessment, and predictive machine learning to maximize the company asset value using underutilized legacy core data. The developed machine learning algorithms identify potential outliers, benchmark the valuable data against current industry standards, increase the confidence in data quality and avoid amplifying error in predicting reservoir properties.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The workflow presented in the paper is expected to reduce uncertainties in subsurface studies caused by limited core data, improper analog selection, high cost, limited time for acquiring new cores, and long delivery times of core analysis data. The workflow reduces the requirement for subsurface formation evaluation rework as new data becomes available at later project stages resulting in optimized field development. The workflow enhanced by machine learning also improves the prediction and propagation of reservoir properties to uncored borehole sections.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In conclusion, managing legacy core data and transforming it to generate new subsurface insights are critical step to establish a reliable database in support of business excellence and the digitalization journey. Innovative machine learning tools continue to unlock new values from legacy core data that significantly impact the entire reservoir life cycle including reserves booking, production forecasting, well placement, and completion design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects more than 71 million people worldwide. The disease slowly progresses to chronic, long-term liver injury which leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 5 % of infections. The alternative reading frame protein (ARFP/core+1) is encoded by a sequence overlapping the HCV core gene in the +1 reading frame. Its role in hepatitis C pathogenesis and the viral life cycle is unclear, although some observers have related its production to disease progression and the development of HCC. The aim of this study was to determine whether ARFP is immunogenic in patients with chronic HCV genotype 3 infection and to assess whether sero-reactivity is associated with disease progression, particularly to HCC. Immunogenic epitopes within the protein were predicted by a bioinformatics tool, and three −20 aa length-peptides (ARFP-P1, ARFP-P2 and ARFP-P3) were synthesized and used in an avidin-biotin ARFP/core+1 peptide ELISA. Serum samples from 50 patients with chronic HCV genotype 3 infection, 50 genotype-1 patients, 50 HBV patients and 110 healthy controls were tested. Sero-reactivity to the ARFP peptides was also tested and compared in 114 chronic HCV genotype-3 patients subdivided on the basis of disease severity into non-cirrhotic, cirrhotic and HCC groups. Chronic HCV genotype-3 patients showed noticeable rates of reactivity to ARFP and core peptides. Seropositivity rates were 58% for ARFP-P1, 47 % for ARFP-P2, 5.9 % for ARFP-P3 and 100 % for C22 peptides. There was no significant difference between these seroreactivities between HCV genotype-3 patients with HCC, and HCV genotype-3 patients with and without liver cirrhosis. Patients with chronic HCV genotype-3 infection frequently produce antibodies against ARFP/core+1 protein. ARFP peptide reactivity was not associated with disease severity in patients with HCV genotype-3. These results support the conclusion that ARFP/core+1 is produced during HCV infection, but they do not confirm that antibodies to ARFP can indicate HCV disease progression.</jats:p>",

A total of 40,901 SSR loci were identified; they were uniformly distributed throughout the TB genome, with a mean distance of 11 kb between loci. Based on these loci, 8,089 pairs of SSR primers were designed, and 101 primer pairs for polymorphic SSR loci were used to genotype the 97 core germplasm resources. The polymorphic SSR loci showed high genetic variation in these core germplasm resources, with an average polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.48. In addition, multiple SSR markers, such as SXAU8002 [100-grain weight (HGW)] and SXAU8006 [stem diameter (SD)], were found to be associated with agronomic traits in the two environments. Finally, based on gene functional annotation and homology analysis, a candidate gene, <jats:italic>FtPinG0007685500</jats:italic>, that may affect the node number and SD of the main stem by participating in lignin synthesis was identified. This study reports the mining of genome-wide SSR loci and the development of markers in TB, which can be used for molecular characterization of the germplasm in its gene pool.

WCRs that have higher rotational velocities and are closer to the shelf are found to exert greater influence on the along‐shelf velocities, with the fastest and closest rings reversing the direction of flow at the shelf break. As rings approach the study site, the Shelfbreak Jet is faster than when the rings are about to exit the study site, likely due to first steepening then flattening of the isopycnals at the Shelfbreak Front. Rings also have lasting impacts on the shelf temperature: rings with faster rotational velocities cool the shelf and rings with slower rotational velocities warm the shelf. The evolution of temperature on the shelf as a ring passes is strongly tied to the season. During warmer seasons, when temperature stratification on the shelf is strong, a ring cools the shelf; during periods of weak thermal stratification, rings tend to warm the shelf. Rings which cool the shelf are additionally associated with increased upwelling as they pass the study site.</jats:p>",

These processes left behind a compositional trail that can be observed in xenoliths and measured by geophysical methods. The abundance of kimberlites in southern Africa makes it an ideal place to test and calibrate mantle geophysical interpretations that can then be applied to less well‐constrained regions. Magnetotellurics (MT) is a particularly useful tool for understanding tectonic history because electrical conductivity is sensitive to temperature, bulk composition, accessory minerals, and rock fabric. We produced three‐dimensional MT models of the southern African mantle taken from the SAMTEX MT data set, mapped the properties of ∼36,000 garnet xenocrysts from Group I kimberlites, and compared the results. We found that depleted regions of the mantle are uniformly associated with high electrical resistivities. The conductivity of fertile regions is more complex and depends on the specific tectonic and metasomatic history of the region, including the compositions of metasomatic fluids or melts and the emplacement of metasomatic minerals. The mantle beneath the ∼2.05 Ga Bushveld Complex is highly conductive, probably caused by magmas flowing along a lithospheric weakness zone and precipitating interconnected, conductive accessory minerals such as graphite and sulfides. Kimberlites tend to be emplaced near the edges of the cratons where the mantle below 100 km depth is not highly resistive. Kimberlites avoid strong mantle conductors, suggesting a systematic relationship between their emplacement and mantle composition.</jats:p>",

In recent years, there have been growing concerns regarding the privacy of the data collected from the users of the smart healthcare systems. This chapter proposes a light-weight federated learning framework based on multi-key homomorphic encryption for deploying predictive models trained on patient data distributed across multiple healthcare institutions without exchanging them. Two predictive models based on the proposed framework are deployed for in-house mortality prediction from patient data and COVID-19 detection from chest x-ray images. Performance evaluation of these models with standard datasets and comparative analyses show that the proposed models are superior to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed framework and the models are potential solutions to improve the quality of healthcare across multiple healthcare institutions, protecting the sensitive patient data and ensuring personalization of healthcare.</jats:p>",

To ascertain coastal entrainment by eddies, we compared the larval fish community of 2 contrasting cyclonic eddies in 3 depth strata (0-5, 5-50, 50-100 m), and with the adjacent shelf community. The frontal cyclonic eddy was smaller and younger than the mesoscale cyclonic eddy. A larval fish entrainment index, based on the ratio of coastal to oceanic taxa, revealed the relative abundance of coastal larvae entrained into the upper mixed layer of the frontal eddy, consistent with published numerical modelling studies of similar eddies. The frontal eddy had a high abundance of commercially important coastal taxa entrained from the inner shelf. However, the adjacent inner shelf water and putative location for frontal eddy formation had recently been displaced by the East Australian Current, resulting in the larval fish community being dominated by oceanic taxa. The spatial and temporal dynamics of coastal entrainment into the larger, older cyclonic eddy and the adjacent shelf region were revealed by mixtures of coastal and oceanic taxa in each of the depth strata. The larger cyclonic eddy had a higher biomass of zooplankton, indicating the cumulative effects of eddy age and production. Eddies which interact with the shelf enable cross-shelf mixing and may contribute to coastal fisheries.</jats:p>",

Multiple benefits associated with urban ponds have only recently started to be appreciated, and examples of in-depth interdisciplinary insights remain rare. This paper gives an account of the ecosystem services provided by Blackford Pond, a semi-natural water body located within a nature reserve and nominated as a site globally important for scientific research. Despite elevated levels of polluting substances and eutrophication, the overall species richness of the site is high and the biodiversity of the locality is enhanced by the ecotone effect. The diversity of available plant hosts and substrates appears to benefit the fungal community and the abundance of aquatic invertebrate fauna appears to benefit the higher trophic levels. Hydrological modelling clearly shows that the pond increases the flood resilience of the surrounding area, despite not having been designed as a drainage feature. The application of the Natural Capital Planning Tool (NCPT) also reveals higher values (in relation to the values of amenity grassland) of such ecosystem services categories as biodiversity (+4.76 per hectare), aesthetic values (+4.67), flood risk regulation (+0.41), air quality (+0.28), local (+0.6) and global (+0.14) climate regulations. The discussion highlights a number of trade-offs among different ecosystem services (e.g. water quality vs. diatom research value, flood resilience vs. air quality and carbon capture, biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal vs. lichenised fungi), and considers which of the multiple benefits provided by the site may have not been fully reflected in NCPT calculations or the economic estimates obtained using contingent valuation (e.g. effects on hydrology, water quality, wildlife corridors, education and research value). The simultaneous consideration of biodiversity, hydrology, water chemistry and amenity, education, research and other values presented in this paper contributes towards a better understanding of the ecology and overall functioning of urban ponds, and helps to increase appreciation of their benefits and promote their public acceptability and further implementation.</jats:p>",

Rock strength was characterized using data inputs/measurements with the objective to reduce uncertainty on predictions of wellbore stability in four deep gas wells. As a primary input for many standard geomechanical models, rock strength parameter is routinely measured on rock samples using triaxial/uniaxial tests. This parameter is traditionally named as Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) measured during the axial loading and crushing of cylindrical \"core plugs\" extracted from cores. Although considered as a standard for rock strength evaluation, this method has some limitations such as (i) sample destruction, (ii) natural bias in weak formations (iii) natural dispersion, (iv) discretization of the measurement along sampled intervals and (v) sample preparation challenges.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The scratch test has been developed as a rapid and cost effective rock strength testing method addressing these limitations. The relative advantages of the scratch test as an alternative to standard rock strength testing are discussed and its added value demonstrated in the context of practical applications for a tight gas reservoir. Geomechanical data was acquired from four different wells with the following measurements: (i) Acoustic wireline log, (ii) Uniaxial compressive strength resulting from laboratory tests on plug samples, (iii) a continuous high-resolution strength profile interpreted from scratch tests performed on whole cores. Then, the data from all these sources has been integrated following a dedicated workflow designed to reduce the uncertainty in the output of strength models from wireline logs, through careful handling of data resolution differences and heterogeneity mapping.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Encouraging correlations between core-based measurements and scratch test suggests that the scratch test has emerged as a valid alternative to standard rock mechanical tests in suitable situations. Robust statistics are provided for strength and explanations are proposed for outlier values from tests on plug samples. Furthermore, the continuity and the high resolution of the strength profile enables a much better calibration of strength proxies from acoustic wireline logs. Finally, the scratch test yield values from shale intervals that were traditionally overlooked by plug site selections for rock mechanical testing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The strength assessment protocol from the scratch test handles rock heterogeneity with a much larger data set than conventional rock strength testing methods. This enables more robust core property-log calibration at different length scales. Such continuous high resolution profiles of rock properties leads to a significant reduction in uncertainty in petrophysical and geomechanics models, and better decision making in well design and field management.</jats:p>",

Then the stabilization effect is investigated, where the installation of SSI on the single‐phase consumer side is assumed as a new concept. The improvement of frequency and transient stability are evaluated. The SSI model is verified by comparing the developed root mean square (RMS) simulation, hardware‐in‐the‐loop (HIL) simulation, and the experiment using SSI hardware. The simulation results show that the SSI has the considerable ability of grid stabilization. Singlephase micro‐grid (SMG) operations using SSIs are also presented. The effectiveness of SMG operations is shown based on laboratory experiments.</jats:p>",

First, our multi-core task allocation method introduces the WFM theory into task assignment for each core to improve the core computing resource utilization for high-efficient parallel computing.

Experimental results show that the proposed approach can save on average 87.31% on the Intel X86 platform, compared to the single-core time.

Interestingly, QDs with a high OLA concentration exhibit diffraction peaks of ZnS/ZnO. As a result, the thermal stability of QDs with ZnS/ZnO shells exhibits better performance than those with ZnS shells.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. It was recently reported (Xie et al. Journal of Molecular Biology 2022, 434 (2), 167349) that the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) ATP-site inhibitor imatinib also binds to Abl’s myristoyl binding pocket, which is the target of allosteric Abl inhibitors. This was based on a crystal structure of a truncated Abl kinase domain construct in complex with imatinib bound to the allosteric site as well as some further ITC, NMR, and kinase activity data. Albeit imatinib’s affinity for the allosteric site is significantly weaker (10 μM) than for the ATP site (10 nM), imatinib binding to the allosteric site may disassemble the regulatory core of Abl, thereby stimulating kinase activity, in particular for Abl mutants with reduced imatinib ATP-site affinity. It was argued that the previously observed imatinib-induced opening of the Abl regulatory core (Skora et al. PNAS 2013, 110 (47), E4437–E4445, Sonti et al. Journal of the American Chemical Society 2018, 140 (5), 1863–1869) may be caused by the binding of imatinib to the allosteric site and not to the ATP site. We show here that this is not the case, but that indeed imatinib binding to the ATP site induces the opening of the regulatory core at nanomolar concentrations. This agrees with findings that other type-II ATP site inhibitors (nilotinib, ponatinib) disassemble the regulatory core despite demonstrated negligible binding to the allosteric site.\n                        </jats:p>"

Through structured interviews with experts from 28 European countries, we explored potential areas of core competency. Specifically, questions pertained to the perceived importance of a series of foundational, functional, and other competencies, as well as current training standards and practices, and optimal standards. Our findings revealed considerable agreement (about three quarters and above) on academic and clinical training, despite varied actual training requirements currently, with fewer respondents relegating importance to training in teaching, supervision, and research (a little over half), and even fewer to skills related to management, administration, and advocacy (fewer than half). European expert clinical neuropsychologists were in agreement with previous studies (including those conducted in the United States, Australia, and other countries) regarding the importance of sound theoretical and clinical training but management, administrative, and advocacy skills were not central to their perspective of a competent specialist in clinical neuropsychology. Establishing a specialty certificate in clinical neuropsychology based on core competencies may enable mobility of clinical neuropsychologists across Europe, and, perhaps, provide an impetus for countries with limited criteria to reconsider their training requirements and harmonize their standards with others.</jats:p>"

Moreover, the attractors can be found by choosing initial conditions that are small perturbations of these fixed points.

We tested this hypothesis on a large family of directed graphs of size n = 5, and found remarkable agreement. Furthermore, we discovered that core motifs with similar embeddings give rise to nearly identical attractors. This allowed us to classify attractors based on structurally-defined graph families.

Here, taking bcc molybdenum (Mo) as the example, the interaction of interstitial solutes carbon (C) and oxygen (O) with screw dislocation, and their influences on the dislocation motion, have been determined using first-principles calculations and thermodynamic models. Due to the incompact atomic structure and variation of electronic states in the dislocation core, C and O will segregate from the bulk system to the dislocation region. Notably, the presence of C/O at the dislocation induces the reconstruction of the core structure, from an easy-core to hard-core configuration. This originates from the fact that the hard-core structure provides a larger available volume at the interstitial site than the easy-core structure and, thus, facilitates the dissolution of C and O. More importantly, the addition of C/O in the dislocation significantly increases the Peierls stresses and double-kink formation enthalpies of screw dislocation in Mo, from 1.91 GPa and 1.18 eV for C/O-free dislocation to 5.63/4.69 GPa and 1.77/1.58 eV for C/O-saturated dislocation. Therefore, these interstitial solutes have a pinning effect on the dislocation motion, and this effect becomes stronger with higher segregating levels. This work reveals the profound effect of interstitial solutes on the properties of the dislocation core and provides a fundamental factor to account for the interstitial solutes-related phenomena in bcc metals.</jats:p>"

Since herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 is sensitive to type I IFN and neutralizing antibody, we investigated the role of TRIM21 in response to ocular HSV-1 infection in mice. In comparison to wild type (WT) mice, TRIM21 deficient (TRIM21 KO) mice were found to be no more susceptible to ocular HSV-1 infection than WT animals, in terms of infectious virus recovered in the cornea. Similar pathology, in terms of neovascularization, opacity, and loss of peripheral vision function, was observed in both WT and TRIM21 KO mice. However, TRIM21 KO mice did possess a significant increase in infectious virus recovered in the trigeminal ganglia, in comparison to the WT animals. The increased susceptibility was not due to changes in HSV-1-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cell numbers or functional capabilities, or in changes in type I IFN or IFN-inducible gene expression. In summary, the absence of TRIM21 results in a modest, but significant, increase in HSV-1 titers recovered from the TG of TRIM21 KO mice during acute infection, by a mechanism yet to be determined.</jats:p>"

The logical core of the underlying Vadalog language is the warded fragment of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs). This formalism ensures tractable reasoning in data complexity, while a recent analysis focusing on a practical implementation led to the reasoning algorithm around which the Vadalog system is built. A fundamental question that has emerged in the context of Vadalog is whether we can limit the recursion allowed by wardedness in order to obtain a formalism that provides a convenient syntax for expressing useful recursive statements, and at the same time achieves space-efficiency. After analyzing several real-life examples of warded sets of TGDs provided by our industrial partners, as well as recent benchmarks, we observed that recursion is often used in a restricted way: the body of a TGD contains at most one atom whose predicate is mutually recursive with a predicate in the head. We show that this type of recursion, known as\n            <jats:italic>piece-wise linear</jats:italic>\n            in the Datalog literature, is the answer to our main question. We further show that piece-wise linear recursion alone, without the wardedness condition, is not enough as it leads to undecidability. We also study the relative expressiveness of the query languages based on (piece-wise linear) warded sets of TGDs. Finally, we give preliminary experimental evidence for the practical effect of piece-wise linearity on Vadalog.\n          </jats:p>",

The association of this wide spectrum of explosion and remnant types with the properties of the progenitors remains an open issue. The rotation and magnetic fields in Wolf–Rayet stars of subsolar metallicity may explain extreme events such as superluminous supernovae and gamma-ray bursts powered by proto-magnetars or collapsars. Continuing with numerical studies of magnetorotational core collapse, including detailed neutrino physics, we focus on progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses in the range between 5 and 39 ${\\rm M}_{\\odot }$. The pre-collapse stars are 1D models employing prescriptions for the effects of rotation and magnetic fields. Eight of the 10 stars we consider are the results of chemically homogeneous evolution owing to enhanced rotational mixing . All but one of them produce explosions driven by neutrino heating (more likely for low-mass progenitors up to 8 ${\\rm M}_{\\odot }$) and non-spherical flows or by magnetorotational stresses (more frequent above 26 ${\\rm M}_{\\odot }$). In most of them and for the one non-exploding model, ongoing accretion leads to black hole formation. Rapid rotation makes subsequent collapsar activity plausible. Models not forming black holes show proto-magnetar-driven jets. Conditions for the formation of nickel are more favourable in magnetorotationally driven models, although our rough estimates fall short of the requirements for extremely bright events if these are powered by radioactive decay. However, the approximate light curves of our models suggest that a proto-magnetar or black hole spin-down may fuel luminous transients (with peak luminosities $\\sim 10^{43-44}\\, \\textrm {erg}$).</jats:p>",

Mosquito viromes, often scrutinized due to their public health relevance, may also provide insight into broadly applicable concepts, such as a “core virome,” a set of viruses consistently associated with a host species or population that may fundamentally impact its basic biology. A subset of mosquito‐associated viruses (MAVs) could comprise such a core, and MAVs can be categorized as (i) arboviruses, which alternate between mosquito and vertebrate hosts, (ii) insect‐specific viruses, which cannot replicate in vertebrate cells, and (iii) viruses with unknown specificity. MAVs have been widely characterized in the disease vector <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti</jats:italic>, and the occurrence of a core virome in this species has been proposed but remains unclear. Using a wild population previously surveyed for MAVs and a common laboratory strain, we investigated viromes in reproductive tissue via metagenomic RNA sequencing. Virome composition varied across samples, but four groups comprised &gt;97% of virus sequences: a novel partiti‐like virus (Partitiviridae), a toti‐like virus (Totiviridae), unclassified Riboviria, and four orthomyxo‐like viruses (Orthormyxoviridae). Whole or partial genomes for the partiti‐like virus, toti‐like virus, and one orthomyxo‐like virus were assembled and analysed phylogenetically. Multigenerational maintenance of these MAVs was confirmed by RT‐PCR, indicating vertical transmission as a mechanism for persistence.

The replacement of one or more hydrogen atom(s) in a drug molecule with its heavier stable isotope deuterium can enhance its metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties. However, it remains uninterrogated if rational deuteration at bioactivation “hot-spots” could attenuate its associated toxicological consequences. Here, our preliminary screening with benzofuran antiarrhythmic agents first revealed that dronedarone and its major metabolite N-desbutyldronedarone elicited a greater loss of viability and cytotoxicity in human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells as compared with amiodarone and its corresponding metabolite N-desethylamiodarone. A comparison of dronedarone and its in-house synthesized deuterated analogue (termed poyendarone) demonstrated that deuteration could attenuate its in vitro toxicity in HepG2 cells by modulating the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and evoking a distinct apoptotic kinetic signature. Furthermore, although pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer rifampicin or the substitution of glucose with galactose in the growth media significantly augmented the loss of cell viability elicited by dronedarone and poyendarone, a lower loss of cell viability was consistently observed in poyendarone across all concentrations. Taken together, our preliminary investigations suggested that the rational deuteration of dronedarone at its benzofuran ring reduces aberrant cytochrome P450 3A4/5-mediated bioactivation, which attenuated its mitochondrial toxicity in human hepatic HepG2 cells.</jats:p>",

Even the most advanced composites today face the difficult task of overcoming the harsh re-hydrogenation conditions (elevated temperature, high hydrogen pressure). Traditionally, the most utilized materials have been RMH (reactive metal hydrides) and complex metal borohydrides M(BH4)x (M: main group or transition metal; x: valence of M), often along with metal amides or various additives serving as catalysts (Pd2+, Ti4+ etc.). Through destabilization (kinetic or thermodynamic), M(BH4)x can effectively lower their dehydrogenation enthalpy, providing for a faster reaction occurring at a lower temperature onset. The present review summarizes the recent scientific results on various metal borohydrides, aiming to present the current state-of-the-art on such hydrogen storage materials, while trying to analyze the pros and cons of each material regarding its thermodynamic and kinetic behavior in hydrogenation studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological progress demands accurate measurements of rapidly changing pressures. This, in turn, requires the use of dynamically calibrated pressure meters. The shock tube enables the dynamic characterization by applying an almost ideal pressure step change to the pressure sensor under calibration. This paper evaluates the effect of the dynamic response of a side-wall pressure measurement system on the detection of shock wave passage times over the side-wall pressure sensors installed along the shock tube. Furthermore, it evaluates this effect on the reference pressure step signal determined at the end-wall of the driven section using a time-of-flight method. To determine the errors in the detection of the shock front passage times over the centers of the side-wall sensors, a physical model for simulating the dynamic response of the complete measurement chain to the passage of the shock wave was developed. Due to the fact that the use of the physical model requires information about the effective diameter of the pressure sensor, special attention was paid to determining the effective diameter of the side-wall pressure sensors installed along the shock tube. The results show that the relative systematic errors in the pressure step amplitude at the end-wall of the shock tube due to the errors in the detection of the shock front passage times over the side-wall pressure sensors are less than 0.0003%. On the other hand, the systematic errors in the phase lag of the end-wall pressure signal in the calibration frequency range appropriate for high-frequency dynamic pressure applications are up to a few tens of degrees. Since the target phase measurement uncertainty of the pressure sensors used in high-frequency dynamic pressure applications is only a few degrees, the corrections for the systematic errors in the detection of the shock front passage times over the side-wall pressure sensors with the use of the developed physical dynamic model are, therefore, necessary when performing dynamic calibrations of pressure sensors with a shock tube.</jats:p>"

Here we show how these observations can probe the runaway phase of planetary growth in the Core Accretion theory. Planets in this phase have the right range of masses to account for the predominantly moderate contrast gaps and rings seen in ALMA observations. However, we find that these planets gain mass and migrate inward very rapidly. As a result, the phase when they could produce gaps with properties similar to those observed is very short, i.e. tgap ≲ 0.1 Myr, independently of the disc viscosity parameter. This would require many tens to hundreds of gas giant planets to be born per ALMA system, violating the available mass budget of solids in realistic discs. This also predicts preponderance of discs with very wide gaps or complete inner disc holes, which is not observed. We show that suppression of both planet accretion and migration by a factor of at least ten is a possible solution to these serious problems. Future population synthesis models of planet formation should aim to address both exoplanetary data of older disc-less planetary systems and ALMA discs with embedded planets in one framework.</jats:p>",

We included all VREfm isolates from six hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark that were sequenced between 2012 and 2020. Ward data were collected from our laboratory information system. A ward outbreak was defined as two patient samples from the same ward within a period of 30 days belonging to the same cgMLST cluster. cgMLST complex types were determined using Ridom SeqSphere v7.2.3, where a maximum of 20 allelic differences between isolates defines a cluster. We included 1690 patient isolates between 2012 and 2020. Our collection consisted of 45 unique clusters and 227 ward outbreaks. The median duration of outbreaks was 20 days. We reported a median outbreak duration of VREfm outbreaks based on WGS data to be 20 days, and thus concluded that our infection control precautions are adequate.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have shown that the efficacy of RNAi varies among different insect species, which limits its wide spread application in the field of crop protection. In this study, we identified and characterized six core RNAi pathway genes including OfDicer1, OfDicer2, OfR2D2, OfAgo1, OfAgo2, and OfAgo3 from the transcriptomic database of the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis). Domain analysis showed that the six deduced proteins contained the necessary functional domains. Insect developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression analysis showed that five genes were expressed in all the stages and tissues examined except OfAgo3, which showed low expression in larvae, and high expression in pupae and adults and in the midgut. RT-qPCR was performed to examine the response of these six genes to exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Interestingly, the transcript levels of OfDicer2 and OfAgo2 were significantly enhanced after the injection of dsEGFP at different time points and tissues investigated. Consequently, the RNAi efficiency in targeting the insect endogenous genes can be greatly enhanced in the hemolymph or midgut. Taken together, our investigations suggest that RNAi efficiency can be enhanced by pre-injection of dsRNA to induce the RNAi core machinery genes, which could be a useful strategy to improving RNAi efficiency for studying gene functions under laboratory conditions.</jats:p>"

The effects of GeO2 content on the valence variations of Yb3+/Yb2+ ions, spectral properties of Yb3+ ions, and radiation resistance of Yb/Al/Ge co-doped silica glasses were systematically studied. The results show that even if the GeO2 content of the sample is relatively low (0.62 mol%), it can inhibit the generation of Yb2+ ions with slight improvement in the spectral properties of Yb3+ ions in the pristine samples and effectively improve its radiation resistance. Direct evidence confirms that the generation of trapped-electron centers (Yb2+/Si-E’/Al-E’) and trapped-hole centers (Al-OHC) was effectively inhibited by Ge co-doping.

The object of study is non-woven core-shell PVA–PEG–SiO2@PVA–GO fiber mats assembled by the technology of coaxial electrospinning. The task of the core-shell fiber development was set to regulate the degradation process under external factors. The dual structure was modified with silica nanoparticles and graphene oxide to ensure the fiber integrity and stability. The influence of the nano additives and crosslinking conditions for the composite was investigated as a function of fiber diameter, hydrolysis, and mechanical properties. Tensile mechanical tests and water degradation tests were used to reveal the fracture and dissolution behavior of the fiber mats and bundles. The obtained fibers were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy to confirm the continuous core-shell structure and encapsulation feasibility for biologically active components, selectively in the fiber core and shell. The results provide a firm basis to draw the conclusion that electrospun core-shell fiber mats have tremendous potential for biomedical applications as drug carriers, photocatalysts, and wound dressings.</jats:p>"

A novel treatment modality is currently being developed that produces converging monoenergetic x-rays. Conventional application of dosimetric calibration as presented in protocol TG61 is not applicable. Furthermore, the dosimetry of the focal point of the converging beam is on the order of a few millimeters, requiring a high-resolution dosimeter. Here we present a procedure to calibrate radiochromic film for narrow-beam monoenergetic 60 keV photons as well as absolute dosimetry of monoenergetic focused x-rays. A study of the focal spot dose rate after passing through a bone-equivalent material was also done to quantify the effects of heterogeneous materials. <jats:italic>Approach.</jats:italic> This was accomplished by configuring a polyenergetic beam of equivalent energy using a clinical orthovoltage machine.

Yet, less is known about its climatic implication in alpine glaciers as the lack of continuous record. Here, we present a long-term δ18Obub record from the Tanggula glacier in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP). It shows that there is a good correlation between the variation of the δ18Obub in this alpine ice core and the accumulation or melting of the glacier. The more developed the firn layer on glacier surface, the more positive the δ18Obub is. The more intense the glacier melting, the more negative the δ18Obub is. Combined with the chronology of the ice core air bubbles, we reconstructed the glacier variations since the late Holocene in the central TP. It showed that there were four accumulation and three deficit periods of glaciers in this region. The strongest glacier accumulation period was from 1610–300 B.C., which corresponding to the Neoglaciation. The most significant melting period was the last 100 years, which corresponding to the recent global warming. During the Little Ice Age, glacier accumulation in the central TP was not significant, and even short deficit events occurred. Comparisons of the late Holocene glacier variation in the central TP with hemispheric glacier and climate variations showed that it was closely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation.\n                        </jats:p>"

The study of photon-dressed states is a central issue in nonlinear optical science, as a coherent response associated with a photon-dressed state can cause ultrafast optical-switching phenomena. In general, however, phase-sensitive dynamics of photon-dressed states are difficult to observe due to their short lifetime. Here, we show that excitation of the organic Mott insulator potassium-tetracyanoquinodimethane with a strong mid-infrared pulse induces a couple of intramolecular vibrations, which add temporally periodic potentials to the electronic system, giving rise to phonon-dressed states in the picosecond time domain. Through sub-cycle spectroscopy using a phase-stable mid-infrared pulse as an excitation and an ultrashort visible pulse as a probe, we observe optical radiation consisting of four kinds of coherent oscillations with double, sum, and differential frequencies of two intramolecular vibrations. The probe-energy dependence of each oscillation can be well interpreted with phonon-dressed states in the framework of Floquet theory. These findings open a possibility for Floquet engineering in correlated electron materials with strong charge–phonon couplings.</jats:p>"

Results indicate that the Saiyong Co basin was a marshy environment with sparse vegetation cover from 21.3 to 6.6 cal. ka BP, before becoming a lake. Highest water level is inferred for 3.9–3.4 cal. ka BP followed by a gradual drying up until 100 years ago. Since then, the lake level has begun to rise again. Pollen spectra are dominated by Artemisia, Poaceae and Cyperaceae, and vegetation changes are mainly reflected by changes in the proportion of these three taxa, especially Artemisia and Cyperaceae. Two major events occurred at 3.9 cal. ka BP and 1.2 cal. ka BP, in response to climate change. Our results also reveal that lake-level changes affect the interpretation of the pollen assemblages due to the relationship between lake size and the pollen source area. Local pollen became the dominant component in pollen assemblages at 0.6 cal. ka BP when the lake level fell to below a certain depth. A higher percentage of Cyperaceae marks the lake’s retreat and reflects the local vegetation around Saiyong Co during 0.6 to ~0.1 cal. ka BP. In the last 100 years, a high value of Cyperaceae is linked to a wetter climate with no obvious evidence for human activities. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages from small lakes as the size of the lake through its history also needs to be known to prevent erroneous interpretations of the pollen data. </jats:p>",

Similar phenomena can occur whenever gradient lengths are comparable to the orbit widths at the top of the pedestal and the loss cone is continuously and increasingly filled by heated particles, collisions and turbulent effects. The lower hybrid heating operator is introduced into the ELMFIRE code to increase the ion temperature during the simulations while keeping the edge temperature low with logical boundary condition at the limiter. Particular focus is given on how the radial electric field deviates from the neoclassical value while introducing turbulent effects.</jats:p>",

The total CEP shift of the synthesized sub-cycle pulse composed of the two spectral components is controlled with simultaneous scans of the two CEPs. The resultant error of the controlled CEP was 642 mrad, so that this technique is useful for searching zero CEP of the synthesized pulse with the maximum field amplitude.

Data analysis was conducted using a modified Health Belief Model framework that included constructs of barriers to action, modifying factors of cue to action and perceived social norms. The findings show that traditional customs and institutional barriers such as low-quality health service delivery, long queues, and distance to the health facilities, immunisation vaccine stockouts and low levels of maternal knowledge influence the choice and decision to engage with maternal immunisation.

Cognitive Functional Therapy is a multidimensional approach for CNSLBP which targets negative cognitions and maladaptive functional behaviors (via body relaxation, control and extinction of protective and safety behaviors). Since the evidence about the efficacy of CFT is still limited, it is important to perform clinical trials with the aim of comparing CFT with other interventions commonly used in clinical practice of physiotherapy. The current study will investigate the efficacy of Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) compared to combined Core Training exercise and manual therapy (CORE-MT) on pain and disability in patients with CNSLBP. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Two-group, randomized controlled trial with blinded assessors. We will recruit 148 patients with CNSLBP in a private clinic in the city of Campinas, Brazil. The experimental group will receive five one-hour individualized sessions of CFT within a period of two months. The control group will receive five one-hour individualized sessions of CORE-MT within a period of two months. Patients will be assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention and after six and twelve months. The primary outcomes will be pain intensity and disability two months after first intervention session; secondary outcomes will be pain intensity and disability at six and twelve months, as well as global perceived effect and patient satisfaction at two, six and twelve months after the first intervention session.

The overdeepening was formed by repeated glacial advance-retreat cycles of the Rhine Glacier throughout the Middle to Late Pleistocene. A seismic survey of Lake Constance revealed a Quaternary sediment fill of more than 150 m thickness representing at least the last glacial cycle. The stratified sedimentary fill consists at the base of ice-contact deposits on top of the molasse bedrock, overlain by glaciolacustrine to lacustrine sediments. During the successful field test of a newly developed, mid-size coring system (&amp;quot;HIPERCORIG&amp;quot;), the longest core (HIBO19) ever taken in Lake Constance was retrieved with an overall length of 24 m. The sediments recovered consist of a nearly continuous succession of lacustrine silts and sands including more than 12 m of Late Glacial sediment at the base. 14 lithotypes were identified through petrophysical and geochemical analyses. In combination with a &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;14&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C- and OSL-based age-depth model, the core was divided into three main chronostratigraphic units. The basal age of ~13.7 ka BP dates the base of the succession back to the B&amp;amp;#248;lling-Aller&amp;amp;#248;d interstadial, with overlying strata representing a complete and thick Younger-Dryas to Holocene succession. The sediments offer a high-resolution insight into the evolution of paleo-Lake Constance from a cold, postglacial to a more productive, warm Holocene lake. The Late Glacial succession is dominated by massive, m-thick sand beds reflecting episodic sedimentation pulses. They are most likely linked to a subaquatic channel system originating in the river Seefelder Aach, which is, despite the Holocene drape, still apparent in today's lake bathymetry. The overlying Holocene succession reveals a prominent, several cm-thick, double-turbiditic event layer representing the most distal impact of the Flimser Bergsturz, the largest known rockslide of the Alps that occurred over 100 km upstream the river Rhine at ~9.5 ka BP. Furthermore, lithologic variations in the Holocene succession document the varying sediment loads of the river Rhine and the endogenic production representing a multitude of environmental changes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

These minicircles are 183 bp in length, constitute six individual single‐stranded DNAs that are ligated to realize duplex interlocking, and adopt temporary base pairing of single strands for interlocking. To probe the DNA‐protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on DNAs with different topologies such as free linear duplex or duplex constrained inside origami and free or topologically‐interlocked minicircles. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were resistant to restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA, such as flexibility, curvature, and groove orientation, play a major role in DNA‐protein interactions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A single horizontal distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber is notoriously challenging for microseismic analysis even when it is close to recorded events. Due to its uniaxial measurement, locations suffer from circular ambiguity. Nonetheless, in unconventional plays, the presence of dispersive guided waves in the DAS records can partially resolve such ambiguity. If the reservoir has lower seismic velocities than its surrounding medium, it can act as a waveguide. In this case, guided waves are generated only by microseismic events occurring inside or close to the reservoir, and their propagation is confined to the reservoir. We first train a machine learning model for microseismic event detection using a unique data set of almost 7000 manually picked events and an equal number of noise windows. Applying the trained model to 10 stimulation stages from two offset wells yields more than 100,000 event detections, with a higher sensitivity than manual labeling. Detected events undergo a localization procedure based on the dispersion properties of guided waves, estimated in-situ from known perforation shots. Location results allow us to reconstruct the spatio-temporal pattern of fracture development. We observe a dominant fracture propagation direction for all stages, which indicates the effect of the regional stress in the reservoir. We qualitatively validate the direction and extent of the fracture growth by perforation shot analysis. We have found the first application of microseismic event location with a single straight fiber, which is considered impossible without a waveguide structure. </jats:p>",

Thus, a method for nonspecific, sensitive, and rapid enrichment of such bacteria is essential for bacteria detection and treatment. This study demonstrates a self-made core-shell Fe3O4@Polydopamine@Polyethyleneimine magnetic beads (Fe3O4@PDA@PEI MBs) with a high density positive charge-based magnetic separation scheme for the broad-spectrum rapid enrichment of microorganisms in the liquid phase. MBs with a high-density positive charge have a strong electrostatic attraction to most microorganisms in nature.

The as-prepared Fe3O4@PDA@PEI MBs composite was carefully characterized by zeta potential analysis, Value stream-mapping (VSM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transforms infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). In this study, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria could be captured in three minutes through electrostatic interaction.

The effects of illumination quality and intensity on the growth and morphogenesis of many plant species have been examined, but improvements are needed to optimize the illumination systems for better plant products with lower resource investments. In particular, new strategies are needed to reduce the wastage of plant products related to leaf senescence, and to better control the ingredients and appearance of leafy vegetables. Although the quality of light is often altered to change the characteristics of plant products, the transcriptional status underlying the physiological responses of plants to light has not been established. Herein, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing to determine how red, blue, and red/blue LEDs and fluorescent light sources affect transcriptome involved in the leaf aging of leaf lettuce. The RNA-sequencing profiling revealed clear differences in the transcriptome between young and old leaves. Red LED light caused large variation between the two age classes, while a pure or mixed blue LED light spectrum induced fewer transcriptome differences between young and old leaves. Collectively, the expression levels of genes that showed homology with those of other model organisms provide a detailed physiological overview, incorporating such characteristics as the senescence, nutrient deficiency, and anthocyanin synthesis of the leaf lettuce plants. Our findings suggest that transcriptome profiles of leaf lettuce grown under different light sources provide helpful information to achieve better growth conditions for marketable and efficient green-vegetable production, with improved wastage control and efficient nutrient inputs.</jats:p>"

This study develops an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based regional ocean data assimilation system, in which the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is implemented with the Stony Brook Parallel Ocean Model (sbPOM) version 1.0 to assimilate satellite and in-situ observations at a daily frequency. A series of sensitivity experiments are performed with various settings of the incremental analysis update (IAU) and covariance inflation methods, for which the relaxation-to-prior perturbations and spread (RTPP and RTPS, respectively) and multiplicative inflation (MULT) are considered. We evaluate the geostrophic balance and the analysis accuracy compared with the control experiment in which the IAU and covariance inflation are not applied. The results show that the IAU improves the geostrophic balance, degrades the accuracy, and reduces the ensemble spread, and that the RTPP and RTPS have the opposite effect. The experiment using the combination of the IAU and RTPP results in significant improvement for both balance and accuracy when the RTPP parameter is 0.8–0.9. The combination of the IAU and RTPS improves the balance when the RTPS parameter is ≤ 0.8 and increases the accuracy for the parameter values between 1.0 and 1.1, but the balance and accuracy are not improved significantly at the same time. The experiments with MULT do not demonstrate sufficient skill in maintaining the balance and reproducing the surface flow field regardless of whether the IAU is applied or not. Therefore, the combination of the IAU and RTPP with the parameter of 0.8–0.9 is found to be the best setting for the EnKF-based ocean data assimilation system.\n                        </jats:p>"

A key structure in episodic memory is the hippocampal formation and the dentate gyrus in particular, as the continuous production of new dentate granule neurons in this brain region was found to play a crucial role in memory and age-related decline in memory. As such, understanding the molecular processes that regulate the relationship between adult neurogenesis and aging of memory function holds great therapeutic potential. Recently, we found that Vang-Gogh like 2 (Vangl2), a core component of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, is enriched in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. In this context, we sought to evaluate the involvement of this member of the Wnt/PCP pathway in both adult neurogenesis and memory abilities in adult and middle-aged mice. Using a heterozygous mouse model carrying a dominant-negative mutation in the Vangl2 gene, called Looptail (Vangl2<jats:sup>Lp</jats:sup>), we show that alteration in Vangl2 expression decreases the survival of adult-born granule cells and advances the onset of a decrease in cognitive flexibility. The inability of mutant mice to erase old irrelevant information to the benefit of new relevant ones highlights a key role of Vangl2 in interference-based forgetting. Taken together, our findings show that Vangl2 activity may constitute an interesting target to prevent age-related decline in hippocampal plasticity and memory.</jats:p>"

      "container-title": [],
      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Gas isotope thermometry using the isotopes of molecular nitrogen and argon has been used extensively to reconstruct past surface temperature change from Greenland ice cores. The gas isotope ratios δ15N and δ40Ar in the ice core are each set by the amount of gravitational and thermal fractionation in the firn. The gravitational component of fractionation is proportional to the firn thickness and the thermal component is proportional to the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the firn column, which can be related to surface temperature change. Compared to Greenland, Antarctic climate change is typically more gradual and smaller in magnitude, which results in smaller thermal fractionation signals that are harder to detect. This has hampered application of gas isotope thermometry to Antarctic ice cores. Here, we present an analytical method for measuring δ15N and δ40Ar with a precision of 0.002 ‰ per atomic mass unit, a two-fold improvement on previous work. This allows us to reconstruct changes in firn thickness and temperature difference at South Pole between 30 and 5 kyr BP. We find that variability in firn thickness is controlled in part by changes in snow accumulation rate, which is, in turn, influenced strongly by the along-flowline topography upstream of the ice core site. Variability in our firn temperature difference record cannot be explained by annual-mean processes. We therefore propose that the ice core gas isotopes contain a seasonal bias due to rectification of seasonal signals in the upper firn. The strength of the rectification also appears to be linked to fluctuations in the upstream topography. As further evidence for the existence of rectification, we present new data from the Dome Fuji ice core that are also consistent with a seasonal bias throughout the Holocene. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of ice core gas records. For example, we show that the effects of upstream topography on ice core records can be significant at flank sites like South Pole—they are responsible for some of the largest signals in our record. Presumably upstream signals impact other flank-flow ice cores such as EDML, Vostok, and EGRIP similarly. Future work is required to confirm the existence of seasonal rectification in polar firn, determine how spatially and temporally widespread rectifier effects are, and to incorporate the relevant physics into firn air models.\n                        </jats:p>"

By contrast, in the case of BaO/SrO/ZnO/SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> glasses, silver has, in comparison to other noble metals, another significant, yet different effect. It forms metallic particles (hexagonal phase) with plate-like morphology during thermal treatment at 675 °C. In the second step of thermal treatment at 760 °C, this phase most probably expels some metallic Sb, which is oxidized by Sb<jats:sup>V</jats:sup> (present in the surrounding glass phase) to Sb<jats:sup>III</jats:sup>. As a result, the plate-like morphology is maintained and a crystalline shell around the metallic core is formed, mainly consisting of ZnO with some SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and antimony oxide, as proved by scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

One of the challenges in constructing condition-independent coexpression data based on publicly available gene expression data is managing the inherent sampling bias. Here, we report ATTED-II version 11, wherein we adopted a coexpression calculation methodology to balance the samples using principal component analysis and ensemble calculation. This approach has two advantages. First, omitting principal components with low contribution rates reduces the main contributors of noise. Second, balancing large differences in contribution rates enables considering various sample conditions entirely. In addition, based on RNAseq- and microarray-based coexpression data, we provide species-representative, integrated coexpression information to enhance the efficiency of interspecies comparison of the coexpression data. These coexpression data are provided as a standardized z-score to facilitate integrated analysis with different data sources. We believe that with these improvements, ATTED-II is more valuable and powerful for supporting interspecies comparative studies and integrated analyses using heterogeneous data.</jats:p>",

The pH‐responsive performance endows the core–shell nanostructures with size switchable property, with an average diameter of 200 nm in the neutral pH and 60 nm in the acidic microenvironment, which facilitates not only tumor accumulation but also tumor penetration. Moreover, the structure switch of WP5⊃TAPEG under acidic microenvironment and the dual mechanism regulated extending of п conjugate, inclusion in the hydrophobic cavity of WP5 and the dense distribution in the core–shell structured assemblies, dramatically enhance the absorption in the near‐infrared‐II region and, further, the photothermal conversion efficiency (60.2%).

Therefore, the analysis of vector integration sites present in the genomic DNA of circulating cells allows to determine the number of clones in the blood ecosystem. Shannon diversity index is adopted to evaluate the heterogeneity of the transduced population of gene corrected cells. However, this measure can be affected by several technical variables such as the DNA amount used and the sequencing depth of the library analyzed and therefore the comparison across samples may be affected by these confounding factors. We developed an advanced spline-regression approach that leverages on confounding effects to provide a normalized entropy index.

Quantitative explorations at the subject level and fine-scale knowledge in landslide monitoring research can be used to provide information and references for landslide monitoring status analysis and disaster management. In the context of the large amount of network information, it is difficult to clearly determine and display the domain topic hierarchy and knowledge structure. This paper proposes a landslide monitoring knowledge discovery method that combines K-core decomposition and Louvain algorithms. In this method, author keywords are used as nodes to construct a weighted co-occurrence network, and a pruning standard value is defined as K. The K-core approach is used to decompose the network into subgraphs. Combined with the unsupervised Louvain algorithm, subgraphs are divided into different topic communities by setting a modularity change threshold, which is used to establish a topic hierarchy and identify fine-scale knowledge related to landslide monitoring. Based on the Web of Science, a comparative experiment involving the above method and a high-frequency keyword subgraph method for landslide monitoring knowledge discovery is performed. The results show that the run time of the proposed method is significantly less than that of the traditional method.</jats:p>"

A safe and effective vaccine to prevent lethal EEHV infection would significantly improve conservation efforts for this endangered species. Recent studies from our laboratory suggest that EEHV morbidity and mortality are often associated with primary infection. Therefore, we aim to generate a vaccine, particularly for EEHV1 naïve animals, with the goal of preventing lethal EEHV-HD. To address this goal, we generated a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) recombinant virus expressing a truncated form of glycoprotein B (gBΔfur731) from EEHV1A, the strain associated with the majority of lethal EEHV cases. Vaccination of CD-1 mice with this recombinant virus induced robust antibody and polyfunctional T cell responses significantly above mice inoculated with wild-type MVA. Although the vaccine-induced T cell response was mainly observed in CD8<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T cell populations, the CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T cell response was also polyfunctional.

The inflammatory response to LPS was enhanced in compound heterozygous mice <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> and elevated serum interleukin-1β was abrogated by NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition.

It is well known that in 1D, gapped ground states have the split property with respect to cutting the system into left and right half-chains. In 2D, however, the split property fails to hold for interesting models such as Kitaev’s toric code. Here we show that this failure is the reason that anyons can exist in that model. There is a folklore saying that the existence of anyons, like in the toric code model, implies long-range entanglement of the state. In this paper, we prove this folklore in an infinite dimensional setting. More precisely, we show that long-range entanglement, in a way that we will define precisely, is a necessary condition to have non-trivial superselection sectors. Anyons in particular give rise to such non-trivial sectors. States with the split property for cones, on the other hand, do not admit non-trivial sectors. A key technical ingredient of our proof is that under suitable assumptions on locality, the automorphisms generated by local interactions can be “approximately factorized.” That is, they can be written as the tensor product of automorphisms localized in a cone and its complement respectively, followed by an automorphism acting near the “boundary” of<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\\Lambda $$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>Λ</mml:mi></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>, and conjugation with a unitary. This result may be of independent interest. This technique also allows us to prove that the<jats:italic>approximate</jats:italic>split property, a weaker version of the split property that<jats:italic>is</jats:italic>satisfied in e.g. the toric code, is stable under applying such automorphisms.</jats:p>",

We present for the first time a pore-scale micro-CT study of natural hydrate-bearing cores that were acquired from Green Canyon Block 955 in UT-GOM2-1 Expedition and preserved within hydrate pressure–temperature stability conditions throughout sub-sampling and imaging processes. Measured hydrate saturation in the sub-samples, taken from units expected to have in-situ saturation of 80% or more, ranges from 3 ± 1% to 56 ± 11% as interpreted from micro-CT images. Pore-scale observations of gas hydrate in the sub-samples suggest that hydrate in silty sediments at the Gulf of Mexico is pore-invasive rather than particle displacive, and hydrate particles in these natural water-saturated samples are pore-filling with no evidence of grain-coating. Hydrate can form a connected 3D network and provide mechanical support for the sediments even without cementation. The technical breakthrough to directly visualize particle-level hydrate pore habits in natural sediments reported here sheds light on future investigations of pressure- and temperature-sensitive processes including hydrate-bearing sediments, dissolved gases, and other biochemical processes in the deep-sea environment.</jats:p>"

We specifically analyze real-time dynamics of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model after a sudden quench starting from the Mott insulator by means of the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. Calculated single-particle correlation functions are found to be in good agreement with a recent experiment. By estimating the phase and group velocities from the single-particle and density-density correlation functions, we predict how these velocities vary in the moderate interaction region, which serves as a quantitative benchmark for future experiments and numerical simulations.</jats:p>"

Materials and Methods: CT-guided and US-guided CNB of central lung lesions performed between May 2014 and January 2022 were retrospectively analysed at our hospital. Biopsies were performed using 18-G needles with a coaxial system. CT images, histopathology reports, medical records, and procedural details for all patients were reviewed to evaluate the biopsy route, complications, and diagnostic accuracy. According to the imaging equipment used, biopsies were divided into US-guided and CT-guided approaches for comparison. Results: A total of 65 patients, who had undergone 65 CNBs for central lung masses were reviewed. Ultrasound guided biopsies of central lung masses (n=22) were performed safely via a direct pathway. In this group, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 94.4%, 75% and 90.9%, respectively. In the CT guided biopsy group, there were 43 patients and we observed a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 86.1%, 85.7% and 86%. There were statistically significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy and lesion visibility rate among the different biopsy techniques. There was no difference in complication rates between groups. Conclusion: Percutaneous US-guided CNB using a18-G catheter with axial is more efficient technique than CT-guided procedure in the cases of central lung biopsies with atelectasis; however, as this series was small, more data is required.</jats:p>",

The hadronic EOS NL3<jats:italic>ωρ</jats:italic> is obtained by the relativistic mean field theory, while the strange quark matter EOS is calculated by a quasiparticle model that incorporates the nonperturbative features of quantum chromodynamics. In the transition region, we use a polynomial function to interpolate the pressure as a function of the chemical potential.

We find that the presence of strange quark matter at high densities makes the EOS softer.

For a fixed gravitational mass of 1.4<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n\t\t\t\t\t             <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>, the central baryonic number densities for the hybrid EOSs are larger than that for the hadronic EOS, and the radii for the hybrid EOSs are smaller than that for the hadronic EOS. This means that the hybrid stars are more compact than the neutron star, and will have smaller tidal deformabilities than that for the neutron star. The radii for hybrid stars are also consistent with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) analysis of PSR J0030 + 0451 (<jats:inline-formula>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t               <jats:tex-math>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</jats:tex-math>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t               <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:mi>M</mml:mi>\n                        <mml:mo>=</mml:mo>\n                        <mml:mn>1.4</mml:mn>\n                        <mml:msubsup>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mn>4</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>−</mml:mo>\n                              <mml:mn>0.14</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>+</mml:mo>\n                              <mml:mn>0.15</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msubsup>\n                        <mml:msub>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mi>M</mml:mi>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>⊙</mml:mo>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msub>\n                     </mml:math>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t               <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"gac4ea1ieqn1.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t             </jats:inline-formula>, <jats:inline-formula>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t               <jats:tex-math>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</jats:tex-math>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t               <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:mi>R</mml:mi>\n                        <mml:mo>=</mml:mo>\n                        <mml:mn>13.0</mml:mn>\n                        <mml:msubsup>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mn>2</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>−</mml:mo>\n                              <mml:mn>1.06</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                           <mml:mrow>\n                              <mml:mo>+</mml:mo>\n                              <mml:mn>1.24</mml:mn>\n                           </mml:mrow>\n                        </mml:msubsup>\n                     </mml:math>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t               <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"gac4ea1ieqn2.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t             </jats:inline-formula> km) and PSR J0740 + 6620 (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 2.08 ± 0.07<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n\t\t\t\t\t             <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> = 12.35 ± 0.75 km).

By applying %-order biaxial tensile strain to the substrate, a spin reorientation transition from IP to OOP occurs in the free layer, resulting in a drastic change in the shape of the magnetoresistance curve. This change is reversible with increasing and decreasing strain.

The appearance of this kind of defects is quite common in construction practice. The issues of eliminating the causes of such defects, as well as strengthening damaged ceilings, are not the subject of this study. The purpose of the analysis was to identify damage to concrete and damage to the integrity of the slab ribs, which are not always available during visual screening. Existing methods of non-destructive testing with the help of specialized equipment make it possible to determine the strength of concrete as well as the presence of cracks and their configuration in products. The disadvantages of such methods include: high cost of equipment, the necessary level of qualification of specialists using it and the impossibility of its use for mass verification of the integrity of slabs. Therefore, it became necessary to develop a method for detecting defects in prefabricated structures for prompt inspection at the construction site. The proposed method makes it possible to quickly check the presence of significant defects in the construction due to sound audible analysis from strikes by a hammer on the slab. The simplified method of determining the integrity of hollow-core slabs makes it possible to narrow the volume of thorough and time-consuming instrumental studies during a complete inspection of the object, allocating places that need a thorough examination of damaged areas of structures from the total volume of prefabricated slabs of the object. According to the results of the research, it was determined that sound can be divided into three main types that characterize the nature of the structure defect: voiced sound indicates that the structure is not damaged, thud sound - the structure is damaged by near cracks, intermediate sound - the structure has deep cracks, mainly in a vertical rib.</jats:p>",

However, molecular mechanisms by which divergent antisense transcription is regulated have not been detailed. Here, we report a novel ZWC complex composed of ZC3H4, WDR82 and CK2 that suppresses divergent antisense transcription. The ZWC complex preferentially localizes at TSSs of active genes through direct interactions of ZC3H4 and WDR82 subunits with the S5p RNAPII C-terminal domain. ZC3H4 depletion leads to increased divergent antisense transcription, especially at genes that naturally produce divergent antisense transcripts. We further demonstrate that the ZWC complex phosphorylates the previously uncharacterized N-terminal acidic domain of SPT5, a subunit of the transcription-elongation factor DSIF, and that this phosphorylation is responsible for suppressing divergent antisense transcription. Our study provides evidence that the newly identified ZWC-DSIF axis regulates the direction of transcription during the transition from early to productive elongation.</jats:p>",

To evaluate the dynamic properties of sandwich beams, manufactured structures subjected to sine sweep and classic shock tests and assessed both with and without magnetic field of varying intensities applied on the free end of the beam. The experimental results demonstrated good performance in vibration level attenuation, particularly in the structure’s primary vibration mode under consideration. The magnetic field applied was capable of lowering the first natural frequency of the proposed sandwich beam structures. Experiment results showed that an increase in an induced magnetic field shifted the natural frequencies, vibration amplitude, and damping ratio of sandwich panels with MRE honeycomb core.</jats:p>",

Consequently, we evaluated the ameliorative actions of TA (1.0 mg/10 g diet) on rotenone (500 μM)-induced toxicity in Drosophila after 7 days’ exposure. Additionally, we performed molecular docking of TA against selected pro-inflammatory protein targets.

In this paper, using the Pedersen Index we measure electoral volatility in Hungary at the settlement level between the last three parliamentary elections (2010, 2014 and 2018), with special attention to the geographical aspects of the phenomenon. According to our preliminary assumptions those social groups switch their votes frequently who are marginalised, therefore, the level of volatility may reflect peripheriality. Our results show that high volatility can be detected in the two opposite sides of the settlement hierarchy in Hungary: in bigger cities and smaller villages, but for very different reasons. This study gives evidence that electoral volatility can also be considered as a possible indicator in the delimitation and classification of peripheral areas and settlements. The paper aimed to contribute to the understanding of cleavage formation at the regional level by adding a spatial perspective while connecting the socioeconomic profile of the voting population and electoral volatility.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we consider quantum metrology based on symmetry-protected adiabatic transformation. We introduce a ferromagnetic Ising model with a transverse field as a probe and consider the estimation of a longitudinal field. Without the transverse field, the ground state of the probe is given by the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state, and thus the Heisenberg limit estimation of the longitudinal field can be achieved through parity measurement. In our scheme, full information of the longitudinal field encoded on parity is exactly mapped to global magnetization by symmetry-protected adiabatic transformation, and thus the parity measurement can be replaced with global magnetization measurement. Moreover, this scheme requires neither accurate control of individual qubits nor that of interaction strength. We discuss the effects of the finite transverse field and nonadiabatic transitions as imperfection of adiabatic transformation. By taking into account finite time duration for state preparation, sensing, and readout, we also compare performance of the present scheme with a classical scheme in the absence and presence of dephasing.</jats:p>",

However, the extent to which computer modeling and on bench measurements of IOL chromatic aberration translate to chromatic aberration in patients implanted with these multifocal IOLs (MIOLs) is not yet fully understood. In this study, we compare the chromatic difference of focus and longitudinal chromatic aberrations in pseudophakic patients implanted with different IOL designs (monofocal and trifocal IOLs) and materials (hydrophobic and hydrophilic), and compared them with predictions from computer eye models and on bench measurements with the same IOLs. Patient data consisted of results from 63 pseudophakic eyes reported in four different studies and obtained psychophysically in the visual testing channel of a custom-developed polychromatic adaptive optics system. Computational predictions were obtained using ray tracing on computer eye models, and modulation transfer function (MTF) on bench measurements on physical eye models. We found that LCA (in vivo/simulated) for far vision was 1.37 ± 0.08 D/1.19 D for monofocal hydrophobic, 1.21 ± 0.08 D/0.88 D for monofocal hydrophilic, 0.99 ± 0.06 D/1.19 D for MIOL hydrophobic, and 0.82 ± 0.05 D/0.88 D for MIOL hydrophilic. For intermediate and near vision, LCA (in vivo/simulated) was 0.67 ± 0.10 D/0.75 D and 0.23 ± 0.08 D/0.19 D for MIOL hydrophobic and 0.27 ± 0.15 D/0.38 D and 0.15 ± 0.15 D/−0.13 D for MIOL hydrophilic, respectively.

In plants, characterization of 3D digital representations of organs at single-cell resolution represents a promising approach to addressing this problem. A major challenge is to provide organ-centric spatial context to cells of an organ. We developed several general rules for the annotation of cell position and embodied them in 3DCoordX, a user-interactive computer toolbox implemented in the open-source software MorphoGraphX. 3DCoordX enables rapid spatial annotation of cells even in highly curved biological shapes. Using 3DCoordX, we analyzed cellular growth patterns in organs of several species. For example, the data indicated the presence of a basal cell proliferation zone in the ovule primordium of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Proof-of-concept analyses suggested a preferential increase in cell length associated with neck elongation in the archegonium of Marchantia (Marchantia polymorpha) and variations in cell volume linked to central morphogenetic features of a trap of the carnivorous plant Utricularia (Utricularia gibba). Our work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed strategies as they provide organ-centric spatial context to cellular features in plant organs of diverse shape complexity.</jats:p>",

To protect cells against oxidative stress, cells have evolved a strong antioxidant defense system to either prevent RONS formation or scavenge them. The maintenance of the redox balance ensures signal transduction, development, cell proliferation, regulation of the mechanisms of cell death, among others. Oxidative stress can beneficially be used to treat several diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, heart disease, cancer, and other diseases by regulating the antioxidant system. Understanding the mechanisms of various endogenous antioxidant systems can increase the therapeutic efficacy of oxidative stress-based therapies, leading to clinical success in medical treatment. This review deals with the recent novel findings of various cellular endogenous antioxidant responses behind oxidative stress, highlighting their implication in various human diseases, such as ulcers, skin pathologies, oncology, and viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Poly(betulin disuccinate-co-sebacic acid) microspheres were prepared using a solvent evaporation technique from copolymers obtained by polycondensation of betulin disuccinate (DBB) and sebacic acid (SEB). The content of sebacic acid in the copolymers was 20, 40, 60 and 80 wt%, respectively. Small and large rifampicin-loaded microspheres were obtained for each of the copolymers. The initial amount of drug was 10, 30 or 50 wt%, based on the weight of the polymer. Particles obtained in this study were round in shape with diameter in the range of 2–21 μm and of orange to red colour originating from rifampicin. The RIF encapsulation efficacy varied from 7% to 33%. Drug loading varied from 2% to 13% and increased at a higher RIF ratio. The highest degree of drug loading was observed for large particles, in which the initial amount of drug (at the particle preparation stage) was 50 wt%. Microspheres prepared from betulin-based polyanhydrides may have significant applications in drug delivery systems. The concentration of loaded drug was enough to obtain bactericidal effects against reference S. Aureus ATCC 25923 bacteria.</jats:p>"

This model assumes that there is a spring-type imperfectness at interfaces between the piezoelectric core and the face materials, both in the normal and tangential directions, and the core layer is poling in various directions. A mathematical model is created for the current problem, and then the finite element method (FEM) is used to solve it. Further, attention is focused on the influence of the mentioned imperfectness and the poling directions on the frequency response of plate-strip, in addition to the effects of the most important parameters on this response. The results show that as the imperfectness at the interface planes has the greatest effect on the horizontal polarization of the piezoelectric core, the mentioned polling direction inhibits the resonance mode of the system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Preeclampsia (PE) generally manifests in the second half of pregnancy with hypertension and proteinuria. The understanding of the origin and mechanism behind PE is incomplete, although there is clearly an immune component to this disorder. The placenta constitutes a complicated immune interface between fetal and maternal cells, where regulation and tolerance are key. Stress factors from placental dysfunction in PE are released to the maternal circulation evoking the maternal response. Several complement factors play a role within this intricate landscape, including C1q in vascular remodeling and Factor H (FH) as the key regulator of alternative pathway complement activation. We hypothesize that decreased levels of C1q or FH, or disturbance of their function by autoantibodies, may be associated with PE. Autoantibodies against C1q and FH and the concentrations of C1q and FH were measured by ELISA in maternal sera from women with preeclamptic and normal pregnancies. Samples originated from cohorts collected in the Netherlands (n=63 PE; n=174 control pregnancies, n=51 nonpregnant), Finland (n=181 PE; n=63 control pregnancies) and Norway (n=59 PE; n=27 control pregnancies). Serum C1q and FH concentrations were higher in control pregnancy than in nonpregnant women. No significant differences were observed for serum C1q between preeclamptic and control pregnancy in any of the three cohorts. Serum levels of FH were lower in preeclamptic pregnancies compared to control pregnancies in two of the cohorts, this effect was driven by the early onset PE cases. Neither anti-C1q autoantibodies nor anti-FH autoantibodies levels differed between women with PE and normal pregnancies. In conclusion, levels of anti-C1q and anti-FH autoantibodies are not increased in PE. C1q and FH are increased in pregnancy, but importantly, a decrease in FH concentration is associated with PE.</jats:p>"

Recent lipidomic analysis has indicated changes in serum lipidome profiles, especially in regard to specific phosphatidylcholines, associated with obesity. However, little work has evaluated murine hepatic liver lipidomic profiles nor compared these profiles across age, high-fat diet, or specific genotypes, in this case the lack of hepatic Cyp2b enzymes. In this study, the effects of age (9 months old), high-fat diet (4.5 months old), and the loss of three primarily hepatic xeno- and endobiotic metabolizing cytochrome P450 (Cyp) enzymes, Cyp2b9, Cyp2b10, and Cyp2b13 (Cyp2b-null mice), on the male murine hepatic lipidome were compared. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis show that age perturbs hepatic phospholipid profiles and serum lipid markers the most compared to young mice, followed by a high-fat diet and then loss of Cyp2b. Several lipid biomarkers such as PC/PE ratios, PE 38 : 6, and LPC concentrations indicate greater potential for NAFLD and hypertension with mixed effects in Cyp2b-null mice(less NAFLD and greater hypertension-associated markers). Lipid profiles from older mice contain greater total and n-6 fatty acids than normal diet (ND)-fed young mice; however, surprisingly, young Cyp2b-null mice contain high n-6 : n-3 ratios. Overall, the lack of Cyp2b typically enhanced adverse physiological parameters observed in the older (9 mo) mice with increased weight gain combined with a deteriorating cholesterol profile, but not necessarily all phospholipid profiles were adversely perturbed.</jats:p>",

RNA‐binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a well‐studied IDP that induces LLPS since its low‐complexity core region (FUS‐LC‐core) is essential for droplet formation through contacts between FUS‐LC‐cores. Several experimental studies have reported that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations modulate LLPS‐driven droplet formation through the dissolution of FUS. To elucidate the role of ATP in this dissolution, microsecond‐order all‐atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for a crowded system of FUS‐LC‐cores in the presence of multiple ATP molecules. Our analysis revealed that the adenine group of ATP frequently contacted the FUS‐LC‐core, and the phosphoric acid group of ATP was exposed to the external solvent, which promoted both hydration and solubilization of FUS.</jats:p>",

Benefiting from the specific interactions between asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptors and the galactose moiety, the PADGal@PCMSt NPs can deliver HCPT with the highest efficiency to HepG2 cells in comparison with the human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), the human alveolar adenocarcinoma basal epithelial cells (A549), the mouse breast cancer cells (4T1), and the mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3).

The finite element method is used to discuss and analyze the sensing performance of the RI sensor. Gold is used as the excitation material for surface plasmon resonance, and a gold nanoring is embedded around the first cladding of the PCF. The liquid analytes penetrate the outermost layer of the cladding, and the central hole is filled with liquid crystal E7. Complete coupling and incomplete coupling are excited as the analyte RI increases, and the resonance strength of complete coupling is stronger than that of incomplete coupling. It can be proved by calculation that at different wavelengths, resonant coupling of fifth-order and sixth-order surface plasmon polaritons is obtained. The RI of liquid analytes ranges from 1.405 to 1.445. The diameters of the liquid crystal cores are 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 µm; their average sensitivities are 10700, 10566, 10167, and 9166 nm/RIU; and the linear fitting constants are 0.98025, 0.97387, 0.96597, and 0.95507, respectively. In short, the RI sensor has the advantages of tunability, wide range, and high sensitivity, and is expected to be applied in various fields.</jats:p>",

We demonstrate here that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)–dependent modification of p53 enables rapid recruitment of p53 to damage sites, where it in turn directs early repair pathway selection. Specifically, p53-mediated recruitment of 53BP1 at early time points promotes nonhomologous end joining over the more error-prone microhomology end-joining. Similarly, p53 directs nucleotide excision repair by mediating DDB1 recruitment. This property of p53 also correlates with tumor suppression in vivo. Our study provides mechanistic insight into how certain transcriptionally deficient p53 mutants may retain tumor-suppressive functions through regulating the DNA damage response.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, housing quality index (H.Q.I) for the entire sample was evaluated and the housing quality indexes results were found to be below average (fair) using a five-point Likert scale, starting from very bad (rated as 1), fair (rated as 3) to very good (rated as 5) to calculate the total weighted values of all rated attributes and means values of rated attributes in the study area. Surveyed results have shown significant deterioration in quality of dwellings components in the core area, due to age of buildings and lack of maintenance. The study concluded that there is an urgent need to replace the bad dwellings components, build new structures, provides basic amenities like electricity, pipe-borne water, roads/drainages and to refurbish the existing ones to ensure that the residents do not lack all these amenities.</jats:p>"

By utilizing colloidal CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots, gated by intense THz pulses, a proof of concept of an all‐optical femtosecond electro‐absorption switch is presented in this work. Without any additional enhancement of the THz electric field, an extinction contrast of more than 6 dB and transmission changes in the visible of more than 15% are achieved, with the latter setting a new record for solution‐processed electro‐absorption materials at room temperature. The absence of physical artifacts, originating from electrodes and field enhancing structures, allows to employ a simple and intuitive numerical model, which rationalizes the large field‐induced electro‐absorption response. Supported by theoretical calculations, the importance of the energy band alignment of heterostructure quantum dots are discussed for the first time and suggest that further improvement of the modulation depth and contrast may be achieved with Type‐II quantum dots.</jats:p>",

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 facilities in the highest quartile of cirrhosis care to specify the successful implementation strategies and their mechanisms of change.

However, the proximate mechanisms of MR on these physiological benefits have not been fully elucidated. The essential amino acid methionine plays numerous biological roles and limiting its availability in the diet directly modulates methionine metabolism. There is growing evidence that redox regulation of methionine has regulatory control on some aspects of cellular function but interactions with MR remain largely unexplored. We tested the functional role of the ubiquitously expressed methionine repair enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) on the metabolic benefits of MR in mice. MsrA catalytically reduces both free and protein-bound oxidized methionine, thus playing a key role in its redox state. We tested the extent to which MsrA is required for metabolic effects of MR in adult mice using mice lacking MsrA. As expected, MR in control mice reduced body weight, altered body composition, and improved glucose metabolism. Interestingly, lack of MsrA did not impair the metabolic effects of MR on these outcomes. Moreover, females had blunted MR responses regardless of MsrA status compared to males. Overall, our data suggests that MsrA is not required for the metabolic benefits of MR in adult mice.</jats:p>"

The overdeepening was formed by repeated glacial advance-retreat cycles of the Rhine Glacier throughout the Middle to Late Pleistocene. A seismic survey of Lake Constance revealed a Quaternary sediment fill of more than 150 m thickness representing at least the last glacial cycle. The stratified sedimentary fill consists at the base of ice-contact deposits on top of the molasse bedrock, overlain by glaciolacustrine to lacustrine sediments. During the successful field test of a newly developed, mid-size coring system (\"HIPERCORIG\"), the longest core (HIBO19) ever taken in Lake Constance was retrieved with an overall length of 24 m. The sediments recovered consist of a nearly continuous succession of lacustrine silts and sands including more than 12 m of Late Glacial sediment at the base. 14 lithotypes were identified through petrophysical and geochemical analyses. In combination with a <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C- and OSL-based age-depth model, the core was divided into three main chronostratigraphic units. The basal age of ~ 13.7 ka BP dates the base of the succession back to the Bølling-Allerød interstadial, with overlying strata representing a complete and thick Younger-Dryas to Holocene succession. The sediments offer a high-resolution insight into the evolution of paleo-Lake Constance from a cold, postglacial to a more productive and warmer Holocene lake. The Late Glacial succession is dominated by massive, m-thick sand beds reflecting episodic sedimentation pulses. They are most likely linked to a subaquatic channel system originating in the river Seefelder Aach, which is, despite the Holocene drape, still apparent in today’s lake bathymetry. The overlying Holocene succession reveals a prominent, several cm-thick, double-turbiditic event layer representing the most distal impact of the Flimser Bergsturz, the largest known rockslide of the Alps that occurred over 100 km upstream the river Rhine at ~ 9.5 ka BP. Furthermore, lithologic variations in the Holocene succession document the varying sediment loads of the river Rhine and the endogenic production representing a multitude of environmental changes.</jats:p>",

However, existing haptic actuators have some hurdles such as single mode, poor compatibility, or incomplete tactile information. In this study, we proposed a novel way to generate haptic feedback by designing a soft electro-hydraulic pneumatic actuator (SEHPA) with dual drive modes. The SEHPA was structured with silicone films, a silicone air chamber, flexible electrodes, and an insulating liquid dielectric for good human–machine compatibility. The SEHPA had the advantages of high output force (1.5 N at 10 kPa) and displacement (4.5 mm at 5 kPa), as well as various haptic notifications (0~400 Hz vibration). The electro-hydraulic drive method realized smooth output force changes at the millinewton level (0~40 mN) and output displacement changes at the micron level (0~800 μm), which further enriched the details of the tactile experience. In addition, the self-sensing capability of the SEHPA can be dedicated to monitoring and ensuring precise output. The SEHPAs can be potentially mounted on the fingertips to provide accurate tactile sensation once the manipulator touches an object through teleoperation. More invisible information can also be obtained by customizing various haptic notifications. The excellent response behavior and accurate tactile haptic feedback demonstrate the candidate for teleoperation fields.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The basic premise of deep in situ fluidized mining is to study the in situ stress state of deep rocks, and coring is one of the basic physical means. However, core discing often occurs in the process of coring. And core discing is one of the symbols of high in situ stress in deep engineering area, and revealing the mechanical response of core stub under different conditions is an important premise to explore the formation mechanism of core discing. Therefore, the effects of in situ stress combination condition, core diameter, and drilling depth on the maximum tensile stress after core stub unloading are discussed by PFC2D discrete element numerical simulation method, and the formation mechanism of core discing is preliminarily explored based on strain energy and dissipated energy. Research shows that in situ stress combination is the most dominant factor of core discing. When the hydrostatic stress increases from 40 MPa to 80 MPa, the maximum tensile stress at the core stub increases by 98.42%. When the horizontal stress is 60 MPa and the axial stress increases from 40 MPa to 100 MPa, the maximum tensile stress at the core stub increases by 53.33%. However, when the axial stress is 60 MPa and the horizontal stress increases from 40 MPa to 80 MPa, the maximum tensile stress at the core stub first increases and then decreases, and there is an inflection point when the horizontal stress is 75 MPa. When the core diameter increases from 8.00 mm to 13.00 mm, the maximum tensile stress at the core stub increases by 1.58 times. When the drilling depth increases from 3.00 cm to 4.00 cm, the maximum tensile stress at the core stub increases by 4.01 times; that is, small diameter cores and cores with large drilling depth are more prone to core discing. The total energy of the system increases with the increase of in situ stress. When the hydrostatic pressure is 80 MPa, the dissipated energy of the system is 2.80 times greater than that when the hydrostatic pressure is 40 MPa. More energy must be dissipated when the core discing occurs under higher in situ stress conditions. It is preliminarily proved that the formation mechanism of core discing is that the tensile cracks extend and penetrate at the core stub, and the core is pulled off to form a core disc, which is reciprocating to produce core discing. The research results are expected to provide a certain reference for understanding the formation mechanism of core discing and provide useful ideas for the related research of discing phenomenon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Humans race drones faster than neural networks trained for end-to-end autonomous flight. This may be related to the ability of human pilots to select task-relevant visual information effectively. This work investigates whether neural networks capable of imitating human eye gaze behavior and attention can improve neural networks’ performance for the challenging task of vision-based autonomous drone racing. We hypothesize that gaze-based attention prediction can be an efficient mechanism for visual information selection and decision making in a simulator-based drone racing task. We test this hypothesis using eye gaze and flight trajectory data from 18 human drone pilots to train a visual attention prediction model. We then use this visual attention prediction model to train an end-to-end controller for vision-based autonomous drone racing using imitation learning. We compare the drone racing performance of the attention-prediction controller to those using raw image inputs and image-based abstractions (i.e., feature tracks). Comparing success rates for completing a challenging race track by autonomous flight, our results show that the attention-prediction based controller (88% success rate) outperforms the RGB-image (61% success rate) and feature-tracks (55% success rate) controller baselines. Furthermore, visual attention-prediction and feature-track based models showed better generalization performance than image-based models when evaluated on hold-out reference trajectories. Our results demonstrate that human visual attention prediction improves the performance of autonomous vision-based drone racing agents and provides an essential step towards vision-based, fast, and agile autonomous flight that eventually can reach and even exceed human performances.</jats:p>"

In the polarity/protrusion model of VD growth cone guidance away from ventrally expressed UNC-6 (repulsion), UNC-6 first polarizes the growth cone via the UNC-5 receptor such that filopodial protrusions are biased dorsally. UNC-6 then regulates a balance of protrusion in the growth cone based upon this polarity. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion ventrally, and the UNC-6 receptor UNC-40/DCC stimulates protrusion dorsally, resulting in net dorsal growth cone outgrowth. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion through the flavin monooxygenases FMO-1, 4, and 5 and possible actin destabilization, and inhibits pro-protrusive microtubule entry into the growth cone utilizing UNC-33/CRMP. The PH/MyTH4/FERM myosin-like protein was previously shown to act with UNC-5 in VD axon guidance utilizing axon guidance endpoint analysis. Here, we analyzed the effects of MAX-1 on VD growth cone morphology during outgrowth. We found that max-1 mutant growth cones were smaller and less protrusive than wild type, the opposite of the unc-5 mutant phenotype. Furthermore, genetic interactions suggest that MAX-1 might normally inhibit UNC-5 activity, such that in a max-1 mutant growth cone, UNC-5 is overactive. Our results, combined with previous studies suggesting that MAX-1 might regulate UNC-5 levels in the cell or plasma membrane localization, suggest that MAX-1 attenuates UNC-5 signaling by regulating UNC-5 stability or trafficking. Alternately, MAX-1 might inhibit UNC-5 independent of this known mechanism. We also show that the effects of MAX-1 in growth cone protrusion are independent of UNC-40/DCC, UNC-33/CRMP, and UNC-34/Enabled. In summary, in the context of growth cone protrusion, MAX-1 inhibits UNC-5, demonstrating the mechanistic insight that can be gained by analyzing growth cones during outgrowth in addition to axon guidance endpoint analysis.</jats:p>",

The spatial position detection of the flange port of a tank car can guide the automatic docking of the fluid loading and offloading arm and flange port of the tank car. In this paper, a flange position detection method based on image recognition was proposed. Firstly, the end state of the loading arm was analyzed to determine the expression mode of the loading arm’s spatial pose so as to form a unified expression with the flange position and docked pose on the tank car. Then, for the image processing of the flange port of the tank car, this paper binarized the edge of the flange end face based on the Otsu algorithm, used the Canny algorithm for edge detection, used the least squares method to fit the image edge coordinates into a spatial circle, calculated the center coordinates and normal vector of the flange end face, and used these parameters to guide the end of the loading arm to adjust the position and attitude so that it was consistent with the position and pose of the flange port to realize docking. Then, a circular object center detection and calibration experiment, a flange end face image experiment, and an automobile tank car flange port physical detection experiment were carried out. The test results show that the spatial coordinate accuracy of the flange port diameter and center detected by this method meets the requirements of the loading arm automatic docking system, providing a research idea for the design of an automatic docking system for the loading and unloading arm of a tank car.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A new ice core was drilled in West Antarctica on Skytrain Ice Rise in field season 2018 / 2019. This 651 m ice core is one of the main targets of the WACSWAIN (WArm Climate Stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet in the last INterglacial) project. A present-day accumulation rate of 13.5 cm w.e./year was derived. Although the project mainly aims to investigate the last interglacial (115–130 ka BP), a robust chronology period covering the recent past is needed to constrain the age models for the deepest ice. Additionally, this time period is important for understanding current climatic changes in theWest Antarctic region. Here, we present a stratigraphic chronology for the top 184.14 m of the Skytrain ice core covering the last 2000 years based on absolute age tie points interpolated using annual layer counting encompassing the last 2000 years of climate history. Together with a model-based depth-age relationship of the deeper part of the ice core, this will form the ST22 chronology. The chemical composition, dust content, liquid conductivity, water isotope concentration and methane content of the whole core was analysed via continuous flow analysis (CFA) at the British Antarctic Survey. Annual layer counting was performed by manual counting of seasonal variations in mainly the sodium and calcium records. This counted chronology was informed and anchored by absolute age tie points, namely, the tritium peak (1965 CE) and six volcanic eruptions. Methane concentration variations were used to further constrain the counting error. A minimal error of ± 1 year at the tie points was derived, accumulating to ± 5–10 % of the age in the unconstrained sections between tie points. This level of accuracy enables data interpretation on at least decadal timescales and provides a solid base for the dating of deeper ice, which is the second part of the chronology.\n                        </jats:p>"

During 2017–2020, resistance in isolates from urogenital sites of 433 patients was 64.7% (95% CI: 59.5–69.6%; range: 43.9–78.7%) for ciprofloxacin, 50.7% (95% CI: 45.3–56.1%; range: 41.3–70.4%) for tetracycline, and 30.8% (95% CI: 26.3–35.6%; range: 26.7–35.8%) for benzylpenicillin. Percentage of isolates non-susceptible to azithromycin was 4.1% (95% CI: 2.0–7.4%; range: 2.7–4.8%) and all (100%) isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Two (1.6%) isolates from 2019 and one (2.2%) isolate from 2020 had high-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC≥256 mg/L). Overall, 1.0% (4/418) of isolates had a ceftriaxone MIC of 0.25 mg/L, which is at the ceftriaxone susceptibility breakpoint (MIC≤0.25 mg/L). Treatment with ceftriaxone 250 mg plus azithromycin 1 g can continuously be recommended for gonorrhoea therapy in Qatar.

Recently, a cusp-overlap view (COP) implantation technique has been proposed for TAVR with self-expandable valves offering an improved visualization during valve expansion compared to the three-cusp view (TCV). This study aims to systematically analyze procedural outcomes of TAVR patients treated with the CoreValve Evolut valve using a COP compared to TCV in a high-volume center. The primary endpoint was technical success according the 2021 VARC-3 criteria. A total of 122 consecutive patients (61 pts. TCV: April 2019 to November 2020; 61 pts. COP: December 2020 to October 2021) that underwent TAVR with the CoreValve Evolut prosthesis were included in this analysis. Although there was no difference in the primary endpoint technical success between TCV and COP patients (93.4% vs. 90.2%, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.16, 2.4, p = 0.51), we observed a significantly lower risk for permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) among COP patients (TCV: 27.9% vs. COP: 13.1%, OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15, 0.97, p = 0.047).

Here, we provide evidence that cortical projection neurons (CPNs) and striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) are two main and complementary players in the TSHZ3-linked ASD syndrome. In the cerebral cortex, TSHZ3 is expressed in CPNs and in a proportion of GABAergic interneurons, but not in cholinergic interneurons or glial cells. In the striatum, TSHZ3 is expressed in all SCINs, while its expression is absent or partial in the other main brain cholinergic systems.

With the benefit of a RC of the central axis of the RC-FMF, the sensor is more sensitive to curvature compared to other fiber sensors based on ordinary SMF or FMF. Curvature measurement can be achieved by monitoring the wavelength shift of interference dips.

This discovery was achieved as a trigger of foam formation during the microbial PHB fermentation. The purified MVs were existed as a mixture of outer MVs and outer/inner MVs, revealed by transmission electron microscopy. It should be noted that there was a good correlation between MV formation and PHB production level that can be finely controlled by varying glucose concentrations, suggesting the causal relationship in both supramolecules artificially produced in the microbial platform. Notably, the controllable secretion of MV was governed spatiotemporally through the morphological change of the <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> cells caused by the PHB intracellular accumulation. Based on a hypothesis of PHB internal-pressure dependent envelope-disorder induced MV biogenesis, here we propose a new Polymer Intracellular Accumulation-triggered system for MV Production (designated “PIA-MVP”) with presenting a mechanistic model for MV biogenesis. The PIA-MVP is a promising microbial platform that will provides us with a significance for further study focusing on biopolymer capsulation and cross-membrane transportation for different application purposes.\n</jats:p>"

The outbreak of COVID-19 in recent years subjects the fire risks and disaster prevention and mitigation strategies of hospitals to challenges and changes. According to cases of hospital fire in the past, protection of hardware equipment can effectively simplify emergency response actions. Nevertheless, the hardware security of hospital buildings still requires integration with disaster reduction and response management of relevant personnel to prioritize healthcare quality and patient safety, strengthen disaster prevention and mitigation process design, and improve the overall fire safety of a hospital. An accreditation system should be introduced to strengthen a hospital’s fire safety precautions, conduct thorough inspections, and develop strategies meeting specific needs.

The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the environment metallicities of Type Ib and Ic SNe tend to higher metallicity than Type IIP, however Type Ic are also present at lower metallicities whereas Type Ib are not. The Type Ib frequency distribution is narrower (standard deviation ∼0.06 dex) than the Ic and IIP distributions (∼0.15 dex) giving some evidence for a significant fraction of single massive progenitor stars; the low metallicity of Type Ic suggests a significant fraction of compact binary progenitors. However, both the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Anderson–Darling test indicate no statistical significance for a difference in the local metallicities of the three SN types. Monte Carlo simulations reveal a strong sensitivity of these tests to the uncertainties of the derived metallicities. Given the uncertainties of the strong emission methods, the applicability of the tests seems limited. We extended our analysis with the data of the Type Ib/Ic/IIP SN sample from Galbany et al. The CDFs created with their sample confirm our CDFs very well. The statistical tests, combining our sample and the Galbany et al. sample, indicate a significant difference between Type Ib and Type IIP with &amp;lt;5 per cent probability that they are drawn from the same parent population.</jats:p>",

This work disassembles the vertical magnetic field of each group of poloidal field windings and calculates the field decay index (n-index) at different radial positions. It is found that the instability growth time τg of horizontal displacement increases as the equilibrium radial position of plasma moves outward, which is beneficial to the position control. The simulation and experiments verified the effect of equilibrium position on horizontal instability. The equilibrium position slightly outward from the geometric center of the vacuum chamber effectively decreases the horizontal displacement oscillation amplitude and guarantees the controllable horizontal displacement.</jats:p>",

However, it remains significantly challenging to simultaneously capture a sufficient volume of sweat and achieve stable contact between electrodes and sweat, especially in a relatively mild sweating condition. Herein, a wearable electrochemical fabric sensor is developed by embroidering diversified sensing yarns with a multi‐ply cotton sheath and carbon nanotube‐based sensing fiber core into a super‐hydrophobic fabric substrate. The device allows for sweat enrichment among the core–sheath sensing yarn and reduce ineffective diffusion, thus remarkably increasing the sweat capture efficiency.

The device also maintains a highly durable sensing performance, obtained even during dynamic deformation processes such as bending, twisting, and shaking.

Previous studies have shown that repetitive short‐pulse (rSP) illumination selectively induces PSI photoinhibition. Depending on the growth light intensity or the variety/species of the plant, PSI photoinhibition is different, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we aimed to clarify whether the differences in the susceptibility of PSI to photoinhibition depend on environmental factors or on rice varieties and which physiological properties of the plant are related to this susceptibility. We exposed mature leaves of rice plants to rSP illumination. We examined the effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration and low N during growth on the susceptibility of PSI to photoinhibition and compared it in 12 different varieties. We fitted the decrease in the quantum yield of PSI during rSP illumination and estimated a parameter indicating susceptibility. Low N level increased susceptibility, whereas elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration did not. The susceptibility differed among different rice varieties, and many <jats:italic>indica</jats:italic> varieties showed higher susceptibility than the <jats:italic>temperate japonica</jats:italic> varieties. Susceptibility was negatively correlated with the total chlorophyll content and N content. However, the decrease in  value, an indicator of damaged PSI, was positively correlated with chlorophyll content. This suggests that in leaves with a larger electron transport capacity, the overall PSI activity may be less susceptible to photoinhibition, but more damaged PSI may accumulate during rSP illumination.</jats:p>",

This study analyzes the housing satisfaction of residents in the core area of Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. The study adopted a mixed-method that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. The study specifically investigated the socio-economic characteristics of the residents (income, type of buildings, and ages of buildings), their source of water and source of power supply, land-use conversion, and conditions of social amenities in the core areas and resident’s level of satisfaction indices. An empirical research was explored for use, multiple sampling techniques was used to select 357 cases from a frame of 4,981 respondents who supplied information through the questionnaire instrument administered to three wards. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the set -data collected. Data processed was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 and Microsoft excel. Analysis of data was discussed using frequency count and distribution, presented through the use of tables, figures, and percentages. Measurements of weight were attached to an element, hence used for the analysis. Based on the research findings, monthly income, type of building, and age of buildings determine the level of housing satisfaction. Ease access to public transport, proximity to work, and affordability determine resident satisfaction in the core city. The research recommends that, the government should develop strategies that will improve the condition of social amenities with a low relatively index of satisfaction. Public and private participation/partnership (PPP) in maintaining existing facilities and collaboration with the Benin Electricity Distribution Company to enhance stable power supply is advocated.</jats:p>",

However, in this study, bees were exposed to relatively high glyphosate concentrations. Here, we chronically exposed newly emerged honey bees to imidacloprid, glyphosate and difenoconazole, individually and in a ternary mixture, at an environmental concentration of 0.1 µg/L. We studied the effects of these exposures on the establishment of the gut microbiota, the physiological status, the longevity, and food consumption of the host. The core bacterial species were not affected by the exposure to the three pesticides. Negative effects were observed but they were restricted to few transient non-core bacterial species. However, in the absence of the core microbiota, the pesticides induced physiological disruption by directly altering the detoxification system, the antioxidant defenses, and the metabolism of the host. Our study indicates that even mild exposure to pesticides can directly alter the physiological homeostasis of newly emerged honey bees and particularly if the individuals exhibit a dysbiosis (i.e. mostly lack the core microbiota). This highlights the importance of an early establishment of a healthy gut bacterial community to strengthen the natural defenses of the honey bee against xenobiotic stressors.</jats:p>"

The line laser is used as both the excitation light for the fluorescence and the scanning light line for the 3D profiling. At each scanning step, the system collects both fluorescent and 3D spatial data of the irradiated line region, which are fused to 4D data points based on a line mapping relationship between the datasets, and by scanning across the measurement object, a complete 4D dataset is obtained. The FDHI shows excellent performance with spatial and spectral resolution of 26.0 µm and 3 nm, respectively. The reported FDHI system and its applications provide a solution for 4D detection and analysis of fluorescent objects in meters measurement range, with advantage of high integration as two imaging modules sharing a same laser source.</jats:p>",

We applied the cFS to the development of telescope control software for the observation of the 2017 total solar eclipse. Four main modules were developed: imaging control, mechanism control, data handling, and automated observation. Other modules, such as communication and scheduler, were reused from the cFS. Using an integrated observation system, we successfully observed the total solar eclipse, in which the linearly polarized brightness of the solar corona and sky background were measured at four different wavelengths. In this study, we demonstrated the usefulness of the cFS to develop telescope control software through an eclipse observation system, the so-called DICE (DIagnostic Coronagraph Experiment) mission. Our experience and knowledge of the cFS were expanded to a flight software BITSE (Balloon-borne Investigation of Temperature and Speed of Electrons in the corona), the high-altitude scientific balloon mission in 2019. We plan to apply this approach to future solar coronagraph observations, such as CODEX (COronal Diagnostic EXperiment), on the International Space Station. We expect that the cFS can also be applied in telescope control software for ground-and space-based observations.</jats:p>",

However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools are suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein‐coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine‐based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM−Hs) and 1,2‐ethylenediamine (TZM−Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM−Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM−Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2‐ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM−Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential in rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.</jats:p>",

Various well-validated mechanisms for methane combustion are adopted and compared with experimental data. Ignition delay, laminar flame speed, and emissions for CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> combustion with steam dilution are discussed. Cumulative relative error parameter was determined for all mechanisms considered in this study to evaluate the prediction level in quantifiable terms. Reaction pathways under no and steam-diluted environments are analyzed, and key elementary reactions and species are identified in these conditions. The analysis gives a relative idea of the applicability of some of the reduced mechanisms for the diluted steam conditions. This study aims to guide future computational fluid dynamics simulations to accurately predict combustion characteristics in these conditions. Computations of laminar flame speed from GRI-3.0, Aramco3.0, Curran, and San Diego mechanisms were the most precise under diluted steam conditions. Similarly, for the calculation of ignition delay of methane under the steam dilution, the Aramco mechanism and the Curran’s mechanism were able to predict the experimentally observed values most closely. Sensitivity study for the OH concentrations shows that the H-abstraction of methane from OH radicals has an opposing trend with dilution for Aramco and GRI-3.0 mechanism. On the other hand, CO and NO emissions were reduced significantly, with the dilution increased from 0 to 20%. The third-body effect of steam is observed to dominate the deviation observed between the detailed and reduced mechanism. For low operating pressure conditions, the GRI-3.0 mechanism gives an excellent prediction, whereas, for applications like gas turbines and furnaces, Aramco-3.0 and Curran mechanisms can be adopted to give good results. The San Diego mechanism can be chosen for low computational facility purposes as it shows very good predictions for ignition delay and laminar flame speed computations.</jats:p>"

Whisk-broom scanning is useful for acquiring a spatial measurement using a pixel-based hyperspectral sensor. However, when it is applied to outdoor cultural heritages, temporal illumination variations become an issue due to the lengthy measurement time. As a result, the incoming illumination spectra vary across the measured image locations because different locations are measured at different times. To overcome this problem, in addition to the standard raster scan, we propose an additional perpendicular scan that traverses the raster scan. We show that this additional scan allows us to infer the illumination variations over the raster scan. Furthermore, the sparse structure in the illumination spectrum is exploited to robustly eliminate these variations. We quantitatively show that a hyperspectral image captured under sunlight is indeed affected by temporal illumination variations, that a Naïve mitigation method suffers from severe artifacts, and that the proposed method can robustly eliminate the illumination variations. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by capturing historic stained-glass windows of a French cathedral.</jats:p>",

Besides the role of charge storage centers, SiGeSn QDs have the advantage of a low thermal budget for formation, because Sn presence decreases crystallization temperature, while Si ensures higher thermal stability. In this paper, we prepare MOS capacitors based on 3-layer stacks of gate HfO2/floating gate of SiGeSn QDs in HfO2/tunnel HfO2/p-Si obtained by magnetron sputtering deposition followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) for nanocrystallization. Crystalline structure, morphology, and composition studies by cross-section transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction correlated with Raman spectroscopy and C–V measurements are carried out for understanding RTA temperature effects on charge storage behavior. 3-layer morphology and Sn content trends with RTA temperature are explained by the strongly temperature-dependent Sn segregation and diffusion processes. We show that the memory properties measured on Al/3-layer stack/p-Si/Al capacitors are controlled by SiGeSn-related trapping states (deep electronic levels) and low-ordering clusters for RTA at 325–450 °C, and by crystalline SiGeSn QDs for 520 and 530 °C RTA. Specific to the structures annealed at 520 and 530 °C is the formation of two kinds of crystalline SiGeSn QDs, i.e., QDs with low Sn content (2 at.%) that are positioned inside the floating gate, and QDs with high Sn content (up to 12.5 at.%) located at the interface of floating gate with adjacent HfO2 layers. The presence of Sn in the SiGe intermediate layer decreases the SiGe crystallization temperature and induces the easier crystallization of the diamond structure in comparison with 3-layer stacks with Ge-HfO2 intermediate layer. High frequency-independent memory windows of 3–4 V and stored electron densities of 1–2 × 1013 electrons/cm2 are achieved.</jats:p>"

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS), one of the most common causes of low back pain, is defined as the displacement of a vertebral body over the lower vertebral body with degenerative changes and the absence of fracture or defect in the vertebral ring. This disease is a common and frequently occurring disease. Currently, there are many clinical treatment methods, but there is no specific method, and most of them have the characteristics of slow effect and easy recurrence. Objective. The objective of this study is to summarize and analyze the effects of treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis by Tongdu Bushen acupuncture, intradermal acupuncture, and moxibustion integrated therapy combined with core muscle training program (CMT) on the improvement of pain degree and dysfunction index, as well as the gait characteristics. Methods. 120 patients with DLS will be recruited and randomly divided into two groups using electroacupuncture combined with the CMT group as the control group. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Japanese Orthopedic Association score (JOA) will be used for evaluation. The spatiotemporal and kinematics parameters in gait analysis, as well as the ability of lumbar muscle contraction, fatigue resistance, relaxation, and coordination of lumbar muscle in surface electromyography (sEMG), will be used as objective observation indexes to observe the effectiveness of Tongdu Bushen acupuncture, intradermal acupuncture, and moxibustion integrated therapy combined with CMT. Discussion. Tongdu Bushen acupuncture, intradermal acupuncture, and moxibustion integrated therapy is a traditional Chinese medicine treatment for DLS. Our results will provide evidence to determine whether the integrated therapy can effectively treat DLS, as well as its advantages and safety, and lay a foundation for further research.

The complex ecosystem in cancer that promotes cell survival and the factors that eventually overcome growth constraints and result in proliferation remain to be fully elucidated. Doing so may provide new insights and help identify novel strategies to prolong cancer dormancy and prevent disease recurrence. To dissect the molecular pathways and the microenvironments involved in regulation of dormancy, we utilized a novel immunocompetent transgenic model to study minimal residual disease and relapse. This model revealed a significant reorganization of cancer cell structures, stroma, and immune cells, with cancer cells showing dormant cell signatures. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered remodeling of myeloid and lymphoid compartments. In addition, the Jagged-1/Notch signaling pathway was shown to regulate many aspects of tumorigenesis, including stem cell development, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and immune cell homeostasis during minimal residual disease. Treatment with an anti–Jagged-1 antibody inhibited the Jagged-1/Notch signaling pathway in tumor cells and the microenvironment, delaying tumor recurrence. These findings uncover a cascade of regulatory changes in the microenvironment during dormancy and identify a therapeutic strategy to undercut these changes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals dormancy-associated changes in immune and stromal cells and demonstrates a rationale to pursue Jagged-1/Notch pathway inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy to reduce disease recurrence.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

It is shown that by imposing spiral phase plates (SPPs) on the incident vectorial beams, single three-dimensional (3D) super-resolved (<jats:italic>λ</jats:italic><jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/22) MVC can be achieved in the 4π focusing setup, which is radically different from that produced with a single lens focusing. Furthermore, the light-induced MVC texture turns to be richer and more complex when the radially polarized beams are tailored by the SPPs and judiciously designed multi-ring filters all together. In this case, we are able to garner not only transverse super-resolved (0.447<jats:italic>λ</jats:italic>) MVC needle with an uniformly extended area (40λ) in the single lens focusing system, but also the multiple uniform 3D super-resolved (<jats:italic>λ</jats:italic><jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/24) chain-like MVC cells in the 4π focusing system, thus giving rise to the tunable and scalable super-resolved MVC extension. The related physical mechanisms to trigger such peculiar magnetization polarization topologies are unraveled as well. These resultant achievements would pave the way for the integrated transfer and storage of optomagnetic information, atomic trapping, and beyond.</jats:p>",

Such a framework should ideally integrate risk assessment and decision-making. The framework presented in this paper specifically addresses the needs and expectations in the wider socio-economic and environmental context, as well as a narrower human health context. The framework was demonstrated as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s second Modelling and Data for Radiological Impact Assessments Programme. Three case studies, which have used or could use this integrative approach, are used for illustration. The first concerns remediation from uranium mining activities at Beaverlodge Lake in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, engaging stakeholders (also called ‘interested parties’) in the decision-making process on further options. The second case study suggests how decision analysis could support the selection of the best option for waste disposal for uranium ore processing at Žirovski vrh, Slovenia, taking into account a potential landslide and migration of waste throughout the adjacent valley in the event of flooding. The third case study presents the process and results of radiological safety assessment of the Kepkensberg sludge basin in Tessenderlo area, Belgium both before and after the disposal of material from remediation of the nearby Winterbeek River. It illustrates how such assessments could interface with decision analysis for the purpose of supporting the regulatory decisions related to future approval of a waste disposal option. Results show that formal stakeholder engagement in decision analysis provides a strong contribution to objective, robust, and transparent decision-making not only for radiation protection area but also in others where health and environmental impacts are of concern. A number of recommendations for future work have also been made.</jats:p>",

For the sensing system of Cu@C@ZIF-8, ZIF-8 with proper pore size allows nitrite diffuse through the shell, while big molecules cannot, which ensures high selectivity of the sensor. On the other hand, Cu@C as electrocatalyst promotes the oxidation of nitrite, thereby resulting high sensitivity of the sensor. Accordingly, the Cu@C@ZIF-8 based sensor presents excellent performance for nitrite detection, which achieves a wide linear response range of 0.1–300.0 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>M, and a low limit of detection of 0.033 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>M.

It is, therefore, necessary to construct a complete avian genome and analyze its evolution. We constructed a chicken pan-genome from 20 de novo assembled genomes with high sequencing depth, and identified 1,335 protein-coding genes and 3,011 long noncoding RNAs not found in GRCg6a. The majority of these novel genes were detected across most individuals of the examined transcriptomes but were seldomly measured in each of the DNA sequencing data regardless of Illumina or PacBio technology. Furthermore, different from previous pan-genome models, most of these novel genes were overrepresented on chromosomal subtelomeric regions and microchromosomes, surrounded by extremely high proportions of tandem repeats, which strongly blocks DNA sequencing. These hidden genes were proved to be shared by all chicken genomes, included many housekeeping genes, and enriched in immune pathways. Comparative genomics revealed the novel genes had 3-fold elevated substitution rates than known ones, updating the knowledge about evolutionary rates in birds. Our study provides a framework for constructing a better chicken genome, which will contribute toward the understanding of avian evolution and the improvement of poultry breeding.</jats:p>",

A total of 41 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with PH, NN, BN, and DI in two or more environments. Among these SNPs, 15 were located in regions in which plant architecture-related QTLs had been reported in previous studies, and 26 were new genetic loci.

To evaluate the vaccine efficacy of the mutant, ducklings were inoculated orally or intranasally with PMZ2 or PBS twice and subsequently subjected to a lethal challenge. Compared with the PBS control, PMZ2 immunization stimulated significantly elevated serum IgG, bile IgA and tracheal IgA responses, especially after the boost immunization in both the oral and intranasal groups, and the induced serum had significant bactericidal effects against the wild-type strain. Furthermore, the two PMZ2 immunization groups exhibited alleviated tissue lesions and significantly decreased bacterial loads in the blood and organs compared with the PBS group post-challenge.

Here, we show that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which reemerges in astrocytes in a restricted time frame, is essential for these functions. Although mGluR5 is absent in healthy adult astrocytes, it transiently reemerges in astrocytes of the somatosensory cortex (S1). During a limited spatiotemporal time frame, astrocytic mGluR5 drives Ca2+ signals; upregulates multiple synaptogenic molecules such as Thrombospondin-1, Glypican-4, and Hevin; causes excess excitatory synaptogenesis; and produces persistent alteration of S1 neuronal activity, leading to mechanical allodynia. All of these events were abolished by the astrocyte-specific deletion of mGluR5. Astrocytes dynamically control synaptic plasticity by turning on and off a single molecule, mGluR5, which defines subsequent persistent brain functions, especially under pathological conditions.</jats:p>",

Most CAFs shape the TME toward an immunosuppressive milieu and attenuate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the detailed mechanism of how heterogeneous CAFs regulate tumor response to ICB therapy has not been defined. Here, we show that a recently defined CAF subset characterized by the expression of Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, is associated with survival and favorable therapeutic response to ICB monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prevalence of Meflin-positive CAFs was positively correlated with CD4-positive T-cell infiltration and vascularization within non-small cell lung cancer tumors. Meflin deficiency and CAF-specific Meflin overexpression resulted in defective and enhanced ICB therapy responses in syngeneic tumors in mice, respectively. These findings suggest the presence of a CAF subset that promotes ICB therapy efficacy, which adds to our understanding of CAF functions and heterogeneity.</jats:p>",

We hypothesized that imagining an image would activate a neural representation during its perception even while watching a conflicting image. To test this hypothesis, we developed a closed-loop system to show images inferred from electrocorticograms using a visual semantic space. The successful control of the feedback images demonstrated that the semantic vector inferred from electrocorticograms became closer to the vector of the imagined category, even while watching images from different categories. Moreover, modulation of the inferred vectors by mental imagery depended asymmetrically on the perceived and imagined categories. Shared neural representation between mental imagery and perception was still activated by the imagery under semantically conflicting perceptions depending on the semantic category.</jats:p>"

The red Duroc and Yorkshire porcine breeds are common large animal models for studying dermal wounds due to their structural similarities to human skin; however, the porcine transcriptomic profiles of dermal burn wounds and healing process are not well known. In response, a longitudinal transcriptomic comparative study was conducted comparing red Duroc and Yorkshire superficial and DPT burn wounds to their respective control uninjured tissue. Using next-generation RNA sequencing, total RNAs were isolated from burn wound tissue harvested on 0, 3, 7, 15, 30, and 60 days postburn, and mRNA-seq and gene expression read counts were generated. Significant differentially expressed genes relative to uninjured tissue were defined, and active biological processes were determined using gene set enrichment analyses. Additionally, collagen deposition, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) protein concentration, epidermal and dermal thickness measurements, and wound area changes in response to burn injury were characterized. Overall, the red Duroc pigs, in response to both burn wound types, elicited a more robust and prolonged inflammatory immune response, fibroblast migration, and proliferation, as well as heightened levels of extracellular matrix modulation relative to respective burn types in the Yorkshire pigs. Collectively, the red Duroc DPT burn wounds produce a greater degree of hypertrophic scar-like response compared with Yorkshire DPT burn wounds. These findings will facilitate future porcine burn studies down-selecting treatment targets and determining the effects of novel therapeutic strategies.</jats:p>",

Healthcare workers (HWs), the main actors of the health system, are at higher risk because of their occupation. Serology-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HWs represent a measure of HWs’ exposure to the virus and could be used as a guide to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and valuable in combating COVID-19. This information is currently lacking in Ethiopia and other African countries.

From consenting HWs, blood samples were collected between December 2020 and February 2021, the period between the two peaks of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaire-based interviews.

Of 1997 HWs who provided a blood sample, and demographic and clinical data, 51.7% were females, 74.0% had no symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and 29.0% had a history of contact with suspected or confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall seroprevalence was 39.6%. The lowest (24.5%) and the highest (48.0%) seroprevalence rates were found in Hiwot Fana Specialized Hospital in Harar and ALERT Hospital in Addis Ababa, respectively. Of the 821 seropositive HWs, 224(27.3%) of them had a history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 while 436 (&gt; 53%) of them had no contact with COVID-19 cases as well as no history of COVID-19 like symptoms.

COS development projects should carefully consider: scope (how the COS should be used), stakeholders involved in development (including patients as both research partners and participants), and consensus methodologies used (typically a Delphi survey and consensus meeting), as well as dissemination plans. Developing COS for neuro-oncology is potentially challenging due to extensive tumor subclassification (including molecular stratification), different symptoms related to anatomical tumor location, and variation in treatment options. Development of a COS specific to tumor subtype, in a specific location, for a particular intervention may be too narrow and would be unlikely to be used. Equally, a COS that is applicable across a wider area of neuro-oncology may be too broad and therefore lack specificity. This review describes why and how a COS may be developed, and discusses challenges for their development, specific to neuro-oncology. The COS under development are briefly described, including: adult glioma, incidental/untreated meningioma, meningioma requiring intervention, and adverse events from surgical intervention for pediatric brain tumors.</jats:p>",

Herein, we describe an integrated proteomic and transcriptomic surfaceome profiling approach to identify cell-surface proteins that are highly expressed in osteosarcoma but minimally expressed on normal tissues. Using this approach, we identified targets that are highly expressed in osteosarcoma. Three targets, MT1-MMP, CD276, and MRC2, were validated as overexpressed in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we tested BT1769, an MT1-MMP–targeted Bicycle toxin conjugate, in osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft models. The results showed that BT1769 had encouraging antitumor activity, high affinity for its target, and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. This confirms the hypothesis that our approach identifies novel targets with significant therapeutic potential in osteosarcoma.</jats:p>",

BH4 is synthesized from guanosine triphosphate and regenerated by <jats:italic>quinonoid</jats:italic> dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR), which catalyzes the reduction of <jats:italic>quinonoid</jats:italic> dihydrobiopterin. We analyzed <jats:italic>Qdpr</jats:italic><jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice to elucidate the physiological significance of the regeneration of BH4. We found that the <jats:italic>Qdpr</jats:italic><jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice exhibited mild hyperphenylalaninemia and monoamine deficiency in the brain, despite the presence of substantial amounts of BH4 in the liver and brain. Hyperphenylalaninemia was ameliorated by exogenously administered BH4, and dietary phenylalanine restriction was effective for restoring the decreased monoamine contents in the brain of the <jats:italic>Qdpr</jats:italic><jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice, suggesting that monoamine deficiency was caused by the secondary effect of hyperphenylalaninemia. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that QDPR was primarily distributed in oligodendrocytes but hardly detectable in monoaminergic neurons in the brain. Finally, we performed a behavioral assessment using a test battery. The <jats:italic>Qdpr</jats:italic><jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup> mice exhibited enhanced fear responses after electrical foot shock. Taken together, our data suggest that the perturbation of BH4 metabolism should affect brain monoamine levels through alterations in peripheral amino acid metabolism, and might contribute to the development of anxiety‐related psychiatric disorders.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jnc15600-fig-0008-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Cover Image for this issue:</jats:bold> <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15398\">https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15398</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec>",

The study accordingly aimed to investigate the learning domains and the core contents of FMC in Taiwan, based on a mixed method design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Methods: For the qualitative content analysis of Phase One, 15 physicians and five medical students from five medical centers (two in northern Taiwan, one in central, one in southern, and one in eastern Taiwan) were invited to participate in an in-depth interview with three physicians and one medical student among the interviewees requested to join a focus group to collect data concerning their opinions about the goal, learning domains, and curriculum contents of FMC and their expectations and suggestions. For the quantity analysis of Phase Two, 27 professors of family medicine from seven medical schools were invited to complete an expert questionnaire on topics and contents of family medicine clerkship. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) were used to evaluate the importance of the topics and contents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Results: Based on the results of qualitative content analysis, six learning domains and 18 curriculum contents were constructed. The learning domains included family practice, illness, behavior science, preventive medicine, community medicine, and long-term care. For quantity analysis, AHP found all the six learning domains important as their weighted scores exceeded 0.1. From FDM, the core contents of the six learning domains were respectively family practice, emergency referral, patientcentered care, preventive medicine, community medicine, and functional assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The study used a mixed method design to construct the FMC training framework. 6 learning domains and 18 core contents are proposed and the results can be expected to provide medical schools with a reference for developing suitable syllabi meeting their individual needs and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n                    </jats:p>",

SN 2019ape is a SN Ic that exploded in the main body of a typical elliptical galaxy. Its properties are consistent with an explosion of a regular SN Ic progenitor. A secondary <jats:italic>g</jats:italic>-band light-curve peak could indicate interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). An H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>-emitting source at the explosion site suggests a residual local star formation origin. SN 2018fsh and SN 2020uik are SNe II which exploded in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies. SN 2020uik shows typical spectra for SNe II, while SN 2018fsh shows a boxy nebular H<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> profile, a signature of CSM interaction. We combine these 3 SNe with 7 events from the literature and analyze their hosts as a sample.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers, with a high level of liver metastasis. Primary PDAC is highly hypoxic, and metastases are resistant to first-line treatment, including gemcitabine. Recent studies have indicated that endothelial cell (EC) focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulates DNA-damaging therapy–induced angiocrine factors and chemosensitivity in primary tumor models. Here, we show that inducible loss of EC-FAK in both orthotopic and spontaneous mouse models of PDAC is not sufficient to affect primary tumor growth but reduces liver and lung metastasis load and improves survival rates in gemcitabine-treated, but not untreated, mice. EC-FAK loss did not affect primary tumor angiogenesis, tumor blood vessel leakage, or early events in metastasis, including the numbers of circulating tumor cells, tumor cell homing, or metastatic seeding. Phosphoproteomics analysis showed a downregulation of the MAPK, RAF, and PAK signaling pathways in gemcitabine-treated FAK-depleted ECs compared with gemcitabine-treated wild-type ECs. Moreover, low levels of EC-FAK correlated with increased survival and reduced relapse in gemcitabine-treated patients with PDAC, supporting the clinical relevance of these findings. Altogether, we have identified a new role of EC-FAK in regulating PDAC metastasis upon gemcitabine treatment that impacts outcome.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>These findings establish the potential utility of combinatorial endothelial cell FAK targeting together with gemcitabine in future clinical applications to control metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

We performed quantitative mass spectrometry–based interactome studies to identify 48 novel LRRK2 interactors, including the microtubule-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM1 (tripartite motif family 1). TRIM1 recruits LRRK2 to the microtubule cytoskeleton for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by binding LRRK2911–919, a nine amino acid segment within a flexible interdomain region (LRRK2853–981), which we designate the “regulatory loop” (RL). Phosphorylation of LRRK2 Ser910/Ser935 within LRRK2 RL influences LRRK2’s association with cytoplasmic 14-3-3 versus microtubule-bound TRIM1. Association with TRIM1 modulates LRRK2’s interaction with Rab29 and prevents upregulation of LRRK2 kinase activity by Rab29 in an E3-ligase–dependent manner. Finally, TRIM1 rescues neurite outgrowth deficits caused by PD-driving mutant LRRK2 G2019S. Our data suggest that TRIM1 is a critical regulator of LRRK2, controlling its degradation, localization, binding partners, kinase activity, and cytotoxicity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mitochondria possess their own genome that encodes components of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, and mitochondrial ribosomes within the organelle translate the mRNAs expressed from the mitochondrial genome. Given the differential OXPHOS activity observed in diverse cell types, cell growth conditions, and other circumstances, cellular heterogeneity in mitochondrial translation can be expected. Although individual protein products translated in mitochondria have been monitored, the lack of techniques that address the variation in overall mitochondrial protein synthesis in cell populations poses analytic challenges. Here, we adapted mitochondrial-specific fluorescent noncanonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT) for use with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and developed mito-FUNCAT-FACS. The click chemistry-compatible methionine analog L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) enabled the metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins. In the presence of cytosolic translation inhibitors, HPG was selectively incorporated into mitochondrial nascent proteins and conjugated to fluorophores via the click reaction (mito-FUNCAT). The application of in situ mito-FUNCAT to flow cytometry allowed us to separate changes in net mitochondrial translation activity from those of the organelle mass and detect variations in mitochondrial translation in cancer cells. Our approach provides a useful methodology for examining mitochondrial protein synthesis in individual cells.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Radio mini-haloes are poorly understood, moderately extended diffuse radio sources that trace the presence of magnetic fields and relativistic electrons on scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs, predominantly in relaxed clusters. With relatively few confirmed detections to-date, many questions remain unanswered. This paper presents new radio observations of the galaxy cluster MS 1455.0+2232 performed with MeerKAT (covering the frequency range 872−1712 MHz) and LOFAR (covering 120−168 MHz), the first results from a homogeneously selected mini-halo census. We find that this mini-halo extends for ∼590 kpc at 1283 MHz, significantly larger than previously believed, and has a flatter spectral index (α = −0.97 ± 0.05) than typically expected. Our X-ray analysis clearly reveals a large-scale (254 kpc) sloshing spiral in the intracluster medium. We perform a point-to-point analysis, finding a tight single correlation between radio and X-ray surface brightness with a super-linear slope of $b_{\\rm 1283\\, MHz} = 1.16^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and $b_{\\rm 145\\, MHz} = 1.15^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$; this indicates a strong link between the thermal and non-thermal components of the intracluster medium. Conversely, in the spectral index/X-ray surface brightness plane, we find that regions inside and outside the sloshing spiral follow different correlations. We find compelling evidence for multiple sub-components in this mini-halo for the first time. While both the turbulent (re-)acceleration and hadronic scenarios are able to explain some observed properties of the mini-halo in MS 1455.0+2232, neither scenario is able to account for all the evidence presented by our analysis.</jats:p>",
