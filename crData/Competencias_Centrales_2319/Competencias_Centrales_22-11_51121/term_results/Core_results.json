      "abstract": "<p>Extract parallelism from programs is growing important as the number of cores of processors is increasing. Parallelization usually involves splitting a sequential thread, and schedule the split code to run on multiple cores. E.g. Some previous Speculative Multi-Threading research used code block reordering to automatically parallelize a sequential thread on multi-core processors. Although the parallelized code blocks can run on different cores, there may still be some data dependences among them. Therefore such parallelization will introduce data dependences among the cores where the code blocks run, which should be resolved alongside the execution by cross-core data sync. Cross-core data sync is usually expensive. This paper proposes to minimize the cross-core data sync with core affinity aware code block scheduling. Our work is based on an Speculative Multi-Threading (SpMT) approach with code block reordering. We improve it by implementing an affinity aware block scheduling algorithm. We built a simulator to model the SpMT architecture, and conducted experiments with SPEC2006 benchmarks. The data shows that plenty of cross-core data sync could be reduced (e.g. Up to 28.7% for gromacs) by the affinity aware block scheduling. For inter-core register sync delay of 5 cycles, this may suggest 3.73% increase in performance.</p>"

These systems also are ancient (they are shared by a wide range of other animals), sharply limited, unconscious, automatically activated, and dependent on our limited attentional resources. Here the author suggests that these properties collectively form a natural kind: a cognitive system with some of these properties will likely have all of them. Notably, a cognitive system shared by diverse, distantly related animals will gain a primordial blessing of abstraction: For example, the core place system will represent only the abstract geometric properties that apply to all the environments of the navigating animals that possess it, including terrestrial rats, flying birds, and aquatic fish. In the coming chapters, the author uses these arguments to propose three more systems of core knowledge.</jats:p>",

Children learn these things even in cultures in which people rarely speak to them until they can speak competently themselves. Their learning far outpaces that of their household pets, who inhabit the same environment. Since core knowledge is shared by infants and animals alike, these observations suggest that some uniquely human talent or penchant carries children beyond core knowledge. Here the author hypothesizes that a new learning process emerges at the end of the first year, as infants use their growing knowledge of language to gain new insights into their own and others’ mental states. Infants come to view people as social agents whose mental states are both phenomenal and intentional, and who engage with one another so as to share their actions and their experiences of things and events. By sharing with other people, construed as social agents, children may gain a uniquely human capacity for fast and flexible learning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Core strengthening exercises have been integrated into the conditioning regimens of sportsmen of all levels. Despite a wealth of evidence, the question of what influence core stability exercises have on jump performance remains unsolved. Only a small percentage of studies have explored effects of standalone core training. The objective of this research was to explore acute changes in countermovement jump (CMJ) performance caused by post-activation potentiation (PAP) adopting core activation exercises. 25 male recreational athletes were recruited as participants. They visited on three occasions-first for familiarisation, following for baseline data using a conventional warmup, and final for repeat data upon inducing PAP. Isometric dynamometer was used to quantify core isometric strength and CMJ variables were evaluated using a Portable performance analysis system with MARS Software. Paired t-test and multivariate analysis were carried out. All core strength metrics reported marked increase at <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.001 from conventional to PAP warmup. Following CMJ metrics varied significantly: jump height from take-off (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.001), jump height from flight (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.01), flight time (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.01,) and force at free-fall (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.001). Core training with PAP is a form of neuromuscular training that has the potential to improve power, agility, and speed by modifying force absorption, active joint stabilisation, and improved movement patterns. These alterations are ascribed to changes in cerebral drive, as well as enhanced motor-unit activation and firing frequency at the muscle level. Before a competition, a core activation warm-up can offer a unique training stimulus and increase performance via an ergogenic response. The core is essential for optimal athletic performance and should not be overlooked.</jats:p>",

Here, we study cross-shaped Mie resonators based on quadrupole modes, whose optical response is almost independent of the variations in period and incidence angle.

Herein, we present a facile technique to generate surfactant-free core–shell droplets with an aqueous core in a microfluidic device. We demonstrate that the geometry of the core–shell droplets can be precisely adjusted by the flow rates of the droplet components. As the shell is polymerized after the formation of the core–shell droplets, the resulting solid microparticles ensure the encapsulation of the aqueous core and prevent undesired release. We then study experimentally and theoretically the behaviour of resultant microparticles under heating and compression. The microparticles demonstrate excellent stability under both thermal and mechanical loads. We show that the rupture force can be quantitatively predicted from the shell thickness relative to the outer shell radius. Experimental results and theoretical predictions confirm that the rupture force scales directly with the shell thickness.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The core-mantle boundary (CMB) heat flux is an important variable of Earth's thermal evolution and dynamics. Seismic tomography enables access to seismic heterogeneities in the lower mantle, which can be related to present-day thermal heterogeneities. Alternatively, mantle convection models can be used to either infer the past CMB heat flux or to produce statistically realistic CMB heat flux distributions in self-consistent models. Mantle dynamics modifies the inertia tensor of the Earth, which implies a rotation of the Earth with respect to its rotation axis called True Polar Wander (TPW). This rotation has to be taken into account if mantle dynamics is to be linked to core dynamics. In this study, we explore the TPW and the CMB heat flux produced by a self-consistent mantle convection model. The geoid is also computed and investigated in order to determine the driving mechanism of TPW. This model includes continents, dense chemical piles at the bottom of the shell and plate-like behavior, providing the possibility to link TPW and the CMB heat flux with plate tectonics. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the CMB heat flux is computed to obtain the dominant heat flux patterns. The model shows a geoid dominated by upper mantle structures. Subduction zones and continents are correlated with positive geoid anomalies, about 20 times larger than the observed geoid anomalies. Chemical piles are mostly correlated with negative geoid anomalies because of the anti-correlation between the positions of subducting slabs and the piles. TPW thus tends to lock continents and subduction zones close to the equator, while chemical piles are shifted towards higher latitudes. The positive CMB heat flux anomalies are mostly located at low latitudes because of the equatorial slabs. The dominant heat flux patterns obtained by the PCA largely reflect the supercontinent cycle captured by the model, providing CMB heat flux patterns representative of the supercontinent formation and dispersal.\n                        </jats:p>"

It is considered that a part of the inner core surface where iron in the fluid outer core is precipitated may be melted and formed a mushy region, but its position is not well understood seismologically. We recently analyzed seismic waveforms observed at the antipodal station of the seismic source and showed that there are precursors to reflections beneath the inner core boundary from deeper in the inner core. It has been found that this precursory wave can be modeled as a reflection under the liquid/solid interface at a depth of 100 km below the inner core boundary. Here, we use these precursor waves observed at the antipodal station (&gt; 179°). The sensitivity kernel for the shear wave velocity structure on the inner core surface was calculated by the adjoint method, using theoretical seismic waveforms. The location of the fluid region was identified using this kernel. Our results show two regions of the inner core surface where the shear wave velocity is close to zero. These results may provide seismological evidence to the origin of the earth's magnetic field.</jats:p>"

First, the chapter draws on the lessons from all the previous chapters to lay out (i) the criteria for future-proof science, (ii) the core argument behind these criteria, and (iii) a workable strategy for actually identifying future-proof science. The book can be seen as building on the ‘externalist’ suggestion put forward by Oreskes (2019) that the best strategy is to use certain tools to critically assess the status of the scientific consensus, as a proxy for evaluating the entire wealth of first-order evidence from a large number of different perspectives. The shift from ‘internal’ evidence to ‘external’ evidence supports calls for adjustments to science education in our schools, with greater emphasis on teaching the ‘external’, second-order, or ‘sociological’ evidence for scientific claims. Second, this chapter raises some possible, outstanding objections, and provides preliminary responses.</jats:p>",

The one major addition was ensuring the survival of the emperor. To achieve these strategic goals, Rome maintained a military force of unprecedented size and capability. It also developed a systemic strategic plan that allowed Rome to conserve troops through the employment of extensive fortifications along its thousands of miles of frontiers. Finally, it placed its legions in locations where they were logistically supportable—able to support one another, to guard the frontiers, and to take advantage of rivers and seas to rapidly move huge concentrations of forces to any threatened point in the Empire.</jats:p>",

We aimed to construct a model that predicts LNM and prognosis using preoperative factors such as myometrial invasion (MI), enlarged lymph nodes (LNs), histological grade determined by endometrial biopsy, and serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) level using two independent cohorts consisting of 254 EC patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the constructed model was 0.80 regardless of the machine learning techniques. Enlarged LNs and higher serum CA125 levels were more significant in patients with low-grade EC (LGEC) and LNM than in patients without LNM, whereas deep MI and higher CA125 levels were more significant in patients with high-grade EC (HGEC) and LNM than in patients without LNM. The predictive performance of LNM in the HGEC group was higher than that in the LGEC group (AUC = 0.84 and 0.75, respectively). Patients in the group without postoperative pathological LNM and positive LNM prediction had significantly worse relapse-free and overall survival than patients with negative LNM prediction (log-rank test, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). This study showed that preoperative clinicopathological factors can predict LNM with high precision and detect patients with poor prognoses.

Here the author focuses on research probing the shape properties by which infants categorize objects and learn their functions. She suggests that infants are endowed with core knowledge of the abstract forms and functions shared by all living kinds. Equipped with this knowledge, infants are prepared to learn about the forms and functions of the particular living kinds that surround them, through cautious exploration and observation of other people’s actions. These learning processes also allow infants living in industrialized cultures to begin learning about the forms and functions of factory-produced artifacts, but core knowledge captures these objects poorly. Learning about artifacts begins to accelerate later in childhood.</jats:p>",

The gratings consist of the repetition of supercells having a mixed-order sampled grating in which 1st-order gratings surround a 2nd-order grating. The experimental results showed that the diffraction angles of the laser beams are quite diverse depending on the supercell structures. We demonstrate that the interval of the diffraction angle (θ) of the laser beams is inversely proportional to the length of the supercell experimentally and theoretically. By tuning the length of supercells as well as the length of 1st-order and 2nd-order regions, the interval θ was tuned from 0.1° to 43° with the different arc emission patterns. With the reduction of θ, i.e., the longer 1st-order region, a significant decrease in the laser threshold was obtained, resulting in the lowest lasing threshold of 2.5 ± 0.1 μJ/cm2 with ∼3.5 ns of a long pulse width excitation source.</jats:p>",

Like the object system, the place system builds on perceptual representations of the environment but goes beyond them, bringing knowledge of places that are not in view. The place system also is unitary, early-emerging, present throughout life, and supportive of children’s learning of the geometric structure of their navigable environment. In adults, and children, this system operates automatically and unconsciously, and it calls on the same brain systems and cognitive processes that other animals use when they navigate.

The energy transition is a crucial enabler of sustainable development and climate resilience. Therefore, this study seeks to understand the determinants of solar PV uptake based on a stratified random sample of 130 households on Mahe Island, Seychelles. We applied logistic regression and descriptive statistics to analyze the driving factors of a household decision regarding the adoption of a solar PV system. Results indicated that access to credit and monthly household income influenced the adoption of solar PV systems at the 1% significance level. Independent variables such as gender, age, and education of household heads, including family size that were significant in other studies, were not significant in the current study. Cost-saving (100%), energy security (91.7%), and environmentally friendly perceptions (76.7%), and access to loans (56.7%), were chief among the motivational drivers of the 60 households that had adopted solar PV systems. Whereas, for the non-adopters, the four most essential barriers cited were cheap electricity (82.9%), high initial cost (65.7%), existing loans (52.9%), and long payback time (40.0%). For the communal approach to solar PV systems in Seychelles to be successful, the adoption barriers that occur at the level of households should be considered.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The scope of this study was to investigate the effect of yarn structure and material type on the thermal and mechanical comfort properties of plain knitted fabrics. A new type of elastic core spun yarn which is called tri-core yarn was introduced. The other yarn structures used were single-core/T400, single-core/lycra, dual-core yarn, and ring-spun yarn. The five types of yarn structure were produced with three material types (100% cotton, blended cotton/modal (50/50%), and blended cotton/tencel (50/50%)) at the same yarn count (10 Ne). Knitted fabrics with a single jersey structure were produced from yarn samples. The mechanical comfort properties including fabric modulus and recovery in wale and course directions were measured. Thermal comfort including air permeability, water vapor permeability, thermal conductivity, and thermal absorptivity were also measured. Full factorial analysis was performed on the test results. It was concluded from the factorial analysis that yarn structure, material type, and two-way interaction had a significant influence on mechanical and thermal comfort except for thermal conductivity, the significance of the material type was exactly P = 0.05. It was concluded that knitted fabric produced from tri-core in the case of blended cotton/tencel obtained the better modulus and elastic recovery in both directions in wales and courses that largely improved the mechanical comfort. </jats:p>",

Here, we analyze the dispersion of SPhPs in a multilayer system consisting of a silicon (Si) layer sandwiched between two silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanolayers. We find that SPhPs generated in SiO2 nanolayers couple with guided resonant modes and propagate mainly in the nonabsorbent Si layer for microscale Si thicknesses. This coupling yields an enhancement in thermal conductivity with Si thickness. In contrast, for nanoscale Si thicknesses, evanescent components of SPhPs couple inside the Si layer, resulting in a higher thermal conductivity for thinner Si layers. The transition between these two different coupling phenomena provides the minimum of the in-plane SPhP thermal conductivity at a Si thickness of approximately 1 μm. Our finding brings deeper insight into thermal management in electronics and semiconductors.</jats:p>",

Seventy-nine healthy young adults participated in this study. In a regression analysis, the core muscle endurance time was the dependent variable. The independent variables were the symmetry of frontal core motion (measured using a wireless earbud sensor during walking and cycling), the symmetry of side plank time and of hip abductor strength, the weekly workout time and fast walking and cycling speeds. In the multiple regression analysis, weekly workout time, fast walking speed, symmetry of frontal core motion during fast cycling and symmetry of lateral side plank time predicted core muscle endurance (adjusted R2 = 0.42). Thus, clinicians and fitness personnel should consider the association of core muscle endurance with the symmetry of frontal core motion during cycling and the symmetry of side plank holding time, as well as with the weekly workout time and a fast walking speed, when designing core muscle exercise programmes.</jats:p>"

In this study, the formation of the Core-Skin-Core (CSC) structure and its physical mechanism in a two-stage co-injection molding has been studied based on the ASTM D638 TYPE V system by using both numerical simulation and experimental observation. Results showed that when the skin to core ratio is selected properly (say 30/70), the CSC structure can be observed clearly at central location for 30SFPP/30SFPP system. When the skin to core ratio and operation conditions are fixed, regardless of material arrangement (including 30SFPP/30SFPP; PP/PP; 30SFPP/PP; and PP/30SFPP systems), the morphologies of the CSC structures are very close for all systems. This CSC structure can be further validated by using μ-CT scan and image analysis technologies perfectly. Furthermore, the influences of various operation parameters on the CSC structure variation have been investigated. Results exhibited that the CSC structure does not change significantly irrespective of the flow rate changing, melt temperature varying, or even mold temperature being modified. Moreover, the mechanism to generate the CSC structure can be derived using the melt front movement of the numerical simulation. It is worth noting that after the skin material was broken through, the core material travelled ahead with fountain flow to occupy the flow front. In the same period, the proper amount of skin material with certain inertia of enough kinetic energy will keep going to penetrate the new coming core material to travel until the end of filling. It ends up with this special CSC structure.</jats:p>"

The observed time dependence of the voltage shows a dc voltage with an ac component oscillating with twice of the resonance frequency. The estimated amplitude of the voltage due to the spin motive force is ∼μV. We also investigate spin motive force driven by different modes of standing spin waves.

      "abstract": "<p>In the last two decades, tax avoidance has risen to the top of the agenda of policy makers and international organizations. The majority of political action and academic research has focused on the macro-level of states, pointing towards the responsibility of ‘tax havens’ or ‘offshore financial centers’. Research on the micro-level has demonstrated the importance of non-state actors who facilitate tax planning, but tax advisors have never been studied systematically with global data. In this paper, we connect the micro and macro levels. We map tax advisors geographically using a novel empirical approach based on LinkedIn. We show that tax advisors generally locate in large cities in the EU and OECD, rather than in places targeted as ‘tax havens’. We further consider what determines the locations of tax advisors. Using multiple regression analysis, we find that locations of tax advisors does not correlate with the location of corporate profits, financial secrecy, or economic activity. Rather, it correlates with the managerial and financial activity. Our results underscore the core-periphery structure in offshore finance. Effective regulation of tax avoidance should focus on tax advisors, not only on the destination of money flows, since the active facilitation does not occur in those places.</p>"

In addition, Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values and the distributions of 184 virulence genes were all computed. The proportion of virulence genes was 90.96%, 93.56%, 95.89%, 86.04%, 85.78% and 91.87% for MCG groups 1 to 6, respectively.

Most COSs in the musculoskeletal field are developed for specific conditions. We propose that there are likely to be common core domains within existing musculoskeletal COSs that may be used as a starting point in the development of future COSs. We aim to identify common core domains from existing COSs and to facilitate the development of new COSs for musculoskeletal conditions. As a secondary aim, we will assess the development quality of these COSs.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A systematic review including musculoskeletal COSs.

In particular, fiber-structured mechanical strain sensors with carbon-based materials have emerged as promising alternatives for wearable applications owing to their wearability and adaptability to the human body. Various materials, structures, sensing mechanisms, and fabrication methods have been used to fabricate high-performance fiber strain sensors. Nevertheless, developing multi-modal strain sensors that can monitor multiple deformations remains to be accomplished. This study established core/sheath fiber multi-modal strain sensors using polymer and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Specifically, a flexible and conductive CNT sheet was wrapped onto the elastomeric core fiber at a certain angle. This wrapping angle allowed the CNTs to mechanically deform under tensile and torsional deformations without fatal structural damage. The CNTs could sense both tensile and torsional strains through reversible structural changes during deformations. The fiber strain sensor exhibited an increase of 124.9% and 9.6% in the resistance during tensile and torsional deformations of 100% and 1250 rad/m, respectively.</jats:p>"

Owing to the strong non-linearity of the magnetization dynamics, the oscillation phase flips to another stochastically, which can give a rise to unconventional computing functionalities, including probabilistic computing. Here, we investigated the stochastic dynamics of ferromagnetic-metal magnon parametron, of which the precession phase is discretized into two (0 and π) by parametric pumping of magnons. We found that an AC magnetic field perpendicular to an external field can control the precession phase in the magnon parametron, of which amplitude dependence follows the sigmoid function, a requirement for probabilistic bit operation. We also found that the time scale for flipping between different precession phases grows exponentially as pumping microwave power. Our finding ensures that the magnon parametron can be used as a calculating element for unconventional computing schemes based on bistable systems.</jats:p>",

Chronos-V is a heterogeneous architecture with two regions: (i) General Purpose Processing Elements (GPPE), responsible for executing user applications; (ii) peripherals that provide IO capabilities or hardware acceleration to the system. Besides the standard goal of high-level models, design space exploration at early design stages with reduced simulation time, our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in the MCSoC research field by proposing an architecture with hardware and software support for management techniques. As a case study, we present an ODA (Observe-Decide-Actuate) loop for thermal management, comparing it to a dark silicon patterning mapping in a platform with 196 PEs. Thermal maps show the benefits of using dynamic thermal management in terms of hotspot avoidance and temperature reduction.</jats:p>"

It is also unclear whether UASs can broadly activate transcription from the different promoter classes or whether efficient transcription requires matching UASs and promoters of similar gene class. Here we measure transcription and cofactor specificity for tens of thousands of UAS-core promoter combinations. We find that &lt;5% of UASs display strong core promoter specificity while most UASs can broadly activate promoters regardless of regulatory class. However, we find that matching UASs and promoters from the same gene class is generally important for optimal expression. From examining the cofactor dependence of this large UAS-promoter set, we find that sensitivity to rapid depletion of MED Tail or SAGA is dependent on the identity of both UAS and promoter while dependence on TFIID localizes to only the core promoter. Our results explain why transcription factor-mediated MED recruitment to the UAS does not always result in Tail-dependent transcription and highlight the role of TATA and TATA-like promoter sequences in MED Tail function.</jats:p>"

The basic rules, namely the postulates of Suggestive Linguistics are thoroughly interpreted, since they fully characterize the basic grounds of the science, its main rules, i.e. «language as a whole can be considered as a suggestive phenomenon, therefore the main attention is paid to the communicative-voluntative (suggestive) function of language», «Suggestive Linguistics is dynamic in terms of its research subject», «linguistic suggestion is probabilistic in nature, aimed at overcoming the norms present in each synchronous slice of the language», «any suggestive components have a symbolic two-sided character, that is, they constitute the unity of form and content» and other ones. Sufficient methods of influence utilized within the network of Suggestive Linguistics, including individual and group methods of hypnosis, verbal mythologizing of the personality, methods of automythologizing, phonosemantic suggestive analysis and construction are briefly characterized.

Ultra-short pulse is a promising technology for achieving ultra-high data rate transmission which is required to follow the increased demand of data transport over an optical communication system. Therefore, the propagation of such type of pulses and the effects that it may suffer during its transmission through an optical waveguide have received a great deal of attention in the recent years. Our goal in this paper is to study the propagation characteristics of that pulse in a nonlinear medium. In analyzing these characteristics, the nonlinear effects along with the dispersion are taking into account. Additionally, the considered nonlinear effects include self phase modulation (SPM), sel steepening (SS), cross phase modulation (XPM) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Vocational interest research relies on interest taxonomies that partition the construct space of activity preferences into a small number of broad interest domains. To this day, the most widely used classification system is the RIASEC taxonomy (Holland, 1997), which distinguishes between six overarching interest domains. A central feature of this model is that the six domains are connected via a circular similarity structure, the circumplex, which is often described with the help of two orthogonal core dimensions: People-Things and Data-Ideas. In recent years, alternative interest taxonomies have been proposed, which suggest different partitionings of the construct space that are said to better reflect today’s world of work. Using the example of one such alternative, namely, the recently introduced SETPOINT model (Su et al., 2019), the current article argues that alternative taxonomies strongly reflect the underlying core dimensions that define the interest circumplex. Using a mixed online sample from Germany (N = 560), it is shown that 1) the main and subdomains of the SETPOINT model reflect a circular similarity structure, 2) this circular similarity structure is conceptually identical to the ones identified in previous research, and 3) the discriminatory power of the SETPOINT scales for occupational group membership can largely be traced back to the core dimensions of the interest circumplex.</p>"

It has the potential to allow companies to achieve major efficiency gains and a more productive workforce through automating existing processes, providing deeper levels of analytics, providing better customer support, and increasing security. On the other hand, it may lead to lower staff levels and a drop in existing employee morale. Given the complexities of these projects, AI will only benefit organisations if they understand its capabilities in addition to its shortcomings. This investigation addresses the predicted impact on skills, roles and employee morale of artificial intelligence on the workforce of the future as AI continues to become more prevalent in our society.\r\nWe investigate these impacts of AI specifically across four key industries by engaging in interviews with experts in the field to answer two research questions: (i) What are the core impacts of introducing AI systems in the workplace?, and; (ii) How can organisations develop AI projects for successful transformation? The inclusion strategy for this research were professionals who were highly knowledgeable in the area, and from our findings we were able to identify several impacts that AI made to companies developing these projects; namely employment levels, workforce morale, and process efficiency. With these insights, we subsequently developed a roadmap which contains the recommended steps and decisions that are necessary for successfully introducing AI to an organisation. This roadmap visualises the key decisions and steps that are critical for any AI based initiative for organisations, which will provide practitioners with a higher level of understanding of what is expected, in addition to enabling more effective collaboration with the system developers. Furthermore, this roadmap allows organisations to take a positive and proactive approach to designing these systems with their workforce in mind and to prepares them for the implications with the development, deployment, and use of these AI systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The teaching practicum has been characterised by “wicked feedback” problems. Feedback is essential for enhancing student teachers’ core teaching practices. Student teachers are most vulnerable when they have to present lesson segments and may not know whether they are doing it correctly. Providing actionable, timely and constructive feedback is challenging at the best of times and this became even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic. This proactive action research study aims to provide an overview of the utilization of technology-enhanced feedback (digital screen recording) on preservice teachers’ practicum assessment tasks and to report on their perceptions of, reflections on, and uptake of the feedback. A group of fifteen preservice teachers and two teacher educators from a university in the North West Province participated in the study. The findings indicate that technology-enhanced feedback motivates student teachers to engage with the feedback because it facilitates the personalization of feedback, fosters relationships between preservice teachers and teacher educators, and increases the uptake of feedback that results in improved teaching practicum performance tasks. The study informs a developing understanding of the pedagogic potential of feedback via technology and its uptake within an environment that is becoming increasingly digital. The article concludes with recommendations for exploiting the potential benefits of technology-enhanced feedback to ensure uptake and facilitate the improved teaching practice of preservice teachers within teaching practicum settings.\n\nKeywords: Technology-enhanced, Feedback, Preservice teachers, Core teaching practices, Assessment</jats:p>"

The method takes advantages of the axisymmetric character of the conical horns to project the problem to a bidimensional mesh, reducing the computational time and making easy the optimization of the device. This approach is not used for most popular commercial codes which employ a 3D analysis of the whole antenna. Horn antennas exhibit some remarkable radiation characteristics as they are high directivity, low crosspolar level and symmetric patterns with low return losses on a reasonable bandwidth. The price to pay is handle devices very long and weighed, so it is demanding to find lines of design to shorten and make compact horns to be incorporated to the current communication systems. In this work, we show the advantages to use a double convex lens together with a dielectric core, added to the horn, to achieve a compact and shortened horn maintaining a good performance. Conical horns, of a size as small as one wavelength, can be achieved. To reach such shortening, a double convex lens and a dielectric core must be added to the antenna. The parameters of the final prototype, at 60 GHz, are the following: Length: ≈<jats:italic>λ</jats:italic>, Directivity = 20 dBi, Cross polar Peak = −19.1 dB, Beam width on copular plane = 18.3°, Side Lobe Levels lower than −20 dB (both H and E plane), Return losses = −30.7 dB, and presenting an smooth frequency behavior on a wide bandwidth.</jats:p>",

It approaches this subject by looking back at NIL/TU,O Child and Family Services Society v. B.C. Government and Service Employees’ Union, a case in which employees at a First Nations child and family services provider attempted to unionize. NIL/ TU,O set in motion a legal battle over the jurisdiction of Indigenous labour relations that ultimately reached the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in 2010. The SCC determined that the labours of the workers at NIȽ TU,O Child and Family Services are a matter of provincial jurisdiction because they fall outside of the “core of Indianness,” a contested legal concept used to determine exclusive federal legislative power over ”Indians and Lands reserved for Indians.” Using Indigenous feminisms and a feminist political economy approach, we argue that this decision rests on gendered appraisals, and indeed obfuscations, of social reproduction – that is to say, the labour involved in the daily and intergenerational care and reproduction of people. Bill C-92 necessitates revisiting the case history in NIL/TU,O because the regulation of labour relations are unaddressed in the new Act. We suggest that the uncertainty surrounding jurisdiction over Indigenous labour has the dual potential of, on the one hand, being used for exploitative or dispossessive purposes, or, on the other hand, taken up as an opening for greater self-determination by Indigenous peoples. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Taking the results from laboratory testing, a workflow procedure for deriving compressibility input data is outlined in detail, including the choice of ancillary data, for example, Poisson’s ratio. The workflow includes finding regression-based functions of measured pore volumes (PVs), obtaining their derivatives, and finding optimal solutions following a statistical analysis.

From embedded devices now employing (often heterogeneous) multi-core processors, across many-core scientific computing platforms, to distributed systems comprising thousands of interconnected processors, parallel programming of one form or another is now the norm. Understanding how to efficiently parallelize code, however, is still an open problem, and the difficulties are exacerbated across heterogeneous processing, and especially at run time, when it is sometimes desirable to change the parallelization strategy to meet non-functional requirements (e.g., load balancing and power consumption). In this article, we investigate the use of a programming model based on series-parallel partial orders: computations are expressed as directed graphs that expose parallelization opportunities and necessary sequencing by construction. This programming model is suitable as an intermediate representation for higher-level languages. We then describe a model of computation for such a programming model that maps such graphs into a stack-based structure more amenable to hardware processing. We describe the formal small-step semantics for this model of computation and use this formal description to show that the model can be arbitrarily parallelized, at compile and runtime, with correct execution guaranteed by design. We empirically support this claim and evaluate parallelization benefits using a prototype open-source compiler, targeting a message-passing many-core simulation. We empirically verify the correctness of arbitrary parallelization, supporting the validity of our formal semantics, analyze the distribution of operations within cores to understand the implementation impact of the paradigm, and assess execution time improvements when five micro-benchmarks are automatically and randomly parallelized across 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 multi-core configurations, resulting in execution time decrease by up to 95% in the best case.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;In light of Bill C-92, which establishes a framework for Indigenous communities to exercise legislative authority over child and family service provision, this article addresses the contested regulation of employment and labour relations in Indigenous social service workplaces. It approaches this subject by looking back at NIL/TU,O Child and Family Services Society v. B.C. Government and Service Employees’ Union, a case in which employees at a First Nations child and family services provider attempted to unionize. NIL/ TU,O set in motion a legal battle over the jurisdiction of Indigenous labour relations that ultimately reached the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in 2010. The SCC determined that the labours of the workers at NIȽ TU,O Child and Family Services are a matter of provincial jurisdiction because they fall outside of the “core of Indianness,” a contested legal concept used to determine exclusive federal legislative power over ”Indians and Lands reserved for Indians.” Using Indigenous feminisms and a feminist political economy approach, we argue that this decision rests on gendered appraisals, and indeed obfuscations, of social reproduction – that is to say, the labour involved in the daily and intergenerational care and reproduction of people. Bill C-92 necessitates revisiting the case history in NIL/TU,O because the regulation of labour relations are unaddressed in the new Act. We suggest that the uncertainty surrounding jurisdiction over Indigenous labour has the dual potential of, on the one hand, being used for exploitative or dispossessive purposes, or, on the other hand, taken up as an opening for greater self-determination by Indigenous peoples. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Repetitive or exogenous sequences, such as ribosomal RNA and horizontally transferred genes, are frequently absent from MAGs because of misassembly and binning errors. Here, we report that ribosomal protein genes are also often absent from MAGs, although they are neither repetitive nor exogenous. Comprehensive analyses of more than 190,000 MAGs revealed that these genes could be missing in more than 20–40% of near-complete (i.e., with completeness of 90% or higher) MAGs. While some uncultivated environmental microbes intrinsically lack some ribosomal protein genes, we found that this unexpected absence is largely due to special evolutionary patterns of codon usage bias in ribosomal protein genes and algorithmic characteristics of metagenomic binning, which is dependent on tetranucleotide frequencies of contigs. This problem reflects the microbial life-history strategy. Fast-growing microbes tend to have this difficulty, likely because of strong evolutionary pressures on ribosomal protein genes toward the efficient assembly of ribosomes. Our observations caution those who study genomics and phylogeny of uncultivated microbes, the diversity and evolution of microbial genes in the central dogma, and bioinformatics in metagenomics.</jats:p>",

The three physical properties determine the economics of an oil and gas field, especially in the reservoir rock layer. Sandstone (sand) is a lithology that very common oil and gas reservoir rock. The research was conducted at a laboratory scale using three (3) core plug samples from conventional cores. The method used in the Porosity measurement is Boyle's law helium porosimeter, while for the measurement of saturation using the results of the Conventional Retort method. The results of his research are the porosity values of the three samples taken from an average value of 23.76%, which is in the very good (very good) category. Meanwhile, the permeability values of the three samples were taken from an average value of 211.67 mD which is also in the very good category. From the graph of porosity to permeability it shows a directly proportional relationship, then from the graph of porosity to depth of the three samples above it shows an inverse relationship, those are shown by the trendline but with a very low R2 value. This is possibly caused by two things, namely: lack of sample data, and too close sample interval so that it cannot be used as justification that porosity and depth are not reversed. Oil saturation values (So) and gas saturation (Sg) of the three samples were taken from the average values of 46% and 1.7%.</jats:p>"

All four bimetallic nanorods used in our experiments started from gold nanorod (AuNR) cores (of 36 nm length and 12 nm diameter) which were coated with a 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 nm thick layer of silver. SERS spectra were obtained for each thickness of AuNR\\Ag Raman agent using a Raman reporter-organic molecule p-aminothiophenol (PATP). Moreover, to confirm experimental findings a numerical model was built using COMSOL Multiphysics and solved for a single AuNR\\Ag interaction with light on a silica substrate. The highest SERS signal at the incident wavelength of 784 nm, was observed for AuNR\\Ags coated with a 1 nm thick silver shell.

One of the many reasons for the curious alignment of positivism with natural law theory has been a focus on the explanatory power and theoretical import of the phenomenon of friendship.

The present study investigates whether core–shell chitosan-alginate particle size governs biological activities as well as protein release profile. A coaxial electrospraying was used to fabricate bovine serum albumin (BSA)-loaded core–shell micro/nanoparticles and were fully characterized. The bio/hemocompatibility of the particles was assessed using MTT and hemolytic assays, respectively, followed by the uptake assessment using flow cytometry. Finally, protein absorption was investigated using SDS-PAGE. The SEM size of the microparticles, the hydrodynamic, and the actual sizes of the nanoparticles were 1.2 μm, 90.49 nm, and 50 nm, respectively. Interactions among two polymers and BSA were observed using DSC analysis. BET analysis showed a more surface area for nanoparticles. A sustained release trend of BSA was observed after 14- and 10-day for microparticles and nanoparticles, respectively. Microparticles exhibited excellent hemocompatibility (&lt; 5% hemolysis) and cell viability (at least &gt; 70%) in all concentrations. However, acceptable hemolytic activity and cell viability were observed for nanoparticles in concentrations below 250 μg/mL. Furthermore, nanoparticles showed greater cellular uptake (~ 4 folds) and protein absorption (~ 1.61 folds) than microparticles. Overall, the developed core–shell chitosan-alginate particles in the micro/nanoscale can be promising candidates for biomedical application and regenerative medicine regarding their effects on above mentioned biological activities.</jats:p>"

Both AuNRs and AuNR\\Ags were prepared using a modified seed-mediated method and then characterized using TEM, XPS and UV-vis spectroscopy. All four bimetallic nanorods used in our experiments started from gold nanorod (AuNR) cores (of 36 nm length and 12 nm diameter) which were coated with a 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 nm thick layer of silver. SERS spectra were obtained for each thickness of AuNR\\Ag Raman agent using a Raman reporter-organic molecule p-aminothiophenol (PATP). Moreover, to confirm experimental findings a numerical model was built using COMSOL Multiphysics and solved for a single AuNR\\Ag interaction with light on a silica substrate. The highest SERS signal at the incident wavelength of 784 nm, was observed for AuNR\\Ags coated with a 1 nm thick silver shell. The numerical model confirmed experimental findings and predicted the highest near-field enhancement in the vicinity of nanoparticles on top of a silica substrate at 784 nm wavelength, for an AuNR\\Ag with the same 1 nm silver shell thickness.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Until the beginning of the 2020 academic year, the first-year engineering program at McMaster University was organized as traditional courses to form a common curriculum for all students. The first year core courses were organized as i) Design and Graphics, ii) Computation, iii) Profession &amp; Practice, and iv) Materials. Regardless of which engineering discipline a student enters in second year, the core courses provide a common base for important theory and applications required for the engineering design and development process. The challenge with traditional course organization continues to be concept linkages and attention competition. The purpose of this new approach was to integrate the learning objective of each traditional course into one experiential course through sequential Capstone-style project learning experiences– creating the Integrated Cornerstone. As the name implies, the approach offers the foundational blocks in the engineering student’s education. Focusing pedagogy on a tangible outcomes provides the opportunity to incorporate creativity, self-efficacy, and fosters a sense of community. The Achilles’ heel to a siloed collection of courses offering the Cornerstone approach is that students find themselves immersed in parallel independent projects resulting in unintended distraction. The Integrated Cornerstone merges the core courses learning objectives for better focus of pedagogy. While pandemic restrictions have complicated the quantified comparison of pedagogical approaches between the traditional method of curriculum delivery vs. the Integrated Cornerstone delivery we present aggregate qualitative outcomes of student success. The comparison of approaches and lessons learned for integration will be of interest to other educators seeking better integrated learning for the application of engineering theory in design.</jats:p>"

Light is a suitable tool to move small objects in a noncontact way, given its capabilities in exerting forces and torques. However, when complex manipulation is required, micro-objects with proper architecture could play a specific role. Here we report on the rotational dynamics of core-shell particles, with a polymeric nematic core of ellipsoidal shape capped by Au nanoparticles. They undergo a peculiar synchronous spinning and orbital motion when irradiated by a simple Gaussian beam, which originates from the coupling of the metallic nanoparticles’ optical response and the core anisotropies. The rotation capabilities are strongly enhanced when the trapping wavelength lies in the plasmonic resonance region: indeed, the spin kinetic energy reaches values two orders of magnitude larger than the one of bare microparticles. The proposed strategy brings important insights into optimizing the design of light controlled micro-objects and might benefit applications in microfluidics, microrheology, and micromachining involving rotational dynamics.</jats:p>",

In the context of the circular economy, the press cakes remaining after extraction of juices/oil from plants such as sea buckthorn or hemp can be valorized as they are rich in proteins, fibers and many bioactive compounds. Their use in bread making is a good solution to enrich the nutritional value of bread. Pea protein concentrate, hemp and sea buckthorn ingredients from press cakes by-products were added to whole wheat flour in different percentages and combinations (2% pea protein concentrate; 1% pea + 2% sea buckthorn ingredients; 1% pea + 2% hemp ingredients). Bread samples were obtained through three technological methods: one phase baking process (dough), two phases (sponge and dough) and one phase with dried sourdough added directly into the dough. A control sample (100% wheat whole flour) was considered. The mixtures of whole wheat flour and plant protein ingredients were rheologically tested. The bread samples were physicochemically analyzed (protein, fat, carbohydrates, energy value) and sensory characteristics were evaluated (texture, color and overall acceptability). The changes in the physicochemical characteristics, rheology behavior, microstructure and sensory quality were evaluated and compared. The energy from protein varied from 17.26 to 19.34% which means that all the samples can be considered “a source of protein”. Hardness decreased in samples with sponge and dried sourdough which reflect the importance of technology in keeping the freshness of the product. The most appreciated were the samples with pea protein concentrate, with hemp ingredient obtained through an indirect bread making process and the sample with sea buckthorn ingredient prepared through a direct bread making process using dried sourdough.</jats:p>"

With this broadly sampled dataset consisting of dry/fleshy fruits and wild/domesticated species, we applied novel bioinformatic methods to investigate conserved and divergent patterns of gene expression during fruit development and evolution.

While EMI has been widely used to estimate variations in soil properties in agricultural, geotechnical, and contaminated sites, limited applications have been reported for wetlands. This study assesses the use of EMI for estimating soil property distributions at a restored wetland in northwestern Ohio, USA. We acquired spatial distribution of soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and apparent magnetic susceptibility (MSa) via EMI over a 162,000 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> restored wetland using an EM-38-MK2 instrument towed behind a utility terrain vehicle equipped with a differential ground positioning system. We collected twenty-two undisturbed soil samples and analyzed them in the laboratory for soil moisture (SMC), organic matter (SOM), porosity, bulk density, and texture. A least squares linear regression model was used to compare the correlation between each soil property with measured ECa and MSa while ECa was used to predict the distribution of SMC and SOM using the statistical model validated using the leave-one-out technique. We observed strong correlations between soil texture, SMC, and SOM, and ECa with SOM showing a slightly dominant control. This study shows that ECa can predict the distribution of SMC and SOM in wetland soils to an accuracy of ~ 67–70% for these datasets. The spatial ECa patterns matched the USDA soil map for the site. This study validates the potential of extending EMI for characterizing wetland soil properties, improving sampling plans, and extrapolating soil property estimates to unsampled regions.</jats:p>"

Determination of the bonding quality of sandwich panels with veneer faces and &lt;50 mm thick cork core is not covered either by the EN 314-1, which refers to plywood, nor by its Annex B, which refers to insulating cores with a thickness of at least 50 mm. This technical note assesses the possibility of using the prescriptions of Annex B of EN 314-1 to test the bonding quality (shear strength) of the concerned panels. For this purpose, sandwich panels were realized by bonding fromager (Ceiba pentandra) veneers to a 5 mm thick core, and their bonding quality was tested. Two types of panels were realized, based on the adhesive used (glue spread 340 g/m2 for double glue lines): urea–formaldehyde (UF) and urea–melamine–formaldehyde (UMF); the panels were pressed at 103 °C for 8 min at a nominal pressure of 0.4 MPa. Pre-treatments were dry-conditioned at 20 °C/65% relative humidity until attainment of the equilibrium moisture content, and immersed in water: cold water for UF panels (5.1.1 of EN 314-2) and boiling water for UMF panels (5.1.2 of EN 314-2). The effect of pre-treatment was statistically significant, with shear resistance reductions of 56% and 43% in UF and UMF panels, respectively. Based on this first investigation (2 panels × 10 specimens per panel = 40 specimens), the test method can be considered suitable for providing reliable results. This study constitutes a useful reference to test the bonding quality of sandwich panels with veneer faces and thin cork cores.</jats:p>"

Understanding their connectivity patterns as an omnigenic neighbourhood in a molecular interaction network (interactome) is a key step towards advancing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancers. Here, we introduce a unified connectivity line (<jats:italic>CLine</jats:italic>) to pinpoint omics-specific omnigenic patterns across 15 curated cancers. Taking advantage of the universality of <jats:italic>CLine</jats:italic>, we distinguish the peripheral and core genes for each omics aspect. We propose a network-based framework, multi-omics periphery and core (MOPC), to combine peripheral and core genes from different omics into a button-like structure. On the basis of network proximity, we provide evidence that core genes tend to be specifically perturbed in one omics, but the peripheral genes are diversely perturbed in multiple omics. And the core of one omics is regulated by multiple omics peripheries. Finally, we take the MOPC as an omnigenic neighbourhood, describe its characteristics, and explore its relative contribution to network-based mechanisms of cancer. We were able to present how multi-omics perturbations percolate through the human interactome and contribute to an integrated periphery and core.</jats:p>"

The National Core Indicators Aging and Disability (NCI-AD) collects data from multiple states to evaluate long-term care recipients’ service satisfaction and needs. Many analysts are interested in exploring the service environments of people living with dementia. However, dementia measurement and reporting varies in NCI-AD between states. Dementia status may be obtained from administrative records or self-reported during the survey. We explored the measurement of dementia in NCI-AD and the implications of relying on administrative or self-reported dementia status. We analyzed NCI-AD data from 2015-2018 representing 24,569 respondents age 65+, of which 5,502 (22.4%) were identified as having dementia. 42.9% of respondents had dementia status determined administratively and 57.1% had it determined during the survey. To assess dementia accuracy by data source, we fit separate LASSO models for both the administrative and survey subpopulations predicting dementia status using demographic and functional predictors. We then used each model to predict dementia status in the subpopulation with discordant dementia data source. Using the administrative model to predict survey reported status resulted in a higher sensitivity than using the survey model to predict administrative status (44.6% vs 32.2%). The diminished predictive accuracy of the survey model suggests administrative records may capture cases of dementia diagnosis that would be missed by self-report. These findings highlight analytical caveats for researchers interested study long-term care quality for people with dementia using NCI-AD, and emphasize the importance of moving towards more standardized dementia reporting.</jats:p>",

To develop our empirical perspective, we compare the work on repugnance with the existing empirical literature in management on core-stigma and argue that core-stigmatization results from the mobilized repugnance. The core-stigmatized firm faces higher transaction costs. We demonstrate, through a case-study of the strategies of MindGeek/Pornhub in the online pornography market, how transaction costs economics can explain the choice of strategies to deal with core-stigma. Under most conditions, the increased transaction costs lead to vertical and lateral integration of the firm. In a dynamic setting, rival firms might use stigmatization to prevent the entry of a new competitor. Our second case-study on the early decades of the mail-order company Sears, Roebuck, and Company illustrates that repugnance, including racial discrimination, was mobilized by competitors to block the entry of the firm into the market.</jats:p>",

One of the triggering factors for these mechanical disorders is prolonged sitting according to research showing about 39.5-60% of adults experience low back pain due to prolonged sitting for 1.5 hours - 5 hours. One of the jobs at risk for NPB is batik. Batik craftsmen usually have a static nature of work that is carried out within 8 hours per day in a sitting condition. Static muscle contractions for 8 hours in a sitting condition can increase muscle and spinal ligament tension. Community service activities were carried out in June 2022 with the method of discussing and delivering materials and leaflets related to the bad ergonomic effects that lead to lower back pain and demonstrating core stability exercises. This community service aims to be used as a source of knowledge for mothers of batik craftsmen at the Kajang Lako batik studio across the city of Jambi. The results of the evaluation through the question and answer session were that the batik craftsmen had understood how to practice core stability correctly and were able to do it independently. </jats:p>"

A simple optical system with variable sensitivity is shown to be effective for inspection of a titanium honeycomb component subjected to differential pressure. Results are compared to those achieved with computed tomography (CT), immersion ultrasound testing (UT), and optical holographic interferometry. Lastly, we propose several possible processing strategies for automated quality assessment based on this powerful hybrid approach.</jats:p>"

From 2010-2015, the CLSA enlisted a diverse and multi-ethnic sample of community-dwelling adults 45-85 years of age. Comprehensive phenotyping was performed through interviews at participants’ homes and assessments at data collection sites. Frailty was quantified by the 47-item Frailty Index (FI) Examination, consisting of tests for age-related deficits in physical performance, body composition, cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology, cognitive and sensory function. After dividing our sample into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, we compared machine learning and linear regression models to predict the FI based on age, sex, comorbidities, and blood test results. We used the H2O AutoML platform (DAI 1.10.2) to iteratively determine the optimal model.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>\n            The cohort consisted of 30,097 adults with a mean age of 63±10 years and 51% females.

The gradient-boosted machine learning model achieved an R\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            of 0.512 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.058 to regress FI scores, and an area under the curve of 0.766 to classify FI quintiles, selecting the following 10 variables in descending order of importance: age, chronic heart failure, hypertension, glycated hemoglobin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein, red cell distribution width, vitamin D, female sex, and diabetes.

It has the potential to allow companies to achieve major efficiency gains and a more productive workforce through automating existing processes, providing deeper levels of analytics, providing better customer support, and increasing security. On the other hand, it may lead to lower staff levels and a drop in existing employee morale. Given the complexities of these projects, AI will only benefit organisations if they understand its capabilities in addition to its shortcomings. This investigation addresses the predicted impact on skills, roles and employee morale of artificial intelligence on the workforce of the future as AI continues to become more prevalent in our society.&#x0D;\nWe investigate these impacts of AI specifically across four key industries by engaging in interviews with experts in the field to answer two research questions: (i) What are the core impacts of introducing AI systems in the workplace?, and; (ii) How can organisations develop AI projects for successful transformation? The inclusion strategy for this research were professionals who were highly knowledgeable in the area, and from our findings we were able to identify several impacts that AI made to companies developing these projects; namely employment levels, workforce morale, and process efficiency. With these insights, we subsequently developed a roadmap which contains the recommended steps and decisions that are necessary for successfully introducing AI to an organisation. This roadmap visualises the key decisions and steps that are critical for any AI based initiative for organisations, which will provide practitioners with a higher level of understanding of what is expected, in addition to enabling more effective collaboration with the system developers. Furthermore, this roadmap allows organisations to take a positive and proactive approach to designing these systems with their workforce in mind and to prepares them for the implications with the development, deployment, and use of these AI systems.</jats:p>"

Politics, economy, migration, and globalization have been or are the crucial factors to influence on the families. Polygamy, extended family, nuclear family, transnational family, same-sex marriage and diversified family construct the contexts of families in Taiwan. These multi-family forms seem to ingratiate themselves with the popular concept „diversity” which is articulated since 21th century. Many people think that “diversity” could eliminate conflicts, because not any part will be ignored; “diversity” shows tolerance, progress of society. In fact, there are at the same time more and more conflicts and problems occurred because of diversity. How would be the potential causes of problems? And how could these problems and conflicts in the families be dealt with? The core solutions seem not easy to find. Since 1960s, Chiara Lubich’s concepts: “unity,” “mutual love” and “the model of new family” were spread into Taiwan. Her concepts influence on many families to live in a new way. In this paper, some historical and current family models in Taiwan as well as the relation between the Chiara Lubich’s concept of “unity” and families will be explored to see whether her concepts could be the possible path to reconcile the conflicts of families, and how it could be possibly put into practice.</jats:p>"

Here, we demonstrated that the increased resistance to cilgavimab of the spike L452R is possibly caused by the steric hindrance between cilgavimab and its binding interface on the spike.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Core outcomes sets are increasingly used to define research outcomes that are most important for a condition. Different consensus methods are used in the development of core outcomes sets; the most common is the Delphi process. Delphi methodology is increasingly standardised for core outcomes set development, but uncertainties remain. We aimed to empirically test how the use of different summary statistics and consensus criteria impact Delphi process results.\n<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Results from two unrelated child health Delphi processes were analysed. Outcomes were ranked by mean, median, or rate of exceedance, and then pairwise comparisons were undertaken to analyse whether the rankings were similar. The correlation coefficient for each comparison was calculated, and Bland-Altman plots produced. Youden’s index was used to assess how well the outcomes ranked highest by each summary statistic matched the final core outcomes sets.\nConsensus criteria identified in a review of published Delphi processes were applied to the results of the two child-health Delphi processes. The size of the consensus sets produced by different criteria was compared, and Youden’s index was used to assess how well the outcomes that met different criteria matched the final core outcomes sets.\n<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Pairwise comparisons of different summary statistics produced similar correlation coefficients. Bland-Altman plots showed that comparisons involving ranked medians had wider variation in the ranking. No difference in Youden’s index for the summary statistics was found.\nDifferent consensus criteria produced widely different sets of consensus outcomes (Range: 5-44 included outcomes). They also showed differing abilities to identify core outcomes (Youden’s index Range: 0.32-0.92). The choice of consensus criteria had a large impact on Delphi results.\n<jats:bold>Discussion:</jats:bold> The use of different summary statistics is unlikely to affect how outcomes are ranked during a Delphi process: mean, median and rates of exceedance produce similar results. Different consensus criteria have a large impact on resultant consensus outcomes and potentially on subsequent core outcomes sets: our results confirm the importance of adhering to pre-specified consensus criteria.</jats:p>"

We successfully quantify the rich structural variety of core-shell nanoparticles with heteroepitaxy in 3D at atomic resolution. Instead of forming an atomically-sharp boundary, the core-shell interface is atomically diffuse with an average thickness of 4.2 Å, irrespective of the particle’s size, morphology or crystallographic texture. The high concentration of Pd in the diffusive interface is highly related to the electric double layers of the Pd seeds.

A magneto-thermal iterative coupling method considering the temperature effects of magnetic properties in the electrical steel sheet was investigated. Based on the above measurement data and iterative coupling method, the temperature distribution of the core of a 500-kV power transformer was simulated and analyzed, and compared with the simulation results of the traditional coupling method without considering the temperature effect of the electrical steel sheet. Magneto-thermal coupling simulation under no-load operation is a symmetrical problem. It was found that the temperature of the hottest spot of the transformer core calculated by the magneto-thermal iteration method proposed in this paper was significantly reduced, the temperature of the hottest spot on the core column was about 45 °C, and the temperature of the hottest spot on the upper and lower yoke was about 39 °C, which provides an effective simulation method for accurately calculating the temperature rise distribution of electrical products such as transformers.</jats:p>"

In this regard, it is important to increase employee creativity for creative industry workers in the architectural sector. The existence of employee creativity is inﬂuenced by the existence of core self-evaluation (CSE) owned by individuals and knowledge sharing in work. The purpose of this study was to analyze knowledge sharing as amediator of the effect of CSE on employee creativity. This study uses a quantitative research approach with purposive sampling data collection techniques. The subjects of this research are the creative industry workers in the architectural sector. The research subjects were 107 people, while the research subjects consisted of 75% men and 25% women with an age range between 20-25 years as much as 77% and 26-30 years as much as 23%. Data collection uses the Employee Creativity Scale (ECS) to measure the employee creativity variable, the Core Self-Evaluation Scale (CSES) to measure the core self-evaluation variable, and the Knowledge Sharing Scale (KSS) to measure the knowledge sharing variable. Analysis of the data in the study using the mediation analysis Process Macro Analysis. The results show that knowledge sharing partially mediates the effect of CSE on employee creativity, where when employees have a high level of CSE and apply knowledge sharing in their work, it will increase employee creativity.</jats:p>"

CALL UP Approach is an intervention strategy formulated by the teacher and employed during the Modular Distance Learning; a modality implemented during the occurrence of Covid 19 pandemic. The quasi-experimental method of research was employed to investigate the effectiveness of CALL UP Approach to improve learners’ performance in English, Math and Science. This pre-posttest design makes use of two group of learners with almost similar characteristics. The learners were divided into two groups to compose the control and experimental groups.  The control group were subjected to the usual treatment. Meanwhile, the experimental group were subjected to CALL UP Approach composed of home visits, small group community teaching, scaffolding and feedbacking. The results yielded significant difference on the mean gain score between the control and experimental groups implying that the CALL UP Approach is more effective in improving the pupil’s academic performance in English, Math and Science than the previously available learning model of delivery. The Call Up Approach as an intervention program is found effective to improve the learner’s academic performance as revealed in this study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a key international outcome for guiding development efforts of nation states. However, SDG targets cover vast areas of action, and they are difficult to break down and monitor for countries with different developmental situations and needs. Often, global rankings of countries’ compliance with the SDG agenda are plagued with false signals and methodological limitations. This paper presents a much-needed prioritization of the SDG targets for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. It maps SDG targets and outlines priorities and key areas for environmental action. Sustainability in resource use, consumption and production constitutes a primary area for investments. Education and awareness represent cross-cutting priorities and low-hanging fruit for action. Tackling climate change and emerging supply risks and the management of ecosystems represent an action area in which GCC governments can intensify their interventions. As a supporting policy, regional environmental cooperation is important for enhanced commitments and tackling transboundary aspects of the SDG agenda. The analysis of the SDG agenda in the GCC regions reiterates the importance of countries engaging with global sustainability framings in order work out their own interpretations in congruence with national development realities. Such an SDG regional mapping exercise also assists national-level planners or regional bodies working on development issues in shaping the Gulf region’s engagement with the global sustainability agenda and tracking progress on key SDG priorities.</jats:p>"

Moreover, the biotic and abiotic factors that shape the groundwater resistome on the global scale remain to be explored. Herein, we attempted to fill this knowledge gap through<jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>re-analysis of publicly available global groundwater metagenomes. First, nine ARGs encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (<jats:italic>aad</jats:italic>A,<jats:italic>aph</jats:italic>(3’), and<jats:italic>ant</jats:italic>(3’’)), sulfonamides (<jats:italic>sul</jats:italic>1 and<jats:italic>sul</jats:italic>2), β-lactams (<jats:italic>bla</jats:italic><jats:sub>OXA</jats:sub>and<jats:italic>bla</jats:italic><jats:sub>TEM</jats:sub>), tetracyclines (<jats:italic>tet</jats:italic>(C)) and macrolides (<jats:italic>msr</jats:italic>(E)) were identified to constitute the core groundwater resistome with high detection and abundance levels. Second, the global drivers of groundwater resistome composition were identified by applying a structural equation model with mixed effects to disentangle the individual contributions of each abiotic and biotic factor. Most notably, global effects of the origin of groundwater samples on the resistome were detected with samples from high-income countries (HICs) constantly displaying lower ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances than those from low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). While these effects were consistent across antibiotic classes, biotic factors such as interactions of the groundwater microbiome with fungal or bacterial natural producers of antibiotics, or the co-occurrence of ARGs on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) played significant roles in shaping abundance patterns of resistance towards individual antibiotic classes. Only few ARGs correlated to individual bacterial genera, with microbial community composition in general weakly associated with resistome composition. In conclusion, we provide a first global picture of the resistome of low-anthropogenic impacted groundwater environments and the underlying anthropogenic and biotic drivers shaping it, which can be used as a baseline in future surveillance of antibiotic resistance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>After the passage of the U.S. National Quantum Initiative Act in December 2018, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) recently assembled an interagency working group and conducted a workshop titled “Key Concepts for Future Quantum Information Science Learners” that focused on identifying core concepts for future curricular and educator activities to help precollege students engage with quantum information science (QIS). Helping precollege students learn these key concepts in QIS is an effective approach to introducing them to the second quantum revolution and inspiring them to become future contributors in the growing field of quantum information science and technology as leaders in areas related to quantum computing, communication, and sensing. This paper is a call to precollege educators to contemplate including QIS concepts into their existing courses at appropriate levels and get involved in the development of curricular materials suitable for their students. Also, research shows that compare-and-contrast activities can provide an effective approach to helping students learn. Therefore, we illustrate a pedagogical approach that contrasts the classical and quantum concepts so that educators can adapt them for their students in their lesson plans to help them learn the differences between key concepts in quantum and classical contexts.</jats:p>",

On this basis, we propose six SpMV algorithm schemes and map them to optimize the performance of SpMV. The results show that the M processor’s SpMV performance reached 6.88 GFLOPS.

The proposed technique is model-free and it is based on hyperbolic functions of the six-dimensional pose error of the UAV with respect to the world reference frame; this hyperbolic controller globally attracts the error signals to an ultimate bound about the origin despite external disturbances, which is proved by way of a strict Lyapunov function based analysis. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated by means of tracking and regulation experiments on adverse conditions, which were implemented on a virtual model of the UAV through a physics-engine-based simulation environment that provides an almost identical behaviour than a real UAV. The norm of the six-dimensional error signal converged to zero for the regulation experiments, whereas for tracking it did not exceed 0.05 meters, which indicated a successful operation of the control system. In addition, the performance of the hyperbolic controller was contrasted against a nonlinear PID, which resulted in a better performance in favour of the first one, who settled the errors to zero up to eight seconds before and demanded up to 2000 less revolutions per minute from the rotors while performing the same regulation tasks. All the aforesaid successful results place the proposed technique as a competitive alternative for controlling actively tilting multirotors due to its simplicity, robustness and demonstrated effectiveness.</jats:p>"

The description is based on the study of the distribution function of particles over possible trajectories. We establish a relation between the central slope of density profile and the near-origin behavior of the angular momentum distribution function. We consider both a spherically symmetric (on average) matter distribution as well as deviations from it. If the density profile forms in a  background of spherical gravitation potential then a core-type distribution arises. A regular matter may behave in such way if the background potential was formed by the dark matter. In the presence of deviation from spherical symmetry the formation of cusp-type distribution is possible. Moreover, a reduction of spherical symmetry to the axial one leads to a less steep cusp profile. The complete symmetry breaking (which corresponds, in particular, to the common setup of numerical simulations), leads to a steeper cusp profile.</jats:p>",

Few of the existing tools for investigating HGT are highly automated. Thanks to the adoption of Nextflow for life sciences workflows, and to the standards and best practices curated by communities such as nf-core, fully automated, portable, and scalable pipelines can now be developed. Here we present nf-core/hgtseq to facilitate the analysis of HGT from sequencing data in different organisms. We showcase its performance by analysing six exome datasets from five mammals. Hgtseq can be run seamlessly in any computing environment and accepts data generated by existing exome and whole-genome sequencing projects; this will enable researchers to expand their analyses into this area. Fundamental questions are still open about the mechanisms and the extent or role of horizontal gene transfer: by releasing hgtseq we provide a standardised tool which will enable a systematic investigation of this phenomenon, thus paving the way for a better understanding of HGT.</jats:p>"

Its modification is regulated by three types of m6A-related regulators (methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and RNA-binding proteins (readers)). Till now, the functions and roles of these regulators in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we utilized the open HNSC dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), four different cell lines, and our HNSC patient samples (n=40) to explore the clinical significance of 19 m6A regulators, and selected the most significant prognosis-related regulator. Authentic analyses based on online websites were also used in the study (Oncomine, UALCAN, Kaplan–Meier plotter, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, String, etc.). From the results, general overexpression of m6A regulators was observed in pan-cancer, especially in HNSC. IGF2BP2 was recognized as the hub m6A regulator, which was an independent, unfavorable prognostic factor in HNSC. Its mRNA and protein expression in HNSC were significantly up-regulated. Gene mutation types of IGF2BP2 in HNSC (32%) were mainly mRNA High or Amplification, which represented the high expression of IGF2BP2. And these mutations were associated with a poor prognosis. In functional analysis, IGF2BP2 was negatively correlated to tumor immune infiltration in HNSC. Finally, HMGA2 might interact with the IGF2BP2 in HNSC. In conclusion, IGF2BP2 serves as a core m6A regulator among all regulators in HNSC, which has a high expression and predicts the poor prognosis of HNSC patients independently. IGF2BP2 might bring a new direction for HNSC treatment in the future.</jats:p>",

From the analysis it becomes clear that: (1) calquing (mostly structural) and autonomous word coinage are the most prolific strategies, whereas borrowing and the employment of inherited lexemes are marginal; (2) Latin is the principal direct model for terms, and Danish constitutes another important source. Direct influence of Ælfrician terminology on the Old Icelandic grammatical lexicon is questionable; (3) the terminology currently used primarily comprises terms stemming from the 19th, and to a lesser extent the 18th century, with medieval terminology still being employed only in the case of very basic terms.</jats:p>",

The Sahrmann core stability test (SCST), used in conjunction with the stabilizer pressure biofeedback unit (PBU), is widely applied to objectively evaluate core stability as this pertains lumbopelvic motor control. However, the association between such control and other elements of core stability including core strength, endurance, and dynamic stability during gait has not been well-studied. We investigated the relationships among the ability to control the lumbopelvic complex, core strength and endurance, and gait parameters. We compared lateral core endurance, hip strengths, and gait parameters (lateral oscillation of the center of mass (COM), the single support time, and the peak ground reaction force) between good and poor core stability groups, as determined by the SCST. In addition, logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether other core stability measures correlated with the core stability status defined by the SCST. Only lateral oscillation of the COM during walking differed significantly between the good and poor core stability groups and was a significant predictor of SCST core stability status. Lumbopelvic motor control, (as defined by the SCST), affects dynamic stability during gait, but not to the strength or endurance of the core musculatures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A precessing vortex core (PVC) is a self-excited helical instability that results from the precession of the vortex core around the flow axis in the upstream region of a vortex breakdown bubble. PVC oscillation in a swirl flow-based combustor aids the thermoacoustic instability that results in hardware damage and poor emission characteristics of the engine. The PVC oscillation can be suppressed intermittently or absolutely in the high shear injector-based combustor with proper design and placement of the fuel nozzle in the injector. A high shear injector is an arrangement of two radial swirlers in general, namely, primary and secondary swirlers, equipped with a fuel nozzle at its center to deliver the fuel. In this study, we examine the impact of the placement of the fuel nozzle/center-body and its design over the dynamics of PVC oscillations in a non-reacting flow in a counter-rotating swirler/high shear injector. Time-resolved high-speed (@ 5 kHz) stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements are conducted to elucidate the dynamics of PVC and other coherent structures. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of the velocity field data shows that fuel nozzle flushing with the base of the primary swirler has the most robust PVC oscillation that subsequently gets intermittent or suppressed by placing the center-body of diameters, Dc = 7, 9, and 11 mm at constant upstream mass flow rate. The results show that the center-body with the end face flushing to the exit plane would be helpful to avoid PVC with proper selection of the center-body diameter.</jats:p>",

This model investigates solitary wave propagation inside a fiber. As a result, twin couplers are the subject of this study. Kerr law is the sort of non-linearity addressed there. Because it offers solutions to problems with large tails or infinite fluctuations, the resulting solution set is more generalized than the current solution because it is turned into a fractional-order derivative. Furthermore, the found solutions are fractional solitons with spatial–temporal fractional beta derivative evolution. In intensity-dependent switches, these nonlinear directional couplers also serve as limiters. Non-linearity alters the transmission constants of a system’s modes. The significance of the beta derivative parameter and mathematical approach is demonstrated graphically, with a few of the extracted solutions. A parametric analysis revealed that the fractional beta derivative parameter has a significant impact on the soliton amplitudes. With the aid of the advanced software tools for numerical computations, the categories of semi-dark solitons, singular dark-pitch solitons, single solitons of Type-1 along with 2, intermingled hyperbolically, trigonometric, and rational solitons were established and evaluated. We also discussed sensitivity analysis, which is an inquiry that determines how sensitive our system is. A comparative investigation via different fractional derivatives was also studied in this paper so that one can easily understand the correlation with other fractional derivatives. The findings demonstrate that the approach is simple and efficient and that it yields generalized analytical results. The findings will be extremely beneficial in examining and comprehending physical issues in nonlinear optics, specifically in twin-core couplers with optical metamaterials.</jats:p>"

For natural circulation reactors with a limited driving force, flow distribution optimization is of particular significance, which can be contrived by suitably assigning the inlet resistance of a core assembly channel in reactor design. In the present work, core flow distribution optimization during the fuel life cycle is regarded as a global optimization problem. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximal outlet temperature difference of assembly channels during the fuel life cycle, while the input variable is the inlet resistance coefficient of each assembly channel. The simulated annealing algorithm is applied to the optimization code. The results show that the maximal outlet temperature difference is significantly reduced after optimization, and the resultant core outlet temperature distribution becomes more uniformed. Further evaluation indicates that the optimal solution has good applicability and stability under different reactor conditions. A comparison of the optimization objective function using different temperature difference definitions is also studied in the current study.</jats:p>"

This work presents the first three-dimensional reconstruction of a state-of-the-art TiO2-supported IrO2 based core shell catalyst layer (3 mgIrO2/cm2), using high-resolution X-ray ptychographic tomography at cryogenic temperature of 90 K. The high data quality and phase sensitivity of the technique have allowed the reconstruction of all four phases namely pore space, IrO2, TiO2 support matrix and the ionomer network, the latter of which has proven to be a challenge in the past. Results show that the IrO2 forms thin nanoporous shells around the TiO2 particles and that the ionomer has a non-uniform thickness and partially covers the catalyst. The TiO2 particles do not form a percolating network while all other phases have high connectivity. The analysis of the CL ionic and electronic conductivity shows that for a dry CL, the ionic conductivity is orders of magnitudes lower than the electronic conductivity. Varying the electronic conductivity of the support phase by simulations, reveals that the conductivity of the support does not have a considerable impact on the overall CL electrical conductivity.</jats:p>"

The material selected are materials that are commonly employed for electrical machines components. It was found that gray cast iron core has the lowest natural frequency for each mode from 1 to 3.

However, to assure the sustainability required for the long-term success, nuclear will need to deliver innovative solutions as proposed in iMAGINE. One of the most attractive features, but also a key challenge for the envisaged highly integrated nuclear energy system is the need for a demand driven salt clean-up system. The work described provides an insight into the interplay between a potential salt clean-up system and the reactor operation in a plutonium started core in a dynamic approach. The results presented will help to optimize the parameters for the salt clean-up process as well as to understand the differences which appear between a core started with enriched Uranium and Plutonium as the fissile material. The integrated model is used to investigate the effects of the initial fissile material on core size, achievable burnup, and long term operation. Different approaches are tested to achieve a higher burnup in the significantly smaller Pu driven core. The effects of different clean-up system throughputs on the concentration of fission products in the reactor salt and its consequences are discussed for general molten salt reactor design. Finally, an investigation of how a plutonium loaded core could be used to provide fuel for future reactors through fuel salt splitting is presented with the outcome that one Pu started reactor of the same size as a uranium started core could deliver fuel for 1.5 new cores due to enhanced breeding. The results provide an essential understanding for the progress of iMAGINE as well as the basis for inter-disciplinary work required for optimizing iMAGINE.</jats:p>"

From an evolutionary perspective, Crow (1997) proposed that “schizophrenia is the price that Homo sapiens pays for the faculty of language”. Epidemiological and experimental evidence points to an overlap between FTD and AVHs, yet a thorough investigation examining their shared neural mechanism in schizophrenia is lacking. In this review, we synthesize observations from three key domains. First, neuroanatomical evidence indicates substantial shared abnormalities in language-processing regions between FTD and AVHs, even in the early phases of schizophrenia. Second, neurochemical studies point to a glutamate-related dysfunction in these language-processing brain regions, contributing to verbal production deficits. Third, genetic findings further show how genes that overlap between schizophrenia and language disorders influence neurodevelopment and neurotransmission. We argue that these observations converge into the possibility that a glutamatergic dysfunction in language-processing brain regions might be a shared neural basis of both FTD and AVHs. Investigations of language pathology in schizophrenia could facilitate the development of diagnostic tools and treatments, so we call for multilevel confirmatory analyses focused on modulations of the language network as a therapeutic goal in schizophrenia.</jats:p>"

This interferometry system is of the Michelson type and is based on the heterodyne principle, with two independent solid-state sources that can deliver an output power of up to 50 mW. A high time resolution measurement of &amp;lt;1 µs can be derived by tuning the frequency of one source in the frequency range of 312–324 GHz on the new system, which can realize the fluctuation measurement. We successfully measured the line-averaged electron density in high-density plasma experiments. The measured density agreed well with a microwave interferometer measurement using a different viewing chord, demonstrating that the new system can be used for routine diagnostics of electron density in Heliotron J.</jats:p>",

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the effect of 8 weeks of core stability training on core stability performance in aerials. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a control group (CG; <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 4male + 5female; age 15.89 ± 1.54 years; height 163.11 ± 6.19 cm; weight 55.33 ± 5.07 Kg) and a training group (TG; <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 4male+5female; age 16.11 ± 2.47 years; height 161.56 ± 5.25 cm; weight 57.56 ± 8.11 Kg). Body shape, the performance of core stability, and landing kinetics were measured after 8 weeks of core stability training. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare baseline values between groups. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (time × group) was used. Results: The TG improved body shape, and waist circumference (t = −2.333, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.020).

However, less attention has been paid to the negative posttraumatic changes (i.e., posttraumatic depreciation, PTD) that might occur after a traumatic experience. This study aimed to investigate the role of a series of psychological factors (e.g., disruption of core beliefs, rumination, and depressive symptoms) in predicting PTG and PTD, separately considered. Methods: To reach this goal, 601 participants who experienced different types of traumatic events were recruited. They were asked to indicate sociodemographic and trauma-related information and to complete self-report measures assessing PTG/PTD, core beliefs, rumination, and depressive symptoms. Results: The results of regression analyses showed that gender, age, time since the trauma, core beliefs, deliberate/intrusive rumination, and depressive symptoms were significant predictors of PTG. Conversely, core beliefs, intrusive rumination, and depressive symptoms were found to be positively related to PTD. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings highlight the role that different psychological factors may play in the manifestation of the PTG and/or PTD dimensions. From a clinical perspective, professionals should pay attention to these factors when a person struggles in coping with a highly stressful experience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Penggunaan plat sandwich pada struktur kapal semakin meluas. Steel based hybrid sandwich banyak digunakan sebagai alternatif pengganti plat baja berpenegar. Plat sandwich ini terdiri dari faceplate berupa baja dan core material berupa matriks polyurethane elastomer. Perbedaan karakteristik pada dua material penyusun plat sandwich tersebut menyebabkan beberapa permasalahan. Salah satu permasalahan yang mungkin terjadi adalah kerusakan retak pada core material, yang menyebabkan lepasnya faceplate dari core-nya. Hal ini terjadi karena core material yang berupa matriks polyurethane relatif getas (brittle), sehingga rentan mengalami kerusakan ketika terkena pembebanan lebih atau berulang. Pada penelitian ini dilakukan analisis stress dan deformasi yang terjadi pada plat sandwich struktur geladak kapal, yang memiliki kerusakan retak pada core yang menyebabkan lepasnya lapisan faceplate dari core materialnya. Kerusakan core ini diasumsikan merepresentasikan retak mode I pada mekanika kepecahan. Analisis dilakukan dengan metode elemen hingga dengan bantuan software komputer. Beberapa model dengan variasi panjang keretakan dianalisis, untuk melihat pengaruh panjang keretakan terhadap stress, deformasi dan faktor intensitas stress pada model tersebut. Serta dievaluasi nilai panjang retak minimal saat mulai terjadinya perambatan retak. Hasil analisis menunjukkan bahwa tegangan maksimum (von misses) mengalami kenaikan secara linear dan signifikan terhadap kenaikan panjang keretakan. Tegangan maksimum pada kondisi utuh terjadi pada ujung-ujung kondisi batas jepit (fixed), sementara pada model dengan kerusakan berada pada sisi yang tidak mengalami keretakan. Deformasi juga mengalami kenaikan yang linear dan signifikan seiring dengan kenaikan panjang keretakan. Posisi deformasi maksimum berada pada ujung retakan. Nilai critical stress intensity factor (KIC) pada model adalah 6,90 dan panjang retak gagal (af) adalah 12,2 mm. Artinya perambatan retak akan terjadi ketika panjang retak mencapai 12,2 mm.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This disease rapidly reached pandemic status, presenting a serious threat to global health. However, the detailed molecular mechanism contributing to COVID-19 has not yet been elucidated.\n \nMETHODS: The expression profiles, including the mRNA levels, of samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 along with clinical data were obtained from the GSE152075 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify co-expression modules, which were then implemented to evaluate the relationships between fundamental modules and clinical traits. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were evaluated using R software packages.\n \nRESULTS: A total of 377 SARS-CoV-2-infected samples and 54 normal samples with available clinical and genetic data were obtained from the GEO database. There were 1444 DEGs identified between the sample types, which were used to screen out 11 co-expression modules in the WGCNA. Six co-expression modules were significantly associated with three clinical traits (SARS-CoV-2 positivity, age, and sex). Among the DEGs in two modules significantly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, enrichment was observed in the biological process of viral infection strategies (viral translation) in the GO analysis. The KEGG signalling pathway analysis demonstrated that the DEGs in the two modules were commonly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, and thermogenesis pathways. Moreover, a five-core gene set (RPL35A, RPL7A, RPS15, RPS20, and RPL17) with top connectivity with other genes was identified in the SARS-CoV-2 infection modules, suggesting that these genes may be indispensable in viral transcription after infection.\n \nCONCLUSION: The identified core genes and signalling pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can significantly supplement the current understanding of COVID-19. The five core genes encoding ribosomal proteins may be indispensable in viral protein biosynthesis after SARS-CoV-2 infection and serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19 treatment. These findings can be used as a basis for creating a hypothetical model for future experimental studies regarding associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection with ribosomal protein function.</jats:p>"

In this article, I concentrate on the aesthetic dimension of Winnicott's text and use it to explore the role of aesthetic experience in the development of self‐experience. I suggest that the paper's aesthetic dimension—form, quality and structure—expresses essential characteristics of the core of the self and the mature self's communication with it. I furthermore suggest that Winnicott, by use of poetic expression, offers the idea that the core, defined here as pre‐reflective experience, can be approached through aesthetic means. Building on George Hagman and Giuseppe Civitarese, I argue that aesthetic experience creates a bridge between pre‐reflective and reflective aspects of self‐experience and thus contributes to the integration of self. I suggest that forming a connection with the core can be seen as an aesthetic act where the intention is not to transform pre‐reflective experience into reflective. Since aesthetic experience includes reflection, the effort to represent the core of the self remains paradoxical.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Thermal bombs are a widely used method to artificially trigger explosions of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to determine their nucleosynthesis or ejecta and remnant properties. Recently, their use in spherically symmetric (1D) hydrodynamic simulations led to the result that 56,57Ni and 44Ti are massively underproduced compared to observational estimates for Supernova 1987A, if the explosions are slow, i.e. if the explosion mechanism of CCSNe releases the explosion energy on long time-scales. It was concluded that rapid explosions are required to match observed abundances, i.e. the explosion mechanism must provide the CCSN energy nearly instantaneously on time-scales of some ten to order 100 ms. This result, if valid, would disfavour the neutrino-heating mechanism, which releases the CCSN energy on time-scales of seconds. Here, we demonstrate by 1D hydrodynamic simulations and nucleosynthetic post-processing that these conclusions are a consequence of disregarding the initial collapse of the stellar core in the thermal-bomb modelling before the bomb releases the explosion energy. We demonstrate that the anticorrelation of 56Ni yield and energy-injection time-scale vanishes when the initial collapse is included and that it can even be reversed, i.e. more 56Ni is made by slower explosions, when the collapse proceeds to small radii similar to those where neutrino heating takes place in CCSNe. We also show that the 56Ni production in thermal-bomb explosions is sensitive to the chosen mass cut and that a fixed mass layer or fixed volume for the energy deposition cause only secondary differences. Moreover, we propose a most appropriate setup for thermal bombs.</jats:p>",

Multiple spectral peaks with an extremely high signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of up to 30 dB were generated simultaneously in a wide wavelength range. It was shown that part of the energy from the whole pulse spectrum was concentrated at the filtering part and constructed the intense spectral peaks.

The precession of a triaxial inner core with a different density than the fluid core induces a periodic gravity variation of degree 2, order 1. Elastic deformations from the pressure that the precessing fluid core exerts on the core‐mantle boundary also contribute to this gravity signal. We show that the periodic change in Stokes coefficients Δ<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>21</jats:sub> and Δ<jats:italic>S</jats:italic><jats:sub>21</jats:sub> for this signal of internal origin is of the order of 10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup>, similar in magnitude to the signal from solar tides. The relative contribution from the inner core increases with inner core radius and with the amplitude of its tilt angle with respect to the mantle. The latter depends on the strength of electromagnetic coupling at the inner core boundary which in turn depends on the radial magnetic field <jats:italic>B</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>r</jats:italic></jats:sub>; a larger <jats:italic>B</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>r</jats:italic></jats:sub> generates a larger tilt.

The unavailability of specific antibiotics for CDI treatment and its emerging cases worldwide further broaden the challenge to control CDI.\nMethods: The availability of a large number of genome sequences for C. difficile and many bioinformatics tools for genome analysis provides the opportunity for in silico pangenomic analysis. In the present study, 97 strains of C. difficilewere used for pangenomic studies and characterized for their phylogenomic and functional analysis.\nResults: Pangenome analysis reveals open pangenome of C. difficile and high genetic diversity. Sequence and interactome analysis of 1,481 core genes was done and eight potent drug targets are identified. Three drug targets, namely, aminodeoxychorismate synthase (PabB), d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase (DD-CPase) and undecaprenyl diphospho-muramoyl pentapeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (MurG transferase), have been reported as drug targets for other human pathogens, and five targets, namely, bifunctional diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase (cyclic-diGMP), sporulation transcription factor (Spo0A), histidinol-phosphate transaminase (HisC), 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase (DAHP synthase) and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PdcA), are novel.\nConclusion: The suggested potent targets could act as broad-spectrum drug targets for C. difficile.

In inflammation, neutrophils displayed considerable transcriptional diversity, but shared a core inflammation program across a broad range of conditions which was conserved between species. This core program included genes encoding IL-1 family members, CD14, IL-4R, CD69 and PD-L1. Chromatin accessibility of core inflammation genes increased significantly in blood compared to bone marrow and further with migration from blood to tissue. Transcription factor enrichment analysis nominated members of the NF-κB family and AP-1 complex as important drivers of the core inflammation program, and HoxB8 neutrophils with JUNB knockout showed a significantly reduced expression of core inflammation genes at baseline and upon stimulation. In vitro perturbations confirmed surface protein upregulation of core inflammation members in both species. Together, we demonstrate substantial transcriptional conservation in neutrophils in homeostasis and identify a core inflammation program conserved across species.

In this work, we focus on the synthesis and film formation behavior of a series of hard‐core/soft‐shell latexes with varying compositions. It is shown that below a hard‐core content of around 60 wt% the MFFT is almost exclusively dependent on the glass transition temperature of the polymer that forms the soft‐shell. Above hard‐core contents of 60 wt% there is an abrupt increase of the MFFT and film formation is significantly restricted. This behavior is ascribed to the packing behavior of the hard phase. It is shown that the MFFT can be decreased by the use of blends of core‐shell particles of different size such that the packing fraction of the hard domains is improved. This is demonstrated by the counterintuitive result that a blend of two latexes with high MFFT can result in a latex with significantly reduced MFFT. The mechanical properties of the resulting films are also explored in order to determine the limits of hard‐core/soft‐shell systems with regards to their use in coatings applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tissue engineering strategies that combine human pluripotent stem cell-derived myogenic progenitors (hPDMs) with advanced biomaterials provide promising tools for engineering 3D skeletal muscle grafts to model tissue development in vitro and promote muscle regeneration in vivo. We recently demonstrated (i) the potential for obtaining large numbers of hPDMs using a combination of two small molecules without the overexpression of transgenes and (ii) the application of electrospun fibrin microfiber bundles for functional skeletal muscle restoration following volumetric muscle loss. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that the biophysical cues provided by the fibrin microfiber bundles induce hPDMs to form engineered human skeletal muscle grafts containing multinucleated myotubes that express desmin and myosin heavy chains and that these grafts could promote regeneration following skeletal muscle injuries. We tested a genetic PAX7 reporter line (PAX7::GFP) to sort for more homogenous populations of hPDMs. RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses confirmed that PAX7::GFP-sorted hPDMs exhibited high expression of myogenic genes. We tested engineered human skeletal muscle grafts derived from PAX7::GFP-sorted hPDMs within in vivo skeletal muscle defects by assessing myogenesis, engraftment and immunogenicity using immunohistochemical staining. The PAX7::GFP-sorted groups had moderately high vascular infiltration and more implanted cell association with embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMHC) regions, suggesting they induced pro-regenerative microenvironments. These findings demonstrated the promise for the use of PAX7::GFP-sorted hPDMs on fibrin microfiber bundles and provided some insights for improving the cell–biomaterial system to stimulate more robust in vivo skeletal muscle regeneration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The continuous release of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) into the environment may bring about health concerns following human exposure. One important source of ENMs are silver nanoparticles (NPs) that are extensively used as anti-bacterial additives. The introduction of ENMs into the human body can occur via ingestion, skin uptake or the respiratory system. Therefore, evaluating how NPs translocate over bio-membranes is essential in assessing their primary toxicity. Unfortunately, data regarding membrane–NP interaction is still scarce, as is theoretical and in silico insight into what governs adhesion and translocation for the most relevant NPs and membranes. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular descriptions have the potential to alleviate this situation, but are hampered by the absence of a direct link to NP materials and membrane adhesion mechanisms. Here, we interrogate the relationship between the most common NP representation at the CG level and the adhesion characteristics of a model lung membrane. We find that this representation for silver NPs is non-transferable, meaning that a proper CG representation for one size is not suited for other sizes. We also identify two basic types of primary adhesion—(partial) NPs wrapping by the membrane and NP insertion into the membrane—that closely relate to the overall NP hydrophobicity and significantly differ in terms of lipid coatings. The proven non-transferability of the standard CG representation with size forms an inspiration for introducing a core-shell model even for bare NPs that are uniform in composition. Using existing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) data as a reference, we show that this extension does allow us to reproduce size-dependent NP adhesion properties and lipid responses to NP binding at the CG level. The subsequent CGMD evaluation for 10 nm Ag NPs provides new insight into membrane binding for relevant NP sizes and into the role of water in trapping NPs into defected mixed monolayer–bilayer states. This development will be instrumental for simulating NP–membrane adhesion towards more experimentally relevant length and time scales for particular NP materials.</jats:p>"

Here, an epitaxial ferromagnetic La0.67Ba0.33Mn0.95Ti0.05O3 (LBMTO-5) thin film was grown on SrTiO3(001) single crystal substrate by pulsed laser deposition. High-resolution X-ray diffraction proved the high crystallinity of the film with tetragonal symmetry. The magnetic, magnetocaloric and magnetoresistance properties at different directions of the applied magnetic field with respect to the ab plane of the film were investigated. An in-plane uni-axial magnetic anisotropy was evidenced. The LBMTO-5 epilayer exhibits a second-order ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition around 234 K together with a metal–semiconductor transition close to this Curie temperature (TC). The magnetic entropy variation under 5 T induction of a magnetic field applied parallel to the film surface reaches a maximum of 17.27 mJ/cm3 K. The relative cooling power is 1400 mJ/cm3 K (53% of the reference value reported for bulk Gd) for the same applied magnetic field. Giant magnetoresistance of about 82% under 5 T is obtained at a temperature close to TC. Defined as the difference between specific resistivity obtained under 5 T with the current flowing along the magnetic easy axis and the magnetic field oriented transversally to the current, parallel and perpendicular to the sample plane, respectively, the in-plane magneto-resistance anisotropy in 5 T is about 9% near the TC.</jats:p>"

In the fabrication of such devices, hole channels with a high-aspect ratio (HAR) are etched through these layers. The higher the aspect ratio becomes, the more difficulties the HAR etching faces. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was performed to examine the etching of silicon dioxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiN), and oxide-nitride (ON) stacked layers by energetic fluorocarbon ions. Good agreement of etching yields obtained from the simulations and ion beam experiments was observed for the etching of SiO2 and SiN by CF3+ ions for the incident ion energy ranging from 200 to 2000 eV. As to the etching of the ON bilayer, the SiO2 and SiN layers were observed to be etched with their own etch rates at low ion incident energy. However, at sufficiently high incident ion energy, the oxide and nitride layers were mixed by energetic ion impact and the depth of the mixing layer exceeded the thickness of the top SiO2 layer thickness, resulting in a single etch rate limited by the etch rate of a much deeper underlying SiN material. This suggests that if the incident ion energy is high enough such that the thicknesses of the multilayers are lower than the ion penetration depth, the ON stacked layer exhibits a single etch rate determined by the mixed material of the oxide and nitride.</jats:p>",

Looking at the recent developments made by different satellite missions, a dual core-halo electron distribution is employed that represents a true picture of solar wind electrons. We employ Vlasov–Maxwell’s model equations and derive the dispersion relation of the O-wave whose analytical solution characterizes the growth rate of O-mode instability. We take different sets of temperature anisotropy and beta combinations associated with core-halo electron components that highlight the instability characteristics e.g. growth rate and the range of wave number of unstable mode. We note an increment in the growth rate with the increase of anisotropic ratios associated either with core electrons or halo electrons and or the combination thereof. In view of a global perspective of solar wind, it may be a favorable study with the contribution of non-thermal solar wind electrons.</jats:p>",

The findings of structural equation modeling (SEM) reflected the contributions of L2 grit and CSA to overcoming language learners’ experienced anxiety. Furthermore, the significant influence of EFL learners’ CSA on FLA was concluded.

Study Design: Retrospective study Place and Duration: This retrospective study was conducted at Department of Orthopaedic, Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar during the period from April, 2022 to September, 2022. Methods: There were 96 patients were presented in this study. All patients with a primary bone or soft tissue tumour suspected of being malignant who receive a percutaneous CNB or open biopsy and subsequently develop a tumour were included. Patients were equally divided in two groups. Group I had 48 patients and received open incisional biopsy and group II received core needle biopsy in 48 cases. Fischer’s test was used to compared outcomes among both groups. SPSS 23.0 was used to analyze all data. Results:  We found that 28 patients in group I and 30 patients in group II were males. Mean age of the cases in group I was 51.6±7.48 years and in group II mean age was 54.7±10.34 years. As per anatomical distribution, lower extremity was the most common in both groups followed by trunk and upper extremity. In our study favorable outcomes were obtained by CNB in bone sarcoma in terms of diagnostic accuracy, NPV, PPV, sensitivity and specificity as compared to open biopsy but difference was insignificant and in soft tissue sarcoma open biopsy showed a significant good result with p value &lt;0.005. Conclusion: Results from our study showed that the percutaneous biopsy approach was only slightly less effective than open biopsy for soft tissue tumours, whereas the open biopsy technique was more effective for bone tumours.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Three-dimensional surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform based on microstructure fibers has many advantages for rapid liquid detection due to its microfluidic channels and light guidance. The fiber mode field distribution determines the light-analyte interaction strength but has rarely been studied in SERS applications. In this paper, we numerically and experimentally investigate the mode field distribution in suspended-core fibers decorated with gold nanoparticles. The interaction between the core mode and surface mode is controlled by changing the density of gold nanoparticles on the inner surface. The avoided crossing wavelength shifts linearly to red with the decrease of the nanoparticle spacing. With an optimized nanoparticle spacing of 20 nm, the avoided crossing occurs near the laser wavelength of 633 nm, which greatly increases the power ratio in the liquid channels and hence improves the SERS performance. The detection limit for crystal violet was 10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup> M, and the enhancement factor was 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup>. The avoided crossing mechanism can be applied to all fiber SERS probes for sensitivity improvement.</jats:p>",

Presence of Si and S affects electrical and thermal transport properties and thus influences core thermal processes and evolution. Paleomagnetic observations constrain a high intensity magnetic field that ceases shortly after formation of the moon (~ 3.5–4.2 Ga year ago), and thermal convection in the core may contribute to generation of this field. In this study, the electrical resistivity of Fe-14 wt% Si-3 wt% S was measured in both solid and molten states at pressures up to 5 GPa and thermal conductivity was calculated via the Wiedemann–Franz Law from the electrical measurements. The results were used to estimate the adiabatic conductive heat flux of a molten Fe-14 wt% Si-3 wt% S lunar core and compared to a Fe-2-17 wt% Si lunar core, which showed that thermal convection of either core composition shuts down within the duration of the high intensity magnetic field: (1) 3.17–3.72 Ga year ago for a Fe-14 wt% Si-3 wt% S core; and (ii) 3.38–3.86 Ga years ago for a Fe-2-17 wt% Si core. Results favouring compatibility of these core compositions with paleomagnetic observations are strongly dependent on the temperature of the core-mantle boundary and time-dependent mantle-side heat flux.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The era of single processors had almost reached a saturation state, and the industry had moved to multi-core processors for the newer generation of many-core architecture. Interconnections between multiple cores with network on chip (NoC) surpass traditional bus architecture for its quality of service (QoS) and other additional services. Seamless communication among the cores is more significant for better performance and the proper utilization of the cores. The rise in the cores count in a semiconductor chip adds the complexity of the communication among cores. Cache misses request and packet transmission’s traffic possibly will reduce the performance of the architecture. A theoretical game-based methodology is proposed to improvise the performance and communication by routing the request packets in the NoC of the many core architectures and the throughput is maximized with reduced latency by using the stag-hunt game (SHG) model. The proposed communication algorithm routes the packets in an adaptive way by detecting the congestion in routers. The SHG based odd-even routing algorithm is adaptive and can divert the packets towards less congested routers using the information gathered about congestion in the system, so that the overall performance of the system in terms of latency and throughput is improved.</jats:p>"

The Buginese culture belongs to the Bugis people. Bugis people are a community that occupies the area of South Sulawesi alongside the Makassar, Toraja, and Mandar ethnics. They live in harmony and form social systems and institutions. As an ethnic that dominates the population of South Sulawesi, the Bugis ethnic strongly maintains their culture. This can be seen in their principle of core values in the Buginese culture. The core values of Buginese are also a reflection of their worldview in this life. This study aims to uncover 1) the principle of core values of Buginese ethnic through their cultural ideologies, and 2) the aspect of philosophy, religion, and moral perspectives behind their principle of core values. This study utilizes the Cultural Semantics theory with an interpretive qualitative method, which relies on its analysis of the descriptive meaning of expressions. The results of this study indicate that the principle of core values of Buginese culture is awake because they practice the cultural heritage of their ancestors by actualizing it in a contemporary context.

This is especially true for hosts such as marine macroalgae where the taxonomic composition of the microbiome is highly diverse and variable in space and time. Identifying core taxa is one way forward but there are many methods and thresholds in use. This study leverages a large dataset of microbial communities associated with the widespread brown macroalga, <jats:italic>Fucus distichus,</jats:italic> across sites and years on one island in British Columbia, Canada. We compare three different methodological approaches to identify core taxa at the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level from this dataset: (1) frequency analysis of taxa on <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> performed over the whole dataset, (2) indicator species analysis (IndVal) over the whole dataset that identifies frequent taxa that are enriched on <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> in comparison to the local environment, and (3) a two-step IndVal method that identifies taxa that are consistently enriched on <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> across sites and time points. We then investigated a <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> time-series dataset to see if those core taxa are seasonally consistent on another remote island in British Columbia, Canada. We then evaluate host-specificity of the identified <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> core ASVs using comparative data from 32 other macroalgal species sampled at one of the sites.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We show that a handful of core ASVs are consistently identified by both frequency analysis and IndVal approaches with alternative definitions, although no ASVs were always present on <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> and IndVal identified a diverse array of <jats:italic>F. distichus</jats:italic> indicator taxa across sites on Calvert Island in multiple years. Frequency analysis captured a broader suit of taxa, while IndVal was better at identifying host-specific microbes. Finally, two-step IndVal identified hundreds of indicator ASVs for particular sites/timepoints but only 12 that were indicators in a majority (&gt; 6 out of 11) of sites/timepoints. Ten of these ASVs were also indicators on Quadra Island, 250 km away.

All participants were free of injuries at least two weeks prior to the study, experienced (training experience: 8.5 ± 3.3 years) handball players who were tested mid-season in the evening of one of their training sessions. Pearson correlations were calculated for core muscle strength endurance with (a) shoulder mobility/stability and (b) throwing velocity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A hybrid photonic bandgap effect in twisted hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers (HC-PBFs) is theoretically investigated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Due to the topological effect, twisting of the fibers changes the effective refractive index and lifts the degeneracy of the photonic bandgap ranges of the cladding layers. This twist-induced hybrid photonic bandgap effect shifts up the center wavelength and narrows the bandwidth of the transmission spectrum. A quasi-single-mode low-loss transmission is achieved in the twisted 7-cell HC-PBFs with a twisting rate <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">α</jats:italic> = 7–8 rad/mm, which has a loss &lt; 30 dB/km and higher-order mode extinction ratio &gt; 15 dB.

Nevertheless, the bioaccessibility of phenolic acids was not significantly different between the gel matrices (p&gt;0.05). The release of all phenolics was almost complete (&gt;80%) at the oral phase (pH 7) and significantly lower at gastric phase (pH 3), then at intestinal phase, the release was either increased or significantly reduced depending on the phenolic acid structure.

Here we report our findings five months post-acute COIVD-19.\n<jats:bold>METHODS:</jats:bold> Main outcomes and measures included pulmonary function tests, imaging tests, and a battery of symptom, physical, emotional, and cognitive assessments 5 months post-acute COVID-19.\n<jats:bold>FINDINGS:</jats:bold> Dyspnea, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, brain fog, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms but there were generally no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts (p&gt;0.05). Many patients had abnormal physical, emotional, and cognitive scores, but most functioned independently; there were no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts (p&gt;0.05). Six-minute walk test, lung ultrasound, and diaphragm excursion were abnormal but only in the hospitalized cohort. Pulmonary function tests showed moderately restrictive pulmonary function only in the hospitalized cohort but no obstructive pulmonary function. Newly detected major neurological events, microvascular disease, atrophy, and white-matter changes were rare, but lung opacity and fibrosis-like findings were common after acute COVID-19.\n<jats:bold>INTERPRETATION:</jats:bold> Many COVID-19 survivors experienced moderately restrictive pulmonary function, and significant symptoms across the physical, emotional, and cognitive health domains. Newly detected brain imaging abnormalities were rare, but lung imaging abnormalities were common. This study provides insights into post-acute sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection in neurological and pulmonary systems which may be used to support at-risk patients, develop effective screening methods and interventions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Obtaining the core temperature of the cable joint is vital to ensure the safe operation of the modern power system with integration. To improve the speed and accuracy of core temperature inversion, this study proposed a non-embedded cable joint temperature inversion method named uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and the improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) optimized the back propagation neural network (BPNN). Firstly, UMAP is used to reduce the feature dimension of sample data input and enhance the data visualization effect. After dimension reduction, the model input features are consistent with the international ampacity calculation standard, and the calculation speed and accuracy of the model are improved. To improve the optimization ability of SSA, the Tent chaotic operator is introduced, and then the ISSA is used to optimize BPNN to address the issue of unstable output and easy falling into a local minimum. At last, the optimization ability and temperature inversion effect of the improved model were compared with other competing algorithms based on the 10 kV cable joint temperature-rise test and CEC2017 benchmark function. The experimental results show that the proposed method shortens the calculation time of the model, and the mean absolute error of temperature inversion is about 0.1°C. The overall performance is the most outstanding, the training data set is unbiased, and the interpretability of the model improves, which can provide a reliable reference for line operation and maintenance personnel.</jats:p>"

In this work, we reconstruct the Sgr core morphology and kinematics on the basis of a model that has already successfully reproduced the Sgr stream. Here we use a very high resolution model that almost resolves individual stars in the Sgr core. It reproduces most of the observed morphology and kinematic properties, without specific fine tuning. We also show that the dark matter may have been almost entirely stripped by Milky Way tides after two passages at the pericenter. Finally the model predicts that the Sgr core will be fully disrupted within the next 2 Gyr.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Elastic anisotropy of iron-bearing alloys and compounds can lead to a variation of seismic velocities along different directions in planetary cores. Understanding the deformation properties of candidate core-forming materials is thus necessary to reveal the details about the interior of distant planets. Silicon has been considered to be one of the dominant light elements in the cores. Here we investigated the deformation of the ε-FeSi phase up to 49 GPa and 1100 K employing the radial X-ray diffraction technique in diamond anvil cells. Stoichiometric FeSi is a good approximation for the deformation behavior of the Fe-FeSi system and the low-pressure polymorph of FeSi may be the stable phase in the cores of small terrestrial planets such as Mercury. Yield strength in ε-FeSi is higher than in hcp-Fe and hcp-Fe-Si alloys, in the temperature range we investigated here the temperature has little influence on the lattice strain parameters, yield strength, and anisotropy within experimental precision. The azimuthal anisotropy of the longitudinal sound waves in ε-FeSi is below 0.6% at low pressure and decreases further with compression, while the shear wave contrast is below 1.25% in the entire investigated pressure range. Therefore, polycrystalline aggregates of iron silicide are nearly isotropic at extreme conditions. Consequently, any observed anisotropy in planetary cores will be incompatible with silicon being the dominant light element in the core composition.</jats:p>"

The coordinated movement of the shoulder helps in the proximal to distal activation of the kinetic chain. Overhead motion in badminton players requires coordinated movement from feet to hand, which is activated by core muscles. \nObjectives: To find out the association between shoulder pain and core strength. \nMethodology: sixty-two badminton players were randomly included in the study. Demographic Data (name, age, gender) were considered. SPADI was used to assess shoulder pain and core strength was assessed by Dynamic abdominal endurance (DET) and isometric Flexion test (IFT), Biering- Sorensen fatigue test (BSFT), Dynamic horizontal right side support test (DHRS) and Dynamic horizontal left side support test (DHLS). All participants completed the entire study duration and treatment parameters are measured before and after the study. \nResults: Results show a moderate association between shoulder pain and core strength using SPAI and IFT (phi Cramer's V = - 0.229, whereas a strong association was found between shoulder pain and DET (phi Cramer's V = -0.418), BSFT (phi Cramer's V = -0.306), DHRS (phi Cramer's V = -0.324), and DHLS (phi Cramer's V = -0.376).  \nConclusion: This study concludes that there is a strong association between shoulder pain and core muscles strength in badminton players.\n\nKey words: shoulder pain, core strength, SPADI, badminton players.</jats:p>"

This tendency codefines the dark factor of personality (D), which is conceptualized as the underlying disposition from which all socially and ethically aversive (dark) traits arise as specific, flavored manifestations. We scrutinize this unique theoretical notion by testing, for a broad set of 58 different traits and related constructs, whether any predict how individuals weigh their own versus others’ utility in proactive allocation decisions (i.e., social value orientations) beyond D. These traits and constructs range from broad dimensions (e.g., agreeableness), to aversive traits (e.g., sadism) and beliefs (e.g., normlessness), to prosocial tendencies (e.g., compassion). In a large-scale longitudinal study involving the assessment of consequential choices (median N = 2,270; a heterogeneous adult community sample from Germany), results from several hundred latent model comparisons revealed that no meaningful incremental variance was explained beyond D. Thus, D alone is sufficient to represent the social preferences inherent in socially and ethically aversive personality traits. </jats:p>",

Since the new products resulting from this process often require assembly as part of their manufacturing processes, it becomes necessary to promote a functional information representation for the assembly domain. Several authors have proposed different core concepts to represent the information related to assembly. However, the resulting body of knowledge is fragmented and lacks a unified concept and definition of the information this concept should contain to be broadly adopted by the academy and industry. This study aims to identify and characterize the core concepts used to enclose the assembly information (e.g., assembly features, ports, connectors, and others) by conducting a literature review in the domain of discrete manufacturing, considering the period between 1985 and 2022. It was found that the literature is rich in concepts but often diverging: a clear depiction of the assembly information required by the involved stakeholders during the whole product development process remains elusive. This work's contribution addresses this gap by identifying the perspectives from which the assembly information can be studied, and the information required to describe the assembly process fully. The resulting information requirements were used to assess the existing approaches addressing assembly information representation. These findings can be used as a base to establish a comprehensive assembly information representation in the future.</jats:p>",

The samples are characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, broadband dielectric spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Widely known relaxations such as <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>, normal mode and interfacial polarisation are observed and discussed. An additional relaxation named omega (<jats:italic>ω</jats:italic>) is also observed, whose dielectric strength is inversely correlated to the crystallinity of the nanoparticles. We suggest that this may be attributed to the polarizing interaction of the hydroxyl groups of silanols with the hydroxy ether groups of the polymer chain. The <jats:italic>ω</jats:italic> is absent in DMA confirming it as a polarisation phenomenon. At lower concentration of silanols, the <jats:italic>ω</jats:italic> largely overlaps with <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>, effectively becoming an integral part of it. Finally, two interfacial polarisation relaxations are observed in the case of core–shell structures, originating from the core–shell and shell–polymer interface but, due to the similar real permittivity values of the core, shell and the polymer, their dielectric strength is weak.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is provided to study the supersonic flutter behavior of sandwich plates with a magnetorheological (MR) core and polymeric face sheets reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The mathematical modelings of the plate and the aerodynamic pressure of the fluid flow are performed utilizing the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and the linear piston theory, respectively. The effective mechanical properties of the face sheets are estimated utilizing the rule of mixture along with the Halpin–Tsai model. Hamilton’s principle is employed to derive the governing equations and associated boundary conditions and these equations are solved using a semi-analytical approach for a Levy-type plate. The influences of different parameters on the aeroelastic stability of the plate are investigated such as the thickness of the MR core, magnetic field intensity, distribution pattern and mass fraction of the GNPs, boundary conditions, and geometrical parameters of the plate. This paper is the first theoretical attempt to study the effects of MR materials on the aeroelastic stability of Levy-type moderately thick sandwich plates and presents useful results that will be useful in the future of air vehicles. </jats:p>",

In the conventional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) scheme, a substantial portion of massive stars, e.g. all stars in the mass range of 8–100 M⊙, are assumed to enrich the Galaxy with their nucleosynthetic products. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the observations, namely, few CCSNe whose progenitor stars are more massive than ∼18 M⊙. Here, we show that the chemical characteristics shaped by local thin disc stars are compatible with the predictions by enrichment via CCSNe limited to less massive progenitors in the new paradigm of Galactic dynamics that allows stars to migrate from the inner disc. This renewed GCE model predicts that the bursting star formation events − which are considered to take place in the Galactic bulge and in the thick disc − generate more numerous low-mass CCSNe than those expected from the locally determined canonical initial mass function. This finding suggests a high rate of CCSNe in early-type galaxies, which reflects a unique cosmic history of the CCSN rate. With considerable contributions from these galaxies to the cosmic star formation rates in the early Universe, we predict a more steeply increasing slope of the CCSN rate with increasing redshift than that in proportion to cosmic star formation. This predicted redshift evolution agrees well with the measured rates for $0 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.8$; however, its predicted CCSN rate for higher z calls for more precise data from future surveys.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor. Immune therapies have had limited effect, but not much is known about the frequency and type of immune cells in the infiltration zone and periphery. In these areas, tumor cells migrate into the brain parenchyma and prevent total tumor resection thereby leading to recurrence. This study aims to quantify the type and distribution of immune cells in glioblastomas. A cohort of 67 glioblastomas was established containing tissue from central tumor and/or infiltration zone and/or tumor periphery. Patients were included if most tumor cells were positive in immunohistochemical staining for P53. A multiplex staining was established, where tissue sections were stained with P53 (tumor cells), FOXP3 (FOXP3+ regulatory T cells), CD8 (CD8+ cytotoxic T cells) and IBA1 (microglia/macrophages). Cells were counted in tumor core, infiltration zone and periphery using Visiopharm software based on training of convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the number of tumor cells with immune cells in proximity (30 µm) was quantified. The number of CD8+, FOXP3+ and Iba1+ cells was significantly higher in the core than in the periphery (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and in the infiltration zone than in the periphery (P &amp;lt; 0.001). However, the CD8+, FOXP3+ and Iba1+ cells/tumor cell ratio increased from core to infiltration zone and to periphery (P &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a higher amount of tumor cells with CD8+ cells in proximity in the tumor core (P &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas the highest amount of tumor cells with IBA1+ cells and FOXP3+ cells in proximity was the infiltration zone (P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, although levels of immune cells are highest in the tumor core - the higher proximity and ratio of immune cells to tumor cells in the infiltration zone/periphery suggest immune-suppressive mechanisms to be active in these areas.</jats:p>",

Computing integration activities use computing tools, like programming, to support learning in non-computing disciplines. The paper begins with the motivation for integrating computing that encouraged widespread buy-in, design goals, and design parameters. The primary motivating factor for this work was preparing teachers to use technology to support learning in their classrooms. Involving computing education faculty in the preparation enabled the activities to include computer science and spread computational literacy. The paper also describes the process and year-long timeline for designing and implementing the integrations, followed by the details of the computing integrated activities. Last, the paper describes preservice teachers’ reactions to computing integration, focusing on before-and-after perceptions and knowledge of computing. Preservice teachers perceptions and knowledge of computing evolved similarly to teachers who engage in different approaches to learning about integrated computing, such as in elective or educational technology courses, suggesting that this approach is effective for engaging all teachers in integrating computing. In particular, the common feature that ignited teachers’ excitement about integrating computing was offering new opportunities to improve student learning and providing engaging activities within their non-computing discipline.</jats:p>"

Here, we have introduced a new approach to directly synthesis the core–shell of Au@Cu and its Au@Cu<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O oxides on an FTO electrode for non-enzymatic glucose detection. Physical vapor deposition of Au thin film followed by thermal annealing has been used to fabricate Au nanocores on the electrode. The Cu shells have been deposited selectively on the Au cores using an electrodeposition method. Additionally, Au@Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and Au@CuO have been synthesized via post thermal annealing of the Au@Cu electrode. This binder-free and selective-growing approach has the merit of high electrooxidation activity owing to improving electron transfer ability and providing more active sites on the surface. Electrochemical measurements indicate the superior activity of the Au@Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O electrode for glucose oxidation. The high sensitivity of 1601 μAcm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> mM<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and a low detection limit of 0.6 μM are achieved for the superior electrode. Additionally, the sensor indicates remarkable reproducibility and supplies accurate results for glucose detection in human serums. Moreover, this synthesis approach can be used for fast, highly controllable and precise fabrication of many core–shell structures by adjusting the electrochemical deposition and thermal treatment parameters.</jats:p>"

This perspective article aims to highlight the potential benefits of adopting experimental settings involving two or more participants (the so-called “second person” approach) for studying the neural bases of organizational behaviour. Specifically, we stress the idea that moving beyond the individual perspective and capturing the dynamical relationships occurring within dyads or groups (e.g., leaders and followers, salespersons and clients, teams) might bring novel insights into the rising field of ON. In addition, designing research paradigms that reliably recreate real work and life situations might increase the generalizability and ecological validity of its results. We start with a brief overview of the current state of ON research and we continue by describing the second-person approach to social neuroscience. In the last paragraph, we try and outline how this approach could be extended to ON. To this end, we focus on leadership, group processes and emotional contagion as potential targets of interpersonal ON research.</jats:p>"

We used the HBc-VLP platform for expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigenic epitope.\n<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Insertion of the selected epitope was done into the major immunodominant region (MIR) of truncated (149 residues) hepatitis B core capsid protein. The chimeric protein was constructed in PET28a<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and expressed through the bacterial <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> BL21 expression system. However, the protein was expressed in inclusion body forms and they were extracted following urea denaturation from the insoluble phase. Following the extraction, the vaccine protein was purified using Ni2+ iminodiacetic acid (IDA) affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and western blotting were used to confirm the protein expression. Regarding the denaturation step, the unavoidable refolding process was carried out, so that the chimeric VLP reassembled in native conformation. Based on the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) microscopic analysis, the HBC VLP was successfully assembled. Confirming the assembled chimeric VLP, we explored the immunogenic effectivity of the vaccine through mice immunization with two-dose vaccination with and without adjuvant. The utilization of adjuvant was suggested to assess the effect of adjuvant on improving the immune elicitation of chimeric VLP-based vaccine.  Immunization analysis based on anti-spike specific IgG antibody showed a significant increase in antibody production in harvested serums from immunized mice with HBc-VLP harboring antigenic epitope compared to HBc-VLP and PBS-injected mice.\n<jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold>The results approved the successful production and the effectiveness of the vaccine in terms of humoral IGG antibody production. Therefore, this platform can be considered a promising strategy for developing safe and reasonable vaccines; however, more complementary immunological evaluations are needed.</jats:p>"

Here, we use a library of eighteen layer-by-layer electrostatically assembled nanoparticles (LbL-NPs) to independently assess the impact of nanoparticle core stiffness and surface chemistry on<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>uptake and transport in three common assays, as well as intracellular trafficking in hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells. We demonstrate that nanoparticle core stiffness impacts the magnitude of material transported, while surface chemistry influences how the nanoparticles are trafficked within the cell. Finally, we demonstrate that these factors similarly dictate<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>BBB transport using intravital imaging through cranial windows in mice, and we discover that a hyaluronic acid surface chemistry provides an unpredicted boost to transport. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of considering factors such as assay geometry, nanomaterial labelling strategies, and fluid flow in designing preclinical assays to improve nanoparticle screening throughput for drug delivery to the brain.</jats:p>"

However, some CBF-AML patients have persistent measurable residual disease (MRD) and are more likely to relapse after standard chemotherapy treatment. The CAG regimen, composed of cytarabine, aclarubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, has been proven to be effective and safe in treating refractory AML patients.\n<jats:bold>Method: </jats:bold>We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy of the CAG regimen to eliminate MRD detected by RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and CBFβ::MYH11 transcript levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) among 23 patients. Molecular response was defined as the ratio of fusion transcript after treatment to that before treatment greater than or equal to 0.5.\n<jats:bold>Result:</jats:bold> The molecular response rate and median decrease ratio of fusion transcripts at themolecular level of the CAG regimen were 52.5% and 0.53, respectively. Among the 15 patients who had a poor molecular response to the high/intermediate-dose cytarabine regimen, the median decrease ratios of transcripts at the molecular level of high/intermediate-dose cytarabine and CAG were 1.55 and 0.53 (P=0.028), respectively, and 6 of 15 patients achieved amolecular response to CAG (40%). The median disease-free survival was 18 months, and the overall survival rate at three years among all patients was 72.7%±10.7%. The common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (100%), thrombocytopenia (39%) and neutropenia (37.5%).\n<jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The CAG regimen may have activity in CBF-AML patients and could provide a new option for patients who have a poor molecular response to high/intermediate-dose cytarabine.</jats:p>"

The sample comprised texts of the secondary school home economics teacher 1st selection test for the 2017-2022 school years. Determination of frequency of occurrence, generation of word clouds, centrality analysis, and topic modeling were performed using NetMiner 4.4. The key results were as follows. First, content analysis revealed that the number of questions and scores for each subject (field) has remained constant since 2020, unlike before 2020. In terms of subjects, most questions focused on ‘theory of home economics education’, and among the evaluation content elements, the highest percentage of questions asked was for ‘home economics teaching·learning methods and practice’. Second, the network of the secondary school home economics teacher selection test covering the 2017-2022 school years has an extremely weak density. For the 2017- 2019 school years, ‘learning’, ‘evaluation’, ‘instruction’, and ‘method’ appeared as important keywords, and 7 topics were extracted. For the 2020-2022 school years, ‘evaluation’, ‘class’, ‘learning’, ‘cycle’, and ‘model’ were influential keywords, and five topics were extracted. This study is meaningful in that it attempted a new research method combining content analysis and text network analysis and prepared basic data for the revision of the evaluation area and evaluation content elements of the secondary school home economics teacher selection test.</jats:p>"

The main part of the nuclear energy system is the reactor core, especially the most widely used Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). This reactor is the hottest part of the nuclear system; security risks and economic possibilities must be considered. Controlling this reactor can increase the security and efficiency of nuclear power systems. This study presents a dynamic model of the (PWR), including the reactor's core, the plenums of the upper and lower, and the connecting piping between the reactor core and steam generator. In addition, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) self-tuning PID Controller for the nuclear core reactor is presented. This adaptive controller is used to enhance the performance characteristics of PWR by supporting the profile of the reactor power, the coolant fuel, and hot leg temperatures. The suggested proposed ANFIS self-tuning controller is estimated through a comparison with the conventional PID, neural network, and fuzzy self-tuning controllers. The results showed that the proposed controller is best over traditional PID, neural network, and fuzzy self-tuning controllers. All simulations are throughout by using MATLAB/SIMULINK.</jats:p>"

Outcomes from research are contradictory. When we zoom out, we can be aware that violence is everywhere and that we are part of it. At the same time, we can sense that the world is full of love. Both are part of the destructive dynamics of escalating conflicts in families that are more related to powerlessness than to power. In a therapeutic context we focus on the destructive dynamics in which the languages of perpetrator and victim are not helpful.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The faithful segregation and inheritance of bacterial chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids requires dedicated partitioning systems. The most common of these, ParABS, consists of ParA, a DNA-binding ATPase and ParB, a protein that binds to centromeric-like <jats:italic>parS</jats:italic> sequences on the DNA cargo. The resulting nucleoprotein complexes are believed to move up a self-generated gradient of nucleoid-associated ParA. However, it remains unclear how this leads to the observed cargo positioning and dynamics. In particular, the evaluation of models of plasmid positioning has been hindered by the lack of quantitative measurements of plasmid dynamics. Here, we use high-throughput imaging, analysis and modelling to determine the dynamical nature of these systems. We find that F plasmid is actively brought to specific subcellular home positions within the cell with dynamics akin to an over-damped spring. We develop a unified stochastic model that quantitatively explains this behaviour and predicts that cells with the lowest plasmid concentration transition to oscillatory dynamics. We confirm this prediction for F plasmid as well as a distantly-related ParABS system. Our results indicate that ParABS regularly positions plasmids across the nucleoid but operates just below the threshold of an oscillatory instability, which according to our model, minimises ATP consumption. Our work also clarifies how various plasmid dynamics are achievable in a single unified stochastic model. Overall, this work uncovers the dynamical nature of plasmid positioning by ParABS and provides insights relevant for chromosome-based systems.</jats:p>"

Porphyry deposits are gaining in importance as a source of critical raw materials with the increasing global demand for these commodities. To date, minor and trace metal(loid)s are still commonly recovered as by-products from porphyry ores without prior characterization of their host mineralogy that could inform more efficient processing and improved recoveries. We report a comprehensive metal(loid) deportment study on a complete vein paragenetic series in samples from the northwestern high-grade zone of the Bingham Canyon Cu-Mo-Au porphyry deposit, Utah. The polyphase Bingham stock comprises an early premineralization equigranular monzonite phase that was intruded by a series of five successive, ore-related porphyry intrusions. Veins with hypogene Cu-(Fe) sulfide assemblages from all five porphyry intrusions were characterized for their trace metal(loid) contents by laser ablation-inductively coupled-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).</jats:p><jats:p>It was found that bornite and digenite contain elevated Bi, Ag, Te, and Se relative to chalcopyrite, whereas the latter contains elevated concentrations of Co, Ga, and In. A stepwise decline in sulfide abundance occurs over the porphyry intrusion sequence and is more pronounced in digenite and bornite than in chalcopyrite. The related diminishing concentration per rock volume (inventory) of Bi, Ag, Te, and Se in the youngest porphyry dikes could have been caused in part by a geochemical change in the mineralizing fluid supply across successive intrusive-hydrothermal cycles.</jats:p><jats:p>Element mapping of exsolved digenite within bornite revealed characterstic partitioning of metal(loid)s between bornite and digenite; most notably Ag, but also Te and Au are enriched in digenite relative to enclosing bornite. Bornite domains within these composite grains reveal complex zonation of Sn, In, and Bi, which are attributed to stress-induced diffusion within bornite, resulting from the digenite exsolution process. The selective partitioning of metal(loid)s between bornite and digenite is likely a common feature in many porphyry Cu deposits, given the fundamental mineralogical characteristics of these two sulfides. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of the distribution (from mineral to deposit scale) of critical trace metal(loid)s in porphyry deposits, particularly those containing exsolved digenite. This knowledge can be applied to determine more accurately the value of ore resources, to improve geometallurgical models and by-product recoveries, and to help limit the environmental effects of metal(loid) dispersion.</jats:p>",

The study group consisted of 160 subjects (74 women, 86 men) with a mean age of 20.26 ± 1.55. The Functional Movement Screen Test (FMS™), as well as the core stability tests including the lateral trunk muscles endurance test (the side bridge test), the abdominal muscles endurance test and the trunk extensors muscle endurance test—were used to evaluate the effects of core stability training. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in the FMS test scores before and after introducing a core stability exercise program. Initially, the average total score of the FMS test in female tennis players was 14.58 ± 2.91, and after core stability training it was 17.20 ± 1.68 (p &lt; 0.001). In the male group, the total FMS test score was 14.44 ± 2.76 before and 16.91 ± 1.36 after (p &lt; 0.001) in the final assessment. Additionally, statistically significant differences were observed in the core stability test scores before and after introducing a stabilisation training program. The results of the study showed that specific core strengthening exercises could improve the FMS test scores in adult tennis players. This may also have an influence on reducing injury risk in this group, although further studies would be required to test this.</jats:p>"

We show here it originated at the core‐mantle boundary (CMB) largely as a localized change in the field acceleration under north and central America. We find the impulse events in 1969 and 2017 involved similar amplitudes of field acceleration change with similar localized dipole structures. However in 1969 the acceleration change pattern was north‐south rather than east‐west oriented, and it propagated poleward rather than westward. Moreover, there was a distinctive local surge in the CMB secular variation leading up to the 1969 event. We propose the 1969 impulse resulted from hydromagnetic waves arriving at the CMB that were triggered by a convective burst near to the core surface; this event involved localized flux expulsion and inward propagating waves.</jats:p>",

Understanding the transcriptional landscape long after irradiation treatment that results in chronic salivary hypofunction will help identify injury mechanisms and develop regenerative therapies to address this need. Advances in single cell (sc)RNAseq have made it possible to identify previously uncharacterized cell types within tissues and to uncover gene regulatory networks that mediate cell-cell communication and drive specific cell states. scRNAseq studies have been performed for virtually all major tissues including salivary glands; however, there are currently no scRNAseq studies evaluating the long-term chronic effects of irradiation on salivary glands. Here, we present scRNAseq from control and irradiated murine parotid glands collected 10 months post-irradiation. We identify a population of epithelial cells in the gland defined by expression of<jats:italic>Etv1</jats:italic>, which may be an acinar cell precursor. These Etv1+ cells also express<jats:italic>Ntrk2</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Erbb3</jats:italic>and thus may respond to myoepithelial cell-derived growth factor ligands. Furthermore, our data suggests that CD4+CD8+ T-cells and secretory cells are the most transcriptionally affected during chronic injury with radiation, suggesting active immune involvement during chronic injury post-irradiation. Thus, our study provides a resource to understand the transcriptional landscape in a chronic post-irradiation microenvironment and identifies cell-specific pathways that may be targeted to repair chronic damage.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlights</jats:title><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>We generated a scRNAseq dataset of chronic irradiation injury in parotid glands</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>A newly identified<jats:italic>Etv1</jats:italic>+ epithelial population may be acinar precursors</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Ntrk2 and Erbb3 are highly specific Etv1+ cell receptors that may mediate cell-cell communication with myoepithelial cells</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>CD8+ T-cells and secretory acinar cells have the greatest transcriptional changes post-IR</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:sec>"

If captured gravitationally inside the core of the Sun, these WIMPs may produce high-energy neutrinos as the end product in case they undergo self-annihilations at the solar core. In this work, we address the detectability of such neutrinos at the proposed KM3NeT detector. Upper bounds of the detection rate for such neutrinos at KM3NeT are computed for the case of a generic dark matter scenario and also when specific models for particle dark matter are chosen. In this work, upper bounds of muon event rates for different annihilating dark matter masses are computed for each of the cases of dark matter annihilation channels (e.g. [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], etc.). These upper bounds are also computed by considering the dark matter scattering cross-section using upper bounds obtained from PandaX-4T direct dark matter search experiment. </jats:p>",

In this study, the effect of applied potential, electrolytic temperature, and types of electrolytic solution on yield, anode surface disintegration and microstructural properties of electrochemically synthesized GO has been investigated. The GO has been synthesized in an aqueous solution of 1 M piranha solution and sulfuric acid ([Formula: see text]) via electrochemical method by applying 24 V DC power source. After that, the GO was thermally reduced at around 650[Formula: see text]C in a muffle furnace, and cooled down inside the muffle furnace. The yield, pH of the electrolytic solution, and anode surface disintegration all looked to be affected by the applied voltage and electrolyte temperature. Between the temperatures of 50[Formula: see text]C and 70[Formula: see text]C, the maximum yield was observed. During UV–Vis and XRD investigation, the absorbance, crystal structure, and interplanar distance appear to be unaffected by the reduction temperature, high voltage, electrolyte temperature and hydrogen peroxide addition. As demonstrated by Raman spectra, TEM, FE-SEM, AFM, and TGA analysis, high voltage, electrolyte temperature, and hydrogen peroxide addition have an important effect on the degree of defect, microstructure, and oxygen percentage, surface roughness and thermal stability of thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO). </jats:p>",

Although steel is commonly used to make the core of BRBs, previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of annealed aluminum as a preferred core material because of its high ductility and high over‐strength. However, the deformation compatibility of the truss members with the aluminum‐core BRB in BRKB‐TMFs at high drifts is not well studied in the literature. Hence, an experimental study is performed on a scaled sub‐assemblage of a BRKB‐TMF frame designed using the Performance‐Based Plastic Design method. Cyclic tests are performed on 1:3 scale models of aluminum‐core BRB and BRKB‐TMF to evaluate their performance at drifts corresponding to Maximum Considered Earthquake intensity. Also, to further compare the performance of steel and aluminum as suitable BRB core materials, cyclic tests are performed on BRBs with steel and aluminum cores designed using a consistent criterion. The experiments demonstrated the superior performance of aluminum core BRB over steel core BRB. The experimental studies on the BRKB‐TMF concluded that per the design intent, the BRB acted like a fuse for the frame by restricting all the inelastic deformations to itself and the study frame could successfully meet the target drift criteria.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, treatment outcomes have been reported by clinicians after history and clinical examination in what is known as clinician‐reported outcomes (CROs). Much less commonly employed however, are patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) in which patients directly report on their condition. Endodontic treatment outcome reporting is evolving from a focus on CROs to increasing consideration for patient and disease‐focused outcomes, with different criteria being proposed for assessment of treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, this has led to considerable variability and a lack of consensus on the definition, appropriate measurement and reporting of these outcomes. Heterogeneity in outcome reporting in clinical research provides a significant major barrier to conduct meta‐analysis, guidelines development, clinical decision making, and ultimately affecting patient care. These effects could, however, be reduced by the establishment of a core outcome set (COS) in endodontics, which is defined as an agreed, standardized set of outcomes that should be included, measured and reported as a minimum in all trials and outcome studies. COS development is a regulated and validated process requiring involvement of appropriate stakeholders as well as a rigorous methodology. To date, COS has been developed for the management of traumatic dental injuries, orthodontic and periodontal treatment and is currently being developed for endodontic treatment. The aim of this review is to discuss the importance of COS in endodontics with focus on the evidence for and impact of heterogeneity in reporting endodontic treatment outcomes. An overview of an ongoing process for development of COS for different endodontic treatment modalities will also be provided.</jats:p>",

In this context, the use of legacy data originally acquired in the last fifty years for scientific projects and petroleum exploration and production activities would represent a suitable cost-effective solution and help to maximize the value of this extended national asset. Core material represents the only direct observation of subsurface deposits and must be preserved from the current disposal process related to the decommissioning of hydrocarbon fields. In this contribution, a suite of samples from core material stored at national (i.e. British Geological Survey) and local (i.e. Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London) core repositories, previously characterized at the micro scale using X-ray micro-computed tomographic (μCT) imaging are discussed. Using this technique, it has been possible to investigate how pore and grain geometries control crucial features of a suitable reservoir such as porosity and permeability. The aim of this contribution is to describe the methodology behind digital image analysis (DIA) following μCT imaging applied to core material. We show how DIA can be used to provide significant measures of reservoir suitability when making initial assessments of storage reservoirs, without the need for expensive and time-consuming analyses.</jats:p>",

The MSD and VAF are used to compute the diffusion coefficient of ions. The results are compared with the data computed neglecting the ion core effect. It is found that the ion core effect leads to a significant decrease in the diffusion coefficient. Additionally, we computed the viscosity coefficient of ions using the Green–Kubo relation connecting viscosity and the stress autocorrelation function.

Herein, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) were coaxial electrospun in core–shell structured fibers to create locally inhomogeneous microstructures deliberately. Through adjusting the functional group HFP/TrFE monomer ratio, P(VDF-HFP)/P(VDF-TrFE) hybrid polymer films with topological composition distribution have been elaborately designed, enabling gradient polarization distribution from core to shell. Compared with homogeneous hybrid films of the same composition, the core–shell structure significantly boosts breakdown strength, thus resulting in a significantly improved energy storage capacity. At an HFP/TrFE monomer ratio of 10:1, an optimal comprehensive energy storage performance has been achieved with Ue ∼ 20.7 J/cm3 and efficiency 67.8%; moreover, the film could maintain its energy storage performance after 106 charge/discharge cycles without reduction. Molecular dynamic simulation and finite element analysis have been employed in combination to reveal the dipole moments distribution at the molecular level and polarization distribution at the microscale, which further demonstrates that elaborate polarization distribution adjustment is an effective strategy toward high-performance electrostatic energy storage capacitors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water stable isotope records from ice cores (δ18O and δD) are a critical tool for constraining long-term temperature variability in the high-latitudes. However, precipitation in Antarctica consists of semi-continuous small events and intermittent extreme events. In regions of high-accumulation, this can bias ice core records towards recording the synoptic climate conditions present during extreme precipitation events. In this study we utilise a combination of ice core data, re-analysis products and models to understand how precipitation intermittency impacts the temperature records preserved in an ice core from Mount Brown South in East Antarctica. Extreme precipitation events represent only the largest 10 % of all precipitation events, but they account for 44 % of the total annual snowfall at this site leading to an over-representation of these events in the ice core record. Extreme precipitation events are associated with high-pressure systems in the mid-latitudes which cause increased transport of warm and moist air from the southern Indian Ocean to the ice core site. Warm temperatures associated with these events result in a +2.8 °C warm bias in the mean annual temperature when weighted by daily precipitation, and water isotopes in the Mount Brown South ice core are shown to be significantly correlated with local temperature when this precipitation-induced temperature bias is included. The Mount Brown South water isotope record spans more than 1000 years and will provide a valuable regional reconstruction of long-term temperature and hydroclimate variability in the data-sparse southern Indian Ocean region.\n                        </jats:p>"

This paper presents a two-part systematic investigation of wettability alteration during polymer injection into oil-wet limestone. The first part of the paper determines wettability and wetting stability on the core scale. The well-established Amott–Harvey method is used, and five full cycles performed with repeated spontaneous imbibition and forced displacements. Wettability alterations are measured in a polymer/oil system, to determine polymer influence on wettability, and evaluated towards simpler brine/oil and glycerol/oil systems, to determine reproducibility and uncertainty related to the method and fluid/rock system. Polymer injection into oil-wet limestone core plugs is shown to repeatedly and reproducibly reverse the core wettability towards water-wet. Wettability changed both quicker and towards stronger water-wet conditions with polymer solution as the aqueous phase compared to brine and glycerol. The second part of the paper attempts to explain the observed behavior; by utilizing in situ imaging by Positron Emission Tomography, an emerging imaging technology within the geosciences. High resolution imaging provides insight into fluid flow dynamics during water and polymer injections, identifying uneven displacement fronts and significant polymer adsorption.</jats:p>"

Several key elements of different structural design approaches for lightweight mirrors are discussed and compared, such as material, lightweight ratio, design methods, surface figure, etc. Finally, future challenges, trends, and prospects of lightweight design for mirrors are discussed.

Strengthening trunk muscles using core stabilisation exercises may have a positive effect on improving upper limb and lower limb function. Nevertheless, there is paucity of literature proving the effect of core stabilisation exercises on upper extremity function in subjects with MCA stroke.\nObjectives: To find the effect of core muscle stabilization exercises on upper extremity physical performance and trunk control in subjects with MCA stroke.\nMethods: Thirty subjects were divided into two groups with 15 in each. Group A received core muscle stabilization exercises, with conventional therapy while Group B received conventional therapy alone. Duration of treatment was 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Fugl Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) was used to assess upper extremity physical performance and Trunk impairment scale (Verheyden) [(TIS (V)] was used to assess trunk control. Measurements were taken on the first day before the treatment and last day after the treatment.\nResults: The statistical analysis was done using Mann Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Both the groups showed significant improvement when assessed using FMA- UE and TIS (V). Post-test mean of FMA-UE for group A was 47.20 and Group B was 39.46 whereas, TIS (V) for group A was 14.6 and Group B was 11.4.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Volcanic ashfall forecasts are highly dependent on eruption source parameters (ESPs) and synoptic weather conditions at the time and location of the eruption. In New Zealand, MetService and GNS Science have been jointly developing an ashfall forecast system that incorporates four-dimensional high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) and ESPs into the HYSPLIT model, a state-of-the art hybrid Eulerian and Lagrangian dispersion model widely used for volcanic ash. However, these forecasts are based on discrete ESPs combined with a deterministic weather forecast and thus provide no information on output uncertainty. This shortcoming hinders stakeholder decision making, particularly near the geographical margin of forecasted ashfall and in areas with large gradients in forecasted ash deposition. Our study presents a new approach that incorporates uncertainty from both eruptive and meteorological inputs to deliver uncertainty in the model output. To this end, we developed probability density functions (PDFs) for three key ESPs (plume height, mass eruption rate, eruption duration) tailored to New Zealand’s volcanoes and combine them with NWP ensemble datasets to generate probabilistic ashfall forecasts using the HYSPLIT model. We show that the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique can be used to representatively span this four-dimensional parameter space and allow us to add uncertainty quantification to rapid response forecast systems. For a case study of a hypothetical eruption at Tongariro, New Zealand we suggest that large parts of New Zealand’s North Island would not receive adequate warning for potential ashfall if uncertainties were not included in the forecasts. We also propose new probabilistic summary products to support public information and emergency responders decision making.</jats:p>"

It is defined by the observable reduction in goal-directed behaviour, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. According to decision theory, engagement in goal-directed behaviour depends on a cost–benefit optimization trading off the estimated effort (related to the behaviour) against the expected reward (related to the goal). In this framework, apathy would thus result from either a decreased appetence for reward, or from an increased aversion to effort. Here, we phenotyped the motivational state of 21 patients with bvFTD and 40 matched healthy controls using computational analyses of behavioural responses in a comprehensive series of behavioural tasks, involving both expression of preference (comparing reward value and effort cost) and optimization of performance (adjusting effort production to the reward at stake). The primary finding was an elevated aversion to effort, consistent across preference and performance tasks in patients with bvFTD compared to controls. Within the bvFTD group, effort avoidance was correlated to cortical atrophy in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and to apathy score measured on a clinical scale. Thus, our results highlight elevated effort aversion (not reduced reward appetence) as a core dysfunction that might generate apathy in patients with bvFTD. More broadly, they provide novel behavioural tests and computational tools to identify the dysfunctional mechanisms producing motivation deficits in patients with brain damage.</jats:p>",

Due to the different memory access requirements among heterogeneous cores, the LLC competition is more intense. In the current work, we propose a heterogeneity-aware replacement policy for the partitioned cache (HAPC), which reduces the mutual interference between cores through cache partitioning, and tracks the shared reuse state of each cache block within the partition at runtime to guide the replacement policy to keep cache blocks shared by multiple cores in multithreaded programs. In the process of updating the reuse state, considering the difference of memory accesses to LLC by heterogeneous cores, the cache replacement policy tends to keep cache blocks required by big cores, to better improve the LLC access efficiency of big cores. Compared with LRU and the SRCP, which are the state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms, the performance of big cores can be significantly improved by HAPC when running multithreaded programs, while the impact on little cores is almost negligible, thus improving the overall performance of the system.</jats:p>"

A common, temperature‐based paleoaltimetry method suggests these signals can be disentangled by comparing two proxy locations with similar climates. The difference between the records is assumed to be due to elevation, which is estimated by scaling the temperature difference by a lapse rate. We investigate the uncertainty associated with this approach using a case study of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. From an ensemble of climate simulations, we extract modeled temperatures at locations of real ice cores. We find uncertainty on the order of hundreds of meters that results from spatial heterogeneity in non‐adiabatic temperature change, which itself stems in part from elevation‐induced atmospheric circulation change. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when interpreting temperature‐based paleoaltimetry results for ice sheets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 is the target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that are crucial for vaccine effectiveness. The S1 subunit binds ACE2 while the S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. S2 is a class I fusion glycoprotein and contains a central coiled coil that acts as a scaffold for the conformational changes associated with fusion function. The coiled coil of S2 is unusual in that the 3-4 repeat of inward-facing positions are mostly occupied by polar residues that mediate few inter-helical contacts in the prefusion trimer. We examined how insertion of bulkier hydrophobic residues (Val, Leu, Ile, Phe) to fill a cavity formed by Ala<jats:sup>1016</jats:sup>and Ala<jats:sup>1020</jats:sup>that form part of the 3-4 repeat affects the stability and antigenicity of S trimers. Substitution of Ala<jats:sup>1016</jats:sup>with bulkier hydrophobic residues in the context of a prefusion-stabilized S trimer, S2P-FHA, was associated with increased thermal stability. The trimer stabilizing effects of filling the Ala<jats:sup>1016</jats:sup>/Ala<jats:sup>1020</jats:sup>cavity was linked to improved S glycoprotein membrane fusion function. When assessed as immunogens, two thermostable S2P-FHA mutants derived from the ancestral isolate, A1016L (16L) and A1016V/A1020I (VI) elicited very high titers of neutralizing antibodies to ancestral and Delta-derived viruses (1/2,700-1/5,110), while neutralization titer was somewhat reduced with Omicron BA.1 (1/210-1,1744). The antigens elicited antibody specificities that could compete with ACE2-Fc for binding to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and NAbs directed to key neutralization epitopes within the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) and stem region of S2. The VI mutation enabled the production of intrinsically stable Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 S ectodomain trimers in the absence of an external trimerization motif (T4 foldon). The VI mutation represents a method for producing an intrinsically stable trimeric S ectodomain glycoprotein vaccine in the absence of a foreign trimerization tag.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>AUTHOR SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>First-generation SARS CoV-2 vaccines that generate immune responses to ancestral Spike glycoprotein sequences have averted at least 14.4 million deaths, but their effectiveness against the recently emerged Omicron lineages is reduced. The updating of booster vaccines with variant Spike sequences are therefore likely required to maintain immunity as the pandemic continues to evolve. The Spike is a trimeric integral membrane protein with a membrane spanning sequence at its C-terminus. The Spike protein-based vaccine that is currently licensed for human use is produced by a complex process that reconstitutes the Spike in an artificial membrane. Alternatively, production of the Spike trimer as a soluble protein generally requires replacement of the membrane spanning sequence with a foreign often highly immunogenic trimerization motif that can complicate clinical advancement. We used systematic structure-directed mutagenesis coupled with functional studies to identify an alternative stabilization approach that negates the requirement for an external trimerization motif or membrane-spanning sequence. The replacement of 2 alanine residues that form a cavity in the core of the Spike trimer with bulkier hydrophobic residues resulted in increased Spike thermal stability. Thermostable Spike mutants retained major conserved neutralizing antibody epitopes and the ability to elicit broad and potent neutralizing antibody responses. One such mutation, referred to as VI, enabled the production of intrinsically stable Omicron variant Spike ectodomain trimers in the absence of an external trimerization motif. The VI mutation potentially enables a simplified method for producing a stable trimeric S ectodomain glycoprotein vaccine.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is the critical information required for surgery. However, collecting this information is challenging, time-consuming, and subjective. Some machine learning methods reduce the workload of clinical experts in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) visual diagnosis but face significant challenges because interictal iEEG clinical data often suffer from a significant class imbalance. We aim to generate synthetic data for the minority class. <jats:italic>Approach</jats:italic>. To make the clinically imbalanced data suitable for machine learning, we introduce an EEG augmentation method (EEGAug). The EEGAug method randomly selects several samples from the minority class and transforms them into the frequency domain. Then, different frequency bands from different samples are used to compose new data. Finally, a synthetic sample is generated after converting the new data back to the time domain. <jats:italic>Main results</jats:italic>. The imbalanced clinical iEEG data can be balanced and applied to machine learning models using the method. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network model is used to classify the SOZ and non-SOZ data. We compare the EEGAug method with other data augmentation methods and another method of class-balanced focal loss function, which is also used for solving the data imbalance problem by adjusting the weights between the minority and majority classes. The results show that the EEGAug method performs best in most data. <jats:italic>Significance</jats:italic>. Data imbalance is a widespread clinical problem. The EEGAug method can flexibly generate synthetic data for the minority class, yielding synthetic and raw data with a high distribution similarity. By using the EEGAug method, clinical data can be used in machine learning models.</jats:p>",

She was a daughter of the artist Louis Comfort Tiffany and a granddaughter of Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of the retail empire. Suffering from an unhappy marriage to a psychiatrically ill husband, she emigrated to Europe with her four children seeking psychoanalysis. She ultimately became a lay psychoanalyst and a lifelong partner—both professional and personal—of Anna Freud (1895–1982). Burlingham, at age 67, founded a day nursery for blind children in London. Based on these experiences, she wrote extensively on the psychological problems facing these children. These included, among others, an impaired ego development, the need to remain still (both for safety concerns and to better employ their hearing), and their anomalous relations with their parents and their sighted peers. Her unusual life journey led to many important contributions to this field.</jats:p>",

Then, according to the competing effect of the circular asymmetry of structure and chirality of medium in polarization and the difference of the paired coupling length, a CPBS based on chiral DC-PCF is designed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the career construction model of adaptation, this study explores the impact of core self-evaluations on career adaptability, with the mediating role of protean career attitudes and moderating role of meritocratic beliefs. The results of the questionnaire survey on 1000 Chinese college students show that: (1) core self-evaluations positively predicted college students’ career adaptability; (2) protean career attitudes mediated the relationship between core self-evaluations and career adaptability; (3) meritocratic beliefs not only moderated the effect protean career attitudes have on career adaptability but also moderated the indirect influence of core self-evaluations on career adaptability through protean career attitudes. These results extend the existing antecedent studies on career adaptability and demonstrate the importance of combining self-mobility beliefs (protean career attitudes) with social mobility beliefs (meritocratic beliefs) in the process of core self-evaluations affecting career adaptability. In conclusion, we hope to further develop the theory of career construction and provide more suggestions for college consultants and students.</jats:p>"

We performed cloud‐resolving regional simulations including a control run with the observed WCEs and a sensitivity run excluding the WCEs. These simulations found that the WCEs played a favorable role in the development of the distant TC. The WCEs affected the synoptic‐scale thermodynamic environments over the North Atlantic through the enhanced heat and moisture supply from the GS, increasing the moisture imports toward the distant TC. The WCEs‐enhanced moisture influx created very moist environments in the inner core. This inner‐core moistening was favorable for deep eyewall convection and an associated TC secondary circulation, leading to TC development. This result indicates the importance of WCEs in facilitating the remote process leading to TC development that previous studies have proposed.</jats:p>",

It is most common to separate two high performance composite facesheets with a low-density core, generally in the form of a foam or honeycomb. A recent concept has been to replace these traditional core materials with fiber reinforced truss-like structures, with the goal of further reducing mass. A system is described that can radically reduce the amount of tooling required for truss core sandwich panel manufacture. This system, which is a digital manufacturing platform for the extrusion of continuous fiber reinforced commingled glass fiber/PET tow, was developed to demonstrate the rigidization of composites both on, and off, a tool surface. Navtruss core panels were successfully manufactured using this digital manufacturing platform, without conventional tooling, and the resulting through thickness compression moduli and panel shear moduli were within 14.6% and 23% of the values baseline compression molded specimens. Thus, the results suggest that, with further development, complex truss core structures with performance approaching that of compression molded panels can be manufactured with radically reduced tooling requirements from high volume fraction, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Carya illinoinensis</jats:italic> (pecan) produce a high valued and desired nut crop; with production expanding worldwide. Important attributes of pecans and their ability to adapt to different environments aside from their native regions are currently being investigated. Microbial communities are known to play an important role in crop productivity and overall plant health. Studies in other plant species have shown that the plant microbiome may be influenced by both the environmental conditions and genetics of the plant. Microbiota research in pecan is in its early stages and here we report insights into the core microbiome of seedlings derived from five pecan cultivars located in an orchard from Las Cruces, New Mexico. Seeds from open-pollinated pecan cultivars (‘Burkett’, ‘Mandan’, ‘Pawnee’, ‘Western’, and ‘Wichita’) were collected and grown in a quarantine greenhouse under highly regulated conditions. DNA from the resulting seedlings were used for next generation sequencing (MiSeq) for 16S and ITS and microbiome analyses revealed significant differences in microbial composition and relative abundance (bacterial and fungal) between seedling organs, with roots having the highest alpha diversity followed by stems and leaves. Bacterial family <jats:italic>Chitinophagaceae</jats:italic> was identified to be most relatively abundant in the roots of seedlings compared to the bacterial families <jats:italic>Rhizobiaceae</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Moraxellaceae</jats:italic>, which were found to be most relatively abundant in the stems and leaves, respectively. Analyses also indicated that there were several families (bacterial families: <jats:italic>Rhizobiaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Enterobacteriaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Chitinophagaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Burkholderiaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Sphingomonadaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Pseudomonadaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Moraxellaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Microscillaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Rubritaleaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Caulobacteraceae</jats:italic>; fungal families: <jats:italic>Serendipitaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Nectriaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Ophiostomataceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Hypocreaceae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Aspergillaceae</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Cephalothecaceae</jats:italic>) that were found in all seedlings and these constitute a core microbiome for pecan. There were also differences in microbial composition (bacterial and fungal) between seedlings from different maternal pecan cultivars and these differences are proposed to constitute a signature microbiome for the maternal cultivar. As pecan trees continues to extend to other growing regions it is important to understand the role that these microbes play in pecan. By establishing the core microbiome of pecans, the selection of microbes for breeding and improving pecan production will become a possibility.</jats:p>"

The extracted model analytes were desorbed by a suitable organic solvent and were analyzed by high‐performance liquid chromatography. Under optimized condition, the linearity of the method was in the range of 0.1–200.0 μg/L for the selected analytes in water. The limits of detection were calculated to be in the range of 0.026–0.055 μg/L for warfarin and gemfibrozil, respectively. The limits of quantification were calculated to be in the range of 0.089–0.185 μg/L. The inter‐day and intra‐day relative standard deviations were determined to be in the range of 1.4%–3.3% in three concentrations in order to calculate the method precision. Furthermore, the enrichment factors were found to be 78 and 81 for warfarin and gemfibrozil, respectively. Moreover, the calculated absolute recoveries were between 78% and 81%. The obtained recoveries indicated that the method was useful and applicable in complicated real samples.</jats:p>",

To this end, the paper outlines efforts taken to ‘mainstream’ climate change and environmental law education in a core course of the LLB degree – land law. An empirical study sought to evaluate the students’ engagement with these materials, and their broader views concerning climate change and their legal education. The paper critically evaluates the course and the results of the empirical study. It concludes that students want to be, and should be, taught climate law and the climate context of law as part of their prescribed learning throughout the core curriculum, rather than as optional or elective content.</jats:p>",

Active learning models are believed to be able to improve student learning outcomes. However, the learning model partially does not contribute much to improving learning outcomes. Therefore, the hypothesis is put forward that the effectiveness of improving student learning outcomes between conventional and active learning models has the same criteria. Proving the hypothesis is the aim of this study. The research results are expected to contribute scientific references for developing strategies to improve student learning outcomes. The object of research is the material of Light and Optics, whose learning is carried out in three meetings. The quasi-experimental method was used in this study; randomization was carried out on the sample group (study grade). The research data are the results of the pre-test and post-test. Improved learning outcomes were analyzed using the N-Gain concept. After the learning process using the CORE model, it was found that there was an increase in student learning outcomes of SMP Negeri Banda Aceh City on Light and Optics.</jats:p>",

As a sustainable feature of enterprises, improving employees’ adaptive performance levels is a necessary condition for enterprises to achieve the sustainable development goal. This study is based on self-determination theory, which focuses on new-generation employees as the key force of enterprise and incorporates harmonious work passion and core self-evaluation into the research framework to explore the influence of paradoxical leadership on adaptive performance. The survey data obtained from 519 new-generation employees shows that: paradoxical leadership is significantly and positively correlated with adaptive performance of new-generation employees; the relationship between paradoxical leadership and adaptive performance is partially mediated by harmonious work passion; core self-evaluation positively adjusts the relationship between paradoxical leadership and harmonious work passion. In addition, core self-evaluation also regulates the intermediary role of harmonious work passion—that is to say, the higher core self-evaluation of new-generation employees is, the stronger the intermediary role of harmonious work passion. The research results explain the connotation of how paradoxical leadership improves adaptive performance of new-generation employees, reveal the medium of the relationship between the two, and find both the role boundary of paradoxical leadership and the strategy to improve adaptive performance.</jats:p>"

Here, we introduce the Mechano‐electrospinning, in which drawing force coming from moving substrate and electric static force are used to manipulate the fiber controllable into the traditional coaxial electrospinning to form a new method named coaxial Mechano‐electrospinning which can continuously direct‐write oriented core‐shell fiber with high deposition accuracy. This method uses a coaxial convex needle and a two dimensional moving collector to deposit core‐shell fibers by near‐field localization and mechanical drawing force. A series of experiments were performed to determine optimum process parameters and results showed that with the substrate moving speed of 50–200 mm/s, voltage of 5–6.5 kV and the tip‐collector distance of 20–50 mm, core‐shell fibers can be continuously deposited and well oriented. Additionally, a pressure sensor based on the core‐shell fibers was developed and exhibited good dynamic sensitivity in the range of 0.5–50 Hz.</jats:p>",

Possible reasons for their widespread conservation are still being discussed. It has been suggested that these alphaproteobacterial elements originate from a prophage that was present in an ancestral bacterium and subsequently evolved into a GTA that is now widely maintained in extant descendant lineages. Here, we analysed genomic properties that might relate to the conservation of these alphaproteobacterial GTAs. This revealed that the chromosomal locations of the GTA gene clusters are biased. They primarily occur on the leading strand of DNA replication, at large distances from long repetitive elements, and thus are in regions of lower plasticity, and in areas of extreme GC skew, which also accumulate core genes. These extreme GC skew regions arise from the preferential use of codons with an excess of G over C, a distinct phenomenon from the elevated GC content that has previously been found to be associated with GTA genes. The observed properties, along with their high level of conservation, show that GTA genes share multiple features with core genes in the examined lineages of the Alphaproteobacteria.</jats:p>",

Using two previously discovered HER2-targeting peptides, we modified each peptide with the chelator DOTA and a PEG2 linker resulting in DOTA-PEG2-GSGKCCYSL (P5) and DOTA-PEG2-DTFPYLGWWNPNEYRY (P6). Each peptide was labeled with 68Ga and was evaluated for HER2 binding using in vitro cell studies and in vivo tumor xenograft models.

Here, we describe the preparation of a supramolecular assembly between nanoGS and pentamidine, an antileishmanial drug endowed with a wide range of therapeutic properties (i.e., antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer). The physicochemical characterization of the supramolecular assembly (nanoGSP) in terms of size and colloidal stability was investigated by complementary spectroscopic techniques, such as UV–vis, ζ-potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS).

The ultimate goal is to identify—yet-unexplored—beneficial plant–microbe associations. Based on bulk soil bacterial communities and DArT-SNP analyses of 59 sorghum accessions, we selected three microbiologically distinct field soils and 12 sorghum genotypes, including commercial varieties, wild relatives, and farmer-preferred landraces. The results showed a core rhizosphere microbiome of 2125 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), belonging to eight bacterial families consistently found across the three soil types and the 12 sorghum genotypes. Integration of the rhizosphere bacterial community analysis with DArT-SNP sorghum genotyping revealed the association of differentially abundant ASVs with sorghum genotypic traits, including the distinct recruitment of Pseudomonadaceae by the stay-green, drought-tolerant, and wild sorghum genotypes. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the core and accessory bacterial taxa in the sorghum rhizosphere in the centre of origin, setting a baseline for targeted isolation and functional characterization of putative beneficial rhizobacteria.</jats:p>",

We previous demonstrated that monocytic MDSCs (mMDSCs) but not granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs) infiltrate tumors in mouse models and patients, and that nonspecific targeting of mMDSCs with chemotherapies provided therapeutic benefit in preclinical models of GBM. To investigate the differential role and trafficking of mMDSCs versus gMDSCs in GBM, we adoptively transferred these cells into tumor-bearing mice. Mice that received mMDSCs succumbed to disease at an earlier point compared to control mice or mice that received gMDSCs. To delineate the cellular basis of this distinct behavior of MDSC subsets, we performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and observed that cell adhesion-related genes were significantly enriched in open chromatin regions of mMDSCs as opposed to gMDSCs. Aligned with this epigenetic profile, mMDSCs from blood and tumors had significantly higher surface integrin β1 expression compared to gMDSCs in both mouse models and GBM patients. To evaluate the functional role of these integrins, we pre-treated mMDSCs with anti-integrin β1 prior to adoptive transfer. Blockade of surface integrin β1 interfered with the pro-tumorigenic role of mMDSCs, as the survival span of mice receiving these cells was similar to that of vehicle controls. Further analysis of the ATAC-Seq data revealed that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (Dpp4), an interacting partner of integrin β1, was more accessible in mMDSCs compared to gMDSC. Consistently, bone marrow-derived mMDSCs in mouse and tumor-infiltrating mMDSCs in GBM patients expressed high levels of Dpp4.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper deals with the nonlinear vibration behavior of sandwich panels composed of Graphene platelet reinforced composite (GPLRC) skins and auxetic core embedded with piezoelectric layers subjected to the thermo-magneto-electric loading. The nonlinear equations are obtained by applying Hamilton’s principles in the framework of higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) and von Karman’s nonlinear theory. Linear and nonlinear equations of motion are solved by applying the differential quadrature method (DQM) and homotopy perturbation technique, respectively. In the numerical illustration, at first validation of the present formulation is carried out by comparing the numerical results with those available in the open literature. Then the effects of several parameters such as geometric parameters of auxetic core, applied voltage, magnetic potential, GPL volume fraction, different boundary conditions, and temperature rise on the nonlinear frequency response of sandwich panel are studied. From numerical results, it was concluded that the sandwich panel incorporating auxetic core and piezoelectric layers could increase the magneto-electrical power output. </jats:p>",

Several scalable approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, such as the Algorithm for Proven and Young (APY). In APY, genotyped animals are partitioned into core and non-core subsets, which induces a sparser inverse of the genomic relationship matrix. This partitioning is often done at random. While APY is a good approximation of the full model, random partitioning can make results unstable, possibly affecting accuracy or even reranking animals. Here we present a stable optimisation of the core subset by choosing animals with the most informative genotype data.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We derived a novel algorithm for optimising the core subset based on a conditional genomic relationship matrix or a conditional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype matrix.

Therefore, educational institutions must respond quickly and ensure these technologies' easy and rapid adoption. It is necessary to introduce new approaches to engineers' education, shifting the focus from traditional network technologies toward more programmable network concepts based on network softwarization and cloudification. Our research goal has been to develop and implement a course while focusing on conceiving technical and pedagogical solutions to provide high‐quality education.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Estimating the compressive strength of concrete exposed to different environmental conditions is an essential parameter in judging the quality of concrete and proving its ability to perform as planned. There are various destructive (DT) and non-destructive (NDT) methods for estimating compressive strength. Some NDT and DT procedures, such as Schmidt hammer and core testing, have been used for estimating concrete strength for a long time. These methods consider indirect and predicted tests to evaluate concrete strength in existing structures. Various factors influence these tests, so it is difficult to precisely assess the hardened concrete strength. Thus, this research aims to identify a coherent relationship that connects the results of these tests and correlates them with the results of cube compressive strength by assessing data from laboratory tests conducted under control and durability conditions using statistical techniques. To achieve this purpose, three grades of concrete were considered C<jats:sub>250</jats:sub>, C<jats:sub>450</jats:sub>, and C<jats:sub>600</jats:sub> Kg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Six concrete cubes of size (15x15x15 cm) and four concrete columns of size (30x15x50 cm) were cast for each grade and tested to assess the cube, Schmidt hammer, and core compressive strength of concrete. Half of the columns and cubes were cured in drinking water (control condition) and the other half of the samples were subjected to durability cycles for 92 days (durability condition). In the durability condition, the samples were exposed to 10% sodium sulfate solution for a day, placed in a water tank for a day, heated to 100°C at a laboratory furnace for a day and then left at average laboratory temperature for a day to finish one cycle. The results were tabulated and graphed to notice any differences between DT, NDT and cube compressive strength tests. The results showed that the cube strength is higher than the core strength for all grades of concrete under control and durability conditions. The cube test indicates a lower compressive strength than the Schmidt hammer test method at grade C<jats:sub>250</jats:sub> under control condition and greater compressive strength in the rest of the grades.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, the relationship between the precursor concentration and shell thicknesses and the resulting properties of the nanowire arrays were investigated. The X-ray diffraction results showed that the prepared nanowire arrays consisted of only MAPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and fluorine-doped tin oxide phases, with no impurities. From the scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results, the MAPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> shell material was successfully coated onto the core layer of the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanowire arrays. In addition, the average size of the core–shell nanowire arrays and the shell thickness were obtained using scanning electron microscopy and related software analyses. The results showed that the shell thickness was the largest (40 nm) when the precursor concentration was the lowest (0.025 mol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy showed that when the precursor concentration was 0.025 mol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and the shell thickness was the largest, the nanowire array exhibited the highest absorbance and the smallest band gap, which is conducive to generating more carriers and improving its photovoltaic performance; the <jats:italic>J</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> curve showed the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency at this concentration and shell thickness. Therefore, it can be inferred that the shell thickness may affect the optical and photovoltaic properties.

Thirty patients (16 males, 14 females; mean age: 17.1±0.6 years; range, 12 to 18 years) who had undergone primary incisional hernia repair surgery were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the IST group of 15 patients who underwent the isokinetic exercise program for trunk muscles and the CST group of 15 patients who practiced the core exercise program. Each group exercised three times per week for six weeks. All patients were assessed pre-and post-treatment by an isokinetic dynamometer for trunk flexors and extensors at 60 and 90°/s angular velocities and the European Registry for Abdominal Wall Hernias (EuraHS)-QoL questionnaire.  Results: The trunk flexor and extensor Peak torque/body weight ratio at 60 and 90º/s angular velocities and QoL were significantly improved in both IST and CST groups (p&lt;0.05). The post-treatment values of both groups revealed marked but not statistically significant differences in all measured variables (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Both IST and CST are effective training programs that can improve the strength of trunk flexors and extensors as well as QoL after surgical repair of incisional hernia in adolescents.</jats:p>"

Previously chemically modified GO and reduced GO (RGO) were used to modify OTFT interfaces. However, to our knowledge, there are no published reports where virgin GO was employed for this purpose. For the sake of comparison, OTFTs without modification were also manufactured. The structure of the devices was based on the Bottom Gate Bottom Contact (BGBC) OTFT. We show that the presence of the GO monolayer on the surface of the OTFT’s SiO2 dielectric and Au electrode surface noticeably improves their performance. Namely, the drain current and the field-effect mobility of OTFTs are considerably increased by modifying the interfaces with the virgin GO deposition. It is suggested that the observed enhancement is connected to a decrease in the contact resistance of GO-covered Au electrodes and the particular structure of the P3HT layer on the dielectric surface. Namely, we found a specific morphology of the organic semiconductor P3HT layer, where larger interconnecting polymer grains are formed on the surface of the GO-modified SiO2. It is proposed that this specific morphology is formed due to the increased mobility of the P3HT segments near the solid boundary, which was confirmed via Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements.</jats:p>"

The main objective was to develop these guidelines to accommodate for the locally prevalent endemic diseases and the disparity of resources within the continent. Furthermore, the society aimed to publish these guidelines to increase awareness among African physicians, and facilitate patient capture, diagnosis and initial management.\nMethods\nThe African Society for Immunodeficiency convened an African IEI guidelines taskforce, which developed an initial standard operating procedure. This document entailed the main list of IEI in need of urgent guidelines formulation, validation and review processes.  The first group of diseases chosen to start the formulation of the guidelines were diseases of immune dysregulation. Simultaneously, this was associated with assigning a local African IEI guidelines working party, consisting of mainly locally established experts and young doctors.\nResults\nTwo pilot studies were produced for the project targeting the clinical diagnosis and management of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and Immune Dysregulation with Colitis, respectively. These guidelines will ensure better patient capture, diagnosis, and management especially given local endemic diseases and lack of resources. Moreover, it shall increase local inter-centre or regional collaboration with pioneers and experts within the field inside as well as outside the African continent.</jats:p>"

Herein, a profound impact of the annealing rate and time on photoactivity of gold–copper nanostructures by changes in the position and alignment of energy levels and surface states is reported. AuCu nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated by sputtering of thin metal layers on the Ti nanopatterned foil followed by slow (0.67 °C s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) or fast (30 °C s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) treatment in the rapid thermal annealing furnace and then utilized as photoanodes. Photocurrent in the visible range of the slow‐heated AuCu materials is 77 times higher, whereas for the fast heated 24 times higher than for pure Ti platform. On the other hand, the fast‐heated material exhibits higher photon‐to‐current efficiency, longer recombination rate which reaches 10s, and higher carrier transport rate of 150 μs. Based on the simulated projected local density of states analysis and the characteristics of intensity‐modulated spectra, this phenomenon is attributed to the presence of deeper midgap states in the electronic band structure for the fast‐heated samples. Furthermore, photocurrent is enhanced by the presence of Au inside NPs, which increases tunneling across copper oxides junction.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We previously showed that separation of the Mediator core from Mediator’s tail module results in modest overactivation of genes annotated as highly dependent on TFIID for expression. However, it is unclear if other coactivators are involved in this phenomenon. Here, we show that the overactivation of certain genes by Mediator core/tail separation is blunted by disruption of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase complex through the removal of its structural Spt20 subunit, though this downregulation does not appear to completely depend on reduced Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase association with the genome. Consistent with the enrichment of TFIID-dependent genes among genes overactivated by Mediator core/tail separation, depletion of the essential TFIID subunit Taf13 suppressed the overactivation of these genes when Med16 was simultaneously removed. As with Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase, this effect did not appear to be fully dependent on the reduced genomic association of TFIID. Given that the observed changes in gene expression could not be clearly linked to alterations in Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase or TFIID occupancy, our data may suggest that the Mediator core/tail connection is important for the modulation of Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase and/or TFIID conformation and/or function at target genes.</jats:p>",

Method   A cross-sectional study of newly attending MSM to determine the prevalence and associations of testing positive for anti-HBc using our clinic database from 2012 to 2019. We used crude odds ratios to identify any associations.     Results   There were 3342/5842 (58%) newly attending MSM who were tested for anti-HBc between 2012 and 2019. Of the 3342 MSM tested for anti-HBc, the median age was 30 years (interquartile range 23–43), 442 (13%) were living with HIV, 10 (0.3%) were HBsAg positive, 62 (1.9%) had past/current hepatitis C, 401 (12%) had a positive syphilis enzyme immunoassay (EIA), 455 (14%) were diagnosed with either gonorrhoea or chlamydia and 1080 (32%) were non-UK born. A total of 331 (10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.9–11.0) tested positive for anti-HBc and the proportion testing positive reduced significantly throughout the study period (P &lt; 0.004).

While the Hh pathway is present in all bilaterians, it has mainly been studied in model animals such as Drosophila and vertebrates. Despite the conservatism of its core components, mechanisms of signal transduction and additional components vary in Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. Vertebrates have multiple copies of the pathway members, which complicates signaling implementation, whereas model ecdysozoans appear to have lost some components due to fast evolution rates. To shed light on the ancestral state of Hh signaling, models from the third clade, Spiralia, are needed. In our research, we analyzed the transcriptomes of two spiralian animals, errantial annelid Platynereis dumerilii (Nereididae) and sedentarian annelid Pygospio elegans (Spionidae). We found that both annelids express almost all Hh pathway components present in Drosophila and mouse. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the core pathway components and built multiple sequence alignments of the additional key members. Our results imply that the Hh pathway compositions of both annelids share more similarities with vertebrates than with the fruit fly. Possessing an almost complete set of single-copy Hh pathway members, lophotrochozoan signaling composition may reflect the ancestral features of all three bilaterian branches.</jats:p>"

This study evaluated HBPAP’s process for developing the benefits package against the normative procedural (acceptable way of doing things) and outcome (acceptable consequences) conditions of an ideal healthcare priority-setting process as outlined in the study’s conceptual framework. We conducted a qualitative case study using in-depth interviews with national-level respondents (n = 20) and document reviews. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. HBPAP’s process partially fulfilled the procedural and outcome conditions of the study’s evaluative framework. Concerning the procedural conditions, transparency and publicity were partially met and were limited by the lack of publication of HBPAP’s report. While HBPAP used explicit and evidence-based priority-setting criteria, challenges included lack of primary data and local cost-effectiveness threshold, weak health information systems, short timelines and political interference. While a wide range of stakeholders were engaged, this was limited by short timelines and inadequate financial resources. Empowerment of non-HBPAP members was limited by their inadequate technical knowledge and experience in priority-setting. Finally, appeals and revisions were limited by short timelines and lack of implementation of the proposed benefits package. Concerning the outcome conditions, stakeholder understanding was limited by the technical nature of the process and short timelines, while stakeholder acceptance and satisfaction were limited by lack of transparency. HBPAP’s benefits package was not implemented due to stakeholder interests and opposition. Priority-setting processes for benefits package development in Kenya could be improved by publicizing the outcome of the process, allocating adequate time and financial resources, strengthening health information systems, generating local evidence and enhancing stakeholder awareness and engagement to increase their empowerment, understanding and acceptance of the process. Managing politics and stakeholder interests is key in enhancing the success of priority-setting processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Deep low-frequency (DLF) earthquakes have occurred at depths of 10–30 km in the Kirishima volcanic complex, Japan. Here, we investigate the DLF earthquake activity that was associated with the 2018 eruptions, compare these DLF earthquakes with those associated with the 2011 eruptions, and provide inferences on magmatic fluid ascension during these two eruptions. We apply a new matched-filter method to the continuous waveform data from the 2017–2018 period to comprehensively detect the DLF earthquake activity surrounding the 2018 eruptions. This new method can detect microearthquakes using a single seismic station based on an index that is computed as the product of mutual information and the correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between the template and target waveforms. We perform the same analysis using the 2010–2011 waveform data for comparison with the DLF earthquake activity associated with the 2011 eruptions. We detect 75 DLF earthquakes at approximately 25 km depth during the 2017–2018 period, whereas we detect 1302 DLF earthquakes at similar depths during the 2010–2011 period. Although the number of detected 2017–2018 events is small, we identify two swarms of DLF earthquake activity in March and July 2017. The March 2017 swarm coincides with the appearance of mud pots and jet fumaroles at the surface, and the July 2017 swarm coincides with the initiation of crustal deformation, which indicates the inflation of a deep magma reservoir. Furthermore, the occurrence rate of DLF earthquakes increased slightly after the March 2018 eruptions. Although the occurrence rate of DLF earthquakes associated with the 2018 eruptions was much lower than that associated with the 2011 eruptions, the slight increase in DLF earthquakes during the 2018 eruptions implies a connection between the deep magmatic fluid ascension and shallow volcanic unrest in 2018, which is similar to that observed during the 2011 eruptions. Such a close temporal relationship between the DLF earthquakes and surface volcanic activity suggests that the pressure disturbance within volcanic conduits propagates rapidly from depth.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>"

Single-spinneret electrospinning of emulsions is a much less common method to obtain core-sheath fibers. Core-sheath structure may be generated by electrospinning of homogeneous blend solutions; however, reports on such cases are still scarce. Herein, the preparation of nanofibrous composites from poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(L-lactide) (PLA) and beeswax (BW) by single-spinneret electrospinning of their homogeneous blend solutions in chloroform is reported. The produced fibers had core/double-sheath structure with a PEO core, PLA inner sheath and BW outer sheath. This original fiber structure was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, selective extraction of BW or PEO, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The PLA/BW double sheath led to hydrophobicity of the PEO/PLA/BW mats. The tensile tests revealed that PEO/PLA/BW mats had substantially improved mechanical behavior as compared to PEO, PLA and PEO/BW mats. PEO/PLA/BW mats can be used as drug carriers as evidenced by the one-pot incorporation of the model drug 5-nitro-8-hydroxyquinoline (NQ) into the fibrous materials. Microbiological tests showed that PEO/PLA/BW/NQ had antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the new materials are promising for wound healing applications.</jats:p>"

Despite the prevalence of prenatal care and its importance to maternal and infant health, there are several debates about the best methods of prenatal care delivery, including the most appropriate schedule frequency and content of prenatal visits.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As a result of rapid urbanization worldwide, there is an increasing demand for high-rise buildings, creating an acute need for more resilient tall structures, especially in regions of high seismicity. One of the main challenges facing design engineers is that buildings become increasingly susceptible to higher-mode effects as they become taller. Although current design practices typically achieve life-safety and collapse-prevention during major earthquake events, there is often extensive structural and non-structural damage, in great part exacerbated by the contribution of higher-mode responses. This article proposes a novel system involving a flexure and shear yielding base-mechanism, designed to limit both the first mode and higher-mode responses of a 42-story benchmark structure. These concepts only make use of well-defined buckling restrained steel braces, which have been extensively tested over many decades now and are currently implemented widely in buildings, to achieve the desired shear and flexural base yielding mechanisms. Nonlinear three-dimensional (3D) models developed in ABAQUS were used to validate key elements while models of the benchmark structure and base-mechanism were developed in ETABS to perform Nonlinear Time-History Analyses (NLTHA) for three hazard levels to investigate the global seismic response of the proposed system. Improvements among key seismic response parameters are observed at all hazard levels. By concentrating inelastic demands in the dedicated base steel yielding braces in the proposed system, quick inspection and potential repair after a major earthquake can be achieved with reduced disruptions to the use and operation of the building above. </jats:p>",

Artificial neural networks can learn to predict the scattering spectrum of core-shell particles with high accuracy and can act as fully differentiable surrogate models for a gradient-based design approach. To enable the fabrication of the particles, we consider existing materials and introduce a novel two-step optimization to treat continuous geometric parameters and discrete feasible materials simultaneously. Moreover, we overcome the non-uniqueness of the problem and expand the design space to particles of varying numbers of shells, i.e., different number of optimization parameters, with a classification network. Our method is 1–2 orders of magnitudes faster than conventional approaches in both forward prediction and inverse design and is potentially scalable to even larger and more complex scatterers.</jats:p>"

They are driven by three different global climate models (GCMs), namely MPI‐M‐MPI‐ESM‐LR, NCC‐NorESM1‐M and MOHC‐HadGEM2‐ES, and the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ECMWF‐ERAINT). Simulated rainfall is evaluated against observations from Rwanda Meteorology Agency to assess models' performance. A set of metrics are used to quantify discrepancies of models' simulations from observations. A possible association of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to rainfall over Rwanda is investigated. It is found that in general, all RCMs, their ensemble and multimodel ensemble means reproduce satisfactorily the spatial distribution of the mean seasonal rainfall (MSR), the mean rainfall annual cycle, and the interannual variability of the MSR for both March–April–May (MAM) and October–November–December (OND). However, significant biases in individual RCMs are observed with varying magnitude of bias in space. Observed MSR indicates a positive trend of 0.045 and 0.058 mm·day·year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, for MAM and OND at 0.05 significance level, but almost all models indicate no significant trend (at 0.05 significance level). The seasonal correlations between observed rainfall anomalies and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies indices across the tropical Pacific (Niño1+2 and Niño3.4) and Indian Oceans associated, respectively, with ENSO and IOD, although relatively weak, are reproduced by the three RCMs driven by ECMWF‐ERAINT and the multimodel ensemble means of ECMWF‐ERAINT and MPI‐M‐MPI‐ESM‐LR. Analysis of the Taylor diagram indicates that CCLM5‐0‐15_MPI‐M‐MPI‐ESM‐LR and the multimodel ensemble mean of MPI‐M‐MPI‐ESM‐LR outperform individual models. Overall, the evaluation finds reasonable model skill in representing seasonal rainfall climatology and variability, suggesting the potential use of CORDEX‐CORE (AFR‐22) RCMs for the assessment of future climate projections in Rwanda.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As one of the key proteins, wild-type p53 can inhibit the tumor development and regulate the cell fate. Thus, the study on p53 and its related kinetics has important physiological significance. Previous experiments have shown that wild-type p53-transcribed phosphatase one protein Wip1 can maintain the continuous oscillation of the p53 network through post-translational modification. However, the relevant details are still unclear. Based on our previous p53 network model, this paper focuses on the modification of Wip1 dephosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein ATM. Firstly, the characteristics and mechanism of p53 network oscillation under different numbers of DNA double strand damage were clarified. Then, the influence of ATM dephosphorylation by Wip1 on network dynamics and its causes are investigated, including the regulation of network dynamics transition by the mutual antagonism between ATM dephosphorylation and autophosphorylation, as well as the precise regulation of oscillation by ATM-p53-Wip1 negative feedback loop. Finally, the cooperative process between the dephosphorylation of ATM and the degradation of Mdm2 in the nucleus was investigated. The above results show that Wip1 interacts with other components in p53 protein network to form a multiple coupled positive and negative feedback loop. And this complex structure provides great feasibility in maintaining stable oscillation. What’s more, for the state of oscillation, the bottleneck like effect will arise, especially under a certain coupled model with two or more competitive negative feedback loops. The above results may provide some theoretical basis for tumor inhibition by artificially regulating the dynamics of p53.</jats:p>"

However, the development of city digital twins for flood predictions is challenging due to the time-consuming, uncertain processes of developing, calibrating, and coupling physics-based hydrologic and hydraulic models. In this study, a flood prediction methodology (FPM) that integrates synchronization analysis and deep-learning is developed to directly simulate the complex relationships between rainfall and flood characteristics, bypassing the computationally expensive hydrologic-hydraulic models, with the City of Calgary being used for demonstration. The developed FPM presents the core of data-driven digital twins that, with real-time sensor data, can rapidly provide early warnings before flood realization, as well as information about vulnerable areas—enabling city resilience planning considering different climate change scenarios.</jats:p>"

Locally secreted FN then undergoes β1 integrin-dependent fibrillogenesis. We find that the site of FN secretion is regulated by cell polarization, which occurs in bursts under stabilized lamellipodia at the leading edge. Moreover, analysis of FN secretion and focal adhesion dynamics suggest that focal adhesion formation precedes FN deposition and that deposition continues during focal adhesion disassembly. Lastly, we show that the polarized FN deposition in spreading and migrating cells requires both intact microtubules and myosin II-mediated contractility. Thus, while FN secretion does not require integrin binding, the site of exocytosis is regulated by membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics with secretion occurring after new adhesion formation.</jats:p>",

The effects of reaction temperature and reaction time on the chemical transformation as well as coating quality are investigated by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X‐ray diffraction. More importantly, the transformation of Cu(OH)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> into CuO during alcohol‐thermal process is tentatively discussed. And the growth mechanisms of CuO are speculated, which mainly consist of the continuous dissolution of Cu(OH)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, the transformation of dissolved Cu(OH)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to CuO which happens at a lower temperature than that of dry Cu(OH)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> powder, and the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of CuO. The prepared Al@CuO energetic microspheres are compared with physically mixed Al/CuO counterparts by using thermal analysis, electric ignition and constant‐volume combustion tests. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact quality, Al@CuO energetic microspheres show overall enhanced reaction characteristics in terms of reaction onset temperature, heat release, apparent activation energy, ignition delay, burning time and pressurization rate.</jats:p>",

Bariatric surgery is effective and yields durable weight loss; however, few qualified candidates choose to undergo surgical treatment. Less-invasive alternatives to bariatric surgery are being developed to bridge the treatment gap. Recognizing the burden of conducting pivotal clinical trials and traditional post-approval studies for medical devices, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health has encouraged the development of real-world data content and quality that is sufficient to provide evidence for Total Product Life Cycle medical device evaluation. A key first step is to establish a minimum core data structure that provides a common lexicon for endoscopic obesity devices and its corresponding interoperable data elements. Such a structure would facilitate data capture across existing workflow with a ‘coordinated registry network’ capability. On July 29, 2016, a workshop entitled, ‘GI Coordinated Registry Network: A Case for Obesity Devices’ was held at the FDA White Oak Campus by the Medical Device Epidemiology Network public–private partnership and FDA to initiate the work of developing a common lexicon and core data elements in the metabolic device space, which marked the inauguration of the Gastrointestinal Coordinated Registry Network project. Several work groups were subsequently formed to address clinical issues, data quality issues, registry participation, and data sharing.</jats:p>",

This configuration enables machines to be designed for multi‐pole structures while maintaining a simple coil geometry regardless of the pole count. As a result, these machines generate more torque and power density than most of the machines with windings wound around teeth and inserted into slots. However, transverse flux machines continue to face manufacturing difficulties because a large number of relatively small permanent magnets are required. Thus, a permanent magnet transverse flux generator (PMTFG) is designed with half the magnets on the rotor in comparison with a regular design while generating 18% better power density at the same size and excitation conditions. After proper parameter selection, the electromagnetic performance of the design is examined, and the viability of the design is verified using a three‐dimensional finite‐element model (FEM). Further analyses were carried out to examine the effect of stator core material and air gap length on the performance of PMTFG. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed topology is built, which validates the performance obtained through FEM.</jats:p>",

HBc antigen was produced with a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system and used to immunize mice. Among the established hybridoma clones, a single clone (mAb #7) was selected and further characterized for its ability in the antibody-based in situ biotinylation analysis to collect host proteins that are in the vicinity of HBc. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 215 HBc-interacting host proteins, three of which bind HBc most significantly under hypoxic conditions. Our results indicate that mAb #7 can be used to systematically identify host proteins that interact with HBc under pathophysiological conditions, and thus may be useful to explore the molecular pathways involved in HBV-induced cytopathogenesis.</jats:p>"

A modal experiment is performed using a modal hammer with an acceleration sensor to obtain modal properties of the structure, including natural frequencies, damping ratio, mode shapes, and frequency responses. Eventually, the comparison of vibration characteristics of the CFRP sandwich panel with the GFRP sandwich panel with almost identical geometry is discussed in detail. Furthermore, a finite element simulation is developed to validate the precision of the experimental data. It is recognized that the finite element results are in remarkably good agreement with those obtained by modal experiments.

Assuming two phases are formed in the positive electrode, one rich and one poor in lithium, a core-shrinking problem is formulated and the phase transition is modeled through a shell phase that covers the core one. A careful discretization of the coupled partial differential equations is proposed and used to convert the model into a system of ordinary differential equations. To ensure robust and accurate numerical solutions of the governing equations, a sensitivity analysis of numerical solutions is performed and the best setting, in terms of solver tolerances, solid phase concentration discretization points, and input current sampling time, is determined in a newly developed probabilistic framework. Finally, unknown model parameters are identified at different C-rate scenarios and the model is verified against experimental data.</jats:p>",

The panel consists of a double-U auxetic honeycomb core made of aluminum alloy and graphene platelet reinforced composite (GPLRC) skins at the top and bottom surfaces. According to Gibson’s formula, the effective material properties of facing sheets and double-V auxetic core are considered. The nonlinear equations are obtained by applying Hamilton’s principles via von Karman’s nonlinear theory and higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT). The governing equations of motion are solved by employing the differential quadrature method (DQM) and homotopy perturbation method, respectively. The accuracy of the current results has been verified by comparison with others in the literature. Finally, the influence of different parameters such as applied voltage, magnetic potential, temperature rise, different boundary conditions, and geometric parameters of core on the nonlinear frequency-amplitude response of cylindrical panels are analyzed. The numerical results show negative effect of temperature increment, positive influence of ratio of thickness to inclined length, core thickness, amplitudes of segments, considerable effect of the magnetic potential as well as small effect of applied voltage on the nonlinear vibration of sandwich panel. Finally, the important findings of this research indicate that the magnetic potential, amplitude segment, and length to inclined cell rib length have significant effects on nonlinear dynamic deflection and frequencies-amplitude response. Based on the results of this article, designers can develop different parts of aircraft. </jats:p>",

Further, we developed a machine learning-based approach for 3-D cell segmentation, based on a pretrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, to automatically identify the cytoplasm and nuclei of clock neurons. We combined our segmentation model with a spot counting algorithm to detect <jats:italic>Clock</jats:italic> mRNA spots in individual clock neurons.

Heretofore a combination of therapy and additional medications can alter the course of the disease and reduce upper extremity disability. We developed a virtual environment for pick-and-place tasks as a supportive tool to address the problem of challenging task in occupational therapy. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the influence of size and bounce on proximal and fine motor performance and intrinsic motivation. The secondary objective was to examine how the absence of challenge may decrease intrinsic motivation and heart rate. The randomized trial involved 84/107 eligible inpatients with multiple sclerosis. They were divided into 4 groups by computer randomization: Group 1 small and bouncing, Group 2 small and non-bouncing, Group 3 large and bouncing, and Group 4 large and non-bouncing virtual cubes. Each participant completed 50 sessions of up to 2 min each in approximately 14 days. Before commencement of the study the participants completed visuospatial and cognitive tests. Participants' subjective experiences were assessed daily using the intrinsic motivation inventory. Before and after the study, the box and block test and the 9-hole peg test were administered. Kinematic analysis showed significant differences between groups (average manipulation time <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.008, inserted cubes <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.004). Group 4 was the most successful (inserted cubes &gt; 9) and the fastest (63.4 SD 25.8 s), but had low pressure/tension and heart rate. Group 1 was the slowest (88.9 SD 28.2 s) but had increased interest/enjoyment in the task under higher pressure/tension. There were substantial differences in intrinsic motivation between the 1st and last sessions within groups (Cohen's U3 &lt; 0.3 or &gt; 0.8). The size and behavior of virtual objects may be important for training proximal movements and fine motor skills in people with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, the demonstrated approach proved to be effective and may reduce upper extremity disability in the long term if intrinsic motivation can be sustained longer with a challenging task.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Trial registration</jats:italic> The small scale randomized pilot trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04266444, 12/02/2020, <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04266444\">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04266444</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>"

Twenty double-blind beverage samples, spiked with Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, were prepared in sterile Eppendorf® tubes at room temperature. The gold layer and spikes of ICGNPs increased the surface areas. The ratio of the surface area is 0.76 (IONPs/ICGNPs). The comparative sensitivity and specificity of the IONP-based and the ICGNP-based methods to detect Salmonella were determined. The ICGNP method shows the limit of detection is 32 Salmonella per mL. The ICGNPs had an 83.3% sensitivity and a 92.9% specificity value for the presence and detection of Salmonella. The IONP method resulted in a limit of detection of 150 Salmonella per mL, and a 66.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity for the presence and detection of Salmonella. The higher surface area of ICGNPs increases the efficiency of detection. The monitoring of Salmonella can thus be achieved by a rapid magnetic fluorescent assay using a smartphone for image capture and analyze, providing quantitative results. The findings from the present study would help to detect Salmonella rapidly in water. It can improve the microbial quality of water and food safety due to the presence of Salmonella in the water environment.</jats:p>"

A systematic review was conducted on studies analyzing synergies between two or more core muscles. Publications from 2005 until July 2021 were identified by performing structured searched in Pubmed/MEDLINE, PEDro and WOS. Fifteen studies were eligible for the final systematic review. A total of 56% of the studies established synergies between the core muscles and 44% between the homo and contralateral sides of the core muscles. The most studied core synergies were transversus abdominis, internal oblique and external oblique followed by the rectus abdominis and the lumbar multifidus.

Spatially resolved spectroscopy and emission intensity of argon atom and ion lines were measured via local optical emission spectroscopy, and electron density was measured experimentally by an RF-compensated Langmuir probe. The relation between the emission intensity and the electron density was obtained and the wavenumbers of helicon and ‘Trivelpiece-Gould’ (TG) waves were calculated by solving the dispersion relation in wave modes. The results show that at least two distinct wave coupled modes appear in argon helicon plasma at increasing RF power, i.e. blue core (or BC) mode with a significant bright core of blue lights and a normal wave (NW) mode without blue core. The emission intensity of atom line 750.5 nm (<jats:italic>I</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>ArI750.5nm</jats:sub>) is related to the electron density and tends to be saturated in wave coupled modes due to the neutral depletion, while the intensity of ion line 480.6 nm (<jats:italic>I</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>ArII480.6nm</jats:sub>) is a function of the electron density and temperature, and increases dramatically as the RF power is increased. Theoretical analysis shows that TG waves are strongly damped at the plasma edge in NW and/or BC modes, while helicon waves are the dominant mechanism of power deposition or central heating of electrons in both modes. The formation of BC column mainly depends on the enhanced central electron heating by helicon waves rather than TG waves since the excitation of TG waves would be suppressed in this special anti-resonance region.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, L2,3-edge XAS reveals that the physical d-counts of the formally NiIV compounds measured lie well above the d6 count implied by the oxidation state formalism. The generality of this phenomenon is explored computationally by scrutinizing 8 additional complexes. The extreme case of NiF62– is considered using high-level molecular orbital approaches as well as advanced valence bond methods. The emergent electronic structure picture reveals that even highly electronegative F– is incapable of supporting a physical d6 NiIV center.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Lung cancer represents a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, with the highest frequency and mortality in both sexes combined. In a clinical scenario characterized by the widespread of multidetector-row spiral CT, core-needle biopsy under tomographic guidance is one of the main and safest methods to obtain tissue specimens, even though there are relatively high rates of pneumothorax (0–60% incidence) and pulmonary hemorrhage (4–27% occurrence rates). The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT-guided core-needle biopsy in the diagnosis of primary lung malignancies and to compare our results with evidence from the literature. Materials and Methods: Our analysis included 350 thoracic biopsies, performed from 2017 to 2022 with a 64-row CT guidance and 16/18 G needles mounted on a biopsy gun. We included in the final cohort all samples with evidence of primary lung malignancies, precursor lesions, and atypia, as well as inconclusive and negative diagnoses. Results: There was sensitivity of 90.07% (95% CI 86.05–93.25%), accuracy of 98.87% (95% CI 98.12–99.69%), positive predictive value of 100%, and negative value of 98.74% (95% CI 98.23–99.10%). Specificity settled at 100% (93.84–100%). The AUC was 0.952 (95% CI 0.924–0.972). Only three patients experienced major complications after the procedure. Among minor complications, longer distances from the pleura, the presence of emphysema, and the lower dimensions of the lesions were correlated with the development of pneumothorax after the procedure, while longer distances from the pleura and the lower dimensions of the lesions were correlated with intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in 51% of true positive cases, showing TTF-1, CK7, and p40 expression, respectively, in 26%, 24%, and 10% of analyzed samples. Conclusions: The CT-guided thoracic core-needle biopsy is an extremely accurate and safe diagnostic procedure for the histological diagnosis of lung cancer, a first-level interventional radiology exam for peripheral and subpleural lesions of the lung, which is also able to provide adequate samples for advanced pathologic assays (e.g., FISH, PCR) to assess molecular activity and genetic sequencing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Centralized power management control systems are hitting a scalability limit. In particular, enforcing a power cap in a many-core system in a performance-friendly manner is quite challenging. Today’s on-chip controller reduces the clock speed of compute domains in response to local or global power limit alerts. However, this is opaque to the operating system (OS), which continues to request higher clock frequency based on the workload characteristics acting against the centralized on-chip controller. To address these issues, we introduce TokenSmart, which implements a set of scalable distributed frequency control heuristics within the OS, using a novel token-based mechanism. The number of system-allocated power tokens represents the maximum allowable power consumption; and the OS governor orchestrates a token-passing (or sharing) algorithm between the compute engines. Token allocation count increase (decrease) corresponds to a increase (decrease) of clock frequency. The compute units are connected in a ring-topology allowing minimal meta-data to be passed along with the token value for regulating power budget. We explore different heuristics to assign tokens smartly across the units. This results in efficient power regulation and sustenance of turbo frequencies over a longer duration. Our proposed methodology can be implemented in hardware with multiple on-chip controllers, or in software where each set of cores acts as a compute unit. The methodology is currently implemented within the Linux kernel of a real IBM POWER9 many-core system and experimentally verified on different real world workloads such as Redis, Cassandra, PostgreSQL along with a micro-benchmark such as rt-app. Our experiments indicate the increase in throughput for all the workloads along with the benefit of power savings. For instance, results show a considerable boost of about 4% in throughput of both the PostgreSQL and Redis benchmark with a substantial savings in power consumption (18% and 37%, respectively). If the approach is implemented in hardware, then our experimental analysis speculates the throughput to increase up to 14% in PostgreSQL benchmark.</jats:p>",

Most of the time, these structures are exposed to extreme and heavy loads and damaged. Therefore, the mechanical properties of composite sandwich structures are important issue that should be addressed by engineers. For this purpose, the mechanical properties of a GFRP composite sandwich structures with polyurethane foam‐filled M‐shaped core are numerically and experimentally determined in this research. The sandwich panels manufactured for this study are composed of GFRP as fibers and resin epoxy as matrix material. In order to determine the bending and compressive response of the GFRP composite structures, three‐point bending and compression tests are performed using a SANTM ATM‐140 universal testing machine. A finite element method is developed to validate the precision of the experimental results. It is recognized that the finite element data are in remarkably great agreement with those obtained by experimental tests. Hence, the finite element analysis and experiment method could be utilized to predict the mechanical properties of the GFRP composite sandwich panels.</jats:p>",

While the substitution of heteroatoms essentially modulates the band structure of most semiconducting materials, chemical (molecular) doping can achieve relatively reliable carrier concentration modulation, particularly for nanocarbons and two-dimensional semiconductors. Compared to p-type counterparts, the stabilization of n-type carbon materials has been a challenge not only for basic science but also for various electronic device applications. This Mini-Review describes rational concepts for, and the results of, a stable n-type doping technique mainly for carbon nanotubes using molecular reactions and interactions. The stable n-type carbon nanotubes with controlled carrier concentration are implemented in complementary circuits and thermoelectric energy harvesters. The molecular and supramolecular n-type doping is not limited for carbon nanotubes, but is utilized in the fabrication of conducting transition metal dichalcogenides such as a molybdenum disulphide (MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) monolayer.</jats:p>",

How to keep the temperature and humidity in a pig house within a normal range is the problem to be solved in this paper. The traditional threshold-based environmental control system cannot meet this requirement. In this paper, an intelligent control system of temperature and humidity in a pig house based on machine learning and a fuzzy control algorithm is proposed. We use sensors to collect the temperature and humidity in the pig house and store these data in chronological order. Then, we use these time series data to train the GRU model and then use the GRU model to predict the temperature and humidity change curve in the pig house in the next 24 hours. Finally, the mathematical model of the pig house and related equipment is established, and the output power of the related equipment is calculated based on the prediction results of GRU so as to effectively regulate the indoor temperature and humidity. The experimental results show that compared with the threshold-based environmental control system, our system reduces the abnormal temperature and humidity by about 90%.</jats:p>"

In the present study, we aimed to analyze the role of the HCV core protein in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced death under the viewpoint of HCV genetic variability. Immortalized hepatocytes (IHH), and not the Huh 7.5 hepatoma cell line, stably expressing HCV subtype 4a and HCV subtype 4f core proteins showed that only the HCV 4a core protein could increase sensitivity to TNFα-induced death. Development of two transgenic mice expressing the two different core proteins under the liver-specific promoter of transthyretin (TTR) allowed for the in vivo assessment of the role of the core in TNFα-induced death. Using the TNFα-dependent model of lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine (LPS/Dgal), we were able to recapitulate the in vitro results in IHH cells in vivo. Transgenic mice expressing the HCV 4a core protein were more susceptible to the LPS/Dgal model, while mice expressing the HCV 4f core protein had the same susceptibility as their littermate controls. Transcriptome analysis in liver biopsies from these transgenic mice gave insights into HCV core molecular pathogenesis while linking HCV core protein genetic variability to differential pathology in vivo.</jats:p>"

The study included 242 clinical educators for nursing students. Item analysis, factor analysis, criterion validity, and internal consistency were used for the data analyses.Results: For the final scale, 35 items were selected and 5 factors were categorized, which together explain 61.7% of the total variance. The factors were education and evaluation, research and cooperation, ethical/legal principles, presenting leadership, and clinical practice. The scores for the scale significantly correlated with the teaching efficacy scale for clinical nursing instructors. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the 35 items was .96.Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrated that the core competency scale has good validity and reliability. This scale can be used to assess the competency of clinical educators for nursing students; hence, it will help in evaluating the relationship between the skills of clinical educators for nursing students and the self-efficacy of those students.</jats:p>",

In addition to Pdiff, we are able to pick PP‐, PPP‐, and SS‐wave arrivals and locate the event to the farside of Mars in the vicinity of Tharsis, in agreement with the imaged location of the impact. This indicates that our joint single‐station seismic event‐location and structure‐inversion scheme is both robust and accurate.

We identified CNBs first diagnosed elsewhere that were reviewed in our department over the course of 1 year because the patients sought care at our center and in which a change in diagnosis had been recorded. The outside and in-house CNB diagnoses were then classified based on Breast WHO Fifth Edition diagnostic categories. The impact of the change in diagnosis was estimated based on the subsequent surgical management. Findings in follow-up surgical excisions (EXCs) were used for validation. In 2018, 4950 outside cases with CNB were reviewed at our center. A total of 403 CNBs diagnoses were discrepant. Of these, 147 had a change in the WHO diagnostic category: 80 (54%) CNBs had a more severe diagnosis and 44 (30%) a less severe diagnosis. In 23 (16%) CNBs, the change of diagnostic category had no impact on management. Intraductal proliferations (n=54), microinvasive carcinoma (n=18), and papillary lesions (n=35) were the most disputed diagnoses. The in-house CNB diagnosis was confirmed in most cases with available excisions. Following CNB reclassification, 22/147 (15%) lesions were not excised. A change affecting the surgical management at our center occurred in 2.5% of all CNBs.

Integrating clinicalpathological data and image features build multi-modal and multi-instance (MMMI) deep learning model to obtain the final prediction.\nResults\n 1. For predicting with or without lymph node metastasis, the AUC was 0.770, 0.709, 0.809 based on the clinicopathological features, WSI and MMMI, respectively. 2. For predicting four classification of lymph node status (no metastasis, isolated tumor cells (ITCs), micrometastasis, and macrometastasis), the prediction based on clinicopathological features, WSI and MMMI were compared. The AUC for no metastasis was 0.770, 0.709, 0.809, respectively; ITCs were 0.619, 0.531, 0.634, respectively; micrometastasis were 0.636, 0.617, 0.691, respectively; and macrometastasis were 0.748, 0.691, 0.758, respectively. MMMI developed a more accurate prediction effect. 3. For prediction of different molecular types of breast cancer, MMMI demonstrated a better prediction effect for any type of lymph node status, especially in the molecular type of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 4. In the external validation set, MMMI also showed better predictive effect in the four classification, with AUC of 0.725, 0.757, 0.525, and 0.708, respectively.\nConclusions\n We developed a breast cancer lymph node metastasis prediction model by using MMMI. Through all cases tests, the results showed that the overall prediction ability was high and relatively stable.</jats:p>"

We report the realization of all-crystalline GaN/Er:GaN/GaN embedded waveguide fiber structures using the hydride vapor phase epitaxy growth and re-growth technique, along with chemical–mechanical polishing processes. The Er:GaN core layer possesses an Er doping concentration of 1.7×1020 atoms/cm3, confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Motivated by the unknown reasons for a kilometer-scale high-temperature overprint of 270 ~ 300 °C in a reservoir outcrop analog (Piesberg Quarry, northwest Germany), numerical simulations are conducted to identify the transport mechanisms of the fault-related hydrothermal convection system. The system mainly consists of a main fault and a sandstone reservoir in which transfer faults are embedded. The results show that the buoyancy-driven convection in the main fault is the basic requirement for elevated temperatures in the reservoir. We studied the effects of permeability variations and lateral regional flow on the preferential fluid flow pathways, dominant heat transfer types, and mutual interactions among different convective and advective flow modes. The sensitivity analysis of permeability variations indicates that lateral convection in the sandstone and advection in the transfer faults can efficiently transport fluid and heat, thus causing elevated temperatures (≥ 269 °C) in the reservoir compared to purely conduction-dominated heat transfer (≤ 250 °C). Higher-level lateral regional flow interacts with convection and advection and changes the dominant heat transfer from conduction to advection in the transfer faults for the low permeability cases of sandstone and main fault. Simulations with anisotropic permeabilities detailed the dependence of the onset of convection and advection in the reservoir on the directional permeability distribution. The depth-dependent permeabilities of the main fault reduce the amount of energy transferred by buoyancy-driven convection. The increased heat and fluid flows resulting from the anisotropic main fault permeability provide the most realistic explanation for the thermal anomalies in the reservoir. Our numerical models can facilitate exploration and exploitation workflows to develop positive thermal anomalies zones as geothermal reservoirs. These preliminary results will stimulate further petroleum and geothermal studies of fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes in faulted tight sandstones.\n                        </jats:p>"

We demonstrate that LE regions are conserved across multiple cancers while TC states are tissue specific, highlighting the existence of common mechanisms underlying tumor progression and invasion. Additionally, we found that a LE gene signature is associated with worse clinical outcomes while a TC gene signature is associated with improved prognosis across multiple cancer types. Finally, using an in silico modeling approach, we describe spatially-regulated patterns of cell development in OSCC that are predictably associated with drug response.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigated how children's drawings can provide insights into their cognitive development. It can be challenging to quantify the diversity of children's drawings across their developmental stages as well as between individuals. This study observed children's representational drawing ability by conducting a completion task where children could freely draw on partially drawn objects, and quantitatively analyzed differences in children's drawing tendencies across age and between individuals. First, we conducted preregistered analyses, based on crowd-sourced adult ratings, to investigate the differences of drawing style with the age and autistic traits of the children, where the latter was inspired by reports of atypical drawing among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Additionally, the drawings were quantified using feature representations extracted with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which allowed an analysis of the drawings at different perceptual levels (i.e., local or global). Findings revealed a decrease in scribbling and an increase in completion behavior with increasing age. However, no correlation between drawing behavior and autistic traits was found. The network analysis demonstrated that older children adapted to the presented stimuli in a more adult-like manner than younger children. Furthermore, ways to quantify individual differences in how children adapt to the presented stimuli are explored. Based on the predictive coding theory as a unified theory of how perception and behavior might emerge from integrating sensations and predictions, we suggest that our analyses may open up new possibilities for investigating children's cognitive development.</jats:p>"

However, no study has examined subjective-physiological emotional coherence among older adults while tasting food. Accordingly, the present study compared subjective-physiological emotional coherence during food consumption among older and younger adults. Methods: Participants consumed bite-sized gel-type foods with different flavors and provided their subjective ratings of the foods while their physiological responses (facial electromyography (EMG) of the corrugator supercilia, masseter, and suprahyoid, and other autonomic nervous system signals) were simultaneously measured. Results: Our primary findings were that (1) the ratings of liking, wanting, and valence were negatively correlated with corrugator EMG activity in older and young adult participants; (2) the positive association between masseter EMG activity and ratings of wanting/valence was weaker in the older than in the young adult group; and (3) arousal ratings were negatively correlated with corrugator EMG activity in the older group only. Conclusions: These results demonstrate commonalities and differences in subjective-physiological emotional coherence during food intake between older and young adults.</jats:p>"

When the outer shell contains sodium styrenesulfonate homopolymer blocks, treatment with a toluene solution of [RhCl(COD)]2 led to undesired polymer coagulation. Investigation of the interactions of [RhCl(COD)]2 and [RhCl(COD)(PPh3)] with smaller structural models of the polymer shell functions, namely sodium p-toluenesulfonate, sodium styrenesulfonate, and a poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) homopolymer in a biphasic toluene/water medium points to the presence of equilibrated Rh-sulfonate interactions as the cause of coagulation by inter-particle cross-linking. Modification of the hydrophilic shell to a statistical copolymer of sodium styrenesulfonate and poly(ethylene oxide) methyl ether methacrylate (PEOMA) in a 20:80 ratio allowed particle loading with the generation of core-anchored [RhCl(COD)TPP] complexes. These Rh-loaded latexes efficiently catalyze the aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of neat styrene as a benchmark reaction. The catalytic phase could be recovered and recycled, although the performances in terms of catalyst leaching and activity evolution during recycles are inferior to those of equivalent nanoreactors based on neutral or polycationic outer shells.</jats:p>"

Any type of handling and manipulation may cause stress and result in physical harm to mice, potentially leading to unintended consequences of experimental outcomes. Nevertheless, the pathological effects of these interventions are poorly documented and assumed to have a negligible effect on experimental variables. In that context, we provide a comprehensive post mortem overview of the main pathological changes associated with routine interventions (i.e., restraint, blood drawing, and intraperitoneal injections) of laboratory mice with an emphasis on presumed traumatic osteoarticular lesions. A total of 1000 mice from various studies were included, with 864 animals being heavily manipulated and 136 being handled for routine husbandry procedures only. The most common lesions observed were associated with blood collection or intraperitoneal injections, as well as a series of traumatic osteoarticular lesions likely resulting from restraint. Osteoarticular lesions were found in 62 animals (61 heavily manipulated; 1 unmanipulated) with rib fractures and avulsion of the dens of the axis being over-represented. Histopathology and micro-CT confirmed the traumatic nature of the rib fractures. While these lesions might be unavoidable if mice are manipulated according to the current standards, intentional training of research personnel on appropriate mouse handling and restraint techniques could help reduce their frequency and the impact on animal wellbeing as well as study reproducibility.</jats:p>"

The tapered small-core section of STSCS is surrounded by magnetic fluid (MF) containing ferromagnetic particles (FMPs) of different concentrations. The FMPs align themselves along the magnetic field, depending on the strength of the magnetic field. This alignment of FMPs changes the refractive index around the tapered small-core section, which in turn changes the output spectral response of the STSCS optical fibre structure. The change in spectral response is then calibrated for sensing the magnetic field strength. This paper also investigates the effect of both the taper waist diameter of the STSCS optical fibre structure and the concentration of MF surrounding it on the magnetic field sensitivity. The maximum sensitivity demonstrated in this paper is 0.46 nm/mT for a taper waist diameter of 10 μm surrounded by 1.22% FMPs in the MF. The magnetic sensor demonstrates reversible results, and its effects on the orientation of the magnetic field along the X–Y, X–Z and Y–Z axes are also investigated, which suggest that the sensor is capable of vector magnetic field measurement.</jats:p>"

A target‐enrichment approach was chosen, using the Angiosperms353 v.4 kit RNA‐baits and including 86 Bromelioideae species representing previously identified major evolutionary lineages. Phylogenetic analyses were based on 125 target nuclear loci, assembled off‐target plastome as well as mitogenome reads. A Bromelioideae phylogeny with a mostly well‐resolved backbone is provided based on nuclear (194 kbp), plastome (109 kbp), and mitogenome data (34 kbp). For the nuclear markers, a coalescent‐based analysis of single‐locus gene trees was performed as well as a supermatrix analysis of concatenated gene alignments. Nuclear and plastome datasets provide well‐resolved trees, which showed only minor topological incongruences. The mitogenome tree is not sufficiently resolved. A total of 26 well‐supported clades were identified.

We examine the change in the Pacific OMZ volume in an ensemble of ESMs from the CMIP6 archive, considering a broad range of oxygen (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) thresholds relevant to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems (5–160 µmol/kg). Despite OMZ biases in the historical period of the simulations, the ESM ensemble projections consistently fall into three regimes across ESMs: an expansion of low oxygenated waters (+0.8 [0.6, 1.0] × 10<jats:sup>16</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/century for O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ≤ 120 µmol/kg, ESM median and interquartile range); a slight contraction of the OMZ core although more uncertain across ESMs (−0.1 [−0.5, 0.0] × 10<jats:sup>16</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/century for O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ≤ 20 µmol/kg); and at the transition from contraction to expansion regimes, a spatial redistribution but near‐zero change in the volume of hypoxic waters (0.0 [−0.3, +0.1] × 10<jats:sup>16</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/century for O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ≤ 60 µmol/kg). Changes in circulation and biology dictate the shift from expansion to contraction. Specifically, reduced subtropical ventilation controls the expansion of low oxygenated waters, while a combination of circulation and biological changes explains the contraction of the core (likely changes in mixing, reduced intermediate ventilation and oxygen demand). Increased model complexity (e.g., ecosystem dynamics and equatorial circulation) likely stabilize the OMZ response, suggesting that future changes might lie in the lower bound of current projections. The expansion of low oxygenated waters which delimit the optimum habitat of numerous marine species would severely impact ecosystems and ecosystem services.</jats:p>",

The results showed that exogenous JA and MeJA at 1.0 mM significantly inhibited pollen tube germination and pollen tube elongation. and JA up-regulated CoCOI1, CoJAZ1, and CoMYC, the core genes of jasmonate signal transduction. Subcellular localization indicated that CoCOI1 and CoJAZ1 were located in the nucleus and CoMYC2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. The three genes exhibited tissue-specific expression pattern. CoCOI1 was significantly expressed in pollen, CoJAZ1 was significantly expressed in ovary, CoMYC2 was significantly expressed in filaments, but not in pollen. Furthermore, CoJAZ1 and CoMYC2 were highly expressing at 24 h in self-pollinated styles. These results suggested that JA signal transduction of C. oleifera was involved in the process of self-pollination, and thus in the process of plant defense.

Based on reanalysis data from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), the historical trends in the variation of BC and the factors affecting this were investigated in core city of Central Plains Economic Zone in China-Zhengzhou. Based on correlation analysis with ground measurements of BC concentration, it was determined that the MERRA-2 reanalysis data could be used to reveal the variations in ground-level BC concentrations. According to the variation trends of BC concentration in 1980–2020 and typical fossil fuel consumption in 2008–2017, two periods of rapidly increasing BC concentration were identified in 1980–1989 and 1999–2006. The increase in BC concentration then slowed from 2007. Since 2012, due to the adjustment of the Zhengzhou strategy and the implementation of an emission control strategy throughout Henan Province, the consumption of coal and coke decreased by 4% every year, resulting in a downward trend in the total BC emissions. However, coal and coke were still the main factors affecting the BC concentration in Zhengzhou. The contribution of transportation to BC in Zhengzhou has been particularly important since 2016. Analysis of BC seasonal variation revealed that the highest BC concentration was in winter, mainly due to the increase in industry and residential emissions. Additionally, based on the local and regional emission inventories and combined with potential source contribution function (PSCF), concentration weighted trajectory (CWT), this study revealed the potential sources regions and source types of BC in Zhengzhou, and found that the intensification of energy consumption and BC emissions in Zhengzhou and the surrounding regions of Henan Province might be the reasons for the high BC loading in Zhengzhou through regional transport.</jats:p>"

Our goal is to determine the level of chemical complexity towards the starless core L1517B, which seems younger than L1498, and compare it with the other two previously studied cores to see if there is a chemical evolution within the cores. We have carried out 3 mm high-sensitivity observations towards two positions in the L1517B starless core: the core’s centre and the position where the methanol emission peaks (at a distance of ∼5000 au from the core’s centre). Our observations reveal that a lower number of COMs and COM precursors are detected in L1517B with respect to L1498 and L1544, and also show lower abundances. Besides methanol, we only detected CH3O, H2CCO, CH3CHO, CH3CN, CH3NC, HCCCN, and HCCNC. Their measured abundances are ∼3 times larger towards the methanol peak than towards the core’s centre, mimicking the behaviour found towards the more evolved cores L1544 and L1498. We propose that the differences in the chemical complexity observed between the three studied starless cores are a consequence of their evolution, with L1517B being the less evolved one, followed by L1498 and L1544. Chemical complexity in these cores seems to increase over time, with N-bearing molecules forming first and O-bearing COMs forming at a later stage as a result of the catastrophic depletion of CO.</jats:p>",

One of the main and first challenges in designing molten salt fast reactors (MSFRs) is the selection of an appropriate molten salt fuel system based on the envisaged applications and objectives. In this study’s series, a full-scope evaluation has been conducted about employing either chloride or fluoride salt fuels as the main competitors’ candidates for fuel salt in MSFR designs. Two distinguished projects, EVOL (CNRS, Grenoble-France), based on fluoride salt, and iMAGINE (The University of Liverpool, UK), based on chloride salts, were considered in order to achieve this goal as case studies. The first part of this series (part 1—this article) deals with the investigation of the thermophysical properties of the salt fuel system, criticality search and neutron-flux energy spectrum. An identical typical design of the MSFR core has been considered for a neutronic simulation by using MCNPX V2.7 based on the chemical composition of the fuel salt mentioned in both projects. The thermophysical evaluation has been conducted through literature research and theoretical methods based on the experimental values for the salt component properties. The results of the study are presented for thermophysical properties, including the melting point, vapour pressure/boiling point, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and density, in addition to neutronic simulation for the core critical dimension and neutron-flux spectrum of both the chloride- and fluoride-based salt fuel systems. In the discussion of the results, it is concluded that both the chloride and fluoride salt fuel systems have benefits that are seen on different comparative parameters. The delivered data will provide future decision makers with evidence for the salt choice for balancing their design objectives with the opportunities and expectations. Thus, a final selection of the most appropriate salt fuel system to be used in MSFRs will be postponed for more investigation in the final part of this article series, combining the data with different potential user profiles.</jats:p>"

The tensile strength and knotting strength of CGG/ACNF suture prepared by twisting CGG/ACNF filaments increase by 69.5%, and CGG/ACNF suture has a similar friction coefficient to silk and PGLA sutures. Moreover, CGG/ACNF suture with antibiosis and cytocompatibility exhibits better growth promotion of cells than silk suture, similar to PGLA suture in vitro. In addition, the stitching experiment of mice with the CGG/ACNF suture further confirms better healing properties and less inflammation in vivo than silk and PGLA sutures do.

While finding extra-tidal stars is imperative for understanding cluster evolution, connecting isolated extra-tidal field stars back to their birth cluster is extremely difficult. In this work, we present a new methodology consisting of high-dimensional data analysis and a particle spray code to identify extra-tidal stars of any Galactic globular cluster using M3 as a case study. Using the t-Stochastic Neighbour Embedding and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine learning dimensionality reduction algorithms, we first identify a set of 103 extra-tidal candidates in the APOGEE DR17 data catalogue with chemical abundances similar to M3 stars. To confirm each candidate’s extra-tidal nature, we introduce corespray – a new python-based three-body particle spray code that simulates extra-tidal stars for any Galactic globular cluster. Using Gaia EDR3 proper motions and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we apply multivariate Gaussian modelling and an extreme deconvolution to identify the extra-tidal candidates that are more likely to be associated with a distribution of corespray-simulated M3 extra-tidal stars than the field. Through these methods, we identify 10 new high-probability extra-tidal stars produced via three-body interactions in M3. We also explore whether any of our extra-tidal candidates are consistent with being ejected from M3 through different dynamical processes. Future applications of corespray will yield better understandings of core dynamics, star formation histories, and binary fractions in globular clusters.</jats:p>",

Multiple regression analysis for disaster nursing core competencies revealed that the most powerful predictor was communication (β=.31, p&lt;.001). Communication, insight and having children explained approximately 30% of the variance in disaster nursing core competencies.Conclusion: The compassion competence of nurses at COVID-19 designated hospitals was a major factor influencing disaster nursing competence. Communication was the most important sub-factor of compassion competence.

Two sets of core-shell nanoparticles (S1 and S2) of similar core sizes of 5.0 nm and different shell thicknesses (4.1 nm for S1 and 5.7 nm for S2) were obtained by changing the number of nucleating sites. Magnetic measurements were conducted on the nanoparticles at low and room temperatures to study the shell thickness and temperature dependence of the magnetic properties. Interestingly, both core-shell nanoparticles showed similar saturation magnetization, revealing the ineffective role of the shell thickness. In addition, the coercivity in both samples displayed similar temperature dependencies and magnitudes. Signatures of spin glass (SG) like behavior were observed from the field-cooled temperature-dependent magnetization measurements. It was suggested to be due to interface spin freezing. We observed a slight and non-monotonic temperature-dependent exchange bias in both samples with slightly higher values for S2. The effective magnetic anisotropy constant was calculated to be slightly larger in S2 than that in S1. The magnetothermal efficiency of the chitosan-coated nanoparticles was determined by measuring the specific absorption rate (SAR) under an alternating magnetic field (AMF) at 200–350 G field strengths and frequencies (495.25–167.30 kHz). The S2 nanoparticles displayed larger SAR values than the S1 nanoparticles at all field parameters. A maximum SAR value of 356.5 W/g was obtained for S2 at 495.25 kHz and 350 G for the 1 mg/mL nanoparticle concentration of ferrogel. We attributed this behavior to the larger interface SG regions in S2, which mediated the interaction between the core and shell and thus provided indirect exchange coupling between the core and shell phases. The SAR values of the core-shell nanoparticles roughly agreed with the predictions of the linear response theory. The concentration of the nanoparticles was found to affect heat conversion to a great extent. The in vitro treatment of the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line and HT-29 human colorectal cancer cell was conducted at selected frequencies and field strengths to evaluate the efficiency of the nanoparticles in killing cancer cells. The cellular cytotoxicity was estimated using flow cytometry and an MTT assay at 0 and 24 h after treatment with the AMF. The cells subjected to a 45 min treatment of the AMF (384.50 kHz and 350 G) showed a remarkable decrease in cell viability. The enhanced SAR values of the core-shell nanoparticles compared to the seeds with the most enhancement in S2 is an indication of the potential for tailoring nanoparticle structures and hence their magnetic properties for effective heat generation.</jats:p>"

In this work, a mucus-binding factor knockout CRL1505 strain (ΔmbfCRL1505) was obtained and the lack of binding ability to both intestinal epithelial cells and mucin was demonstrated in vitro. In addition, two sets of in vivo experiments in 6-week-old Balb/c mice were performed to evaluate ΔmbfCRL1505 immunomodulatory activities. (A) Orally administered ΔmbfCRL1505 prior to intraperitoneal injection of the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist poly(I:C) significantly reduced intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD3+NK1.1+CD8αα+) and pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-15) in the intestinal mucosa. (B) Orally administered ΔmbfCRL1505 prior to nasal stimulation with poly(I:C) significantly decreased the levels of the biochemical markers of lung tissue damage. In addition, reduced recruitment of neutrophils and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8) as well as increased IFN-β and IFN-γ in the respiratory mucosa were observed in ΔmbfCRL1505-treated mice when compared to untreated control mice. The immunological changes induced by the ΔmbfCRL1505 strain were not different from those observed for the wild-type CRL1505 strain. Although it is generally accepted that the expression of adhesion factors is necessary for immunobiotics to induce their beneficial effects, it was demonstrated here that the mbf protein is not required for L. rhamnosus CRL1505 to exert its immunomodulatory activities in local and distal mucosal sites.

We show that due to asymmetries in the accretion process, the composition of the material falling onto a star may vary with time during the accretion of a single planetary body. Consequently, the instantaneous photospheric abundances of white dwarfs do not necessarily reflect the bulk composition of their pollutants, especially when their diffusion time-scales are short. In particular, we predict that when an asteroid with an iron core tidally disrupts around a white dwarf, a larger share of its mantle is ejected, and that the core/mantle fraction of the accreting material varies with time during the event. Crucially, this implies that the core fraction of differentiated pollutants cannot be determined for white dwarfs with short diffusion time-scales, which sample only brief episodes of longer accretion processes. The observed population of polluted white dwarfs backs up the proposed theory. More white dwarfs have accreted material with high Fe/Ca than low Fe/Ca relative to stellar abundance ratios, indicating the ejection of mantle material. Additionally, we find tentative evidence that the accretion rate of iron decreases more rapidly than that of magnesium or calcium, hinting at variability of the accreted composition. Further corroboration of the proposed theory will come from the upcoming analysis of large samples of young white dwarfs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Reconstruction of the distribution of ground motion due to an earthquake is one of the key technologies for the prediction of seismic damage to infrastructure. Particularly, the immediate reconstruction of the spatially continuous wavefield is valuable for decision-making of disaster response decisions in the initial phase. For a fast and accurate reconstruction, utilization of prior information is essential. In fluid mechanics, full-state recovery, which recovers the full state from sparse observation using a data-driven model reduced-order model, is actively used. In this study, the framework developed in the field of fluid mechanics is applied to seismic wavefield reconstruction. A seismic wavefield reconstruction framework based on compressed sensing using the data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) is proposed and its characteristics are investigated through numerical experiments. The data-driven ROM is generated from the data set of the wavefield using the singular value decomposition. The spatially continuous seismic wavefield is reconstructed from the sparse and discrete observation and the data-driven ROM. The observation sites used for reconstruction are effectively selected by the sensor optimization method for linear inverse problems based on a greedy algorithm. The proposed framework was applied to simulation data of theoretical waveform with the subsurface structure of the horizontally stratified three layers. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed by the reconstruction based on the noise-free observation. Since the ROM of the wavefield is used as prior information, the reconstruction error is reduced to an approximately lower error bound of the present framework, even though the number of sensors used for reconstruction is limited and randomly selected. In addition, the reconstruction error obtained by the proposed framework is much smaller than that obtained by the Gaussian process regression. For the numerical experiment with noise-contaminated observation, the reconstructed wavefield is degraded due to the observation noise, but the reconstruction error obtained by the present framework with all available observation sites is close to a lower error bound, even though the reconstructed wavefield using the Gaussian process regression is fully collapsed. Although the reconstruction error is larger than that obtained using all observation sites, the number of observation sites used for reconstruction can be reduced while minimizing the deterioration and scatter of the reconstructed data by combining it with the sensor optimization method. Hence, a better and more stable reconstruction of the wavefield than randomly selected observation sites can be realized, even if the reconstruction is carried out with a smaller number of observations with observation noise, by combining it with the sensor optimization method.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the expression of core components of the Hippo signaling pathway and its association with clinicopathological features in endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected endometrioid endometrial cancer specimens from 60 patients between January 2002 and December 2009 at Gyeongsang National University Hospital. Relevant clinicopathological data were obtained through electronic medical records of patients. The expression patterns of six core components (YAP, p-YAP, LATS1/2, MST1/2, KIBRA, and Merlin) were identified by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray sections. Results: The positive expression ratio was 75.0% for YAP, 73.3% for p-YAP, 26.7% for MST1/2, 16.7% for KIBRA, 15.0% for Merlin, and 15.0% for LATS1/2. YAP expression was negatively correlated with MST 1/2 kinases (p = 0.045) and positively correlated with p-YAP (p = 0.012). Merlin, and MST 1/2 kinases (p = 0.043) showed a positive correlation. A subgroup of patients aged below 60 years (p = 0.004) and with myometrial invasion depth of less than 1/2 (p = 0.041) showed a positive association with YAP expression. p-YAP expression was negatively associated with a subset of patients with primary tumour size ≥4 cm (p = 0.03). Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between age and YAP expression. The odds ratio of p-YAP expression was significantly lower in the group with tumour size ≥4 cm. Conclusion: Two prognostic factors, age and tumour size, were significantly associated with the expression of YAP and p-YAP in endometrial cancer. Further research should focus on their expression as a marker for prediction of clinicopathological implications in endometrial cancer.</jats:p>"

By introducing dynamic heterogeneous redundancy, the amimic control plane is built to effectively solve the problems of single control points of failure, unknown backdoor vulnerabilities and static configuration. Heterogeneity is an important indicator for evaluating the security of a system. Generally speaking, the greater the heterogeneity, the higher the security. Currently, there is little research evaluating the security of the mimic control plane in SDN by quantifying the heterogeneity. To this end, this paper proposes two methods for measuring the heterogeneity, based on the biological population diversity assessment method. Firstly, the heterogeneity quantification method, i.e., method 1, is based on system complexity and difference. On this basis, another heterogeneous quantification method, i.e., method 2, is established using high order symbiosis of the vulnerabilities. The experimental results show that, compared to the known methods, the heterogeneous quantification method 1 considers more comprehensive factors and is closer to reality. The heterogeneity quantification method 2 is more instructive to quantify the security of the mimic control plane.</jats:p>"

This article focuses attention on the vivid examples of interaction among fundamentally different spheres of music playing: ethnic, academic, jazz and modern pop music. The growing number of examples of combining music with various types of thinking and rules of organizing musical materials, observed during the past 70 years, posed a question to music theoreticians and historians concerning the genre-based definition of these fundamentally new types of music. Presently, none of the existing genre-based definitions of the aforementioned musical compositions has a concrete wholesome description; they contain numerous contradictions, tautologies and interchangeable terms. To solve these problems, we have introduced a separate category, unionique music, which includes music works created as a result of organic combination of elements from a broad range of music spheres: from the music of Western European academic tradition to electronic music. This article offers an analysis of Ravi Shankar’s Concerto No 1 for Sitar &amp; Orchestra and Anoushka Shankar’s Land of Gold album. A characteristic feature of these works is the basic ethnic component, while in other aspects, they have essential differences. Analysis of recent research and publications. An important place in this article is occupied by the world music genre, because it contains a vividly expressive ethnic component. Therefore, this article uses research works devoted to the world music genre by P. Bohlman, R. Middleton, M. Hart, I. Fedorova, and the studies of history and theory of Indian musical culture. The main goal of the study is to identify, based on the analysis of Ravi Shankar’s Concerto No 1 for Sitar &amp; Orchestra and Anoushka Shankar’s Land of Gold album, the factors that place these compositions into the unionique music category. Methodology: the historical, analytical and comparative methods were used to achieve the goal set forth in this article. Results and conclusions. Our analysis has revealed that Anoushka Shankar’s Land of Gold album and Ravi Shankar’s Concerto No 1 for Sitar &amp; Orchestra are the works that have no analogues, and based on all features, they fall into the unionique music category. The author of this article has come to a conclusion that a new paradigm of musical thinking has occurred in the 21st century, featuring the use of a broad range of expressive means in the works of music to create compositions at a fundamentally different level. The importance of perceiving all spheres of music playing as equal parts of a wholesome picture of the musical world as well as the understanding the rules of every sphere of music was stressed upon. The fact that interaction among music domains has a substantial potential for the creation of various interesting compositions that enrich the musical culture was established.</jats:p>"

The histologic distinction between papillary breast lesions remains challenging, especially on core biopsy specimens. Aim: This study aimed to determine the rate of upgrade to atypia or malignancy of biopsy-proven papillary lesions on surgical follow-up and to assess for factors associated with an upgrade in Greater Vancouver, BC, Canada. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective population-based study of all breast papillary lesions diagnosed on core biopsy between 2017 and 2019 in the Fraser Health Authority in Greater Vancouver, Canada. Patients were retrieved from the laboratory information system. Patient demographics, histopathologic, and radiologic findings were analyzed. Results: A total of 269 specimens from 269 patients (mean 61.1 years), including 265 female and 4 male patients, were included in the study. Of the 269 specimens, 129 (48%) were intraductal papillomas and 140 (52%) were atypical papillary lesions. The overall upgrade rate among papillomas was 11.6% (15 of 129) on final excision. The mean age of patients diagnosed with papilloma on core biopsy was significantly younger than those with atypical papillary lesions (55.6 vs 66.1 years, P &lt; .0001). Lesion size in patients with papillomas on core biopsy was significantly smaller than those with atypical papillary lesions (11.1 vs 15.1 mm, P = .001). The upgrade rates in patients &lt;55 and ≥55 years were 4.9% and 13.2%. Size ( P = .004) and atypia on core biopsy ( P = .009) were significantly associated with upgrade. Older age (&gt;55 years) (OR =  5.3, 95% CI: 1.04-27.08) was an independent predictor of upgrade among papillomas. Size, location, and Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) radiologic categories in our study were not associated with predicting the upgrade of papillomas. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the risk of upgrade to atypia or malignancy is sufficient to warrant the excision of benign papillomas of any size in patients aged ≥55 years. In patients younger than 55 years, observation with close clinical and radiological follow-up without surgery may be sufficient. Our findings also support surgical excision of papillomas diagnosed on core biopsy when associated with atypia. </jats:p>",

We adopt the soft-step function to model the chemical and structural anisotropy of the peripheral PEL. In addition, the PEL for the aforementioned bio-systems immersed in aquatic microenvironment often induces dielectric gradient-mediated ion partitioning effect, which in turn leads to the PEL to be partially ion penetrable. Within the Debye–Hückel electrostatic framework, we derive a general expression for electrophoretic mobility of a soft particle considering the combined impacts of hydrophobicity of the inner core, inhomogeneously distributed segment distribution accompanied by chemical heterogeneity and ion partitioning effect.

Cavanaugh et al., J. Chem. Phys. 155, 244705 (2021)]. Several possible assignments are considered, and a substitutional indium adjacent to a zinc vacancy, In3+/VZn2−, is found to be the most likely. This assignment is consistent with the observation that trapping occurs only when the QD has excess indium and is supported by experiments showing that the addition of zinc oleate or acetate decreases the extent of trapping, presumably by filling some of the vacancy traps. We also show that the addition of alkyl carboxylic acids causes increased trapping, presumably by the creation of additional zinc vacancies. The calculations show that either a single In2+ ion or an In2+–In3+ dimer is much too easily oxidized to form the reversible traps observed experimentally, while In3+ is far too difficult to oxidize. Additional experimental data on InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in the absence of chloride demonstrates that the reversible traps are not associated with Cl−. However, a zinc vacancy adjacent to a substitutional indium is calculated to have its highest occupied orbitals about 1 eV above the top of the valence band of bulk ZnSe, in the appropriate energy range to act as reversible traps for quantum confined holes in the InP valence band. The associated orbitals are predominantly composed of p orbitals on the Se atoms adjacent to the Zn vacancy.</jats:p>",

It is a 537 amino acids protein with an 82 residues long hydrophilic cytoplasmic N‐terminus followed by a transmembrane part comprising 14 transmembrane helices. We optimized the functional expression of <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2 in the plasma membrane of a salt‐sensitive <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic> strain and characterized in vivo a set of mutated or truncated versions of <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2 in terms of their substrate specificity, transport activity, localization, and protein stability. We identified a highly conserved proline 246, located in the core of the protein, as being crucial for ion selectivity. The replacement of P246 with serine or threonine resulted in antiporters with altered substrate specificity that were not only highly active at acidic pH 4.0 (like the native antiporter), but also at neutral pH. P246T/S versions also exhibited increased resistance to the <jats:italic>Hs</jats:italic>NHA2‐specific inhibitor phloretin. We experimentally proved that a putative salt bridge between E215 and R432 is important for antiporter function, but also structural integrity.

Since a landslide is caused by a combination of the triggers of rainfall and the vulnerability of spatial information, a study that can suggest a method to analyze the complex relationship between the two factors is required. In this study, the relationship between complex factors (rainfall period, accumulated rainfall, and spatial information characteristics) was designed as a system dynamics model as variables to check the possibility of occurrence of vulnerable areas according to the rainfall characteristics that change in real-time. In contrast to the current way of predicting the collapse time by analysing rainfall data, the developed model can set the precipitation period during rainfall. By setting the induced rainfall period, the researcher can then assess the susceptibility of the landslide-vulnerable area. Further, because the geospatial information features and rainfall data for the 672 h before the landslide's occurrence were combined, the results of the susceptibility analysis could be determined for each topographical characteristic according to the rainfall period and cumulative rainfall change. Third, by adjusting the General cumulative rainfall period (D<jats:sub>G</jats:sub>) and Inter-event time definition (IETD), the preceding rainfall period can be adjusted, and desired results can be obtained. An analysis method that can solve complex relationships can contribute to the prediction of landslide warning times and expected occurrence locations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Air trapped in polar ice provides unique records of the past atmospheric composition ranging from key greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) to short-lived trace gases like ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8). Provided that the analyzed species concentrations and their isotopic fingerprints accurately reflect the past atmospheric composition, biogeochemical cycles can be reconstructed. Recently, the comparison of CH4 records obtained using different extraction methods revealed disagreements in the CH4 concentration for the last glacial in Greenland ice. Elevated methane levels were detected in dust-rich ice core sections measured discretely pointing to a process sensitive to the melt extraction technique. To shed light on the underlying mechanism, we performed targeted experiments and analyzed samples for methane and other short-chain alkanes ethane and propane covering the time interval from 12 to 42 kyr. Here, we report our findings of these elevated alkane concentrations occurring in dust-rich sections of Greenland ice cores. The alkane production happens during the melt extraction step (in extractu) of the classic wet extraction technique and reaches 14 to 91 ppb for CH4 excess in dusty ice samples. We document for the first time a co-production of excess methane, ethane, and propane (excess alkanes) with the observed concentrations for ethane and propane exceeding their past atmospheric background at least by a factor of 10. Independent of the produced amounts, excess alkanes were produced in a fixed molar ratio of approximately 14:2:1, indicating a shared origin. The amount of excess alkanes scales linearly with the amount of mineral dust within the ice samples. The isotopic characterization of excess CH4 reveals a relatively heavy carbon isotopic signature of -46.4 ‰ (± 2.4 ‰) and a light deuterium isotopic signature of -318 (± 53 ‰) in the samples analyzed. With the co-production ratios of excess alkanes and the isotopic composition of excess methane we established a fingerprint that allows us to confine potential formation processes. This fingerprint is not in line with a microbial origin, rather such an alkane pattern is indicative of abiotic decomposition of organic matter as found in sediments, soils and plant leaves. This study provides first indications for an abiotic reaction producing excess alkanes during ice core analyses and discusses potential mechanisms. We see an urgent need to correct the already existing discrete CH4 records for excess CH4 contribution (CH4(xs), δ13C-CH4(xs), δD-CH4(xs)) in dust-rich intervals in Greenland ice. Specifically, excess CH4 has a significant effect on the assessments of the hemispheric CH4 source distribution. As we observe that in some intervals excess CH4 is in the same range as the Inter-Polar Difference (IPD), previous interpretations of relative contribution of high latitude northern hemispheric CH4 sources need to be revised.\n                        </jats:p>"

This study determined the exclusive and shared core microbiome taxa of two reef‐building coral species (<jats:italic>Pocillopora damicornis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. verrucosa</jats:italic>), as well as the surrounding seawater and sediment, in six coral communities along the Northeastern tropical Pacific region. We also analysed the putative metabolic functions of the most abundant OTUs of these core microbiomes and evaluated the influence of anthropogenic stressors (i.e., tourism, fishery, eutrophication, among others) on core microbiome composition. Bacterial diversity was assessed by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA. The bacterial families Planctomycetaceae, Oceanospirillaceae, and Moraxellaceae presented the highest relative abundances in corals samples, while Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae dominated in seawater samples. In the sediment samples, Pseudoalteromonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Moraxellaceae, and Pseudonocardiaceae had the highest representation. The core microbiomes of the two coral species, seawater, and sediment, shared 571 OTUs. The <jats:italic>P. damicornis</jats:italic> core microbiome varied between sites with low and moderately‐high anthropogenic stressors. The core microbiomes of both coral species showed an increase in the relative abundance of the families Planctomycetaceae and Pseudomonadaceae in the sites with moderate‐high anthropogenic stressors, associated with higher values of ammonium, chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>, and extinction coefficient. In contrast, the core microbiome of <jats:italic>P. verrucosa</jats:italic>, seawater, and sediments did not vary between sites with different anthropogenic stress conditions. Aerobic chemoheterotrophy was the metabolic function with the highest occurrence in all substrates' core microbiomes, followed by ureolysis and photoautotrophy.</jats:p>",

The capability of the methodology to address the surface evolution of the cobalt oxidation state is tested through a proof of concept surface modification introduced by Ar‐ion sputtering. To address the cobalt local electronic structure at different depths from the extreme surface, we exploited Auger‐free Hard X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) spectra to fit the Co 2p core‐level features in the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra.

Upon viral entry, host replication machinery is hijacked, supporting new virus particle production and thereby allowing viral survival in the host. In this process, host proteins interact with viral proteins to either facilitate viral replication, or they may provide antiviral defense mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed the impact of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection on the global proteome of Dicer active Aedes albopictus cells during the early and late time points of infection. We utilized a bottom-up approach of global proteomics analysis, and we used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to identify the global protein signatures of Ae. albopictus at two different time points upon CHIKV infection. The mass spectrometry data analysis of the early time point revealed that proteins belonging to pathways such as translation, RNA processing, and cellular metabolic processes were less in abundance, whereas those belonging to pathways such as cellular catabolic process and organic substance transport were significantly abundant. At later time points, proteins belonging to pathways such as cellular metabolic processes, primary metabolic process, organonitrogen compound metabolic process, and organic substance metabolic process were found to be decreased in their presence, whereas those belonging to pathways such as RNA processing, gene expression, macromolecule metabolic processing, and nitrogen compound metabolic processing were found to be abundant during CHIKV infection, indicating that modulation in gene expression favoring cell survival occurs at a later time point, suggesting a survival strategy of Aedes cells to counter prolonged CHIKV infection.</jats:p>"

Moreover, good stability over a long testing time (50 h) is demonstrated.

It stimulates the hunting behavior of the sand cat, which attacks or searches for prey according to the sound frequency; each sand cat aims to catch better prey. Therefore, the sand cat will search for a better location to catch better prey. In the SCSO algorithm, each sand cat will gradually approach its prey, which makes the algorithm a strong exploitation ability. However, in the later stage of the SCSO algorithm, each sand cat is prone to fall into the local optimum, making it unable to find a better position. In order to improve the mobility of the sand cat and the exploration ability of the algorithm. In this paper, a modified sand cat swarm optimization (MSCSO) algorithm is proposed. The MSCSO algorithm adds a wandering strategy. When attacking or searching for prey, the sand cat will walk to find a better position. The MSCSO algorithm with a wandering strategy enhances the mobility of the sand cat and makes the algorithm have stronger global exploration ability. After that, the lens opposition-based learning strategy is added to enhance the global property of the algorithm so that the algorithm can converge faster. To evaluate the optimization effect of the MSCSO algorithm, we used 23 standard benchmark functions and CEC2014 benchmark functions to evaluate the optimization performance of the MSCSO algorithm. In the experiment, we analyzed the data statistics, convergence curve, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and box graph. Experiments show that the MSCSO algorithm with a walking strategy and a lens position-based learning strategy had a stronger exploration ability. Finally, the MSCSO algorithm was used to test seven engineering problems, which also verified the engineering practicability of the proposed algorithm.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In vitro drug release testing is an important quality control tool for formulation development. However, the literature has evidence that poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA)-based formulations show a slower in vitro drug release than a real in vivo drug release. Much longer in vitro drug release profiles may not be reflective of real in vivo performances and may significantly affect the timeline for a formulation development. The objective of this study was to develop a surfactant mediated accelerated in vitro drug release method for the PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) of a novel chemotherapeutic agent AC1LPSZG, a model drug with a poor solubility. The Sotax USP apparatus 4 was used to test in vitro drug release in a phosphate buffer with a pH value of 6.8. The sink conditions were improved using surfactants in the order of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) &lt; Tween 80 &lt; cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The dissolution efficiency (DE) and area under the dissolution curve (AUC) were increased three-fold when increasing the CTAB concentration in the phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Similar Weibull release kinetics and good linear correlations (R2~0.99) indicated a good correlation between the real-time in vitro release profile in the phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and accelerated release profiles in the optimized medium. This newly developed accelerated and discriminatory in vitro test can be used as a quality control tool to identify critical formulation and process parameters to ensure a batch-to-batch uniformity. It may also serve as a surrogate for bioequivalence studies if a predictive in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) is obtained. The results of this study are limited to AC1LPSZG NPs, but a similar consideration can be extended to other PLGA-based NPs of drugs with similar properties and solubility profiles.</jats:p>"

Moreover, re-training within 3 days led to natural long-term recall, indicating facilitated consolidation. Inhibiting offline CA1 activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity, or protein synthesis after first exposure to the STM-forming event impaired the future re-exposure-facilitated consolidation, which highlights a role of protein synthesis, NMDAR and NREM sleep in the long-term storage of an STM trace. These results provide evidence that STM is not completely lost within hours and demonstrates a possible two-step STM consolidation, first long-term storage as a behaviorally inactive engram, then transformation into an active state by recurrence within 3 days.</jats:p>"

Protein corona identity and abundance characterization is entirely dependent on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), though the variability of this technique for the purpose of protein corona characterization remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the variability of LC-MS/MS workflows in analysis of identical aliquots of protein coronas by sending them to different proteomics core-facilities and analyzing the retrieved datasets. While the shared data between the cores correlate well, there is considerable heterogeneity in the data retrieved from different cores. Specifically, out of 4022 identified unique proteins, only 73 (1.8%) are shared across the core facilities providing semiquantitative analysis. These findings suggest that protein corona datasets cannot be easily compared across independent studies and more broadly compromise the interpretation of protein corona research, with implications in biomarker discovery as well as the safety and efficacy of our nanoscale biotechnologies.</jats:p>"

Resisting certain types of information and actors online requires people to adopt new mental habits that help them avoid being tempted by attention-grabbing and potentially harmful content. We argue that digital information literacy must include the competence of critical ignoring—choosing what to ignore and where to invest one’s limited attentional capacities. We review three types of cognitive strategies for implementing critical ignoring: self-nudging, in which one ignores temptations by removing them from one’s digital environments; lateral reading, in which one vets information by leaving the source and verifying its credibility elsewhere online; and the do-not-feed-the-trolls heuristic, which advises one to not reward malicious actors with attention. We argue that these strategies implementing critical ignoring should be part of school curricula on digital information literacy. Teaching the competence of critical ignoring requires a paradigm shift in educators’ thinking, from a sole focus on the power and promise of paying close attention to an additional emphasis on the power of ignoring. Encouraging students and other online users to embrace critical ignoring can empower them to shield themselves from the excesses, traps, and information disorders of today’s attention economy. </jats:p>",

The HCBF functions as a micro Fabry-Perot cavity and possesses low transmission loss. One FPI acts as the sensing unit while the other FPI is used as the reference unit to generate the Vernier effect. The sensing FPI was prepared by fusion splicing a section of HCBF between a single-mode fiber (SMF) and a hollow silica tube (HST), and the reference FPI was fabricated by sandwiching a piece of HCBF between two SMFs. Two FPIs with very different free spectral ranges (FSRs) in the fringe pattern were connected to the 2 × 2 coupler parallelly, which realizes the harmonic Vernier effect and ensures the stability of the interference fringe. Laboratory results exhibited that the pressure sensitivity can be enhanced to 119.3 nm/MPa within 0-0.5 MPa by the proposed sensor. Moreover, low-temperature crosstalk of 0.074 kPa/° was achieved. Compared with the traditional optical fiber gas pressure sensor, the advanced sensor features high sensitivity, stability, easy fabrication, and fast response, which can be a promising candidate for real-time and high-precision gas pressure monitoring.</jats:p>",

In the present study, partially purified α-amylase was obtained from strains of Pseudogymnoascus sp. obtained from Antarctic and Arctic locations. Partially purified α-amylases from these polar fungi exhibited very similar characteristics, including being active at 15 °C, although having a small difference in optimum pH. Both fungal taxa are good candidates for the potential application of cold-active enzymes in biotechnological industries, and further purification and characterization steps are now required. The α-amylases from polar fungi are attractive in terms of industrial development because they are active at lower temperatures and acidic pH, thus potentially creating energy and cost savings. Furthermore, they prevent the production of maltulose, which is an undesirable by-product often formed under alkaline conditions. Psychrophilic amylases from the polar Pseudogymnoascus sp. investigated in the present study could provide a valuable future contribution to biotechnological applications.</jats:p>"

A 45% national reduction in CO2 emissions has been projected by government to realize net zero carbon in 2030. CO2 utilization is the prominent solution to curb not only CO2 but other greenhouse gases, such as methane, on a large scale. For decades, thermocatalytic CO2 conversions into clean fuels and specialty chemicals through catalytic CO2 hydrogenation and CO2 reforming using green hydrogen and pure methane sources have been under scrutiny. However, these processes are still immature for industrial applications because of their thermodynamic and kinetic limitations caused by rapid catalyst deactivation due to fouling, sintering, and poisoning under harsh conditions. Therefore, a key research focus on thermocatalytic CO2 conversion is to develop high-performance and selective catalysts even at low temperatures while suppressing side reactions. Conventional catalysts suffer from a lack of precise structural control, which is detrimental toward selectivity, activity, and stability. Core-shell is a recently emerged nanomaterial that offers confinement effect to preserve multiple functionalities from sintering in CO2 conversions. Substantial progress has been achieved to implement core-shell in direct or indirect thermocatalytic CO2 reactions, such as methanation, methanol synthesis, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and dry reforming methane. However, cost-effective and simple synthesis methods and feasible mechanisms on core-shell catalysts remain to be developed.

In particular, the extent of stable stratification (i.e., non‐convective regions) in the planet strongly influences long‐term cooling processes, and may record primordial heavy element gradients from early in a planet's formation. Because the Galileo entry probe measured a subsolar helium abundance, Jupiter interior models often invoke an outer stably stratified region due to helium rain. Additionally, Juno gravity data suggest a deeper, potentially stratified dilute core extending halfway through the planet. However, fits to Jupiter's gravitational data are non‐unique, and outstanding uncertainty over the equations of state for hydrogen and helium remain. Here, we use high‐resolution numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Jupiter's magnetic field to place constraints on the extent of stable stratification within the planet. We find that compared to traditional interior models, an upper stably stratified layer between 0.9 and 0.95 Jupiter radii (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>J</jats:italic></jats:sub>) helps to explain both Jupiter's dipolar magnetic field and zonal winds. In contrast, an extended dilute core that is entirely stably stratified (no convective layers) yields significantly worse fits to both. However, our models with extended deep stratification still generate dipolar magnetic fields if an upper stratified region is also present. Overall, we find that a planet with a dilute core i.e., strongly stably stratified is increasingly challenging to reconcile with Jupiter's magnetic field and winds. Thus if a dilute core is present, alternative modalities such as a fully convective dilute core, a complex multilayered interior structure, or double diffusive convection may be required.</jats:p>",

Thus, effective post–hip fracture rehabilitation is crucial to enable patients to regain function and improve their quality of life. Most post–hip fracture rehabilitation programs focus only on physical functioning, but rehabilitation goals related to the quality of life, social participation, and environmental issues are also crucial considerations. This study aimed to develop a core set of considerations based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) for use as a reference in designing comprehensive rehabilitation programs for patients with hip fractures. For this purpose, we recruited 20 experts from related fields working at a university hospital to complete a three-round Delphi-based questionnaire. Before beginning this process, a literature review related to ICF category selection was conducted. Next, a 5-point Likert scale was employed to rate the importance of each proposed category, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and semi-interquartile range indices were analyzed to rate the consensus status. Categories for the ICF core set of considerations for post-hip-fracture rehabilitation were chosen on the basis of a high level of consensus and a mean score of ≥4.5 in the third Delphi-based questionnaire round. After selection, the ICF core set comprised 34 categories, namely 15 for bodily functions, 5 for bodily structures, 13 for activities and participation, and 1 for environmental factors. The proposed post-hip-fracture rehabilitation ICF core set can serve as a reference for developing effective rehabilitation strategies and goal setting by interdisciplinary teams. However, further feasibility evaluation is recommended for individualized rehabilitation program design.</jats:p>"

This potentially leads to the unfair exclusion of patients from EVT. We propose that net water uptake (NWU) can be used in addition to CTP to more accurately assess the extent and/or stage of tissue infarction. Patients treated for AIS between 06/2015 and 07/2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline CTP-derived core volume (pCore) and NWU were determined. Logistic regression tested the relationship between baseline clinical and imaging variables and core-overestimation (primary outcome). The secondary outcomes comprised 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin score) and lesion growth. 284 patients were included. Median NWU was 7.2% (IQR 2.6–12.8). ASPECTS (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.51), NWU (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–0.98), onset to recanalization (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.00) and imaging (RR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.00) times, and pCore (RR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.02) were significantly associated with core overestimation. Core-overestimation was more likely to occur in patients with large pCores and low NWU at baseline. NWU was significantly correlated with lesion growth. We conclude that NWU can be used as a supplemental tool to CTP during admission imaging to more accurately assess the extent of ischemia, particularly relevant for patients with large CTP-defined cores who would otherwise be excluded from treatment.</jats:p>"

This work addressed the evaluation of different temperature‐ and precipitation‐based CE in SA considering the CORDEX‐CORE ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) and their driving earth system models (ESMs) in the reference period 1981–2010 and the late 21st century (2070–2099), for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. The assessment focused on model performance for the individual events—heatwaves (HWs), Extreme rainfall (ER) days, and dry‐spells (DSs)—and their compound occurrence in terms of climatological frequency and duration. The spatial patterns of individual events were adequately reproduced by the RCMs, evidencing general overestimations in extreme precipitation intensities. In terms of CE, the frequencies of coincident HWs and DSs (sequential DSs and ER) were remarkable over central‐eastern Brazil and southern SA (southeastern SA). The main features of CE were generally well‐simulated by the RCMs, although they presented regional differences such as an underestimation of the maximum frequencies of these two CE in northeastern Brazil and southeastern SA, respectively. The high‐resolution information was generally in line with the larger‐scale driving ESMs. The climate change signal analysis generally showed robust future increases in CE frequency and duration in different areas of SA, as for coincident HWs and DSs (sequential DSs and ER) over northern SA and southern Brazil (southeastern SA). This was mostly consistent among the RCMs ensemble and notably strengthened in the worst‐case scenario (RCP 8.5).</jats:p>",

Complete phenol degradative genes involved only in the ortho-cleavage were detected in both strains. This was validated using assays of the enzymes catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which indicated the activity of only catechol 1,2-dioxygenase in both strains, in agreement with the results from the WGS. Both strains were psychrotolerant with the optimum temperature for phenol degradation, being between 10 and 15 °C.

Due to the outstanding photoluminescence (PL) properties of quantum dots (QDs), a high-quality CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) aptasensor for simultaneously monitoring the amyloid-β oligomers (AβO) and tau protein was proposed. By engineering the interior inorganic structure and inorganic–organic interface, water-soluble dual-color CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs with a near-unity PL quantum yield (&gt;90%) and mono-exponential PL decay dynamics were generated. The π–π stacking and hydrogen bond interaction between the aptamer-functionalized dual-color QDs and gold nanorods@polydopamine (Au NRs@PDA) nanoparticles resulted in significant fluorescence quenching of the QDs through FRET. Upon the incorporation of the AβO and tau protein, the fluorescence recovery of the QDs-DNA/Au NRs@PDA assembly was attained, providing the possibility of simultaneously assaying the two types of AD core biomarkers. The lower detection limits of 50 pM for AβO and 20 pM for the tau protein could be ascribed to the distinguishable and robust fluorescence of QDs and broad spectral absorption of Au NRs@PDA. The sensing strategy serves as a viable platform for the simultaneously monitoring of the core biomarkers for AD and other major diseases.</jats:p>"

When designing a delivery system with optimized penetration behavior across the biological barriers, mechanical properties, such as deformability, are emerging as important parameters that need to be considered, although they are usually neglected in current research. Herein, a liquid core nanoparticle (LCN) composed of a polymer‐encapsulated edible oil droplet is demonstrated. Owing to the unique structure in which the liquid oil core is encapsulated by a layer of highly hydrophilic and cross‐linked polymer, the LCN exhibits high mechanical softness, making it deformable under external forces. With high deformability, LCNs can effectively penetrate through several important biological barriers including deep tumor tissue, blood–brain barriers, mucus layers, and bacterial biofilms. Moreover, the potential of the LCN as a drug delivery system is also demonstrated by the loading and release of several clinical drugs. With the capability of penetrating biological barriers and delivering drugs, LCN provides a potential platform for disease treatments, particularly for those suffering from inadequate drug penetration.</jats:p>",

Emerging tip-scan HS-AFM overcame this design hindrance and opened a door for additional functionalities. In this study, we designed a motor-driven stretching device to manipulate elastic substrates for HS-AFM imaging of biomolecules under controllable mechanical stimulation. To demonstrate the applicability of the substrate stretching device, we observed a microtubule buckling by straining the substrate and actin filaments linked by α-actinin on a curved surface. In addition, a BAR domain protein BIN1 that senses substrate curvature was observed while dynamically controlling the surface curvature.

In this work, strong and tough hierarchical core–shell fibers with cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in the core and regenerated silk fibroins (RSFs) in the shell are designed and prepared, mimicking natural spider silks. CNF/RSF core–shell fibers with precisely controlled morphology are continuously wet‐spun using a co‐axial microfluidic device. Highly‐dense non‐covalent interactions are introduced between negatively‐charged CNFs in the core and positively‐charged RSFs in the shell, diminishing the core/shell interface and forming an integral hierarchical fiber. Meanwhile, shearing by microfluidic channels and post‐stretching induce a better ordering of CNFs in the core and RSFs in the shell, while ordered CNFs and RSFs are more densely packed, thus facilitating the formation of non‐covalent interactions within the fiber matrix. Therefore, CNF/RSF core–shell fibers demonstrate excellent mechanical performances; especially after post‐stretching, their tensile strength, tensile strain, Young's modulus, and toughness are up to 635 MPa, 22.4%, 24.0 GPa, and 110 MJ m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The B cell and T cell antigen receptors (BCR and TCR) share a common architecture in which variable dimeric antigen-binding modules assemble with invariant dimeric signaling modules to form functional receptor complexes. In the TCR, a highly conserved T cell receptor αβ (TCRαβ) transmembrane (TM) interface forms a rigid structure around which its three dimeric signaling modules assemble through well-characterized polar interactions. Noting that the key features stabilizing this TCRαβ TM interface also appear with high evolutionary conservation in the TM sequences of the membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) heavy chains that form the BCR’s homodimeric antigen-binding module, we asked whether the BCR contained an analogous TM structure. Using an unbiased biochemical and computational modeling approach, we found that the mouse IgM BCR forms a core TM structure that is remarkably similar to that of the TCR. This structure is reinforced by a network of interhelical hydrogen bonds, and our model is nearly identical to the arrangement observed in the just-released cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of intact human BCRs. Our biochemical analysis shows that the integrity of this TM structure is vital for stable assembly with the BCR signaling module CD79AB in the B cell endoplasmic reticulum, and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that BCRs of all five isotypes can form comparable structures. These results demonstrate that, despite their many differences in composition, complexity, and ligand type, TCRs and BCRs rely on a common core TM structure that has been shaped by evolution for optimal receptor assembly and stability in the cell membrane.</jats:p>",

In the present study, Fox R1 was further characterized using housekeeping genes and pathogenicity tests, as Fusarium oxysporum R1 f.sp. iridacearum race 4. Though Fox R1 invaded the saffron plant through both corm and roots, the corm was found to be the preferred site of infection. In addition, the route of pathogen movement wastracked by monitoring visual symptoms, semi-quantitative PCR, quantitative-PCR (q-PCR), real-time imaging of egfp-tagged Fusarium oxysporum R1, and Fox R1 load quantification. This study is the first study of its kind on the bidirectional pathogenesis from corm to roots and vice-versa, as the literature only reports unidirectional upward movement from roots to other parts of the plant. In addition, the colonization pattern of Fox R1 in saffron corms and roots was studied.

Representational similarity analysis reveals that the structure of task representations is preserved across the three brain parts. Principal component analysis visualizes distinct organizations of abstract cognitive functions in each part of the cerebellum and subcortex. More than 90% of the cognitive tasks are decodable from the cerebellum and subcortical activities, even for the novel tasks not included in model training.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS), other UK government agencies and the World Health Organization (WHO) advised people to cough into their elbows. It was thought that this would reduce viral spread and protect the public. However, there is limited peer reviewed evidence to support this. Objectives: To determine if cough related interventions reduce environmental contamination, protecting members of the public from infection. Methods: Scientists and engineers at the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) laboratory used a human cough simulator that provided a standardised cough challenge using a solution of simulated saliva and a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus; Phi6. Pseudomonas syringae settle plates were used to detect viable Phi6 virus following a simulated cough into a 4 × 4 m test chamber. The unimpeded pattern of contamination was compared to that when a hand or elbow was placed over the mouth during the cough. High speed back-lit video was also taken to visualise the aerosol dispersion. Results and Discussion: Viable virus spread up to 2 m from the origin of the cough outwards in a cloud. Recommended interventions, such as putting a hand or elbow in front of the mouth changed the pattern of cough aerosol dispersion. A hand deflected the cough to the side, protecting those in front from exposure, however it did not prevent environmental contamination. It also allowed for viral transfer from the hand to surfaces such as door handles. A balled fist in front of the mouth did not deflect the cough. Putting an elbow in front of the mouth deflected the aerosol cloud to above and below the elbow, but would not have protected any individuals standing in front. However, if the person coughed into a sleeved elbow more of the aerosol seemed to be absorbed. Coughing into a bare elbow still allowed for transfer to the environment if people touched the inside of their elbow soon after coughing. Conclusions: Interventions can change the environmental contamination pattern resulting from a human cough but may not reduce it greatly.</jats:p>"

Results were then mixed to illuminate the essential conditions for supporting family connection to health care, mental health care, and social services. Qualitative analysis identified themes related to empathic engagement and person‐centred navigation as central to connecting families to needed services. Quantitative analysis of navigator effort identified participant outreach, weekly check‐ins, service identification, and ongoing supervision as essential navigation activities.

Four optimal end-members are unmixed, and three transport-deposition processes are revealed, including the runoff, wave and aeolian processes. The humidity index synthesized by the runoff and aeolian end-members in the core sediment is used to reconstruct the humidity variability in the East Asian monsoonal domain since the last deglaciation. Our record shows that the patterns of humidity variability are coincidentally linked with the monsoonal precipitation index from the same core and stalagmite record in southern China. The Holocene optimum is identified in early and middle Holocene. In addition, a series of millennial- and multi-centennial-scale dry events documented in our record are well correlated with the ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic. The results reveal that the grain-size record from Anguli-nuur lake is sensitive in response to moisture variability in northern China.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Treatment of early-stage breast cancer currently includes surgical removal of the tumor and (partial) breast irradiation of the tumor site performed at fractionated dose. Although highly effective, this treatment is exhaustive for both patient and clinic. In this study, the theoretical potential of an alternative treatment combining thermal ablation with low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy using radioactive magnetic nanoparticles (RMNPs) containing 103-palladium was researched. Methods: The radiation dose characteristics and emission spectra of a single RMNP were calculated, and dose distributions of a commercial brachytherapy seed and an RMNP brachytherapy seed were simulated using Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit. Results: It was found that the RMNP seeds deliver a therapeutic dose similar to currently used commercial seed, while the dose distribution shows a spherical fall off compared to the more inhomogeneous dose distribution of the commercial seed. Changes in shell thickness only changed the dose profile between 2 × 10−4 mm and 3 × 10−4 mm radial distance to the RMNP, not effecting long-range dose. Conclusion: The dose distribution of the RMNP seed is comparable with current commercial brachytherapy seeds, while anisotropy of the dose distribution is reduced. Because this reduces the dependency of the dose distribution on the orientation of the seed, their surgical placement is easier. This supports the feasibility of the clinical application of the proposed novel treatment modality.</jats:p>"

However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell‐surface core‐fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core‐fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell‐surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on‐bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core‐fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core‐fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in‐depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.</jats:p>",

However, the physical and psychological differences among individuals and the high cost of data collection are the main challenges for further research on this problem. In this work, our aim is to build a model to detect subjects’ psychological stress in different states through electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Therefore, we design a VR high-altitude experiment to induce psychological stress for the subject to obtain the ECG signal dataset. In the experiment, participants wear smart ECG T-shirts with embedded sensors to complete different tasks so as to record their ECG signals synchronously. Considering the temporal continuity of individual psychological stress, a deep, gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is developed to capture the mapping relationship between subjects’ ECG signals and stress in different states through heart rate variability features at different moments, so as to build a neural network model from the ECG signal to psychological stress detection. The experimental results show that compared with all comparison methods, our method has the best classification performance on the four stress states of resting, VR scene adaptation, VR task and recovery, and it can be a remote stress monitoring solution for some special industries.</jats:p>"

However, transmission is still an issue due to transmission loss, especially in optical fibers. In this work, we proposed, designed, and fabricated micro spiral phase plates (SPPs) directly on an end facet of a piece of PbSe-doped ring-core fiber (RCF) through two-photon polymerization, realizing the integration of OAM beam generation, transmission, and amplification. The prepared RCF comprises a double-clad structure with a core-clad refractive index difference of 2.2% and the fluorescence range is 1150 nm–1700 nm. The intensity distribution of the OAM beam and the spiral interference fringes were obtained, which indicated that the OAM mode (|l|=1, 2, 3, 4) was generated and transmitted directly within the fiber. The small-signal amplification of four OAM modes was accomplished at 1550 nm under a pump power of 634 mW. The on–off gain is &gt;13.2 dB for all modes and the differential mode gain (DMG) is &lt;1.7 dB. The SPP-carrying RCF structure demonstrates the integration of generation, transmission, and amplification of higher-order OAM modes in all-fiber systems.</jats:p>"

Research examining contributing factors has tended to focus on poor infrastructure or lack of health care worker compliance with recommended guidelines, with limited consideration of the working environments within which IPC measures are implemented. Our analysis of compromised tuberculosis (TB)-related IPC in South Africa used clinic ethnography to elucidate the enabling environment for TB-IPC strategies. Using an ethnographic approach, we conducted observations, semi-structured interviews, and informal conversations with healthcare staff in six primary health clinics in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between November 2018 and April 2019. Qualitative data and fieldnotes were analysed deductively following a framework that examined the intersections between health systems ‘hardware’ and ‘software’ issues affecting the implementation of TB-IPC. Clinic managers and front-line staff negotiate and adapt TB-IPC practices within infrastructural, resource and organisational constraints. Staff were ambivalent about the usefulness of managerial oversight measures including IPC protocols, IPC committees and IPC champions. Challenges in implementing administrative measures including triaging and screening were related to the inefficient organisation of patient flow and information, as well as inconsistent policy directives. Integration of environmental controls was hindered by limitations in the material infrastructure and behavioural norms. Personal protective measures, though available, were not consistently applied due to limited perceived risk and the lack of a collective ethos around health worker and patient safety. In one clinic, positive organisational culture enhanced staff morale and adherence to IPC measures. ‘Hardware’ and ‘software’ constraints interact to impact negatively on the capacity of primary care staff to implement TB-IPC measures. Clinic ethnography allowed for multiple entry points to the ‘problematic’ of compromised TB-IPC, highlighting the importance of capturing dimensions of the ‘enabling environment’, currently not assessed in binary checklists.</jats:p>"

Thus, a novel method to extend the erosion resistance of the valve was innovatively proposed, namely, nanosecond laser ablation micro-pits on the substrate surface and high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying WC coating to extend the erosion resistance of the valve. The characterization and evaluation of the erosion resistance of the WC-sprayed coating after the pretreatment of the 3Cr13 substrate surface polishing/grit blasting/nanosecond laser ablation circular micro-dimple were conducted using the unit coupon erosion test of liquid–solid two-phase flow, followed by the test evaluation and analysis of the erosion resistance test of the WC coating after different pretreatments of the full-size valve core. Results showed that the micro-dimple pretreatment on the surface of the 3Cr13 substrate increased the contact area rate and bonding strength of the substrate and the WC coating. By taking erosion volume loss as the evaluation index, the erosion resistance of the micro-dimple pretreatment on the surface of the 3Cr13 substrate was increased by about 31.98% compared with that of the polishing pretreatment. Therefore, the new method of surface nanosecond laser texture pretreatment and HVOF-spraying WC coating can effectively improve the erosion resistance of the valve.</jats:p>"

The International Maritime Organization has strengthened regulations on sulfur, a notorious pollutant, to prevent sea pollution. In addition, the production of LNG fueled ships is increasing. Among various metals, 9% nickel steel is widely used in the shipbuilding industry because it is advantageous in terms of material strength and cryogenic impact toughness. Various studies are being carried out to predict and prevent its distortion, caused by welding, in the design. To predict welding distortion during flux core arc welding, this study found a way to refine the parameters constituting the Goldak welding heat source. The optimal heat source parameters were derived by using BOP experiments, cross-sectional analysis, finite element analysis and global optimization algorithm. When re-analyzed and verified based on the values, an error of up to 6.3% was found between simulation results and experimental values. The process was improved by clarifying the objective function and reducing the range of candidate welding efficiencies during global optimization and the process efficiency was also improved by reducing analysis time with a simplified model. Therefore, it is thought that this study can contribute to the productivity improvement of LNG storage containers, helping engineers apply it immediately in the industrial field.</jats:p>"

To identify the causal relationship between regional climate, sea-level trajectories, and environmental change and their potential impact on hominine habitats on the island, we investigated a high-resolution seismic profile together with sediment, stable isotope, geochemical, and biotic proxies retrieved from a marine sediment core (ASTC1). Our results show that the basin was once isolated, and a marine inundation occurred at around 7.3 ka BP, which is older than expected, based on global sea level reconstructions. The entire transition from isolation to full marine conditions was accomplished in three major phases: (1) non-marine isolated conditions between 9–7.3 ka BP, (2) semi-isolated hypersaline marsh and lagoonal conditions between 7.3 and 4.1 ka BP, and (3) semi-isolated shallow marine conditions of today (4.1 ka BP to present). High water alkalinity, elevated organic content, and heavier isotopic signals indicate relatively arid conditions in the region that favored Sr-rich carbonate precipitation within the 7.3–6 ka BP interval. On the other hand, freshwater biota, along with a high Corg/N ratio and lighter isotopic signal, showed wetter conditions, at least for the intervals 8–7.3 ka and 6–5.4 ka BP, in contrast to the aridification trend seen as 4.1 ka to present. Finally, the hominine habitat evolution at around 6 ka BP might be attributed to the wetter conditions and the freshwater source provided by the bay at that time.</jats:p>"

We evaluated differences in patient-reported symptomology between cancer patients with versus without HIV using data from 12,529 patients at the Moffitt Cancer Center, including 55 with HIV. The symptoms were assessed using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), which asks patients to rank 12 symptoms on a scale of 1–10, with scores ≥7 considered severe. The responses across all questions were summed to create a composite score. Vital status through t July 2021 was determined through linkage to the electronic health record. PWH reported a higher composite ESAS score on average (44.4) compared to HIV-uninfected cancer patients (30.7, p-value &lt; 0.01). In zero-inflated negative binomial regression models adjusted for cancer site, sex, and race, the composite ESAS scores and the count of severe symptoms were 1.41 times (95% CI: 1.13–1.77) and 1.45 times (95% CI: 1.09–1.93) higher, respectively, in cancer patients with HIV.

Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this work, a series of core–shell polymer composites is studied, and the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers) is investigated. It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers—a domain‐type polarization. The formation of a core–shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of tpolymer composites by essentially modifying the filler‐cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher‐than‐normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high‐<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core–shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core–shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.</jats:p>",

However, the high throughput and reproducible methods for nanopatterning of such films for advanced light-emitting applications are still missing. In this work, we show direct laser writing on thin films assembled from CdSe/CdZnS NPLs using either spin-coating or the self-assembly method for the purpose of fabricating. Using theoretical calculations, we design the period of the structures to achieve high quality-factor optical modes in the emission band of NPLs. In these nanostructured NPL films, fabricated according to the design, we observe photoluminescence enhancement and directional outcoupling effects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soliton-based supercontinuum generation is a powerful approach for generating light with the desired properties, although limited dispersion tuning capabilities remain a key challenge. Here, we introduce liquid-core fibers (LCFs) with longitudinally controlled dispersion of a higher-order mode, achieved by axial modulation of the liquid core diameter. This approach provides a versatile photonic platform with unique dispersion control capabilities that are particularly relevant to ultrafast, non-linear frequency conversion. Our tuning concept uses LCFs with anomalous dispersion at telecommunication wavelengths (TE01-mode) and relies on the strong dependence of dispersion on the core diameter. Non-monotonic, complex dispersion profiles feature multiple dispersive waves formation when launching ultrashort pulses. For example, this effect has been used to fill spectral gaps in fibers with linearly decreasing core diameter in order to spectrally smooth the output spectra. Our results highlight the potential of LCFs for controlling dispersion, particularly along the fiber axis, thus yielding novel dispersion landscapes that can reveal unexplored nonlinear dynamics and generate tailored broadband spectra.</jats:p>",

Problem-based learning (PBL) is expected to provide effective simulation scenarios and realistic clinical conditions to help students achieve those learning goals. This article aims to explore the effects of PBL strategies on nursing students’ self-evaluation of core competencies. This longitudinal cohort survey study evaluated 322 nursing students attending Chung Shan Medical University, Taiwan, in 2013 and 2014, where PBL teaching strategies are used in all four undergraduate years from freshman to senior. Based on their undergraduate academic levels, students were categorized into three groups- one-year PBL exposure, two-year PBL exposure, and three-year exposure. A core competency questionnaire was administered twice to ask participants to self-assess five professional competencies: learning attitude, problem identification, information analysis, execution, and life-long learning. The results showed that students with the longest exposure to PBL (Group 3) had higher self-evaluated scores for all core competencies than the other groups, except for the execution competency. The mean total competency score increased by 0.12 points between the pre-and-test. In addition, the mean score increased significantly more in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2. These trends were consistent for the information analysis, execution, and life-long learning competencies. In conclusion, the changes in the self-evaluated scores between groups indicate PBL strategies effectively improve nursing students’ core competencies. The longest exposure group reported higher self-evaluated core competency scores than the other groups, especially for the information analysis, execution, and life-long learning competencies.</jats:p>"

According to SEM and TEM images the HfO2, NPs are spherical, and their size is less than 10 nm, anchored on the surface of the graphene sheets. The EDX spectrum shows carbon, oxygen, and HfO2 and reveals the formation of the HfO2-graphene nanocomposite. The UV-vis absorption spectra show the optical properties of synthesized HfO2-graphene nanocomposite. The study examines the influence of different ratios of the addition of graphene on the photocatalytic activity of HfO2-graphene. It was found that the HfO2-graphene (50 wt%) 40 mg nanocomposite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity than the bare HfO2 towards the methylene blue photodegradation, an aromatic pollutant in water under UV light irradiation, which can be applied optimally for individually wastewater management system. The HfO2-graphene (50 wt%) photocatalyst degrades 81 ± 2% of tetracycline in 180 min, implying that tetracycline can be degraded more efficiently under UV light. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity under UV light illumination can be attributed to the effective separation of photogenerated electrons, inhibiting recombination in the HfO2-graphene composite.</jats:p>"

To address these limitations, this study aims to establish and characterize immortalized CSSC lines (imCSSC) generated from primary human CSSCs. Primary CSSCs (pCSSC), isolated from human adult corneoscleral tissue, were transduced with ectopic expression of hTERT, c-MYC, or the large T antigen of the Simian virus 40 (SV40T) to generate imCSSC. Cellular morphology, proliferation capacity, and expression of CSSCs specific surface markers were investigated in all cell lines, including TNFAIP6 gene expression levels in vitro, a known biomarker of in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy. SV40T-overexpressing imCSSC successfully extended the lifespan of pCSSC while retaining a similar morphology, proliferative capacity, multilineage differentiation potential, and anti-inflammatory properties. The current study serves as a proof-of-concept that immortalization of CSSCs could enable a large-scale source of CSSC for use in regenerative medicine.</jats:p>"

Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN.

To date, in 64 publications, 701 viruses have been described associated with indigenous species of Aotearoa New Zealand. Viruses were identified in indigenous birds (189 viruses), bats (13 viruses), starfish (4 viruses), insects (280 viruses), and plants (126 viruses). HTS gave rise to a 21.9-fold increase in virus discovery rate over the targeted methods, and 72.7-fold over symptom-based methods. The average number of viruses reported per publication has also increased proportionally over time. The use of HTS has driven the described national virome recently by 549 new-to-science viruses; all are indigenous. This report represents the first catalogue of viruses associated with indigenous species of a country.

Here, we demonstrate a combined technique to access power-sufficient optical microcombs, with a photonic-integrated soliton microcomb and home-developed erbium-doped gain fiber. The soliton microcomb is generated in an integrated Si3N4 microresonator chip, which serves as a full-wave probing signal for power amplification. After the amplification, more than 40 comb modes, with 115-GHz spacing, reach the onset power level of &gt;−10 dBm, which is readily available for parallel telecommunications , among other applications.</jats:p>"

Yet, pathways that repair double-strand breaks (DSBs) in animal mitochondria are poorly understood. By performing a candidate screen for mtDNA repair proteins, we identify that REC—an MCM helicase that drives meiotic recombination in the nucleus—also localizes to mitochondria in Drosophila. We show that REC repairs mtDNA DSBs by homologous recombination in somatic and germline tissues. Moreover, REC prevents age-associated mtDNA mutations. We further show that MCM8, the human ortholog of REC, also localizes to mitochondria and limits the accumulation of mtDNA mutations. This study provides mechanistic insight into animal mtDNA recombination and demonstrates its importance in safeguarding mtDNA during ageing and evolution.</jats:p>",

However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell‐surface core‐fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core‐fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell‐surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on‐bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core‐fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core‐fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in‐depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.</jats:p>",

In this work, 4A-Fe@Cu bimetallic Fenton catalysts with a three-dimensional core-shell structure were prepared by a simple, template-free, and surfactant-free methodology and used in the adsorption and degradation of Congo red (CR). The results showed that the open three-dimensional network structure and the positive charge of the surface of the 4A-Fe@Cu catalyst could endow a high adsorption capacity for CR, reaching 432.9 mg/g. The good adsorption property of 4A-Fe@Cu for CR not only did not inactivate the catalytic site on 4A-Fe@Cu but also could promote the contact between CR and the active sites on the catalyst surface and accelerate the degradation process. The 4A-Fe@Cu bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity than monometallic 4A@Cu and/or 4A-Fe catalysts due to low work function value. The effects of different pH, H2O2 dosages, and catalyst dosages on the catalytic performance of 4A-Fe@Cu were explored. In the conditions of 7.2 mM H2O2, 2 g/L 4A-Fe@Cu, and 1 g/L CR solution, the degradation ratio of CR by 4A-Fe@Cu could reach 99.2% at pH 8. This strategy provided guidance to the design of high-performance Fenton-like catalysts with both adsorption and catalysis properties for dye wastewater treatment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When the ambient temperature, in which a person is situated, fluctuates, the body’s surface temperature will alter proportionally. However, the body’s core temperature will remain relatively steady. Consequently, using body surface temperature to characterize the core body temperature of the human body in varied situations is still highly inaccurate. This research aims to investigate and establish the link between human body surface temperature and core body temperature in a variety of ambient conditions, as well as the associated conversion curves. Methods: Plan an experiment to measure temperature over a thousand times in order to get the corresponding data for human forehead, axillary, and oral temperatures at varying ambient temperatures (14–32 °C). Utilize the axillary and oral temperatures as the core body temperature standards or the control group to investigate the new approach’s accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for detecting fever/non-fever conditions and the forehead temperature as the experimental group. Analyze the statistical connection, data correlation, and agreement between the forehead temperature and the core body temperature. Results: A total of 1080 tests measuring body temperature were conducted on healthy adults. The average axillary temperature was (36.7 ± 0.41) °C, the average oral temperature was (36.7 ± 0.33) °C, and the average forehead temperature was (36.2 ± 0.30) °C as a result of the shift in ambient temperature. The forehead temperature was 0.5 °C lower than the average of the axillary and oral temperatures. The Pearson correlation coefficient between axillary and oral temperatures was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.28–0.52), between axillary and forehead temperatures was 0.07 (95% CI, −0.07–0.22), and between oral and forehead temperatures was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.11–0.39). The mean differences between the axillary temperature and the oral temperature, the oral temperature and the forehead temperature, and the axillary temperature and the forehead temperature were −0.08 °C, 0.49 °C, and 0.42 °C, respectively, according to a Bland-Altman analysis. Finally, the regression analysis revealed that there was a linear association between the axillary temperature and the forehead temperature, as well as the oral temperature and the forehead temperature due to the change in ambient temperature. Conclusion: The changes in ambient temperature have a substantial impact on the temperature of the forehead. There are significant differences between the forehead and axillary temperatures, as well as the forehead and oral temperatures, when the ambient temperature is low. As the ambient temperature rises, the forehead temperature tends to progressively converge with the axillary and oral temperatures. In clinical or daily applications, it is not advised to utilize the forehead temperature derived from an uncorrected infrared thermometer as the foundation for a body temperature screening in public venues such as hospital outpatient clinics, shopping malls, airports, and train stations.</jats:p>"

The approach is different from the previously published works and employs a convergent assembly of the tricyclic labdane‐type core from pre‐functionalized cyclic building blocks. Stereoselective Michael addition enabled the fragment coupling with excellent control over three newly created contiguous stereocenters, all‐carbon quaternary centers included. Silyl enol ether‐promoted ring‐opening metathesis paired with ring closure were the other key steps enabling concise assembly of the tricyclic core. Late‐stage functionalization sequences transformed the tricyclic intermediates into a set of different forskolin‐like molecules. The modular nature of the synthetic scheme described herein has the potential to become a general platform for the preparation of analogs of forskolin and other complex tricyclic labdanes.</jats:p>",

Herein, we report the spontaneous formation of highly dispersed Ni nanoclusters on HB sheets. The spontaneous reduction reaction of Ni ions by the HB sheets was monitored by in-situ measurements with an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. Acetonitrile solutions of Ni complexes and acetonitrile dispersions of the HB sheets were mixed in several molar ratios (the HB:Ni molar ratio was varied from 100:0.5 to 100:20), and the changes in the absorbance were measured over time. In all cases, the results suggest that Ni metal clusters grow on the HB sheets, considering the increase in absorbance with time. The absorbance peak position shifts to the higher wavelength as the Ni ion concentration increases. Transmission electron microscopy images of the post-reaction products indicate the formation of Ni nanoclusters, with sizes of a few nanometers, on the HB sheets, regardless of the preparation conditions. These highly dispersed Ni nanoclusters supported on HB sheets will be used for catalytic and plasmonic applications and as hydrogen storage materials.</jats:p>"

Both ADCs show a remarkable reduction in the inter-ELM particle and heat fluxes to the target compared to the standard divertor configuration. 95%–98% of the inter-ELM peak heat flux to the target is mitigated as a synergetic effect of ADCs, baffling, and nitrogen seeded detachment.

It is yet unknown which genes regulate Zn tolerance in rice. In the present study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for Zn tolerance in rice at the seedling stage within a rice core collection, named Ting’s core collection, which showed extensive phenotypic variations in Zn toxicity with high-density single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A total of 7 and 19 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected using root elongation (RE) and relative root elongation (RRE) under high Zn toxicity, respectively. Among them, 24 QTL were novel, and qRRE15 was located in the same region where 3 QTL were reported previously. In addition, qRE4 and qRRE9 were identical. Furthermore, we found eight candidate genes that are involved in abiotic and biotic stress, immunity, cell expansion, and phosphate transport in the loci of qRRE8, qRRE9, and qRRE15. Moreover, four candidate genes, i.e., Os01g0200700, Os06g0621900, Os06g0493600, and Os06g0622700, were verified correlating to Zn tolerance in rice by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Taken together, these results provide significant insight into the genetic basis for Zn toxicity tolerance and tolerant germplasm for developing rice tolerance to Zn toxicity and improving rice production in Zn-contaminated soils.</jats:p>"

Here, a mid-infrared hollow-core fiber (HCF) based flexible longitudinal photoacoustic resonator for PAS-based gas sensing is proposed and theoretically demonstrated. A mid-infrared anti-resonant HCF is designed to innovatively replace the traditional metallic acoustic resonator and obtain a flexible photoacoustic cell in PAS. Optical transmission characteristics of the HCF are analyzed and discussed, achieving single mode operation with below 1 dB/m confinement loss between 3 and 8 μm and covering strong absorptions of some hydrocarbons and carbon oxides. With varied bending radii from 10 mm to 200 mm, the optical mode could be maintained in the hollow core. Based on the photoacoustic effect, generated acoustic mode distributions in the HCF-based flexible photoacoustic resonator are analyzed and compared. Results show that the PAS-based sensor has a stable and converged acoustic profile at the resonant frequency of around 16,787 Hz and a favorable linear response to light source power and gas concentration. The proposed novel photoacoustic resonator using HCF presents bring potential for advanced flexible PAS-based gas detection.</jats:p>"

Here, EC‐reconstructed NiFe/NiFeOOH core/shell nanoparticles in highly conductive carbon matrix based on the pulsed laser deposition prepared NiFe nanoparticles is successfully confined. Electrochemical characterizations and first‐principles calculations demonstrate that the reconstructed NiFe/NiFeOOH core/shell nanoparticles exhibit high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity (a low overpotential of 342.2 mV for 10 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) and remarkable durability due to the efficient charge transfer in the highly conductive confined heterostructure.

Such OER improvement can be attributed to the Néel relaxation related magnetic heating effect functionalized superparamagnetic NiFe cores, which are generally underutilized in reconstructed core/shell nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the designed superparamagnetic core/shell nanoparticles, combined with the large improvement by magnetic heating effect, are expected to be highly efficient OER catalysts along with the confined structure guaranteed high conductivity and catalytic stability.</jats:p>",

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been recognized as a promising approach for the treatment of aMCI. Objective: In this paper, we aimed to investigate the modulating mechanism of tDCS on the core neurocognitive networks of brain. Methods: We used repeated anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and assessed the effect on cognition and dynamic functional brain network in aMCI patients. We used a novel method called temporal variability to depict the characteristics of the dynamic brain functional networks. Results: We found that true anodal stimulation significantly improved cognitive performance as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment after simulation. Meanwhile, the Mini-Mental State Examination scores showed a clear upward trend. More importantly, we found significantly altered temporal variability of dynamic functional connectivity of regions belonging to the default mode network, central executive network, and the salience network after true anodal stimulation, indicating anodal HD-tDCS may enhance brain function by modulating the temporal variability of the brain regions. Conclusion: These results imply that ten days of anodal repeated HD-tDCS over the LDLPFC exerts beneficial effects on the temporal variability of the functional architecture of the brain, which may be a potential neural mechanism by which HD-tDCS enhances brain functions. Repeated HD-tDCS may have clinical uses for the intervention of brain function decline in aMCI patients.</jats:p>",

The parameter matching was used to reasonably select relevant parameters so that the excavator’s boom energy-recovery and utilization system can improve operational efficiency and energy-saving efficiency under the premise of satisfying the normal working conditions of the working mechanism, and achieving the purpose of serializing VAPP products. A multi-objective optimization model was put forward according to energy-saving efficiency and operational efficiency. First, the accuracy of the acceleration method of the CVODE, a solver for stiff and non-stiff ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems, was verified by a physical prototype test. The results showed that the test and simulation results were in good agreement. A particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was used to optimize the main parameters of the boom energy-recovery system to obtain the appropriate energy-saving efficiency and obtain the VAPP displacement and related component parameters required by the energy-recovery system of excavator booms of different tonnages. The simulation results showed that a motor working condition was necessary in the guaranteed descending stage, and the process of lifting–descending–lifting was completed under the condition that the total time did not exceed a certain value. The energy-saving rates of the 7-ton (7T), 12-ton (12T), 20-ton (20T), and 30-ton (30T) excavator boom energy-recovery systems reached 29.8%, 35.3%, 31.25%, and 27.88%, respectively. In the eight-core CPU workstation under the simulation conditions, compared with the Simulation X platform simulation method, the simulation efficiency of the multi-core CPU parallel method was improved by more than 80 times.</jats:p>"

The unsteady drag, unsteady lift, and particle behavior are investigated for different densities and particle configurations. The time evolution of the unsteady drag and lift is changed by interference by the planar shock wave, Mach stem convergence, and the shock wave reflected from the other particle. These two particles become closer after the shock wave passes than in the initial state under most conditions. Two particles placed in an in-line arrangement approach each other very closely due to the passage of a shock wave. On the other hand, two particles placed in a side-by-side arrangement are only slightly closer to each other after the shock wave passes between them. The pressure waves resulting from Mach stem convergence of the upstream particle and the reflected shock waves from the downstream particle are the main factors responsible for the force in the direction that pushes the particles apart. The wide distance between the two particles attenuates these pressure waves, and the particles reduce their motion away from each other.</jats:p>",

Music performance requires skillful integration of multimodal sensory information for the production of dexterous movements. However, it has not been understood what roles somatosensory afferent information plays in the acquisition and sophistication of specialized motor skills of musicians across different stages of development. In the present preliminary study, we addressed this issue by using a novel technique with a hand exoskeleton robot that can externally move the fingers of pianists. Short‐term exposure to fast and complex finger movements generated by the exoskeleton (i.e., passive movements) increased the maximum rate of repetitive piano keystrokes by the pianists. This indicates that somatosensory inputs derived from the externally generated motions enhanced the quickness of the sequential finger movements in piano performance, even though the pianists did not voluntarily move the fingers. The enhancement of motor skill through passive somatosensory training using the exoskeleton was more pronounced in adolescent pianists than adult pianists. These preliminary results implicate a sensitive period of neuroplasticity of the somatosensory‐motor system of trained pianists, which emphasizes the importance of somatosensory‐motor training in professional music education during adolescence.</jats:p>",

Differentially expressed genes and miRNAs between AD patients and healthy controls were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The mRNA‐miRNA network was constructed and key genes involved in AD were screened out by protein–protein interaction analysis, and were subsequently verified by independent datasets and qPCR in an AD mouse model. Our findings showed that six hub genes including CALN1, TRPM7, ATR, SOCS3, MOB3A and OGDH were believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Western blot analysis further determined that CALN1, ATR and OGDH were the possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. In addition, 6 possible miRNAs biomarkers have also been verified by qPCR on AD animal models. Our findings may benefit clinical diagnosis and early prevention of AD.</jats:p>",

The action-values constructed from the experience (retrospective value) and the ones from the knowledge (prospective value) were identified in various regions of the brain. However, how and which neural circuit integrates these values and executes the chosen action remains unknown. Combining reinforcement learning and two-photon calcium imaging, we found that the preparatory activity of neurons in a part of the frontal cortex, the anterior-lateral motor (ALM) area, initially encodes retrospective value, but after extensive training, they jointly encode the retrospective and prospective value. Optogenetic inhibition of ALM preparatory activity specifically abolished the expert mice’s predictive choice behavior and returned them to the novice-like state. Thus, the integrated action-value encoded in the preparatory activity of ALM plays an important role to bias the action toward the knowledge-dependent, predictive choice behavior.</jats:p>",

This method allows a simple and versatile preparation of PDA@mesoporous silica (MS) nanospheres exhibiting tunable yolk@shell architectures and shell pore sizes. Through reaction temperature‐regulated swelling degree and confined shrinkage of PDA nanospheres, the volume ratio of the hollow cavity that the PDA core occupies can easily be tuned from ca. 2/3 to ca. 1/2, then to ca. 2/5, finally to ca. 1/3.

Four VO2 polymorphs have been detected by electron diffraction and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis, with M1 being by far the most abundant phase. Post-experimental strain measurements in HRTEM images have revealed that the actual residual strain is minimized due to the columnar morphology of the VO2 grains, as well as intrinsic oxide layers in the VO2/Si epitaxy. The TEM outcomes confirmed the complementary electrical and magnetic measurements in the films, where a transition from a monoclinic M1 to a rutile VO2 R phase has been identified, influenced by the initial percentage of phases in thick VO2 films.</jats:p>"

Among the various nanoparticles, the unique optical property derived from the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of metallic nanoparticles is a primary reason that metallic nanoparticles are researched and applied. Copper and Iron nanoparticles have the potential to generate hydroxyl radicals in excess H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> via Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. On the other hand, gold nanoparticles equipped with a photosensitizer can transfer the energy of photons to chemical energy and enhance the production of singlet oxygen, which is suitable for cancer treatment. With the actions of these two reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, cell apoptosis can further be induced. In this work, we first synthesized dual metal nanoparticles with poly[styrene-alt-(maleic acid, sodium salt)(Cu ferrite oxide-polymer) by a simple one-step hydrothermal reduction reaction. Then, gold(III) was reduced and doped into the structure, which formed a triple metal structure, Au-doped Cu ferrite nanoparticles (Au/Cu ferrite oxide-polymer NPs). The metal ratio of the product could be controlled by manipulating the Fe/Cu ratio of reactants and the sequence of addition of reactants. The core–shell structure was verified by transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, the hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen generation ability of Au/Cu ferrite oxide-polymer was proved. The chemodynamic and photodynamic effect was measured, and the in vitro ROS generation was observed. Furthermore, the behavior of endocytosis by cancer cells could be controlled by the magnetic field. The result indicated that Au/Cu ferrite oxide-polymer core–shell nanoreactor is a potential agent for chemodynamic/photodynamic synergetic therapy.</jats:p>"

Despite this, there is only one licensed vaccine available to prevent infection and safety concerns limit immunization to only a subset of individuals. Most dengue virus vaccine efforts attempt to evoke broadly neutralizing antibodies against structural proteins. However, eliciting antibodies to block the activity of viral proteins involved in pathogenesis could be a useful complementary approach. Studies suggest that non-structural protein 1, which participates in disruption of the endothelial barrier and is hypothesized to play a significant role in the progression to severe dengue, could be a promising target for vaccine efforts. Here, we used an unbiased approach to identify peptide epitopes of dengue virus non-structural protein 1 that could evoke antibodies that bind to NS1 from all 4 serotypes and also bind to DENV-infected cells. DENV-2 NS1 peptides were generated such that 35 overlapping 15 amino acid peptides represented the entire NS1 protein. These peptides were each chemically conjugated to bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLP) and used to immunize mice. Sera were then screened for IgG to cognate peptide as well as binding to recombinant hexameric NS1 from all four DENV serotypes as well as binding to DENV-2 infected cells by microscopy. From these data, we identified several peptides that were able to elicit antibodies that could bind to infected cells as well as DENV NS1. These peptides and their homologues in the corresponding NS1 of other DENV serotypes could be used as potential immunogens to elicit binding antibodies to NS1. Future studies will investigate the functional and protective capacities of antibodies elicited by these immunogens against DENV NS1.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the little variation in defect points, tile block defect detection typically detects subtle defects in large-format images, allowing defective characteristics to be displayed regionally. Traditional convolutional neural network architectures that extract regional features take into account the connection between regional features simply, resulting in the presence of region-specific bias, which makes tile block defect detection still a challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper divides feature information into patches that can represent different regional features. Additionally, the relationship between different patches and tile block defects is studied; as a result, this paper proposes a new attention mechanism called the Cross Patch Attention Module (CPAM). Since the regional performance of patches is consistent with the tile block defect characteristics, CPAM can distinguish various regional features by patches. Then, in order to create reliable one-dimensional patch information, CPAM provides a method to connect patches linearly in two spatial directions. This takes into account the correlation of adjacent patches in various spatial directions. Finally, by extracting the regional characteristics of patches, CPAM can successfully assist the model in distinguishing the importance of different patches. The experimental results demonstrate that CPAM has excellent performance for tile block defect detection, and plugging CPAM into different end-to-end models can have a good gain effect, which can effectively and stably help the model to complete the task of tile block defect detection.</jats:p>"

Prevotella, Bacteroides, Collinsella, Blautia, and Megasphaera were the most abundant, and Bacteroides, Blautia, Lachnoclostridium, Sutterella, and Ruminococcus gnavus were the most prevalent. While community composition remained relatively stable across different age classes, the number of core taxa present decreased significantly with age. Fecal microbiome composition varied with host diet type. Cats fed kibble had a slightly, but significantly greater number of core taxa compared to cats not fed any kibble. The core microbiomes of cats fed some raw food contained taxa not as highly prevalent or abundant as cats fed diets that included kibble. Living environment also had a large effect on fecal microbiome composition. Cats living in homes differed significantly from those in shelters and had a greater portion of their microbiomes represented by core taxa. Collectively our work reinforces the findings that age, diet, and living environment are important factors to consider when defining a core microbiome in a population.</jats:p>"

The technique is based on the flocking and collective navigation behavior observed in natural swarms, such as cattle herds, bird flocks, and even large groups of humans. As global and concurrent information of all swarm members is not available in natural swarms, these systems use local observations to achieve the desired behavior. Similarly, PACNav relies only on local observations of the relative positions of UAVs, making it suitable for large swarms deprived of communication capabilities and external localization systems. We introduce the novel concepts of <jats:bold>path persistence</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>path similarity</jats:bold> that allow each swarm member to analyze the motion of other members in order to determine its own future motion. PACNav is based on two main principles: (a) UAVs with little variation in motion direction have high <jats:bold>path persistence</jats:bold>, and are considered by other UAVs to be reliable leaders; (b) groups of UAVs that move in a similar direction have high <jats:bold>path similarity</jats:bold>, and such groups are assumed to contain a reliable leader. The proposed approach also embeds a reactive collision avoidance mechanism to avoid collisions with swarm members and environmental obstacles. This collision avoidance ensures safety while reducing deviations from the assigned path. Along with several simulated experiments, we present a real-world experiment in a natural forest, showcasing the validity and effectiveness of the proposed collective navigation approach in challenging environments. The source code is released as open-source, making it possible to replicate the obtained results and facilitate the continuation of research by the community.</jats:p>",

In experiments on the QC mode, two sets of moveable Langmuir probes (LPs) were used to measure the local parameters including floating potential, electron temperature, electron density, and so on, as well as their profiles. To monitor the magnetohydrodynamic activities, a Mirnov probe was used to measure the poloidal magnetic fluctuation. The QC mode can be seen in the spectra of floating potential, but there is no similar peak in the spectra of magnetic fluctuation. Thus, the QC mode is probably electrostatic. By analyzing the electrostatic potential fluctuations from the LPs, the features of the QC mode including frequency, wavenumber, propagation direction, and dependence on collisionality are identified, which are consistent with the characteristics of dissipative trapped electron mode.</jats:p>",

Herein, a new strategy for in situ site‐selective Ag‐doping exclusively at the central core of AuNCs using sulphated colloidal surfaces as the templates is presented. This approach exceedingly improves the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of AuNCs by eliminating nonradiative losses in the multi‐step relaxation cascade populating the emissive state. Density functional theory predicts the mechanism of specific doping at the central core, endorsing the preferential bonding between Ag<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions and sulphates in water.

This study develops an ensemble Kalman filter\n(EnKF)-based regional ocean data assimilation system in which the local\nensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is implemented with version 1.0 of the Stony Brook\nParallel Ocean Model (sbPOM) to assimilate satellite and in situ\nobservations at a daily frequency. A series of sensitivity experiments are\nperformed with various settings of the incremental analysis update (IAU) and\ncovariance inflation methods, for which the relaxation-to-prior\nperturbations and spread (RTPP and RTPS, respectively) and multiplicative\ninflation (MULT) are considered. We evaluate the geostrophic balance and the\nanalysis accuracy compared with the control experiment in which the IAU and\ncovariance inflation are not applied. The results show that the IAU improves\nthe geostrophic balance, degrades the accuracy, and reduces the ensemble\nspread, and that the RTPP and RTPS have the opposite effect. The experiment\nusing a combination of the IAU and RTPP results in a significant improvement for both balance and analysis accuracy when the RTPP parameter is 0.8–0.9.\nThe combination of the IAU and RTPS improves the balance when the RTPS\nparameter is ≤0.8 and increases the analysis accuracy for parameter\nvalues between 1.0 and 1.1, but the balance and analysis accuracy are not\nimproved significantly at the same time. The experiments with MULT inflating the\nforecast ensemble spread by 5 % do not demonstrate sufficient skill in\nmaintaining the balance and reproducing the surface flow field regardless of\nwhether the IAU is applied or not. The 11 d ensemble forecast experiments\nshow consistent results.

In this study, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium with different flagellar phenotypes mainly characterized during host-pathogen interaction were analyzed for their transport and deposition behavior in porous media. Column transport experiments and a modified mobile-immobile model were applicated on different strains with flagellar motility (wild-type) or without motility (ΔmotAB), without flagella (ΔflgKL), methylated and unmethylated flagellin (ΔfliB), and different flagella phases (fliCON, fljBON). Results showed that flagella motility could promote bacterial transport and deposition due to their biological advantages of moving and attaching to surfaces. We also found that the presence of non-motile flagella improved bacterial adhesion according to a higher retention rate of the ΔmotAB strain compared to the ΔflgKL strain. This indicated that bacteria flagella and motility both had promoting effects on bacterial deposition in sandy porous media. Flagella phases influenced the bacterial movement; the fliCON strain went faster through the column than the fljBON strain. Moreover, flagella methylation was found to favor bacterial transport and deposition. Overall, flagellar modifications affect Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium transport and deposition behavior in different ways in environmental conditions.</jats:p>"

A long-term trapping and fruit collection study was conducted (2011–2016) in two contrasting agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Cameroon to determine fruit fly species composition, seasonality, attraction to various lures and baits, and fruit infestation levels. Ten tephritid species from genera Bactrocera, Ceratitis, Dacus, and Perilampsis were captured in traps. Bactrocera dorsalis was the most dominant of the trapped species and persisted throughout the year, with peak populations in May–June. Ceratitis spp. were less abundant than B. dorsalis, with Ceratitis anonae dominating in the western highland zone and Ceratitis cosyra in the humid forest zone. Methyl eugenol and terpinyl acetate captured more B. dorsalis and Ceratitis spp., respectively than Torula yeast. The latter was the most effective food bait on all tephritid species compared with BioLure and Mazoferm. Bactrocera dorsalis was the dominant species emerging from incubated fruits, particularly mango, guava, and wild mango. Four plant species—I. wombolu, Dacryodes edulis, Voacanga Africana and Trichoscypha abut—were new host records for B. dorsalis.

Thus far, platinum (Pt) based catalysts are nearly inevitable due to the harsh redox environment of fuel cells. Thus, minimizing Pt metal loading and increasing Pt utilization is a paramount factor for realizing fuel cell technologies. In this context, herein, we developed a multi-metallic nanocatalyst (NC) comprising Pt-clusters (1 wt.%) decorated SnPd composite shell over cobalt-oxide core crystal underneath (denoted as CSPP). For optimizing the ORR performance of the as-prepared NC, we further modulated the configuration of the SnPd shell. In the optimum case, when the Sn/Pd ratio is 0.5 (denoted as CSPP 1005), the ORR mass activity (MA) is 3034.7 mA mgPt−1 at 0.85 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, which is 45-times higher than the commercial Johnson Matthey-Pt/C (J.M.-Pt/C; 20 wt.% Pt) catalyst (67 mA mgPt−1). The results of physical inspections along with electrochemical analysis suggest that such high performance of CSPP 1005 NC can be attributed to the synergistic collaboration between Pt-clusters, PtPd nanoalloys, and adjacent SnPd domains, where Pt-clusters and PtPd nanoalloys promote the O2 adsorption and subsequent splitting, while the SnPd shell favours the OH− relocation step. We believe that the obtained results will open a new avenue for further exploring the high-performance Pt-based catalysts with low Pt-loading and high utilization.</jats:p>"

Methods  For this, four schools were sampled through consultation with researchers after receiving recommendations from the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education for excellent schools in operating the class musical project. First, a preliminary survey was conducted from August 26 (Mon) to August 30 (Fri), 2019, before the 2nd semester collaboration class musical project was implemented, and November 28 (Thurs) after the class musical project was implemented. A post-mortem investigation was conducted on December 20 (Fri). Next, an expert council was held on December 6, 2019 for teachers in charge of operation. For opinion survey questions, pre- and post-reliability tests were performed with Cronbach α, and statistical analysis was performed for the processing of opinion survey results using SPSS Statistics 22.0 program. Results  First, it can be judged that the educational effect has been achieved as a high percentage of respondents answered that their artistic sensibility and creativity were increased through the Hyeopjong's class musical project, and that school life was enjoyable as a result. Second, it was confirmed that meaningful contributions were made in ‘communication competence’ and ‘community competence’, which are future-oriented personality competencies. Third, in spite of the positive purpose of Hyeopjong's class musical project, it was confirmed that the work load was increased from the point of view of the teacher in charge, and supplementation was necessary for this. Conclusions  First, there is a need for a systematic and comprehensive arts education project to revitalize arts and culture education linked to the curriculum and convergence education between subjects. Second, it is necessary to secure sufficient number of hours and budget for the effective and efficient operation of the curriculum. Through this, it is necessary to make continuous efforts to expand the scope of art education in public education by making good use of the characteristics of the class musical project in collaboration and to revive interest in education in the art field.</jats:p>",

However, few efforts have been devoted to exploring bimetal‐polydopamine composites, especially for multistructural composites with high‐capacity components and high stability. In this regard, the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@C‐WSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> core–shell nanospheres are designed and fabricated based on Ti‐W‐polydopamine composites after selenization, in which the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanoparticles are encapsulated or embedded in the carbon nanospheres and the external WSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanosheets are grown epitaxially on the carbon surfaces, featuring multiple channels for ion diffusion and abundant active edges for electrochemical reactions. The introduction of WSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> not only greatly improves the capacity but also results in exponential growth of the active edge. As a result, the as‐prepared TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>@C‐WSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> displayed long‐term cycling performance in lithium‐ion batteries. Furthermore, the anode is assembled into sodium‐ion batteries, manifesting a stable capacity of 352 mA h g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 1.0 A g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> even after 2000 cycles, one of the best performances for polydopamine‐based composites. Enhanced performance can be attributed to the synergies of high‐capacity components and different dimensional materials. This work highlights that the rational design of functional structures provides a novel inspiration for electrodes with effective nanoarchitectures.</jats:p>",

The entire NW heterostructure behaves as a p-type semiconductor, which demonstrates that the high-density carriers are confined within the 4 nm-thick Si shell and form a tubular conduction channel. These findings are confirmed by both calculations and the gate-dependent current–voltage (Id–Vg) characteristics. Atomic resolution microscopic analyses suggest a coherent epitaxial core/shell interface where strain is released by forming dislocations along the axial direction of the NW heterostructure. Additional surface passivation achieved via growing a SiGe(P)/Si/SiGe core/multishell NW heterostructure suggests potential strategies to enhance the tubular carrier density, which could be further modified by improving multishell crystallinity and structural design.</jats:p>",

We previously created ligand-specific inhibitors of Notch signaling comprised of Fc fusions to specific EGF-like repeats of the Notch1 extracellular domain, called Notch decoys, which bound ligands, blocked Notch signaling, and showed anti-tumor activity with low toxicity. However, the study of their function depended on virally mediated expression, which precluded dosage control and limited clinical applicability. We have refined the decoy design to create peptibody-based Notch inhibitors comprising the core binding domains, EGF-like repeats 10–14, of either Notch1 or Notch4. These Notch peptibodies showed high secretion properties and production yields that were improved by nearly 100-fold compared to previous Notch decoys. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy coupled with co-immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that Notch1 and Notch4 peptibodies demonstrate strong but distinct binding properties to Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1. Both Notch1 and Notch4 peptibodies interfere with Notch signaling in endothelial cells and reduce expression of canonical Notch targets after treatment. While prior DLL4 inhibitors cause hyper-sprouting, the Notch1 peptibody reduced angiogenesis in a 3-dimensional in vitro sprouting assay. Administration of Notch1 peptibodies to neonate mice resulted in reduced radial outgrowth of retinal vasculature, confirming anti-angiogenic properties. We conclude that purified Notch peptibodies comprising EGF-like repeats 10–14 bind to both DLL4 and JAG1 ligands and exhibit anti-angiogenic properties. Based on their secretion profile, unique Notch inhibitory activities, and anti-angiogenic properties, Notch peptibodies present new opportunities for therapeutic Notch inhibition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Toward macroscopic applications of graphene, it is desirable to preserve the superior properties of single-layer graphene in bulk scale. However, the AB-stacking structure is thermodynamically favored for multilayer graphene and causes strong interlayer interactions, resulting in property degradation. A promising approach to prevent the strong interlayer interaction is the staking order reduction of graphene, where the graphene layers are rotated in-plane to form a randomly stacking structure. In this study, we propose a strategy to effectively decrease the stacking order of multilayer graphene by incorporating nanospacers, cellulose nanofibers, or nano-diamonds (NDs) in the formation process of porous graphene sponges. We conducted an ultrahigh temperature treatment at 1500 °C with ethanol vapor for the reduction and structural repair of graphene oxide sponges with different concentrations of the nanospacers. Raman spectroscopy indicated an obvious increase in the random-stacking fraction of graphene by adding the nanospacers. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that a small amount of the nanospacers induced a remarkable decrease in ordered graphene crystalline size in the stacking direction. It was also confirmed that a layer-number increase during the thermal treatment was suppressed by the nanospacers. The increase in the random-stacking fraction is attributed to the efficient formation of randomly rotated graphene through the ethanol-mediated structural restoration of relatively thin layers induced by the nanospacers. This stacking-order-reduced graphene with bulk scale is expected to be used in macroscopic applications, such as electrode materials and wearable devices.</jats:p>",

The fascinating inhibited infrared radiation transmission performance (infrared transmittance ~67% at 3 μm) and excellent thermal insulation effect (thermal conductivity of 0.019 Wm−1K−1 at room temperature) and maximum compressive strengths (3.22 kPa) of silica nanofibrous aerogel with TiO2 opacifier were verified. Excellent thermal insulation, compression and thermal stability properties show its potential for practical application in industrial production.

The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of several factors on the initial microbial load (IML) of game carcasses during the early hunting chain. Eviscerated roe deer body cavities (n = 24) were investigated in terms of total viable count and the levels of Pseudomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, a risk analysis based on the obtained original IML data, literature search and a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was performed. The IML could be explained in a regression model by factors including the higher body weight (BW), damaged gastrointestinal tract by the shot, ambient temperature or rain. The levels of Lactobacillus spp. (p = 0.0472), Enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.0070) and E. coli (p = 0.0015) were lower on the belly flap surface when gloves were used during evisceration. The literature search revealed that studies examining influencing factors (IF) on the IML of game carcasses found contradictory effects of the comparable IF on IML. Potential handling failures may lead to a higher IML of game carcasses during the early hunting chain ranked by FMEA. Several handling practices for game carcasses are recommended, such as ensuring efficient cooling of heavier BW carcasses to limit bacterial growth or eviscerating heavier carcasses before lighter ones.</jats:p>"

During glucose depletion, yeast cells release autotoxins, such as leucic acid and L-2keto-3methylvalerate, which can even kill the clonal cells of the ones producing them. Although these autotoxins were likely to induce mass suicide, some cells differentiated to adapt to the autotoxins without genetic changes. If nondifferentiated latecomers tried to invade the habitat, autotoxins damaged or killed the latecomers, but the differentiated cells could selectively survive. Phylogenetically distant fission and budding yeast shared this behavior using the same autotoxins, suggesting that latecomer killing may be the universal system of intercellular communication, which may be relevant to the evolutional transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms.</jats:p>"

In this study, we used ‘TraDIS-Xpress’ (Transposon Directed Insertion site Sequencing with expression), where a high-density transposon mutant library including outward facing promoters in Escherichia coli BW25113 identified genes involved in colistin susceptibility. We examined the genome-wide response of E. coli following exposure to a range of concentrations of colistin. Our TraDIS-Xpress screen confirmed the importance of overexpression of the two-component system basSR (which regulates pETn transferases) but also identified a wider range of genes important for survival in the presence of colistin, including genes encoding membrane associated proteins, DNA repair machinery, various transporters, RNA helicases, general stress response genes, fimbriae and phosphonate metabolism. Validation experiments supported a role in colistin susceptibility for novel candidate genes tested.

However, nearly all patients develop drug-resistant disease, with a median progression-free survival of less than 2 years in chemotherapy-naïve men. Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a central metabolic signaling molecule with key roles in biosynthetic processes and cancer signaling. In signaling, acetyl-CoA serves as the acetyl donor for acetylation, a critical post-translational modification. Acetylation affects the androgen receptor (AR) both directly and indirectly increasing expression of AR dependent genes. Our studies reveal that PC cells respond to the treatment with ARSI by increasing expression of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a major enzyme responsible for cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis, and up-regulation of acetyl-CoA intracellular levels. Inhibition of ACLY results in a significant suppression of ligand-dependent and -independent routes of AR activation. Accordingly, the addition of exogenous acetyl-CoA, or its precursor acetate, augments AR transcriptional activity and diminishes the anti-AR activity of ARSI. Taken together, our findings suggest that PC cells respond to antiandrogens by increasing activity of the acetyl-coA pathway in order to reinstate AR signaling.</jats:p>"

Dysregulated metabolism in GBM offers an opportunity to deploy metabolic interventions as precise therapeutic strategies. To identify the molecular drivers and the modalities by which different molecular subgroups of GBM exploit metabolic rewiring to sustain tumor progression, we interrogated the transcriptome, the metabolome, and the glycoproteome of human subgroup-specific GBM sphere-forming cells (GSC). L-fucose abundance and core fucosylation activation were elevated in mesenchymal (MES) compared with proneural GSCs; this pattern was retained in subgroup-specific xenografts and in subgroup-affiliated human patient samples. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of core fucosylation significantly reduced tumor growth in MES GBM preclinical models. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)–based glycoproteomic screening indicated that most MES-restricted core-fucosylated proteins are involved in therapeutically relevant GBM pathological processes, such as extracellular matrix interaction, cell adhesion, and integrin-mediated signaling. Selective L-fucose accumulation in MES GBMs was observed using preclinical minimally invasive PET, implicating this metabolite as a potential subgroup-restricted biomarker.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Overall, these findings indicate that L-fucose pathway activation in MES GBM is a subgroup-specific dependency that could provide diagnostic markers and actionable therapeutic targets.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Metabolic characterization of subgroup-specific glioblastoma (GBM) sphere-forming cells identifies the L-fucose pathway as a vulnerability restricted to mesenchymal GBM, disclosing a potential precision medicine strategy for targeting cancer metabolism.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

In order to promote the sustainable development of the construction industry, using rice husk ash (RHA) in recycled aggregate concrete has aroused extensive interest. This study aims to investigate the impact of the partial replacement (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% of binder) of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with RHA by equal mass on recycled concrete’s mechanical characteristics and freeze–thaw resistance. The workability, compressive strength, mass loss and dynamic elastic modulus of recycled concrete were tested, and the hydration products and microstructure were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests. The mechanism of the freeze–thaw damage deterioration of RHA recycled aggregate concrete was revealed. The results indicate that the incorporation of RHA has an adverse effect on the workability of fresh concrete. Its high specific surface area will provide a large number of nucleation sites for the hydration reaction, refining the pore structure in the paste and improving the weak bonding of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) by enhancing the matrix’s pozzolanic reaction effect and filling effect, thus improving the compressive strength of concrete. Furthermore, the porous structure of the recycled aggregate attached mortar and mesoporous RHA will absorb a lot of water during the freeze–thaw cycles. With the continuous accumulation of expansion pressure, the interior pores and cracks will gradually expand and extend, leading to more severe damage to the concrete, and the degree of freeze–thaw damage deterioration grows as the RHA replacement ratios increase.</jats:p>"

However, they are currently located within the boundaries of the historical area of a big city. Postindustrial objects that have lost their initial function create opportunities for city development. An urgent problem of urban planning in Lviv is to determine the prospects for the development and reconstruction of industrial areas, complexes, and buildings. The purpose of the work is to identify the modern urban trends in the development process of postindustrial areas located in the historic area of Lviv, as well as its compliance with the city development strategy. The article investigates the connection of new objects with the main functions of the district, provides a historical excursion of their development, on-site studies, and a comparative analysis of objects with the goals of the master plan of Lviv and of the integrated concept of development of the central part of the city. The studied objects of the urban revitalization of postindustrial buildings and areas are grouped according to new dominant function: 1—Development of the creative industry; 2—Revalued multifunctional areas; 3—Implementation of the concept of city center expansion; 4—Reconstruction of historical localities, and 5—Creation of new residential complexes. The authors consider the process of re-urbanization in some particular postindustrial areas and objects as a search for ideas to generalize their use for the whole city. The intensive industrial development of the city during the Soviet period led to strict regulation of other areas. After obtaining independence, there is an opportunity to fix the imbalance. This process occurs in different ways. In particular, the “in situ” review provides an opportunity to understand the development of the territory—whether it follows the master plan (or contradicts it), whether it meets the new development strategy of the city, whether it meets the needs of the local community, or meets the interests of developers only.</jats:p>"

DNDAP was prepared with N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA), N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), Diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMDAAC), 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropaneonic acid (AMPS), and isopentenol polyether (TPEG) as raw materials.

The thermal stability of DNDAP was evaluated by the use of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). WBDF with DNDAP was analyzed for zeta potential and particle size and the corresponding filter cake underwent energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The results showed that the thermal decomposition of DNDAP mainly occurred above 303 °C. DNDAP exhibits excellent rheological and filtration properties in water-based drilling fluids, even under high-temperature aging (up to 200 °C) and high salinity (20 wt% NaCl or 5 wt% CaCl2) environments. The strong adsorption effect of DNDAP makes the particle size of bentonite reasonably distributed to form a dense mud cake that reduces filtration losses.</jats:p>"

The biggest factor improving survival is early detection, but the current understanding of early transformation events is limited. Therefore, we set up a model to study these early events and investigated the relationship of premalignant, senescent hepatocytes, a regenerative environment, and the influence of secreted factors on liver tumorigenesis. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) was triggered in a subset of mouse hepatocytes, which under normal conditions, are eliminated by immunosurveillance. Inducing liver damage and regeneration was sufficient to trigger immunosurveillance escape of OIS hepatocytes, resulting in premalignant to malignant transformation and hepatocellular tumor development. Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) was found to be overexpressed in OIS hepatocytes and in hepatocellular carcinoma. TFF3 deficiency strongly attenuated malignant transformation by increasing insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) expression, which consequently dampened IGF receptor signaling. Furthermore, analysis of precancerous liver tissue validated TFF3 as an early liver cancer biomarker. Altogether, these findings provide mechanistic insights into early transformation and immunosurveillance escape in liver cancer, revealing TFF3 and IGFBP5 to be important players with opposite roles in tumorigenesis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Liver damage induces a compensatory regenerative response that can drive premalignant to malignant transformation of senescent hepatocytes.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

In pre-leukemia, this results in ETV6-RUNX1 antagonization of cell cycle regulation by RUNX1 as evidenced by mass cytometry analysis of B-lineage cells derived from ETV6-RUNX1 knock-in human pluripotent stem cells. In frank leukemia, knockdown of RUNX1 or its co-factor CBFβ results in cell death suggesting sustained requirement for RUNX1 activity which is recapitulated by chemical perturbation using an allosteric CBFβ-inhibitor. Strikingly, we show that RUNX1 addiction extends to other genetic subtypes of pediatric B-ALL and also adult disease. Importantly, inhibition of RUNX1 activity spares normal hematopoiesis.

AOM/DSS treatment results in the significant activation of NSPs, leading to CAC through increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased anti-inflammatory and antitumor IGFBP-3. Collectively, these data suggest that the NSPs proteolyze IGFBP-3, whereas AAT inhibits chronic colonic inflammation-induced NSP activity and subsequently suppresses IGFBP-3 proteolysis. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory and antitumor functions of the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis are restored. AAT mimicking small peptides also showed their inhibitory effects on NSP-induced IGFBP-3 proteolysis. These results suggest that targeting the NSP-IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis using NSP inhibitors such as AAT and the AAT mimics and IGFBP-3R agonists could lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of CAC.</jats:p>"

Assessing CTC levels in patients can aid in the early detection of cancer metastasis and is essential for the purposes of accurate cancer prognosis. However, current in vitro blood tests are limited by the insufficient blood samples and low concentration levels of CTCs, which presents a major challenge for practical biosensing devices. In this work, we propose the first surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fiber probe to work intravenously, which offers a real-time detection of CTCs in bloodstreams. By exposing the protein-functionalized fiber probe to circulating blood, a continuous capture of CTCs ensures a constant increase in enrichment and hence greatly enhances enumeration accuracy. The performance of our plasmonic fiber probe was demonstrated to specifically detect Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells in flowing whole mouse blood. Further, a detection limit of ~1.4 cells per microliter was achieved by using an epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody-based receptor layer and a 15 min enrichment period. This pilot study validates real-time CTC detection directly in the bloodstream by using plasmonic fiber probes, which exhibit promising clinical potential for in vivo diagnostic tests involving low concentration biomarkers in circulating blood.</jats:p>"

We created a 3D-casted mold of the human unruptured IA lesion and cultured endothelial cells on this model; it was then perfused with culture media to model physiological flow conditions. Gene expression profiles of endothelial cells in each part of the IA lesion were then analyzed. Comprehensive gene expression profile analysis revealed similar gene expression patterns in endothelial cells from each part of the IA lesion but gene ontology analysis revealed endothelial cell malfunction within the IA lesion. Histopathological examination, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that endothelial cells within IA lesions are damaged and dysfunctional. Thus, our findings reveal endothelial cell malfunction in IA lesions and provided new insights into IA pathogenesis.</jats:p>",

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is universally accepted to occur via contact with contaminated secretions from the respiratory epithelium, either directly or indirectly. Transmission via droplet nuclei, generated from a cough or sneeze, has also been reported in several human and experimental animal scenarios. However, the role of droplet transmission at the human–animal interface remains to be fully elucidated. Here, the ferret infection model was used to investigate the routes of infection for the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant (B.1.351). Ferrets were exposed to droplets containing infectious SARS-CoV-2, ranging between 4 and 106 µm in diameter, simulating larger droplets produced by a cough from an infected person. Following exposure, viral RNA was detected on the fur of ferrets, and was deposited onto environmental surfaces, as well as the fur of ferrets placed in direct contact; SARS-CoV-2 remained infectious on the fur for at least 48 h. Low levels of viral RNA were detected in the nasal washes early post-exposure, yet none of the directly exposed, or direct-contact ferrets, became robustly infected or seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. In comparison, ferrets intranasally inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant became robustly infected, shedding viral RNA and infectious virus from the nasal cavity, with transmission to 75 % of naive ferrets placed in direct contact. These data suggest that larger infectious droplet nuclei and contaminated fur play minor roles in SARS-CoV-2 transmission among mustelids and potentially other companion animals.</jats:p>",

However, in a RCF, the modes associated with different OAM states are highly overlapping due to the circular refractive index distribution structure, which makes it difficult to distinguish and monitor the OAM modes and in turn limits its inline conversion. Here, we report the first experimental realization of mode monitoring in a RCF using mode filters (MFs), which takes advantage of the difference in the mode adiabatic evolution and the higher-order mode cutoff conditions in tapered RCFs. Different-order OAM can be filtered using MFs with different geometric parameters, as demonstrated by the linearly polarized mode intensity. Combined the mode manipulations in RCF and single-mode fiber, the fundamental mode coupling efficiency can reach 90%, the RCF mode conversion monitoring through inline transmission spectrum evolution can be realized, and the inline fabrication of RCF grating, which couples one mode to a desired mode, can be demonstrated by the fabricating process of three long-period fiber gratings. The mode conversion efficiency between 0-order and 1, 2- or 3-order OAM modes exceeds 96%. Our work provides an efficient approach to monitor and convert OAM modes in higher-order mode supporting RCFs and even other special fibers and further promotes the improvement of the capacity of OAM transmission in RCFs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Exploring the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties of quantum dots (QDs) is not only important for understanding the carrier recombination processes in QD-based devices but also critical for expanding their special applications at different temperatures. However, there is still no clear understanding of the optical properties of CdS/ZnS core/shell QDs as a function of temperature. Herein, the temperature-dependent PL spectra of CdS/ZnS core/shell QDs were studied in the temperature range of 77–297 K. It was found that the band-edge emission (BEE) intensity decreases continuously with increasing temperature, while the surface-state emission (SSE) intensity first increases and then decreases. For BEE intensity, in the low temperature range, a small activation energy (29.5 meV) in the nonradiative recombination process led to the decrease of PL intensity of CdS/ZnS core/shell QDs; and at high temperature the PL intensity attenuation was caused by the thermal escape process. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent variation trend of the SSE intensity was determined by the competition of the trapping process of the surface trap states and the effect of thermally activated non-radiative defects. As the temperature increased, the PL spectra showed a certain degree of redshift in the peak energies of both band-edge and surface states and the PL spectrum full width at half-maximum (FWHM) increases, which was mainly due to the coupling of exciton and acoustic phonon. Furthermore, the CIE chromaticity coordinates turned from (0.190, 0.102) to (0.302, 0.194), which changed dramatically with temperature. The results indicated that the CdS/ZnS core/shell QDs are expected to be applied in temperature sensors.</jats:p>"

Solution-processed 2D materials are attractive for simple, low-cost, and large-scale fabrication of devices on, virtually, any substrate. However, to date, there are only few reports with contrasting results on the thermal conductivity of graphene films, while thermal transport has been hardly measured for other types of solution-processed 2D material films. In this work, inkjet-printed graphene, h-BN and MoS2 films are demonstrated with thermal conductivities of ∼10 Wm−1K−1 and ∼0.3 Wm−1K−1 along and across the basal plane, respectively, giving rise to an anisotropy of ∼30, hardly dependent on the material type and annealing treatment. First-principles calculations indicate that portion of the phonon spectrum is cut-off by the quality of the thermal contact for transport along the plane, yet the ultra-low conductivity across the plane is associated with high-transmissivity interfaces. These findings can drive the design of highly anisotropic 2D material films for heat management applications.</jats:p>"

To understand the roles of soybean miRNAs during P. sojae infection, we analyzed four small RNA libraries from two soybean germplasms before and after P. sojae isolate JS08-12 infection. The cultivar Nannong 10-1 was resistant to JS08-12, whereas the 06-070583 line was susceptible to JS08-12. In total, 528 known and 555 putative novel miRNAs in soybean were identified from 97 million reads; 74 known miRNAs and 75 novel miRNAs that might be specifically related to Nannong10-1 responses to P. sojae; and 55 known and 43 novel miRNAs expressed before and after infection in the susceptible line 06-070583. qRT-PCR provided similar miRNA expression patterns to those obtained by the small-RNA sequencing of the four libraries. Then, the potential target genes of these differentially expressed miRNA were predicted, which encoded transcriptional factors, resistance proteins and transporters. Finally, we focused on the targets of the three legume-specific miRNAs (gma-miR1508, gma-miR1509, and gma-miR1510) and charted the miRNA–target interactions and networks based on the published degradome data.</jats:p>"

Using live imaging and content mixing assays in a heterologous system and structure-guided mutagenesis, we unveil an unexpected function for IZUMO1 in cell-to-cell fusion. We show that IZUMO1 alone is sufficient to induce fusion, and that this ability is retained in a mutant unable to bind JUNO. On the other hand, a triple mutation in exposed aromatic residues prevents this fusogenic activity without impairing JUNO interaction. Our findings suggest a second function for IZUMO1 as a unilateral mouse gamete fusogen.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In eastern Mediterranean sediments, the titanium-to-aluminum ratio\n(Ti/Al) captures relative variability in eolian to river-derived\nmaterial and predominantly integrates climate signals over the Saharan and\nSahel regions. Long Ti/Al time series can, therefore, provide valuable\nrecords of North African humidity and aridity changes. X-ray fluorescence core\nscanning (XRF-CS) can generate near-continuous Ti/Al records with relatively\nmodest effort and in an acceptable amount of time, provided that accurate\nTi/Al values are acquired. Calibration of raw XRF-CS data to those of\nestablished analytical methods is an important pathway for obtaining the\nrequired accuracy. We assess how to obtain reliable XRF-CS Ti/Al calibration\nby using different calibration reference sample sets for a long sediment\nrecord from ODP Site 967 (eastern Mediterranean Sea). The accuracy of\nreference concentrations and the number of reference samples are important\nfor reliable calibration. Our continuous Ti/Al record allows detailed\ntime series analysis over the past 3 Myr. Near-direct control of low-latitude\ninsolation on the timing and amplitude of North African aridity and humidity is\nobserved from 3 to ∼ 1.2 Ma. In our Ti/Al record, most arid\nNorth African intervals (i.e., with the longest period and highest\namplitude) occur after the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT; ∼ 1.2–0.7 Ma), when ice ages intensified. We also observe a subdued\nrelationship between low-latitude insolation and North African climate after\nthe MPT. These findings support the growing consensus that African climate\nbecame more sensitive to remote high-latitude climate when a threshold ice\nvolume was reached during the MPT.\n                    </jats:p>"

How, then, can the brain encode information about <jats:italic>each</jats:italic> of the stimuli that may be present at a given moment? We recently showed that when more than one stimulus is present, single neurons can fluctuate between coding one vs. the other(s) across some time period, suggesting a form of neural multiplexing of different stimuli (Caruso et al., 2018). Here, we investigate (a) whether such coding fluctuations occur in early visual cortical areas; (b) how coding fluctuations are coordinated across the neural population; and (c) how coordinated coding fluctuations depend on the parsing of stimuli into separate vs. fused objects. We found coding fluctuations do occur in macaque V1 but only when the two stimuli form separate objects. Such separate objects evoked a novel pattern of V1 spike count (‘noise’) correlations involving distinct distributions of positive and negative values. This bimodal correlation pattern was most pronounced among pairs of neurons showing the strongest evidence for coding fluctuations or multiplexing. Whether a given pair of neurons exhibited positive or negative correlations depended on whether the two neurons both responded better to the same object or had different object preferences. Distinct distributions of spike count correlations based on stimulus preferences were also seen in V4 for separate objects but not when two stimuli fused to form one object. These findings suggest multiple objects evoke different response dynamics than those evoked by single stimuli, lending support to the multiplexing hypothesis and suggesting a means by which information about multiple objects can be preserved despite the apparent coarseness of sensory coding.</jats:p>"

The top 2000 years have previously been dated using age markers interpolated through annual layer counting. Below this, we align the Skytrain core to the AICC2012 age model using tie points in the ice and air phase, and apply the Paleochrono program to obtain the best fit to the tie points and glaciological constraints. In the gas phase, ties are made using methane and, in critical sections, δ18Oair; in the ice phase ties are through 10Be across the Laschamps Event, and through ice chemistry related to long-range dust transport and deposition. This strategy provides a good outcome to about 108 ka (~605 m). Beyond that there are signs of flow disturbance, with a section of ice probably repeated. Nonetheless values of CH4 and δ18Oair confirm that part of the last interglacial (LIG), from about 117–126 ka (617–628 m), is present and in chronological order. Below this there are clear signs of stratigraphic disturbance, with rapid oscillation of values in both the ice and gas phase at the base of the LIG section. Based on methane values, the warmest part of the LIG and the coldest part of the penultimate glacial are missing from our record. Ice below 631 m appears to be of age &gt;150 ka.\n                        </jats:p>"

Moreover, we uncovered a parallel fundal-lateral functional organization in the IT face network, supporting dual routes (dorsal-ventral) in face processing within IT cortex as well as between IT cortex and the amygdala.

Here, we focused on three ACE2 glycosylation sites (53, 90 and 322) that are geometrically close to spike binding sites and investigated the effect of their glycosylation pattern on spike affinity. These glycosylation deletions caused distinct site-specific changes in interactions with the spike and acted cooperatively. Of note, the particular interaction profiles were conserved between the SARS-CoV-2 parental virus and the variants of concern (VOCs) Delta and Omicron. Our study provides insights for a better understanding of the importance of ACE2 glycosylation on ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction and guidance for further optimization of soluble ACE2 for therapeutic use.</jats:p>"

Effective mode area and confinement loss of five PCFs with optimal dispersion have been further studied to find the fiber with a great application value for supercontinuum generation (SCG). Generally, circular PCFs are dominant over hexagonal lattices because of their small effective mode area, low loss, and small dispersion. #CF1 fiber with a lattice constant (Ʌ) of 1.0 μm and filling factor (d1/Ʌ) of 0.65 has an all-normal dispersion with a low value of -1.623 ps/nm/km, a small effective mode area of 1.43 µm2, and a low loss of 2.472 dB/m at 0.945 µm. The effective mode area and confinement loss of #CF2 (Ʌ = 1.0 µm, d1/Ʌ = 0.7) are the smallest of proposed PCFs. #HF1 fiber (Ʌ = 1.0 µm, d1/Ʌ = 0.5) has a very flat dispersion curve in the 1-2 µm wavelength range and a rather small effective mode area. These are the most optimal fibers for two types of lattices, which are very suitable for near-infrared SCG.</jats:p>",

Itaconic acid (ITA) potentially has anti-TB activity; however, its incorporation in nanoparticles (NP) is challenging. Here we show an approach for preparing polymer-ITA conjugate NPs and a methodology for investigating the NP degradation and ITA release mechanism. The conjugate was synthesized by the two-directional growing of polylactic acid (PLA) chains, followed by capping their extremities with ITA. The poly(lactate)-itaconate PLA-ITA was then used to formulate NPs. The degradation and drug release processes of the polymer conjugate NPs were studied qualitatively and quantitatively. The molecular structures of released species were characterized by using liquid NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We discovered a complex NP hydrolysis process forming diverse oligomers, as well as monomeric lactic acid (LA) and drug ITA. The slow degradation process led to a low release of free drugs, although raising the pH from 5.3 to 7.4 induced a slight increase in the amounts of released products. TEM images showed that bulk erosion is likely to play the primary role in the degradation of PLA-ITA NPs. The overall results and methodology can be of interest for understanding the mechanisms of NP degradation and drug release of this new polymer-drug conjugate system.</jats:p>"

Recently, several studies have suggested endogenous responses within the core are important for limiting the spread of damage and enhancing recovery, but the role of blood flow and capillary pericytes in this process is unknown. Using the Rose Bengal photothrombotic model of stroke, we illustrate blood vessels are present in the ischemic core and peri‐lesional regions 2 weeks post stroke in male mice. A FITC‐albumin gel cast of the vasculature revealed perfusion of these vessels, suggesting cerebral blood flow (CBF) may be partially present, without vascular leakage. The length of these vessels is significantly reduced compared to uninjured regions, but the average width is greater, suggesting they are either larger vessels that survived the initial injury, smaller vessels that have expanded in size (i.e., arteriogenesis), or that neovascularization begins with larger vessels. Concurrently, we observed an increase in platelet‐derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ, a marker of pericytes) expression within the ischemic core in two distinct patterns, one which resembles pericyte‐derived fibrotic scarring at the edge of the core, and one which is vessel associated and may represent blood vessel recovery. We find little evidence for dividing cells on these intralesional blood vessels 2 weeks post stroke. Our study provides evidence flow is present in PDGFRβ‐positive vessels in the ischemic core 2 weeks post stroke. We hypothesize intralesional CBF is important for limiting injury and for encouraging endogenous repair following cerebral ischemia.</jats:p>",

Hence the need to identify novel combination therapies able to overcome drug resistance. miRNAs have emerged as orchestrators of non-genetic mechanisms adopted by melanoma cells to challenge therapies. In this context we previously identified a subset of oncosuppressor miRNAs downregulated in drug-resistant melanomas. Here we demonstrate that lipid nanoparticles co-encapsulating two of them, miR-199-5p and miR-204-5p, inhibit tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo in combination with target therapy and block the development of drug resistance. Mechanistically they act by directly reducing melanoma cell growth and also indirectly by hampering the recruitment and reprogramming of pro-tumoral macrophages. Molecularly, we demonstrate that the effects on macrophages are mediated by the dysregulation of a newly identified miR-204-5p-miR-199b-5p/CCL5 axis. Finally, we unveiled that M2 macrophages programs are molecular signatures of resistance and predict response to therapy in patients. Overall, these findings have strong translational implications to propose new combination therapies making use of RNA therapeutics for metastatic melanoma patients.</jats:p>",

The chirality transfer is based on discrete trimeric tubular assemblies of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, achieving the construction of diastereomerically pure trimers of pillar[5]arenes through synergistic effect of ion pairing between a racemic rim-differentiated pillar[5]arene pentaacid bearing five benzoic acids on one rim and five alkyl chains on the other, and an optically resolved pillar[5]arene decaamine bearing ten amines. When the decaamine is mixed with the pentaacid, the decaamine is sandwiched by two pentaacids through ten ion pairs, initially producing a statistically random mixture of a homochiral trimer and two heterochiral trimers. The heterochiral trimers gradually dissociate and reassemble into the homochiral trimers after unit flipping of the pentaacid, leading to chirality transfer from the decaamine and producing diastereomerically pure trimers.</jats:p>"

The 3D waveguide device couples the LP01 and LP11a modes to the FM-MCF with an insertion loss below 3 dB and cross talk between waveguides below <jats:inline-formula>\n      <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m1\">\n\t<mml:mrow>\n\t  <mml:mo form=\"prefix\">−</mml:mo>\n\t  <mml:mn>36</mml:mn>\n\t  <mml:mtext>  </mml:mtext>\n\t  <mml:mi>dB</mml:mi>\n\t</mml:mrow>\n      </mml:math>\n    </jats:inline-formula>. To test the performance of the 3D waveguide device, we demonstrate four-channel multiplexing communication with two LP modes and two cores in a 1-km few-mode seven-core fiber. The bit error rate curves show that the different degrees of bending of the waveguides result in a difference of approximately 1 dB in the power penalty. Femtosecond laser direct writing fabrication enables 3D waveguide devices to support high-order LP modes transmission and further improves FM-MCF communication.</jats:p>",

We investigate how <jats:italic>CHD7</jats:italic> mutations affect inner ear development using human pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids as a model system. We find that loss of CHD7 or its chromatin remodeling activity leads to complete absence of hair cells and supporting cells, which can be explained by dysregulation of key otic development-associated genes in mutant otic progenitors. Further analysis of the mutant otic progenitors suggests that CHD7 can regulate otic genes through a chromatin remodeling-independent mechanism. Results from transcriptome profiling of hair cells reveal disruption of deafness gene expression as a potential underlying mechanism of CHARGE-associated sensorineural hearing loss. Notably, co-differentiating <jats:italic>CHD7</jats:italic> knockout and wild-type cells in chimeric organoids partially rescues mutant phenotypes by restoring otherwise severely dysregulated otic genes.

Since the UGT2 family forms a large cluster spanning 1.5 Mb, transgenic mouse lines carrying the entire human UGT2 family have not been constructed because of limitations in conventional cloning techniques. Therefore, we made a humanized mouse model for UGT2 by chromosome engineering technologies. The results showed that six UGT2 isoforms examined were expressed in the liver of adult humanized UGT2 (hUGT2) mice. Thus, the functions of human UGT2B7 in the liver of hUGT2 mice were evaluated. Glucuronide of azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine), a typical UGT2B7 substrate, was formed in the liver microsomes of hUGT2 mice but not in the liver microsomes of wild‐type and Ugt2‐knockout mice. When AZT was intravenously administered, AZT glucuronide was detected in the bile and urine of hUGT2 mice, but it was not detected in the bile and urine of wild‐type and Ugt2‐knockout mice. These results indicated that the hUGT2 mice express functional human UGT2B7 in the liver. This finding was also confirmed by using gemfibrozil as an alternative UGT2B7 substrate. Gemfibrozil glucuronide was formed in the liver microsomes of hUGT2 mice and was mainly excreted in the bile of hUGT2 mice after intravenous dosing of gemfibrozil. This hUGT2 mouse model will enable improved predictions of pharmacokinetics, urinary and biliary excretion and drug–drug interactions mediated by human UGT2, at least UGT2B7, in drug development research and basic research.</jats:p>",

At present, there are no examples of using high‐throughput screening to identify chemicals that target plant transcriptional complexes, some of which are responsible for regulating multiple physiological functions. Florigen, a protein encoded by <jats:italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>FT</jats:italic>), was initially identified as a molecule that promotes flowering and has since been shown to regulate flowering and other developmental phenomena such as tuber formation in potato (<jats:italic>Solanum tuberosum</jats:italic>). FT functions as a component of the florigen activation complex (FAC) with a 14‐3‐3 scaffold protein and FD, a bZIP transcription factor that activates downstream gene expression. Although 14‐3‐3 is an important component of FAC, little is known about the function of the 14‐3‐3 protein itself. Here, we report the results of a high‐throughput <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) screening of chemical libraries that enabled us to identify small molecules capable of inhibiting FAC formation. These molecules abrogate the <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> interaction between the 14‐3‐3 protein and the OsFD1 peptide, a rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic>) FD, by directly binding to the 14‐3‐3 protein. Treatment with S4, a specific hit molecule, strongly inhibited FAC activity and flowering in duckweed, tuber formation in potato, and branching in rice in a dose‐dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the high‐throughput screening approach based on the three‐dimensional structure of PPIs is suitable in plants. In this study, we have proposed good candidate compounds for future modification to obtain inhibitors of florigen‐dependent processes through inhibition of FAC formation.</jats:p>",

The profiles of the grain size of the lake sediments show that silt (4–63 µm) was the largest contribution with an average content of 84.05%, and the second largest contribution was sand (&gt;63 µm) with an average content of 15.68%.

The peak–trough value of the mean grain size of the sediments in Hulun Lake can reflect the magnitude of rainfall intensity and river discharge. The clay and silt contents at a depth of approximately 32–38 cm was different from other depths throughout the core, which showed continuous maxima with an average content of 0.35% and 94.08%.

Efficient intervention strategies are urgently needed. Avian immunoglobulin Y (IgY) showed efficacy against viral infection whereas the in vivo efficacy remains unclear. (Methods) We immunized laying hens with S1, S1 receptor-binding domain (S1-RBD), or S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. After immunization, IgYs were collected and extracted from the egg yolks. The neutralization potential of IgYs was examined by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The bioutility of IgYs was examined in Syrian hamsters in vivo. (Results) IgYs exhibited typical banding patterns in SDS-PAGE and Western blot and were immunoreactive against S1, S1-RBD, and S2 subunits. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) showed that all purified IgYs potently neutralized different SARS-CoV-2 strains in vitro. In Syrian hamsters, the combination of IgYs for S1-RBD and S2 subunits administered before or after SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively restored body weight loss and reduced intrapulmonary lesions and the amount of immunoreactive N protein-positive cells, which were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. (Conclusions) Collectively, IgYs specific for S protein subunits effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo and may serve as prophylactic or therapeutic antibodies in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

With ice-shelf retreat, aphotic marine environments transform into new open-water spaces of photo-induced primary production and associated organic matter export to the benthos. Predicting how Antarctic seafloor assemblages may develop following ice-shelf loss requires knowledge of assemblages bordering the ice-shelf margins, which are relatively undocumented. This study investigated seafloor assemblages, by taxa and functional groups, in a coastal polynya adjacent to the Larsen C Ice Shelf front, western Weddell Sea. The study area is rarely accessed, at the frontline of climate change, and located within a CCAMLR-proposed international marine protected area. Four sites, ~1 to 16 km from the ice-shelf front, were explored for megabenthic assemblages, and potential environmental drivers of assemblage structures were assessed. Faunal density increased with distance from the ice shelf, with epifaunal deposit-feeders a surrogate for overall density trends. Faunal richness did not exhibit a significant pattern with distance from the ice shelf and was most variable at sites closest to the ice-shelf front. Faunal assemblages significantly differed in composition among sites, and those nearest to the ice shelf were the most dissimilar; however, ice-shelf proximity did not emerge as a significant driver of assemblage structure. Overall, the study found a biologically-diverse and complex seafloor environment close to an ice-shelf front and provides ecological baselines for monitoring benthic ecosystem responses to environmental change, supporting marine management.</jats:p>"

Alpha-tocopherol succinate (TS) is a derivative of vitamin E that shows potent anticancer mechanisms, and it is an interesting approach as adjuvant. In this study, we designed a pH-sensitive PLGA-polymer-core/TPGS-lipid-shell hybrid nanoparticle, loaded with DOX and TS (LPNP_TS-DOX). Nanoparticles were physicochemically and morphologically characterized. Cytotoxicity studies, migration assay, and cellular uptake were performed in 4T1, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Antitumor activity in vivo was evaluated in 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice. In vitro studies showed a significant reduction in cell viability, cell migration, and an increase in cellular uptake for the 4T1 cell line compared to free DOX. In vivo antitumor activity showed that LPNP-TS-DOX was more effective in controlling tumor growth than other treatments. The high cellular internalization and the pH-triggered payload release of DOX lead to the increased accumulation of the drugs in the tumor area, along with the synergic combination with TS, culminating in greater antitumor efficacy. These data support LPNP-TS-DOX as a promising drug delivery system for breast cancer treatment.</jats:p>"

Based on Lemaitre damage theory, a very high/low cycle combined fatigue damage model was established to analyze the fatigue damage process, which was consistent with the experimental data. It was indicated that 5% LCF predamage value was the equivalent damage value, which was close to the critical value of VHCF crack initiation.

To further understand its therapeutic mechanism of action, in this study, we first demonstrated increased apoptosis and shedding in the CCECs of DMED patients, accompanied by significant mitochondrial injury by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of corpus cavernosum tissue. Next, we used advanced glycation end products (AGEs) to simulate the diabetic environment in vitro and found that AGES damaged mitochondria and inhibited angiogenesis in CCECs in a dose-dependent manner, while LIPUS treatment significantly reversed its effects. Mechanistic studies based on transcriptome sequencing showed that LIPUS significantly up-regulated LC3 and PARKIN protein levels in mitochondria, promoted mitophagy, and affected mitochondrial dynamics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, the protective effects of LIPUS were abrogated when mitophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine. In summary, LIPUS exerted potent inhibitory effects on AGES-induced CCEC failure via mitophagy, providing a theoretical basis for DMED treatment that encompasses the protection of endothelial structure and function.</jats:p>"

To deal with fluctuating nitrate availability in soils, plants store this nutrient in their vacuoles. Chloride channel a (CLCa), a 2NO3−/1H+ exchanger localized to the vacuole in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ensures this storage process. CLCa belongs to the CLC family, which includes anion/proton exchangers and anion channels. A mutation in a glutamate residue conserved across CLC exchangers is likely responsible for the conversion of exchangers to channels. Here, we show that CLCa with a mutation in glutamate 203 (E203) behaves as an anion channel in its native membrane. We introduced the CLCaE203A point mutation to investigate its physiological importance into the Arabidopsis clca knockout mutant. These CLCaE203A mutants displayed a growth deficit linked to the disruption of water homeostasis. Additionally, CLCaE203A expression failed to complement the defect in nitrate accumulation of clca and favored higher N-assimilation at the vegetative stage. Further analyses at the post-flowering stages indicated that CLCaE203A expression results in an increase in N uptake allocation to seeds, leading to a higher nitrogen use efficiency compared to the wild-type. Altogether, these results point to the critical function of the CLCa exchanger on the vacuole for plant metabolism and development.</jats:p>",

These observations resolve a network of core-connecting dust lanes, marking a departure from earlier coarser, more spherical continuum structures. At the same time, the cores do not appear to fragment further. Polarized dust emission is clearly detected. The inferred magnetic field orientations are prevailingly parallel to dust lanes. This key structural feature is analyzed together with the local gravitational vector field. The direction of local gravity is found to typically align with dust lanes. With these findings, we derive a stability criterion that defines a maximum magnetic field strength that can be overcome by an observed magnetic field–gravity configuration. Equivalently, this defines a minimum field strength that can stabilize dust lanes against a radial collapse. We find that the detected dust lanes in W51 e2 and e8 are stable, hence possibly making them a fundamental component in the accretion onto central sources, providing support for massive star formation models without the need of large accretion disks. When comparing to coarser resolutions, covering the scales of envelope, global, and local collapse, we find recurring similarities in the magnetic field structures and their corresponding gravitational vector fields. These self-similar structures point at a multiscale collapse-within-collapse scenario until finally the scale of core-accreting dust lanes is reached where gravity is entraining the magnetic field and aligning it with the dust lanes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to investigate the mechanical behavior of special-shaped reinforced concrete composite columns encased with GFRP core columns (EGCSSCs) subjected to axial load, twenty-seven full-scale EGCSSCs were designed with varying parameters: axial compressive strength of core concrete (fcc), axial compressive strength of peripheral concrete (fco), thickness of GFRP tube (tgfrp), ratio of longitudinal reinforcement (ρv), stirrup ratio (ρs) and GFRP ratio in the cross-section (α). The three-dimensional finite element refined models of EGCSSCs were established by ABAQUS finite element software, and the response of EGCSSCs under axial load was studied based on the verification of finite element modeling. The influence of different parameters on the ultimate axial compressive strength (Nus), initial stiffness (K), and ductility index (µ) of EGCSSCs was obtained, and the typical failure mode of EGCSSCs was clearly described. The results showed that the main failure mode of the EGCSSCs subjected to axial load was bulging outward at the middle of the EGCSSCs, showed yielding of the longitudinal steel bars, and was crushing both ends of the peripheral concrete. When the column was damaged, the peripheral concrete reached peak stress earlier than the core concrete. All specimens exhibited excellent load-carrying capacity and good ductility. Moreover, with the existence of GFRP core columns, the Nus and µ of the columns were increased by 11.61% and 140.86%. In addition, K increased with the increase in fcc, fco, tgfrp and α, and the largest increments were 23.99%, 50.54%, 21.77%, and 34.19%, respectively. µ decreased with the increase in fcc and fco, which decreased by 14.05% and 40.28%, respectively. By using statistical regression and introducing the constraint effect coefficients and the reduction coefficient, the calculation formula for the axial compression-bearing capacity of EGCSSCs was derived, which could lay a foundation for the popularization and application of this kind of composite column in practical engineering.</jats:p>"

Irinotecan is a frontline chemotherapeutic agent that has dose-limiting side effects that compromise its therapeutic potential. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel, targeted drug delivery system with high therapeutic efficacy and an improved safety profile. Here, micellar formulations composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)-2000] (DSPE-mPEG2k) containing irinotecan were proposed as a strategy for colorectal cancer therapy. Firstly, the irinotecan-loaded micelles were prepared using the solvent evaporation method. Then, micelles were characterized in terms of size, polydispersity, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and release kinetics. Cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity were evaluated. The micelles showed size around 13 nm, zeta potential near neutral (−0.5 mV), and encapsulation efficiency around 68.5% (irinotecan 3 mg/mL) with a sustained drug release within the first 8 h. The micelles were evaluated in a CT26 tumor animal model showing inhibition of tumor growth (89%) higher than free drug (68.7%). Body weight variation, hemolytic activity, hematological, and biochemical data showed that, at the dose of 7.5 mg/kg, the irinotecan-loaded micelles have low toxicity. In summary, our findings provide evidence that DSPE-mPEG2k micelles could be considered potential carriers for future irinotecan delivery and their possible therapeutic application against colorectal cancer.</jats:p>"

LamPP is a UV-sensitive bistable opsin having complete photoregenerative ability by green light. Accordingly, transgenic worms expressing LamPP in cholinergic motor neurons stopped moving upon violet light illumination and restored coordinate movement upon green light illumination, demonstrating color-dependent control of behavior using LamPP.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) of obesity-driven EEC remain(s) unclear. In this study, we examined whether LIF signaling plays a role in the obesity-driven progression of EEC. RNA-seq analysis of EEC cells stimulated by adipose conditioned medium (ADP-CM) showed upregulation of LIF/LIFR-mediated signaling pathways including JAK/STAT and interleukin pathways. Immunohistochemistry analysis of normal and EEC tissues collected from obese patients revealed that LIF expression is upregulated in EEC tissues compared to the normal endometrium. Treatment of both primary and established EEC cells with ADP-CM increased the expression of LIF and its receptor LIFR and enhanced proliferation of EEC cells. Treatment of EEC cells with the LIFR inhibitor EC359 abolished ADP-CM induced colony formation andcell viability and decreased growth of EEC organoids. Mechanistic studies using Western blotting, RT-qPCR and reporter assays confirmed that ADP-CM activated LIF/LIFR downstream signaling, which can be effectively attenuated by the addition of EC359. In xenograft assays, co-implantation of adipocytes significantly enhanced EEC xenograft tumor growth. Further, treatment with EC359 significantly attenuated adipocyte-induced EEC progression in vivo. Collectively, our data support the premise that LIF/LIFR signaling plays an important role in obesity-driven EEC progression and the LIFR inhibitor EC359 has the potential to suppress adipocyte-driven tumor progression.</jats:p>"

At present, it is urgent to find a strategy to solve this problem and improve the therapeutic effect. In this study, we designed a programmed release system of anticancer drugs by preparing a nanofiber system with two kinds of diameters and biomaterials (polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PLGA) and silk protein) as drug carriers (paclitaxel), which inspired the occurrence and pathological microenvironment of renal cell carcinoma. The controlled degradation of PLGA nanofibers as a drug carrier achieved the short-term release of paclitaxel, which could rapidly inhibit the spread and metastasis of renal cancer, while the silk protein nanofibers as a drug carrier with slow degradation could provide the long time and continuous release of paclitaxel to prevent the proliferation of renal cancer cells and inhibit recurrence. The synergistic effect of the sustained release system of paclitaxel successfully achieved inhibition of the recurrence and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma and improve the therapeutic effect of renal cell carcinoma. The paclitaxel release profile showed that the PLGA nanofiber drug system provided controlled release of paclitaxel in the first 14 days, while the silk protein nanofiber system provided a relatively stable and long-duration release of paclitaxel (1 month). In vitro experiments showed that the sustained release system of paclitaxel had a lasting inhibitory effect on the proliferation of renal clear cell carcinoma cells. These results indicated that the sustained release system of paclitaxel could be used as a promising drug delivery system with highly efficient implementations to reduce the frequency of systemic administration and inhibit tumor growth and recurrence, which could provide a new strategy for the clinical applications in renal cell carcinoma microenvironment.</jats:p>",

Data on long-term protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed convalescents, is limited. We prospectively measured immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying antibodies against 4 different antigens (spike protein 1 and 2, receptor binding domain, nucleocapsid) and T cell responses by IFN-γ ELISPOT against 4 antigens (membrane, nucleocapsid, spike protein 1 and 2) in 24 OLT convalescents with immunosuppressive therapy longitudinally in the first year after COVID-19 including a booster vaccination in comparison to a matched cohort of non-immunosuppressed convalescents (non-IS-Con). Pre-pandemic OLT samples were retrieved from our prospective OLT biorepository (n = 16). No relevant T cell reactivity or immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in pre-pandemic samples of OLT recipients despite reactivity against endemic corona-viruses. OLT convalescents had a lower prevalence of IgG against nucleocapsid (54% vs. 90%) but not against spike protein domains (98–100% vs. 100%) after vaccination in the second half-year after COVID-19 compared to non-IS-Con. Also, concentrations of anti-nucleocapsid IgG were lower in OLT convalescents than in non-IS-Con. Concentration of IgG against spike protein domains was significantly increased by a booster vaccination in OLT convalescents. But concentration of IgG against two of three spike protein domains remains slightly lower compared to non-IS-Con finally. However, none of these differences was mirrored by the cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 that remained stable during the first year after COVID-19 and was not further stimulated by a corona vaccination in OLT convalescents. In conclusion, despite lower concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in OLT convalescents anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity was as robust as in non-IS-Con.</jats:p>"

Microbiota dysbiosis occurs when energy imbalances appear due to an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Dysbiosis has a critical impact on increasing intestinal permeability and epithelial barrier deterioration, contributing to bacterial and antigen translocation to the liver, triggering non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. In this study, the potential therapeutic/beneficial effects of a combination of metabolic cofactors (a multi-ingredient; MI) (betaine, N-acetylcysteine, L-carnitine, and nicotinamide riboside) against NAFLD were evaluated. In addition, we investigated the effects of this metabolic cofactors’ combination as a modulator of other players of the gut-liver axis during the disease, including gut barrier dysfunction and microbiota dysbiosis. Diet-induced NAFLD mice were distributed into two groups, treated with the vehicle (NAFLD group) or with a combination of metabolic cofactors (NAFLD-MI group), and small intestines were harvested from all animals for histological, molecular, and omics analysis. The MI treatment ameliorated gut morphological changes, decreased gut barrier permeability, and reduced gene expression of some proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, epithelial cell proliferation and the number of goblet cells were increased after MI supplementation. In addition, supplementation with the MI combination promoted changes in the intestinal microbiota composition and diversity, as well as modulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations in feces. Taken together, this specific combination of metabolic cofactors can reverse gut barrier disruption and microbiota dysbiosis contributing to the amelioration of NAFLD progression by modulating key players of the gut-liver axis.</jats:p>"

The two sites are ~450 km apart. Despite meltwater percolation resulting from warming, particle-based trace element records (e.g. Fe, Mg, K) in the Quelccaya and Illimani shallow cores retain well-preserved signals. The firn core chronologies, established independently by annual layer counting, show a convincing overlap indicating the two records contain comparable signals and therefore capture similar regional scale climatology. Trace element records at a ~1–4 cm resolution provide past records of anthropogenic emissions, dust sources, volcanic emissions, evaporite salts and marine-sourced air masses. Using novel ultra-high-resolution (120 μm) laser technology, we identify annual layer thicknesses ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in a section of 2000-year-old radiocarbon-dated near-basal ice which compared to the previous annual layer estimates suggests that Quelccaya ice cores drilled to bedrock may be older than previously suggested by depth-age models. With the information collected from this study in combination with past studies, we emphasize the importance of collecting new surface-to-bedrock ice cores from at least the Quelccaya ice cap, in particular, due to its projected disappearance as soon as the 2050s.</jats:p>",

BCMA is a robust biomarker of plasma cells and a therapeutic target with substantial clinical significance. However, the expression of BCMA in circulating tumor cells of patients with hematological malignancies has not been validated for the detection of circulating plasma and B cells. The application of BCMA as a biomarker in single-cell detection and profiling of circulating tumor cells in patients’ blood could enable early disease profiling and therapy response monitoring. Here, we report the development and validation of a slide-based immunofluorescence assay (i.e., CD138, BCMA, CD45, DAPI) for enrichment-free detection, quantification, and morphogenomic characterization of BCMA-expressing cells in patients (N = 9) with plasma cell neoplasms. Varying morphological subtypes of circulating BCMA-expressing cells were detected across the CD138(+/−) and CD45(+/−) compartments, representing candidate clonotypic post-germinal center B cells, plasmablasts, and both normal and malignant plasma cells. Genomic analysis by single-cell sequencing and correlation to clinical FISH cytogenetics provides validation, with data showing that patients across the different neoplastic states carry both normal and altered BCMA-expressing cells. Furthermore, altered cells harbor cytogenetic events detected by clinical FISH. The reported enrichment-free liquid biopsy approach has potential applications as a single-cell methodology for the early detection of BCMA+ B-lymphoid malignancies and in monitoring therapy response for patients undergoing anti-BCMA treatments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Hypertension is characterized by increased sodium (Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) reabsorption along the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN) as well as chronic systemic inflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is thought to be a mediator of this inflammatory process. Interestingly, increased Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> reabsorption within the ASDN does not always correlate with increases in aldosterone (Aldo), the primary hormone that modulates Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> reabsorption via the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Thus, understanding how increased ASDN Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> reabsorption may occur independent of Aldo stimulation is critical. Here, we show that IL-6 can activate the MR by activating Rac1 and stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a consequent increase in thiazide-sensitive Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptake. Using an in vitro model of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), mDCT15 cells, we observed nuclear translocation of eGFP-tagged MR after IL-6 treatment. To confirm the activation of downstream transcription factors, mDCT15 cells were transfected with mineralocorticoid response element (MRE)-luciferase reporter constructs; then treated with vehicle, Aldo, or IL-6. Aldosterone or IL-6 treatment increased luciferase activity that was reversed with MR antagonist cotreatment, but IL-6 treatment was reversed by Rac1 inhibition or ROS reduction. In both mDCT15 and mpkCCD cells, IL-6 increased amiloride-sensitive transepithelial Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> current. ROS and IL-6 increased <jats:sup>22</jats:sup>Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptake via the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC). These results are the first to demonstrate that IL-6 can activate the MR resulting in MRE activation and that IL-6 increases NCC-mediated Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> reabsorption, providing evidence for an alternative mechanism for stimulating ASDN Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptake during conditions where Aldo-mediated MR stimulation may not occur. </jats:p>",

The Catalog contains variant-trait associations and supporting metadata for &amp;gt;45 000 published GWAS across &amp;gt;5000 human traits, and &amp;gt;40 000 full P-value summary statistics datasets. Content is curated from publications or acquired via author submission of prepublication summary statistics through a new submission portal and validation tool. GWAS data volume has vastly increased in recent years. We have updated our software to meet this scaling challenge and to enable rapid release of submitted summary statistics. The scope of the repository has expanded to include additional data types of high interest to the community, including sequencing-based GWAS, gene-based analyses and copy number variation analyses. Community outreach has increased the number of shared datasets from under-represented traits, e.g. cancer, and we continue to contribute to awareness of the lack of population diversity in GWAS. Interoperability of the Catalog has been enhanced through links to other resources including the Polygenic Score Catalog and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, refinements to GWAS trait annotation, and the development of a standard format for GWAS data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Prognostic biomarkers reflective of underlying molecular mechanisms are critically needed for effective management of DKD. A three-marker panel was derived from a proteomics analysis of plasma samples by an unbiased machine learning approach from participants (N = 58) in the Clinical Phenotyping and Resource Biobank study. In combination with standard clinical parameters, this panel improved prediction of the composite outcome of ESKD or a 40% decline in glomerular filtration rate. The panel was validated in an independent group (N = 68), who also had kidney transcriptomic profiles. One marker, plasma angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2), was significantly associated with outcomes in cohorts from the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 3,183) and the Chinese Cohort Study of Chronic Kidney Disease (N = 210). Glomerular transcriptional angiopoietin/Tie (ANG-TIE) pathway scores, derived from the expression of 154 ANG-TIE signaling mediators, correlated positively with plasma ANGPT2 levels and kidney outcomes. Higher receptor expression in glomeruli and higher ANG-TIE pathway scores in endothelial cells corroborated potential functional effects in the kidney from elevated plasma ANGPT2 levels. Our work suggests that ANGPT2 is a promising prognostic endothelial biomarker with likely functional impact on glomerular pathogenesis in DKD.</jats:p>",

To investigate the global SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, we used sequences shared via GISAID to estimate the impact of sequencing intensity and turnaround times on variant detection in 189 countries. In the first two years of the pandemic, 78% of high-income countries sequenced &gt;0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, while 42% of low- and middle-income countries reached that mark. Around 25% of the genomes from high income countries were submitted within 21 days, a pattern observed in 5% of the genomes from low- and middle-income countries. We found that sequencing around 0.5% of the cases, with a turnaround time &lt;21 days, could provide a benchmark for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance. Socioeconomic inequalities undermine the global pandemic preparedness, and efforts must be made to support low- and middle-income countries improve their local sequencing capacity.</jats:p>"
