      "abstract": "<jats:p>FOXG1 Syndrome (FS) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutation of the <jats:italic>FOXG1</jats:italic> gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator important for telencephalic brain development. People with FS have marked developmental delays, impaired ambulation, movement disorders, seizures, and behavior abnormalities including autistic features. Current therapeutic approaches are entirely symptomatic, however the ability to rescue phenotypes in mouse models of other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome by postnatal expression of gene products has led to hope that similar approaches could help modify the disease course in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as FS. While FoxG1 protein function plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, the ongoing adult expression of FoxG1 and behavioral phenotypes that present when FoxG1 function is removed postnatally provides support for opportunity for improvement with postnatal treatment. Here we generated a new mouse allele of <jats:italic>Foxg1</jats:italic> that disrupts protein expression and characterized the behavioral and structural brain phenotypes in heterozygous mutant animals. These mutant animals display changes in locomotor behavior, gait, anxiety, social interaction, aggression, and learning and memory compared to littermate controls. Additionally, they have structural brain abnormalities reminiscent of people with FS. This information provides a framework for future studies to evaluate the potential for post-natal expression of FoxG1 to modify the disease course in this severe neurodevelopmental disorder.</jats:p>"

In order to further understand the dynamic process of solitons from a multidimensional perspective, here we report the vectorial solitons nature under two-sets pulse splitting in a single cavity induced by dual-core fiber assisted ultrafast fiber lasers. Owing to the weakly coupled cores in symmetrical dual core fiber (SDCF), two pulse groups interaction are formed in a cavity. By using the dispersive Fourier transformation technique (DFT), it was found that the four-component polarized rotation vector solitons (PRVS) generate. Moreover, gradually increasing the power can obtain the locked soliton bound state in two core space, and the corresponding evolution is similar to that of non-degenerate bright solitons in Bose Einstein condensates (BEC). In addition, by properly controlling the soliton phase offset in SDCF, the soliton rain state of multi pulse evolution can be obtained. The related experimental results would be fruitful to the communities interested in soliton dynamics and frequency comb lasers.</jats:p>"

Strengthening the CORE has received increasing attention from sports medicine specialists after the 2000s, and strength training is the subject of recent research in competitive sports. However, there is still a lack of conceptual studies of protocols for training focused on soccer athletes. Objective: Verify a CORE strength training protocol based on the analysis of the CORE training concept, its main functions, and introductory practical examples. Methods: Literature data collection, experimental and statistical-mathematical methods, and theoretical analysis about CORE training focused on explosive strength performance in soccer players are used. The developed protocol experiments with 44 athletes, divided into experimental and control groups, by sex. Information is collected on goal shooting, 30-meter pass, balance, stability, and symmetry. Results: The group experienced better results in both sexes(P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The explosion strength indicators of the players were significantly improved. Whether male or female athletes, the higher the skill level, the stronger the CORE stability in players. Therefore, the CORE stability and strengthening in athletes promote a benefit in the technical level of soccer players. Evidence Level II; Therapeutic Studies - Investigating the result.</jats:p>"

It remains unclear whether (some) BCGs were already in place with quenched star formation before the formation of  a mature cluster core. Here we report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the centre of the spectrscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at  a look-back time of 10.58 billion years. These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 (0.525 trillion solar mass) and BOSS1244-QG2 (0.132 trillion solar mass), were detected with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism slitless spectroscopic observations. These two quiescent galaxies are among the brightest member galaxies in BOSS1244 and reside at redshifts z=2.2451 and z=2.2413, with a half-light radius of 6.72±0.50 and 2.72±0.16 kiloparsec, respectively. BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 are separated by a projected distance of about 70 physical kiloparsecs, implying that we are likely to be witnessing them during the formation of a massive BCG, through a dry merger with size and mass simliar to the most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation may have taken place before the virialization of the cluster core, which is believed to illuminate and heat gas up within the protocluster core. Moreover, we find a strong density-star formation relation over a scale of 20 co-moving Mpc in BOSS1244, implying that the quenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by environment-related processes before the virialization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tPolymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is one of the most promising energy conversion technologies with zero carbon emission, and has received significant attention especially for automotive applications. State-of-the-art PEMFCs use platinum or platinum-alloy nanoparticles distributed on carbon as the electrocatalyst. However, there are still significant challenges for PEMFCs before widespread commercialization including short lifetime and high initial cost mainly originating from the catalyst related issues. Recent research efforts have focused on approaches that would improve catalyst lifetime, reduce its manufacturing cost, and reduce the amount of platinum used without losing activity. In this work, we present a new core-shell electrocatalyst design that can potentially address the challenges of conventional PEMFC catalysts. The design involves a shell of nanocolumnar Pt thin film coated on carbon support core (Pt-TF/C). Pt-TF layers were deposited on carbon powder by high-pressure sputtering (HIPS) and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity relevant to PEMFCs was investigated. HIPS is a simple physical vapor deposition technique that is scalable and easily applicable to industrial sputter deposition systems, in which atoms come to the substrate surface at different angles to form columnar structures. Pt-TF/C powder samples with various types of carbon were produced and studied to investigate their ORR performance. Electrochemical characterization of the samples was performed by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode measurements. The Pt-TF-to-carbon mass ratios were measured by quartz crystal microbalance and thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the presence of Pt on the carbon support. Our preliminary results on specific activity, mass activity, and electrochemically active surface area indicate a promising electrocatalyst durability.    </jats:p>",

Methods: This paper selects high-level aerobic gymnastics athletes and randomly divides them into experimental and control groups. The experiment was conducted over eight weeks. The experimental group adopted systematic core strength training methods, and the control group continued with traditional conventional strength training methods. Volunteers were tested for physical fitness before and after the experiment.

In the particular case of strongly correlated electron systems, numerical techniques are quite limited, since conventional approaches rely on calculating a response functon(Kramers-Heisenberg formula) that is obtained from a perturbative analysis of scattering processes in the frequency domain. This requires a knowledge of a full set of eigenstates in order to account for all intermediate processes away from equilibrium, limiting the applicability to small tractable systems. In this work, we present an alternative paradigm, recasting the problem in the time domain and explicitly solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation without the limitations of perturbation theory: a faithful simulation of the scattering processes taking place in actual experiments, including photons and core electrons. We show how this approach can yield the full time and momentum resolved Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) spectrum of strongly interacting many-body systems. We demonstrate the formalism with an application to Mott insulating Hubbard chains using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method, which does not require a priory knowledge of the eigenstates and can solve very large systems with dozens of orbitals. This approach can readily be applied to systems out of equilibrium without modification and generalized to other spectroscopies.</jats:p>"

Here we present nf-core/hgtseq, to facilitate the analysis of HGT from sequencing data in different organisms. We showcase its performance by analysing six exome datasets from five mammals. Hgtseq can be run seamlessly in any computing environment and accepts data generated by existing exome and whole-genome sequencing projects: this will enable researchers to expand their analyses into this area. Fundamental questions are still open, about the mechanisms and the extent or the role of horizontal gene transfer: by releasing hgtseq we provide a standardised tool which will enable a systematic investigation of this phenomenon, thus paving the way for a better understanding of HGT.</jats:p>"

Formation damage refers to the extent of damage reservoir rocks face from various drilling techniques and/or chemical treatment during well completion. A dynamic filtration test was used to investigate this effect using distinct core samples, brine concentrations and preformed particle gels. The effect of high pressures applied on the particle gels on various core samples with various permeability ranges was determined. These gels were pushed into the core holder with samples and the core permeability change was calculated. Different constant pressures were used to push the piston behind the gel samples. Then, the gel was flown around the core sample and collected in the outlet container. Various hardware was used to tighten the apparatus and provide connection between brine source, syringe pump, piston accumulator, core holder, and flow outlet container. The damage on the core was evaluated by comparing the original core permeability and the core permeability after gel treatments. Pressure gauges were used to measure the pressure drop across the core samples. The penetration of the particle gels into the low permeable formations can be decreased by the best selection of gel types, particle sizes, and brine concentrations under the reservoir condition. This work results can be used to select the best gel types for the right reservoir condition such as reservoir permeability, and reservoir pressure.</jats:p>",

However, few academic studies are dedicated to investigating this relationship in young swimmers.  Objective: Verify the association between supplementary physical training focused on the CORE in young swimmers and their athletic performance.  Methods: Randomized controlled study with 20 swimmers (12 males) born post-2000 was made in aquatic training three times a week for six months. The experimental group received a specific exercise protocol with emphasis on the CORE. The physiological comparison of the data considered the total time to complete the 400 and 800-meter freestyle swim.  Results: After six months, the control group obtained a reduction of 2.6s versus 3.2s of the experimental group in the 400-meter freestyle swim; performance in the 800 meters revealed a reduction of 1s for the control group versus 4.5s of the experimental group, compared to the initial measurement.  Conclusion: Supplemental fitness training focused on the CORE in young swimmers is positively associated with improvements in their athletic performance.

Whereas BoDV-1 causes neurological and behavioral disorders, called Borna disease (BD), in a wide range of mammals, its virulence in humans has been debated for several decades. However, a series of case reports in recent years have established the nature of BoDV-1 as a zoonotic pathogen that causes fatal encephalitis in humans. Although many virological properties of BoDV-1 have been revealed to date, the mechanism by which it causes fatal encephalitis in humans remains unclear. In addition, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs that can be used in clinical practice. A reverse genetics approach to generating replication-competent recombinant viruses from full-length cDNA clones is a powerful tool that can be used to not only understand viral properties but also to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs. The rescue of recombinant BoDV-1 (rBoDV-1) was first reported in 2005. However, due to the slow nature of the replication of this virus, the rescue of high-titer rBoDV-1 required several months, limiting the use of this system. This review summarizes the history of the reverse genetics and artificial replication systems for orthobornaviruses and explores the recent progress in efforts to rescue rBoDV-1.</jats:p>"

Barriers to treatment invite novel and innovation solutions, but as these solutions create new treatment delivery models, they also may – purposefully or accidentally – challenge the values of the field.Method: Value-sensitive design methodology is used in this study to identify the values in current hearing healthcare service delivery. We performed qualitative content analysis of questionnaires, clinical practice guidelines, and professional ethics documents that represent the intended and enacted values in audiology. Results: The result is a comprehensive list of values that can be used as a structured codebook for systematic textual analysis of materials representing current best practices in the provision of hearing healthcare services. A secondary result is an analysis of the relative importance of values in audiology, inferred from the frequency of references to each value.Conclusions: Subjective benefit, professional duties, and self-efficacy were the core values identified in the current provision of audiologic care, and these values should be central to considerations for new hearing healthcare models and technologies.</p>"

The chapter also contains a methodology section, which discusses how to avoid what it terms the ‘metaphor mistake’ in conversations between philosophy and cognitive science. Finally, Hieronymi’s discussion of the notion of reflective control is introduced, and it is shown how this notion easily brings together the two incompatible notions of epistemic agency.</jats:p>",

Through duplication and loss of genes, mammals evolved the species-specific variety of UGT isoforms. Among mammals, Carnivora is one of the orders that includes various carnivorous species, yet there is huge variation of food habitat. Recently, lower activity of UGT1A and 2B were shown in Felidae and pinnipeds, suggesting evolutional loss of these isoforms. However, comprehensive analysis for genetic or evolutional features are still missing. This study was conducted to reveal evolutional history of UGTs in Carnivoran species. We found specific gene expansion of UGT1As in Canidae, brown bear and black bear. We also found similar genetic duplication in UGT2Bs in Canidae, and some Mustelidae and Ursidae. In addition, we discovered contraction or complete loss of UGT1A7–12 in phocids, some otariids, felids, and some Mustelids. These studies indicate that even closely related species have completely different evolution of UGTs and further imply the difficulty of extrapolation of the pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetic result of experimental animals into wildlife carnivorans.</jats:p>"

In this work, a vibration analysis of such structures is performed with the use of an anlytical model based on a zig-zag hypothesis. Due to the assumed periodic microstructure, which may occure in any layer of the structure, the initial governing equations describing its dynamic behaviour may contain periodic, non-continuous coefficients. The main aim of the presented paper is to show an analytical solution to the issue of the vibration analysis of the mentioned structures. With the use of the tolerance averaging technique, the initial governing equations are transformed to the form with constant coefficients, which is convenient to solve using well-known mathematical methods. The derived model is a versatile solution for any type of periodically inhomogeneous sandwich plate, including sandwich plates with a honeycomb core. Eventually, in the calculation example, the application of the derived averaged model in the analysis of vibrations of such structures is presented and discussed. The convergence of results of the tolerance model and FEM analysis proves the correctness and superiority of the proposed solution.</jats:p>"

In order to further understand the dynamic process of solitons from a multidimensional perspective, here we report the vectorial solitons nature under two-sets pulse splitting in a single cavity induced by dual-core fiber assisted ultrafast fiber lasers. Owing to the weakly coupled cores in symmetrical dual core fiber (SDCF), two pulse groups interaction are formed in a cavity. By using the dispersive Fourier transformation technique (DFT), it was found that the four-component polarized rotation vector solitons (PRVS) generate. Moreover, gradually increasing the power can obtain the locked soliton bound state in two core space, and the corresponding evolution is similar to that of non-degenerate bright solitons in Bose Einstein condensates (BEC). In addition, by properly controlling the soliton phase offset in SDCF, the soliton rain state of multi pulse evolution can be obtained. The related experimental results would be fruitful to the communities interested in soliton dynamics and frequency comb lasers.</jats:p>"

In this work, we focus on the effect of electrode gap on detection sensitivity. Through comparing the electrode span of 1 µm and 5 µm, our work shows that narrowing the electrode span could greatly improve detection sensitivity. The mechanism underlying the sensitivity improvement was analyzed via numerical simulation. The small electrode gap (1 µm) allows the electric field to concentrate near the detection area, resulting in a high sensitivity for tiny particles. This finding is also verified with the mixture suspension of 1 µm and 3 µm polystyrene beads. As a result, the electrodes with 1 µm gap can detect more 1 µm beads in the suspension than electrodes with 5 µm gap. Additionally, for single yeast cells analysis, it is found that impedance cytometry with 1 µm electrodes gap can easily distinguish budding yeast cells, which cannot be realized by the impedance cytometry with 5 µm electrodes gap. All experimental results support that narrowing the electrode gap is necessary for tiny particle detection, which is an important step in the development of submicron and nanoscale impedance cytometry.</jats:p>"

Development and establishment of new APN roles is a complex process that has resulted from a wide variety of reasons, key component is a lack of a competency map delineation and role evaluation. Currently, however, competence framework has not been compared at an international level. In mainland China, APN have been introduced in some organizations but their competency domains have not yet been clearly defined, this study aimed to identify the core competencies for advanced practice nursing.\nMethods\n This study was performed in two phases: first, in-depth and semistructured individual interviews were carried out followed by a qualitative content analysis, then an item pool of core competencies was constructed by extracting data from the first phase and the results from previous studies, scales and documents; second, a Delphi technique was conducted with the participation of 28 experts from 7 areas of China to form the final core competency framework for advanced practice nursing.\nResults\n Through the qualitative phase, the core competency framework with six domains and 70 items emerged and then entered into the Delphi phase. Twenty-eight of 30 experts finished 2 rounds of Delphi approaches. The final core competencies for advanced practice nursing consisted of six domains, including direct clinical nursing practice, research and evidence-based nursing practice, professional development, organization and management, mentoring and consultation, and ethical/legal practice, with 61 items.\nConclusion\n This core competency framework consisted of six domains with 61 items can be used in competency-based education to cultivate advanced practice nurses as well as competency level assessment.</jats:p>"

Adhering to these standards will have the effect of focusing on the adequacy of proposed core impact measures, with a filter in place to accept only those that meet the standards not only of the physical sciences but also mainstream economics. and health economics. Fortunately, we are well aware of what the criteria for acceptance and rejection of the core impacts within disease states should be in terms of their required attributes and their relevance for supporting evaluable value claims, notably for patient reported outcomes, Rasch or modern measurement theory. Care must be taken to delineate the core impact elements: separately identifying those that are purely clinical from core patient centric impacts, which is turn should be separated from impacts defined in terms of drug utilization and resource utilization. The purpose of this brief commentary is to set out the required standards for core impact patient-centric value claims and the framework for evaluating those claims. The critical issue for patient-centered core impacts is to recognize the constraints imposed by the standards of fundamental measurement for target patient populations within disease areas; unless these constraints are recognized we will fail. The leads to the role of Rasch or modern measurement theory calibration as the framework for patient centric measures of latent traits or attributes. From these perspectives PC-CIS is premature; until we have agreed standards for measurement for the impact or outcomes for clinical, patient-centric and resource utilization as a core set of disease specific instruments, it seems pointless to push forward to a wider scope when the present evidentiary foundation is so weak.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a worldwide pivot of education to online communication and the utilization of diverse digital technologies to enhance global learning and foster cultural understanding. Within higher education, educators faced unprecedented challenges in the conversion of face-to-face interactions into online, virtual classrooms, with many educators unprepared and untrained to do so. Yet, the introduction of online digital technologies for pedagogical interactions expanded the internationalization of previously limited curriculum prospects, to create global interconnectedness with the potential to invoke Students’ awareness and appreciation of cultural differences in communication, leadership, and conflict. The development of international knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and the linkage between the two is key for the internationalization of the curriculum. With the growth of new digital communication, learning opportunities such as Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL), aims to foster the development of intercultural competencies (ICC) in our students for future career advancement in an expanding global community. Despite the acknowledgment that faculty are underprepared and lack pedagogical knowledge to translate their lived experiences into their curriculum, there remains a tenable lack of available tools for educators to facilitate students actively participating in objective, equitable and inclusive intercultural communication. Herein, is proposed the novel application of a conceptual tool, a “content representation” or CoRe matrix, which explicitly separates a particular topic into divergent, yet linked dimensions of the knowledge and skills attributed to its content, teaching, and learning. It was hypothesized the CoRe tool could be applied to enhance an educator’s PCK of ICC, providing the valuable link between international and pedagogical knowledge, for effective internationalization of the curriculum. The novel ICC CoRe matrix successfully addressed the 4 dimensions of ICC demonstrating the robust nature of the application of the CoRe matrix in the development of an educator’s ICC PCK in the COIL classroom. With the exponential increase in digital technologies creating dynamic worldwide networks in education and the workplace, the development of conceptual tools such as the ICC CoRe matrix has the potential to develop and integrate an educator’s pedagogical knowledge with ICC, to support the development of effective, objective and inclusive student participation in global twenty-first-century classrooms and beyond.</jats:p>"

With the proposed method, the operating points of the motors in different conditions during the design process can be predicted in advance with high accuracy. In the study, two different models are developed for efficiency map and core loss estimation of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor design. The developed models use few parameters and predict with high accuracy. Estimation models shorten the design process and offer a less complex model.

Forward modelling assuming a cylindrical shape shows the patch is ~600 km wide, ~20 km high, and its shear velocities are ~25% reduced. The ULVZ is comparable to other broad ULVZs mapped on the core-mantle boundary near Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa.  Strikingly, all four hotspots where the mantle plume appears rooted by these ‘mega-ULVZs’, show similar anomalous isotopic signatures in He, Ne, and W in their ocean island basalts. This correlation suggests mega-ULVZs might be primordial or caused by interaction with the core, and some material from ULVZs is entrained within the plume.

Early man used simple intuition, but through time knowledge increases allowed decision makers (DMs) to move to ‘objectively informed intuition’ (OII). This uses inherent and learnt cognition at both unconscious and conscious levels. A model of business OII is proposed and evaluated using as variables the managers’ personal characteristics and their unique set of objectives. The resultant equation allows assessing decision quality and provides a framework for DMs to work on improvements relative to their objectives. The literature suggests OII stems from a DM’s makeup (business related phenotype), training and experience in a dynamic trio leading to the defining equation. Analyses show business related phenotype is the most important determinant as well as confirming the proposed theory on the determinants of OII success. Practical methods of improving OII are reviewed, and issues worth further investigation outlined. This research is the first encompassing quantitative relationships explaining business OII quality thus enabling improving OII. Suggested further research may refine the equation and expand its core base. This work involves a range of disciplines as different aspects of human characteristics impact on how decisions are made.</jats:p>"

The SRO clusters centered on Fe, Si, or O atoms are strongly intermixed and homogenously distributed throughout the liquid. The atomic structure of the liquid and the fractions of dominant SRO clusters are not sensitive to pressure/temperature used in the simulations except that the SRO of the O-centered clusters is enhanced close to inner core pressures. The O diffusion coefficient is about 2–3 times larger than the Fe and Si ions and increases more rapidly in the deeper core regions.</jats:p>"

Basic outcome sets have ever been established over the previous decade for a few procedures, but not for hiatal hernia repair yet.

The finite difference method has been used to obtain the energy levels and related wave functions of the system within framework effective mass approximation. The results obtained reveal that the number of well, especially the first five values, have a considerable impact on the critical core values of binding energy. It is found that the presence of impurity and the number of wells cause a blue shift in the peak positions of total absorption coefficients. Moreover, our results show that these factors have an important effect on the magnitude of optical properties.</jats:p>"

Guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of multiple users as well as reducing the operating costs of CDCs are major problems that need to be solved. To solve these problems, this paper establishes a cost model based on multi-core hosts in CDCs, which comprehensively consider the hosts’ energy costs, virtual machine (VM) migration costs, and service level agreement violation (SLAV) penalty costs. To optimize the goal, we design the following solution. We employ a DAE-based filter to preprocess the VM historical workload and use an SRU-based method to predict the computing resource usage of the VMs in future periods. Based on the predicted results, we trigger VM migrations before the hosts move into the overloaded state to reduce the occurrence of SLAV. A multi-core-aware heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the placement problem. Simulations driven by the VM real workload dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared with the existing baseline methods, our proposed method reduces the total operating cost by 20.9~34.4%.</jats:p>"

It is found that interface modulation can not only reduce the lattice mismatch to optimize the band alignment, but also participate in the carrier transport for enhancing mobility.

Autonomous cognitive agents are the technological basis for building such systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. This paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of some functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition. We have developed a numerical method for modeling cognitive activities present at an early stage of ontogenesis. The method was used for the creation of the Cognitive Sensory System.</jats:p>",

This lesson plus the inclusion of technology in continental, national, and university policies and strategic plans implicate significant technology integration, especially blended learning, in higher education in the post-pandemic era. However, there lacks sound theoretical frameworks to adequately explain success indicators and success factors in blended learning. Existing frameworks provided particulars about the impacts of blended learning within certain contexts; none provided a comprehensive analysis of the significant factors that transcend specific application contexts. Moreover, the frameworks did not offer clear conceptions of knowledge, teaching, learning, and technology and its role in learning. To better inform successful blended learning adoption, this study problematizes success indicators and success factors based on a configurative review of existing frameworks and emerging theoretical perspectives in higher education. A holistic conceptual framework that transcends context specificity is proposed to better inform policy making, instructional design, and teaching and learning. Conceptions of adaptive policy, policy as learning design, and policy as practice are found relevant for blended learning policy making and analysis in higher education.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, a total of 501 physicians agreed to answer the questionnaire and working in designated military hospitals and military primary care examination centers and residents at Ankara University Faculty of Medicine Hospital were included in the study. The data were collected by the researcher by face-to-face interviews with the participants between 10 March 2016 and 30 June 2016. The scores of the physicians regarding the basic medical practices were collected under six main topics and compared with the minimum levels described in NCC-2014. As a result of the study, 161 (32.1%) participants were adequate in “history taking” applications, 78 (15.6%) participants were adequate in “recording, reporting and notification”, 72 (14.4%) participants were competent in “preventive medicine and community medicine practice”, 62 (12.4%) participants were competent in “interventional and noninterventional practice”, 26 (5.2%) participants were competent in “laboratory tests and other related procedures”, and 25 (5.0%) participants were competent in “general and problem focused physical examinations”. It has been determined that physicians do not receive adequate training in the medical faculty, especially in the field of forensic medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. Curriculum programs should be prepared that will include measures for the development of all application areas, especially the practices determined under the heading of “general and problem focused physical examinations” and “laboratory tests and other related procedures”, where the participants have the lowest proficiency.</jats:p>"

We focus on work by Indigenous artists in which plants are encountered not only as raw material or as aesthetic resource but as ingenious agents and insightful teachers whose pedagogical and creative inputs are welcomed into the filmmaking process.

At 12 weeks isolated spines were assessed for fusion and bone formation by palpation, biomechanical testing [four-point bending stiffness, moment to failure in extension, and in vitro angular displacement (IVAD)], faxitron x-rays, microCT, and histology. Progressive loss of NIAD occurred in only the HT group (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), and biomechanical tests correlated with the NIAD results.

An essential requirement for the successful use of nanoparticles in biomedical applications is their low toxicity. Therefore, toxicological profiling is necessary to understand the mechanism of nanoparticles. The current study aimed to assess the toxicological potential of CuO/ZnO core/shell nanoparticles with a size of 30 nm in Albino female rats. In vivo toxicity was evaluated by oral administration of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 (mg/L) of CuO/ZnO core/shell nanoparticles to a female rate for 30 consecutive days. The toxicological evaluation revealed significant (p &lt; 0.01) alteration in white blood cells (WBC) at a 5 (mg/L) dose. Also, increase in red blood cells (RBC) at 5, 10 (mg/L) doses, while hemoglobin (Hb) levels and hematocrit (HCT) increased at all doses. This maybe indicates that the CuO/ZnO core/shell nanoparticles stimulated the rate of blood corpuscle generation. The anaemia diagnostic indices (mean corpuscular volume MCV and mean corpuscular haemoglobin MCH) remained unchanged throughout the experiment for all the doses tested 5, 10, 20, and 40 (mg/L). Significant (p &lt; 0.01) growth retardation in all groups treated due to rats' infection by <italic>Hyperthyroidism</italic> induced by thyroxine (T4) level increase.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The wave propagation and power deposition inside and outside the blue-core helicon plasma are computed, together with their transitional behaviours prior to and after the blue-core formation. Computations refer to the experiments on the CSDX (controlled shear decorrelation experiment) (Thakur et al., Plasma Sources Science and Technology 23: 044,006, 2014 and Thakur et al., IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science 43: 2754–2759, 2015). It is found that the radial profile of wave electric field peaks off-axis during the blue-core formation, and the location of this peak is very close to that of particle transport barrier observed in experiment; the radial profile of wave magnetic field shows multiple radial modes inside the blue-core column, which is consistent with the experimental observation of coherent high <jats:italic>m</jats:italic> modes through Bessel function. The axial profiles of wave field indicate that the decay length shortens for increased external field strength, especially when the blue-core mode has been achieved, and this length is relatively longer inside the core than that outside. The wave energy density is overall lower in two orders after blue-core formation than that prior to, and the energy distribution shows a periodic boundary layer near the edge of blue-core column. The dispersion relation inside the blue-core column suggests the presence of two radial modes, while outside the blue-core column it shows no variation, i.e. constant wave number with changed frequency. The power deposition appears to be off-axis in the radial direction, forming a hollow profile, and when the blue-core mode has been formed it shows periodic structure in the axial direction. Analyses based on the step-like function theory and introduced blue-core constant provide consistent results and more physics understanding. These details of wave propagation and power deposition during the blue-core formation are presented for the first time, and helpful for understanding the mechanism of blue-core phenomenon. The equivalence of blue-core plasma column to optical fiber for electromagnetic communication is also explored, and preliminary calculation shows that total reflection can indeed occur if the incident angle is larger than a threshold value. This may inspire a novel application of helicon plasma, and is one of the most interesting findings of present work.</jats:p>"

In this presentation, a novel approach to production of CuO|CuFe2O4 core-shell structure by thermal conversion of CuFe Prussian Blue Analogues will be demonstrated. It represents a new family of photocatalysts that can be used as photoelectrodes able to produce hydrogen under broad spectrum of the visible light. The outstanding photoelectrochemical properties of the photocathodes of CuO|CuFe2O4 have been studied with use of combinatory photo-electrochemical instrumental techniques which proved the electrodes were stable over the whole water photolysis run under relatively positive potentials. Their outstanding performance have been explained by coupling of two charge transfer mechanisms occurring in core-shell architectures. Then, the CuO:Zn nanostructures, in which the photoelectrochemical properties were governed by Fermi level pinning of Zn ions would be presented as well. The implementation of Zn ions enlarged the space charge region and triggered electron availability for the photolysis of water which is unusual for p-type semiconductors. Furthermore, the excellent crystallinity, high surface area, and adhesion to the FTO remarkably improved the photocatalytic activity of the CuO:Zn thin film with cathodic photocurrent of 4 mAcm-2 and a quantum efficiency of 35%, making it promising for hydrogen production.    </jats:p>",

In proton-proton collisions, this represents a challenging\ntask since extracting such information from experimental data is not\nstraightforward. With this in mind, we propose to tackle this problem by\nstudying the production of one hadron and a direct photon in\nproton-proton collisions, including up to Next-to-Leading Order Quantum\nChromodynamics and Leading-Order Quantum Electrodynamics corrections.\nUsing Monte-Carlo integration, we simulate the collisions and analyze\nthe events to determine the correlations among measurable and partonic\nquantities. Then, we use these results to feed three different Machine\nLearning algorithms that allow us to find the momentum fractions of the\npartons involved in the process, in terms of suitable combinations of\nthe final state momenta. Our results are compatible with previous\nfindings and suggest a powerful application of Machine-Learning to model\nhigh-energy collisions at the partonic-level with high-precision.</jats:p>"

Data for this study were derived through the use of questionnaire administered on 476 houses samples of household heass selected using systematic random sampling. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized for this study. Findings established that the majority of the buildings was built more than 30 years ago in the study area. Also, the study revealed that most of the respondents earned less than #15,000 (less than $30) monthly while only few earned more than #15,000. The paper concluded that in urban renewal endeavors, there is need for planners to take into consideration the various socioeconomic and socio-cultural encumbrances if affected people will be meaningfully catered for.</jats:p>",

The core ontology is the basis for the development of domain and application ontologies, which create conditions for the system solution for the complex problems of operating industrial equipment. It consists of an ontological classification of core concepts according to the fundamental basic formal ontology. The essences of BFO were specified and revealed by methods of decomposition and generalization according to generally accepted structures of industrial enterprises. The proposed ontology contains 33 classes, 7 object properties and 34 individuals. The ontology is conceptually transparent and semantically clear, so it is suitable for theoretical knowledge transfer, sharing and retrieval. The ontology is implemented in the OWL language and validated. This article provides examples of requests for work with ontology, which prove the effectiveness of its use in industrial enterprises.</jats:p>"

Further, thermal, chemical and mechanical properties of the prepared materials were studied with Fourier transform‐infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X‐ray diffraction (XRD), tensile measurements, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Finally, fire retardant properties of the prepared nanofibers were studied by inclined flammability and limited oxygen index (LOI) testing.

Partnering for justice must be a conversation, a work in progress, and a critical examination that leads to intentional and careful forward movement. It is a beautiful effort at flattening power hierarchies so diverse voices and expertise can be interwoven in service of youth and communities who have been invisibilized and marginalized. Committed to realizing new, hope‐filled futures, the three pairs of authors use their experiences and expertise to shed light on the work of partnering using a temporal lens: considerations related to the beginnings, middles, and endings of partnering, each of which requires special intentionality and care. Together the authors share core overlapping tenets with other critical scholars that could be considered a partnering for justice epistemology. This epistemology underscores how importantly different <jats:italic>learning through partnering for justice</jats:italic> is from traditional notions of academic research.

Many countries introduce digital interventions to their health systems to improve their populations’ health and make access to health care more accessible. Despite multiple definitions for digital public health and the development of different digital interventions, no study has analysed whether the used technologies fit the definition and the core characteristics of digital public health interventions. Digital public health for us means using digital tools to achieve public health goals. We conducted a scoping review to map the characteristics of digital public health interventions, see how the understanding of specific interventions differs between countries, and how they fit in the theoretical framework of digital public health definitions. Our review is the first to display the landscape of worldwide existing digital public health interventions that use information- and communication technologies. The study’s protocol was published in March 2022 in JMIR Research Protocols (DOI 10.2196/33404). We searched five databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Ieee, and ACM) for publications. Given the broad search string, we retrieved 13,869 results screened for eligibility. A total of 1,429 publications were included for full-text screening. The study showed that the terms for specific interventions are related to the context in which they are used. Scandinavian countries displayed a different understanding of electronic health records (EHRs) than South American countries. We also identified that the separation between digital health and digital public health is blurry in praxis. Although interventions such as EHRs target individuals to improve their health, the collected data can also be pooled to allow research and the development of interventions on a public health level.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Key messages</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>• When comparing interventions internationally, it’s best to compare based on the characteristics of the intervention rather than on the name.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>• Although, in theory, the distinguishment between digital health, digital public health, and public health became more precise in recent years, the practical reality between them remains still blurry.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The dynamical properties of the spin and orbital angular momentums are determined by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light. In addition to optical vortex beams possessing spatial polarization and phase singularities, optical fibers can be used to generate and propagate optical modes with the orbital and spin parts of the angular momentum. In this paper, using the example of hollow-core fibers, we demonstrate the fact that their leaky air core modes also have an orbital part of AM in the case of circular polarization arising from the spin–orbit interaction of the air core modes. The reason for the appearance of AM is the leakage of the air core mode energy.</jats:p>"

In the digital age, e-maintenance platforms can interoperate technically but fail to achieve semantic interoperability. The results are ambiguities and misunderstandings that can lead to equipment shutdowns or inefficient use of material resources. However, as formal knowledge specifications, ontologies have successfully integrated heterogeneous systems for some time. Therefore, the authors developed a core industrial maintenance ontology that is both generic and capable of extending and refining to meet semantic information repository requirements. Ontologies can unite and merge different datasets without adapting new ontologies. Only the core ontology needs to be modified according to the new semantics. A detailed description of the development process is provided, beginning with the definition of requirements and ending with the evaluation.</p>",

Techniques such as<jats:italic>k-</jats:italic>mer minimisers (MinHash), have been developed and are often accurate approximations of distances based on full<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer sets. These and other alignment-free methods avoid the large temporal and computational expense of alignment or mapping. However, these<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer set comparisons are not entirely accurate within-species and can be completely inaccurate within-lineage. This is due, in part, to their inability to distinguish core polymorphism from accessory differences. Here we present a new approach,<jats:italic>KmerAperture</jats:italic>, which uses information on the<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer relative genomic positions to determine the type of polymorphism causing differences in<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer presence and absence between pairs of genomes.

Cholesterol and oxysterols synthesized de novo in immune cells and stroma cells are involved in immune homeostasis, which may also be influenced by an excess intake of dietary cholesterol. Dietary compounds such as β-glucan, plant sterols/stanols, omega-3 lipids, polyphenols, and soy proteins, could lower blood cholesterol levels by interfering with cholesterol absorption and metabolism.

These genes encode the uncharacterized/ hypothetical and conserved proteins. <jats:italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</jats:italic>, a gram negative bacterium causes scrub typhus disease in humans, contains approximately 20% of these proteins which have yet to be annotated. So in the present study, out of 292 hypothetical proteins were chosen to characterize and annotate by using different in silico techniques such as ExPASy ProtParam, VirulentPred, PSROTb, Pfam, InterproScan, PSIPred, SWISS_MODEL, CASTp and STRING. The comparative proteomics analysis revealed that, the protein which are stable, cytoplasmic and virulent, it is non homologous to human genome but essential for the function of the organism. The annotation of these proteins may disclose new information about the pathogen. The actual function of the protein will completely understand by experimental analysis. Prediction of the structure and function of this hypothetical protein should help researchers to uncover and better understand the function of <jats:italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</jats:italic>, leading to the discovery of new drug targets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lithofacies classification is a fundamental step to perform depositional and reservoir characterizations in the subsurface. However, such a classification is often hindered by limited data availability and biased and time-consuming analysis. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of image-based supervised deep learning analysis, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to optimize lithofacies classification and interpretation using core images. While most works have used transfer learning to overcome limited datasets and simultaneously yield a high-accuracy prediction. This method raises some serious concerns regarding how the CNN model learns and makes a prediction as the model was originally trained with entirely different datasets. Here, we proposed an alternative approach by adopting a vision transformer model, known as<jats:italic>FaciesViT</jats:italic>, to mitigate this issue and provide improved lithofacies prediction. We also experimented with various CNN architectures as the baseline models and two different datasets to compare and evaluate the performance of our proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed models significantly outperform the established CNN architecture models for both datasets and in all cases, achieving an f1 score and weighted average in all tested metrics of 95%. For the first time, this study highlights the application of the Vision Transformer model to a geological dataset. Our findings show that the FaciesViT model has several advantages over conventional CNN models, including (i) no hyperparameter fine-tuning and exhaustive data augmentation required to match the accuracy of CNN models; (ii) it can work with limited datasets; and (iii) it can better generalize the classification to a new, unseen dataset. Our study shows that the application of the Vision transformer could further optimize image recognition and classification in the geosciences and mitigate some of the issues related to the generalizability and the explainability of deep learning models. Furthermore, the implementation of our proposed<jats:italic>FaciesViT</jats:italic>model has been shown to improve the overall performance and reproducibility of image-based core lithofacies classification which is significant for subsurface reservoir characterization in different basins worldwide.</jats:p>"

These core-shell nanocatalysts are known to exhibit better mass activity than their monolithic counterparts. In this context, tuning the core can result in a change in both mechanical and geometrical properties, and in turn, can influence the stability. Specifically, designing an interface with surface stresses that makes the structure of the nanostructured catalysts resistant to dissolution would be pivotal towards achieving enhanced durability in PEFC systems. The lattice mismatch between the core and shell is a key intrinsic parameter that governs a transition towards a thermodynamically metastable state. In this work, the mesoscale underpinnings of such metastability on the underlying electro-chemo-mechanical coupling and the resulting influence on degradation-performance interactions will be analyzed. Further, the role of molar volumes and elastic moduli of such core-shell pairs on the evolution of stress states and degradation landscape will be investigated. Design criteria including the influence of shell thickness in protecting against degradation will be delineated.    </jats:p>",

Particularly, the Pt-Co and Pt-Ni core-shell catalysts are considered promising materials for broad deployment to fuel cell systems, even after the shift of focus from light-duty vehicle (LDV) to heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) applications. Nevertheless, there are still various issues that need to be clearly addressed for the advanced core-shell catalysts. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic enhancement must still be necessary.

Increasing seismological observations make the understanding of the mineralogy and mechanism for the complex IC texture extremely challenging, and the driving force for the anisotropic texture remains unclear16-18. Under IC conditions, hydrogen becomes highly diffusive like liquid in the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) solid Fe lattice, which is known as the superionic state.19,20. Here, we reveal that H-ion diffusion in superionic Fe-H alloy is anisotropic with the lowest barrier energy along the c-axis. In the presence of external electric field, the alignment of the Fe-H lattice with the c-axis pointing to the field direction is energetically favourable. Due to this effect, Fe-H alloys are aligned with the c-axis parallel to the equatorial plane by the diffusion of the north–south dipole geomagnetic field into the inner core. The aligned texture driven by the geomagnetic field presents significant seismic anisotropy, which explains the anisotropic seismic velocities in the IC, suggesting a strong coupling between the IC structure and geomagnetic field.</jats:p>"

During 2020, the United States experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and a highly contentious political election, both of which have the potential to disrupt core beliefs and evoke perceptions of PTG. Post-traumatic growth, core belief disruption, perceived social support from humans and pets, coping strategies, and stressful events were assessed in 201 participants from the United States (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>age</jats:italic></jats:sub>: 35.39, <jats:italic>SD</jats:italic>: 14.60) at four time points from April 2020 (T1) until April 2021 (T4). While total PTG did not significantly change from Time 1 to Time 4, perceptions of personal strength and new possibilities increased, as did core belief disruption, and the use of coping strategies decreased. Higher PTG was reported by those who owned pets, those who knew someone who had been hospitalized due to COVID-19, and those who knew someone who had died of COVID-19. While rating COVID-19 or politics as the most stressful event at Time 4 did not correspond to differences in PTG, those who perceived the event to be resolved had higher PTG than those who perceived the event to be ongoing. Having COVID-19 personally and vaccination status was not associated with differences in Post-traumatic Growth. PTG at Time 4 was predicted by core belief disruption and social support in the full sample and in the pet owners only sample, and by support from video conferencing for the full sample only. Time 4 PTG was also predicted by core belief disruption, problem-focused coping, and avoidance coping. Results are discussed in terms of the PTG theoretical model. Additionally, implications for interventions aimed at fostering psychological growth, including through non-traditional forms of social support (i.e., remote communication and perceived support from pets) are addressed.</jats:p>"

NA has central roles in metal nutrition and metal homeostasis of flowering plants. Despite the availability of crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial NAS-like proteins that carry out simpler aminobutanoyltransferase reactions, the enzymatic function of NAS remains poorly understood. Here we report amino acids essential for the activity of AtNAS1 based on structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. An enzyme-coupled continuous activity assay allowed us to compare differing NAS proteins identified through multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. In most class Ia and b NAS proteins of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous angiosperm plants, respectively, the core-NAS domain is fused to a variable C-terminal domain. Compared to fungal and moss NAS (class III) that consist merely of the core-NAS domain, NA biosynthetic activities of the four paralogous Arabidopsis NAS proteins were far lower. Yet their C-terminally trimmed core-NAS variants exhibited strongly elevated activities. Out of 320 amino acids of AtNAS1, twelve, 287-TRGCMFMPCNCS-298, accounted for the auto-inhibitory effect of the C-terminus, with approximately one third contributed by N296 within a CNCS motif that is conserved in Arabidopsis. No detectable NA biosynthesis was mediated by two representatives of groups of plant NAS proteins that naturally lack the C-terminal domain, class Ia<jats:italic>Arabidopsis halleri</jats:italic>NAS5, and<jats:italic>Medicago truncatula</jats:italic>NAS2 of class II which is found in dicots and diverged early during the evolution of flowering plants.

The two zero dispersion wavelength shifts toward the visible region, and it's clear that Soliton's intensity at the second zero dispersion point is around 10% to 25% of its maximum. These peaks are further subdivided into low amplitude dispersive waves depending on the liquid core used at the anomalous region of the fiber. When a soliton approaches the second point of zero dispersion, the refractive index rises. A broadband continuum named \"supercontinuum\" will emerge as a result of soliton fission, dispersive wave radiation, and soliton self-frequency shifting. This type of expansion is important in many modern applications, such as medical, industry, and communication systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The actual process of using a resin to glue can optimize many shortcomings in the basic traditional process of welding a motor core. For example, the use of a resin for gluing can lead to a reduction in iron loss, improve rigidity, reduce processing times, and improve product quality. When using a gluing method, the biggest challenge is the distribution of the resin; therefore, resin distribution is very much important. This experiment used fine mesh nets to eventually improve the unbalanced state of resin distribution. In this research, in order to predict real flow behavior during gluing, computer-aided engineering was used for computer simulation. The results of the simulation showed that the illustrated trend of the filling process was very much similar to the actual experimental results. The simulation results could mostly predict defects and make effective improvements, which can lead to a significant reduction in the money and time spent on experiments. The simulation results of the dipping process also showed that the distribution of resin with fine mesh nets was more even than without fine mesh nets. Fine mesh nets can eventually improve an over-flow problem, which, ultimately, causes bumps. In this research, a simulation analysis of the gluing process of a motor core with fine mesh nets was conducted, and the results show that the resin distribution and the flow front of the runner were more even than those without fine mesh nets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene are associated with increased risk for late-onset AD. Genetic loss of or decreased TREM2 function impairs the microglial response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, resulting in more diffuse Aβ plaques and increased peri-plaque neuritic dystrophy and AD-tau seeding. Thus, microglia and TREM2 are at a critical intersection of Aβ and tau pathologies in AD. Since genetically decreasing TREM2 function increases Aβ-induced tau seeding, we hypothesized that chronically increasing TREM2 signaling would decrease amyloid-induced tau-seeding and spreading. Using a mouse model of amyloidosis in which AD-tau is injected into the brain to induce Aβ-dependent tau seeding/spreading, we found that chronic administration of an activating TREM2 antibody increases peri-plaque microglial activation but surprisingly increases peri-plaque NP-tau pathology and neuritic dystrophy, without altering Aβ plaque burden. Our data suggest that sustained microglial activation through TREM2 that does not result in strong amyloid removal may exacerbate Aβ-induced tau pathology, which may have important clinical implications.</jats:p>",

A liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) offers a combined solution with both high flexibility and thermal conductivity to heat dissipation of wearable electronics. But the potential leakage of the liquid metal (LM) in LMEE under external force severely limits the application of LMEE in the field of flexible thermal management. Inspired by a traditional Chinese snack, \"fried milk\", we herein modify the two-dimensional boron nitride (BN) by thiolation, so as to develop LM@BN core-shell particles through the formation of a protective layer around micron-sized LM particles using thiol-metal interactions, before the flexible thermal management material with high stability is finally prepared by the combination between the LM@BN particles and a silicone rubber elastomer. The results demonstrated that the LM@BN core-shell structure can effectively maintain the balance between the tensile property, the thermal conductivity, and the stability of the material, thereby facilitating the future application of LM-elastomer composites with regard to flexible thermal management and thermal interface materials.</jats:p>"

The current review work focused on different types of core designs, such as truss, foam, corrugated, honeycomb, derivative, hybrid, hollow, hierarchical, gradient, folded, and smart core along with different composite materials accessible for face sheet fabrication, including fiber-reinforced composite, metal matrix composite, and polymer matrix composite are considered. The joining method plays a major role for the performance evolution of sandwich structures, which were also investigated. Further discussions are aligned to address major challenges in the fabrication of sandwich structures and further enlighten the future direction of the advanced composite sandwich structure.

We show that the rapidly rotating convection dynamics in free‐surface paraboloidal annuli are similar those in planetary spherical shell geometries. Three experimental cases are carried out, respectively, at 35 revolutions per minute (rpm), 50 and 60 rpm. Thermal Rossby waves are detected in full disk thermographic images of the fluid's free surface. Ultrasonic flow velocity measurements reveal the presence of multiple azimuthal (zonal) jets, with successively more jets forming in higher rotation rate cases. The jets' cylindrical radial extent is well approximated by the Rhines scale. Over time, the zonal jets migrate to larger radial position with migration rates in good agreement with prior theoretical estimates. Our results suggest that planetary core rotating convection will be comprised of flow structures found in other turbulent geophysical fluid dynamical systems: convective turbulence dominates the small‐scale flow field, and also act to flux energy into larger‐scale, slowly evolving zonal flow structures. How the ambient magnetic fields in planetary core settings affect such turbulent flows remains an open question.</jats:p>",

Here, carbon dioxide (CO2) is stored in a reservoir formation, overlain by a seal with low permeability and high capillary entry pressure. Understanding CO2 migration through the seal is one of the main components to assess caprock integrity, thereby ensuring safe and long-term CO2 containment and storage. This research is a combined and detailed study of caprock porosity and permeability using core and well log data to overcome a major issue: Coring and logging operation are expensive, and rarely done in caprocks. Drill cuttings, however, are available as byproduct of all drilled wells. By studying the caprock porosity and permeability of a potential CO2 storage site, this study aims to develop porosity/permeability relationships which can be used as input to predict matrix migration and capillary leakage to ensure permanent storage of CO2. In this paper, drill cuttings and core samples, which were obtained from a potential CO2 storage site, went through a series of laboratory measurements to determine porosity and permeability. This includes mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP), unsteady state pulse decay permeability on plug samples, and poro-permeameter measurements on crushed samples. Preliminary results have shown that drill cuttings produce higher porosity and permeability values than core samples. Nevertheless, further analysis is needed to establish relationships and correlations between drill cuttings and core samples. By applying a multi-method approach, resulting in trends for porosity and permeability, we may be able to reduce the operational costs of coring by using drill cuttings as alternatives and at the same time help de-risking CO2 storage projects for wider scale of deployment.</jats:p>",

The inferred density of this CSM is orders of magnitude above that seen around RSGs in the field, and is therefore indicative of a short phase of elevated mass-loss prior to explosion. It is not known over what time-scale this material gets there: is it formed over several decades by a ‘superwind’ with mass-loss rate $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-3}\\, {\\rm M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}}$; or is it formed in less than a year by a brief ‘outburst’ with $\\dot{M}\\sim 10^{-1}\\, {\\rm M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}}$? In this paper, we simulate spectra for RSGs undergoing such mass-loss events, and demonstrate that in either scenario, the CSM suppresses the optical flux by over a factor of 100, and that of the near-IR by a factor of 10. We argue that the ‘superwind’ model can be excluded as it causes the progenitor to be heavily obscured for decades before explosion, and is strongly at odds with observations of II-P progenitors taken within 10 yr of core-collapse. Instead, our results favour abrupt outbursts &amp;lt; 1 yr before explosion as the explanation for the early optical radiation of II-P SNe. We therefore predict that RSGs will undergo dramatic photometric variability in the optical and infrared in the weeks-to-months before core-collapse.</jats:p>",

A nested multiple hollow-core anti-resonant fiber (NMH-ARF) has significant potential for applications in MDM. This study proposes a novel NMH-ARF with its structural design based on the traditional single-core nested anti-resonant fiber. We increased the number of nodes between capillaries. By changing the position of the nested tubes, several interconnected areas form when a single core is separated. We investigated the mode-coupling theory and transmission characteristics of this fiber. This fiber structure showed a low sensitivity to bending and achieved a super-low DGD and a super-low confinement loss (CL) at a wavelength of 1.55 µm while keeping CD relatively low.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tSi–based quantum dots (QDs) have attracted much attention as an active element in Si-based optoelectronic applications because their light emission properties due to carrier confinement have potential to combine photonic processing with electronic processing on a single chip. We have focused on CVD formation and characterization of Si-QDs with Ge core and reported their photoluminescence (PL) properties attributable to type II energy-band alignment between the Ge–core and the Si-shell [1-2]. In addition, we have also demonstrated stable electroluminescence in the near–infrared region from diode structures having a 3–fold stacked Si–QDs with Ge core with an areal dot density of ~2.0×10<jats:sup>11</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> under pulsed bias applications [3]. One of the possible ways to enhance the radiative recombination rate and the improve the light emission efficiency is to reduce non–radiative centers and to increase carrier density by impurity doping into the QDs. In this work, in extending our research work to valency-controlled Si–QDs with Ge core, we have studied the effects of boron– and phosphorus–doping to the Ge core on PL properties.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A highly dense layer of Si–QDs with Ge core was formed by controlling thermal decomposition of GeH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and SiH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> alternately on thermally–grown ~2.0 nm–thick SiO<jats:sub>2. </jats:sub>During the Ge deposition, delta doping of boron and phosphorus atoms in QDs was carried out by pulse injection using 1% B<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and 1% PH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> diluted with He, respectively. No changes in dot size and areal dot density with B or P doping were confirmed by AFM topographic images. Under photoexcitation of undoped QDs with a 979–nm line from a semiconductor laser, a broad PL spectrum, which consists of four Gaussian components originating from radiative recombination through quantized states in QDs, were observed in the energy range from 0.62 to 0.85 eV even at room temperature. For the doped QDs, in addition to the four components seen in undoped QDs, relatively-narrow components peaked at ~0.64 eV and ~0.68eV were observed with B-doping and with P-doping to the Ge core, respectively. Notice that, with an increase in B<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> pulse injection from 1 to 4 times, the integrated PL intensity was enhanced by a factor of 1.4 to 2.4 compared to that of the undoped QDs while no significant change in spectral shape was observable. This can be interpreted in terms of an increase in the number of holes with B-doping to the Ge core since the carrier recombination rates is proportional to the product of the number of electrons and holes confined in each of QDs under weak photoexcitation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acknowledgements</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Akio Ohta for his contribution to the measurements.

This study uses a qualitative approach with a case study. Data was collected by online interviews on June-August 2021 and collecting documents. The results show that implementation and metadata development is related to international communities such as ICA and ISO. Analysis of metadata properties shows that metadata and description elements have similarity and different meanings, optional and mandatory elements, multilevel description, application profile that contains 4 ICA standards, inconsistencies metadata value, and did not use subject vocabularies and thesaurus. The metadata obstacle is the lack of archival information from SIKN, harvested archives is just an item, a method for metadata import/export performed manually thus metadata is not up to date in JIKN. Metadata crosswalks produce table of metadata mapping from ISAD (G), Regulatory chief of ANRI 21/2011, ISO 23801, and RiC to Dublin Core. They show the the similarities and differences metadata elements and description that was developing in archival tradition. The study suggests that ANRI adopt Indonesia Onesearch to develop metadata harvesting for SIKN and JIKN. Moreover, ANRI needs to create controlled vocabulary and perform certification for designing SIKN and operating JIKN</jats:p>"

However, the relative distribution of lipids in spermatozoa and the two compartments which supply lipids for spermatogenesis (seminal fluid and blood serum) has not been studied. We hypothesised that altered availability of lipids in blood serum and seminal fluid may affect the lipid composition and progressive motility of sperm. 60 men of age 35 years (median (range 20–45) and BMI 30.4 kg/m2 (24–36.5) under preliminary investigation for subfertility were recruited at an NHS clinic. Men provided samples of serum and semen, subject to strict acceptance criteria, for analysis of spermatozoa count and motility. Blood serum (n = 60), spermatozoa (n = 26) and seminal fluid (n = 60) were frozen for batch lipidomics analysis. Spermatozoa and seminal fluid had comparable lipid composition but showed marked differences with the serum lipidome. Spermatozoa demonstrated high abundance of ceramides, very-long-chain fatty acids (C20-22), and certain phospholipids (sphingomyelins, plasmalogens, phosphatidylethanolamines) with low abundance of phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol and triglycerides. Men with spermatozoa of low progressive motility had evidence of fewer concentration gradients for many lipid species between blood serum and spermatozoa compartments. Spermatozoa are abundant in multiple lipid species which are likely to contribute to key cellular functions. Lipid metabolism shows reduced regulation between compartments in men with spermatozoa with reduced progressive motility.</jats:p>"

CdS grows on the TiO2 surface in the form of nanorods, turning the TiO2@CdS composite particles into durian-like structures.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Understanding CO2 migration through the reservoir seal is one of the main challenges in assessing caprock integrity, thereby ensuring safe and long-term CO2 containment and storage. The determination of seal rock properties using core sample analysis or well data is important to predict matrix migration of CO2 to minimise the risk of capillary leakage. However, core samples and continuous well log data of caprock sections are expensive and limited. This issue can potentially be resolved by using cuttings, that are readily available from drilling, with no additional coring cost. However, before drill cuttings can be used as an alternative, rock properties (porosity and permeability) values from drill cuttings must be correlated with rock properties from the preserved core data, for proof-of-concept purposes. In CO2 storage sites, the caprock zone is usually comprised of low permeability mudrocks. Due to the low permeability of caprocks with values &amp;lt;1 microDarcy (10−18 m2) conventional core analysis is insufficient to determine porosity and permeability. We here use helium pycnometry for porosity determination on plugs and mercury porosimetry on cuttings. Meanwhile, the selected methods for permeability determination is an unsteady-state technique for plugs, and pressure decay / GRI method for cuttings, as both methods can measure permeability down to or even below nanoDarcy (10−21 m2). For the proof-of-concept study, we expect a correlation between plug and cuttings permeabilities of R2&amp;gt; 0.8 as indication of success criteria, based on strong effect size from statistics point of view. Using data from literature, permeability and porosity values from core samples match the permeability from cuttings with R2 &amp;gt;0.9. The R2 value for cutting versus plug porosity is 0.95, which is satisfies the success criteria as well. The correlations show that porosity and permeability values from cuttings are comparable to values from plugs and can be used as an approximation for the uncored zone. This proof-of-concept study marks the beginning of a full fledge research study to establish porosity and permeability relationships in caprocks, which can be used as inputs in predicting CO2 matrix migration for safe geological storage of CO2. In addition, this approach can be applied to unconventional oil and gas studies, with potential cost saving from coring operations.</jats:p>",

Although detailed anatomy syllabi have been developed for medical and other health professional students, none are available for training physical therapists. Therefore, the aim of this project was to produce a core musculoskeletal anatomy syllabus specific to physical therapy students, utilizing a modified Delphi approach. An international Delphi panel (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 53) composed of anatomists and clinicians involved in physical therapy education considered a total of 2193 anatomical items arranged in four categories (musculoskeletal concepts; vertebral column; pectoral girdle and upper limb; pelvic girdle and lower limb). Using specific criteria, items were rated on the basis of whether they were considered essential knowledge for a competent physical therapy student, and were categorized as core, recommended, not recommended or not core. Of the 2193 items, 1700 (77.5%) were rated as core or recommended. For musculoskeletal concepts, 70% (233/332) of items were categorized as core/recommended. Approximately 80% of items in the other three categories were considered core/recommended—vertebral column (355/440), pectoral girdle and upper limb (513/657), and pelvic girdle and lower limb (599/764). This project presents a detailed musculoskeletal anatomy syllabus which may be used within a physical therapy curriculum. A key difference compared to published musculoskeletal anatomy syllabi for medical students is that a greater number of items are considered core/recommended (approximately 80% vs. 50%). These findings will now be considered and deliberated in accordance with the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists modified Delphi approach.</jats:p>",

A novel D-shaped negative curvature fiber based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is proposed. The design consists of negative curvature solid core fiber surrounded by a cladding composed of double-layer adjoined airholes. An outside layer of the cladding contains semi-circular airholes, and the interior layer has small circular air holes to overwhelm the higher-order modes. The external sensing approach detects changes in the refractive index between 1.33 and 1.37. Employing gold as a plasmonic material, SPR is developed on top of the photonic crystal fiber (PCF). Between the gold layer and the PCF, a small layer of titanium dioxide is placed for binding the plasmonic material to the fiber. And it acts as an adhesive layer. The finite element method is used to perform numerical analyses. After improving the structural parameters, an enhanced sensitivity of 26 000 nm RIU<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> is achieved. Because of its enhanced sensitivity, this sensor is used in a bio-medical application to detect and prevent diseases in the early stage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, research funding agencies, universities, and governments have become increasingly concerned with promoting the reuse of research datasets. Enabling researchers to evaluate the trustworthiness and fitness-for-use of research datasets produced by others is critical for facilitating the reuse of these datasets. Understanding how researchers make these evaluations is crucial for developing digital infrastructure and tools, such as data repositories and metadata schema, in a way that better supports researchers in making these evaluations. Physical samples such as rocks are critical for generating datasets in many scientific domains. Often, samples are collected on field expeditions conducted by large infrastructural projects. These projects comprise many human and non-human components that affect the quality and integrity of samples. However, little is known about whether and how prospective dataset users evaluate the samples' trustworthiness and sample collection processes underlying these datasets. Researchers‘strategies for evaluating sample trustworthiness are explored through a longitudinal qualitative case study (ethnographic observation, interviews (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 66), and document analysis) of subseafloor biosphere research, an earth sciences domain. Domain researchers use rock samples collected on research cruises conducted by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). Subseafloor biosphere researchers are primarily concerned about samples being compromised by microbiological contamination. Researchers vary regarding the components of IODP infrastructure they consider when evaluating sample trustworthiness. These components include methods to process samples, people handling samples, IODP policies and procedures, and IODP organizational politics. Researchers‘strategies vary according to their disciplinary background, with microbiologists employing more fine-grained judgments about methods; whether researchers have participated in IODP expeditions, with those who have employing more fine-grained judgments about people involved; and whether researchers have ever been involved in organizing cruises or serving on IODP committees, with those who have employing more fine-grained judgments about many aspects of cruises. Researchers who make less complex decisions may be prone to erroneously trusting contaminated samples; researchers who make more complex decisions may be prone to erroneously discarding uncontaminated samples. The paper concludes by considering implications for the design of digital infrastructures to support researchers in evaluating sample trustworthiness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>Preparing pre-service teachers to integrate technology in their future classrooms is a complex endeavor. Several factors known to affect the use of technology in the classroom include technology knowledge and skills, positive attitudes toward integrating technology, pedagogical expertise with technology and content knowledge in one or more disciplines. One strategy that has been used in many educator preparation programs has been to create a course that teaches how to integrate technology. Measuring the impact of these types of courses is important in determining whether they are meeting the needs of the pre-service teachers in their pursuit to integrate technology in a meaningful and effective way. This paper reports on the measurement and alignment of three aspects that impact pre-service technology integration - technology self-efficacy, strategies and experiences provided by the preparation programs, and the intersection of technology, content knowledge and pedagogy. Pre-service participants in a semester-long course focused on integrating technology gained significantly from pre to post on each of the scales, demonstrating an increase in technology self-efficacy, experiences related to technology during their program and confidence in fusing technology, content knowledge and pedagogy. In addition, the three measures focused on different areas of technology integration aligned to show relationships of the attributes important for using technology in their future classrooms.</ns4:p>"

However, the confined nanostructure with poor electronic conductivity inhibits their further enhanced catalytic performance towards OER. Herein, a 3D core-shell LDH structure is synthesized through a facile one-step reaction strategy, in which the terephthalic acid and urea is employed as the organic ligand for the metal organic framework (MOF) precursor and surface coordination buffer between LDH and MOF. Benefiting from the hierarchical 3D microstructure with uniformly nanosheets grown on the surface, the as prepared electrocatalyst exhibits rich edge active sites and enormous electrochemical surface area. The representative sample (namely, CoNi-LDH@BDC) achieves an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 280 mV at 100 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> and robust cyclic stability. In addition, <jats:italic>quasi-operando</jats:italic> studies using X-ray absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further elucidate that the Co-Ni dual metal sites act as the main active site while Ni of high valence state is a favorable site to oxygen for the O-O bond formation.

WHO Prescription indicators are intended to evaluate the services provided to the population concerning the rational use of medicines. The study aims to study prescription practices and rational use of medicines in the department of Internal medicine, using WHO prescribing indicators in a tertiary care teaching institute of national importance. A total of 50 prescriptions were digitally photographed and analysed for prescription practices and rational drug use, using standard WHO core prescribing indicators. A  total of 301 drugs with multiple and diverse diagnoses were used. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 22 version. The average number of drugs per prescription was 3.48%. It was found that only 13.79% of prescriptions have generic names, whereas 27.58% of patient encounters had at least one drug from the National List of Essential Medicine, 6.8% of prescriptions have antibiotics and 0.7% of prescriptions were injections. The number of prescriptions with fixed drug combinations was 27.55%. Indicators such as percentage of the National List of Essential Medicine, fixed drug combinations and prescribing with a generic name are used. Hence, we will suggest regular prescription audit practices and conducting CMEs and training workshops for clinicians for the rational use of medicines in all healthcare settings to succeed in the rational use of medicine.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to explore top pharmacist role model competencies as perceived by pharmacy students of different years of the curriculum.  \nMethods: A newly developed 14-item questionnaire (The Competencies of Role Models in Pharmacy (CRMP) questionnaire) was distributed among 207 pharmacy students and filled out anonymously, and the results obtained were analysed on SPSS 26 software. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check data normality, and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis was utilised to assess the variations in CRMP scores based on the students’ academic year.   \nResults: Teaching skills and professionalism were the most vital attributes selected by pharmacy students, followed by communication skills and laboratory skills. Interestingly, students perceived business and entrepreneurship skills as well as the career status of role models as the least essential competencies. Moreover, notable differences were observed in the overall opinions of students in different academic years, which may be indicative of the dynamic changes in student perspectives as they move forward in their pharmacy programme.    \nConclusion: The competencies of pharmacist role models were assessed and ranked according to their importance as perceived by pharmacy students across different academic years. This information helps gain insight into students’ prioritisation of role model competencies and sheds light on the path toward developing future role model training/assessment programmes to improve the quality of pharmacy education.</jats:p>"

Many descriptions of the diversity of the salivary microbiome have focused on the changes induced by certain diseased states, but the commonalities and differences within healthy saliva have not been fully described. Here, we define and explore the core membership of the human salivary microbial community by collecting and re-analysing raw 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data from 47 studies with 2206 saliva samples. We found 68 core bacterial taxa that were consistently detected. Differences induced by various host intrinsic and behaviour factors, including gender, age, geographic location, tobacco usage and alcohol consumption were evident. The core of the salivary microbiome was verified by collecting and analysing saliva in an independent study. These results suggest that the methods used can effectively define a core microbial community in human saliva. The core salivary microbiome demonstrated both stability and variability among populations. Geographic location was identified as the host factor that is most associated with the structure of salivary microbiota. The independent analysis confirmed the prevalence of the 68 core OTUs we defined from the global data and provides information about how bacterial taxa in saliva varies across human populations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research in mammals has evidenced that proper colonization of the gut by a complex commensal microbial community, the gut microbiota (GM), is critical for animal health and wellbeing. It greatly contributes to the control of infectious processes through competition in the microbial environment while supporting proper immune system development and modulating defence mechanisms at distant organ sites such as the lung: a concept named ‘gut-lung axis’. While recent studies point to a role of the GM in boosting immunity and pathogen resilience also in poultry, the mechanisms underlying this role are largely unknown. In spite of this knowledge gap, GM modulation approaches are today considered as one of the most promising strategies to improve animal health and welfare in commercial poultry production, while coping with the societal demand for responsible, sustainable and profitable farming systems. The majority of pathogens causing economically important infectious diseases in poultry are targeting the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of the GM in the development and function of the mucosal immune system is crucial for implementing measures to promote animal robustness in commercial poultry production. The importance of early gut colonization in the chicken has been overlooked or neglected in industrial poultry production systems, where chicks are hampered from acquiring a complex GM from the hen. Here we discuss the concept of strengthening mucosal immunity in the chicken through GM modulation approaches favouring immune system development and functioning along the gut-lung axis, which could be put into practice through improved farming systems, early-life GM transfer, feeding strategies and pre-/probiotics. We also provide original data from experiments with germ-free and conventional chickens demonstrating that the gut-lung axis appears to be functional in chickens. These key principles of mucosal immunity are likely to be relevant for a variety of avian diseases and are thus of far-reaching importance for the poultry sector worldwide.</jats:p>"

Developing this class of FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) builds on the work of several years to develop the Knowledge Grid (https://kgrid.org/), which facilitates the development, description and implementation of biomedical knowledge packaged in machine-readable and machine-executable formats (Flynn et al. 2018). Additionally, this work aligns with the goals of the Mobilizing Computable Biomedical Knowledge (MCBK) community (https://mobilizecbk.med.umich.edu/) (Mobilizing Computable Biomedical Knowledge 2018). In this abstract, we describe our work to develop a FDO carrying a computable phenotype.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Defining computable phenotypes</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In biomedical informatics, 'phenotyping' describes a data-driven approach to identifying a group of individuals sharing observable characteristics of interest, generally related to a disease or condition, and a 'computable phenotype' (CP) is a machine-processable expression of a phenotypic pattern of these characteristics (Hripcsak and Albers 2018). </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>For the purposes of this work, we are interested in CPs derived from data contained in electronic health record (EHR) systems. This includes both structured data, e.g. codes for diseases, diagnoses, procedures, or laboratory tests, and unstructured data, e.g. free text including patient histories, clinical observations, discharge summaries, and reports. Thus, we define computable phenotype FDOs (CP-FDOs) as a class of FDO that packages an executable EHR-derived CP together with documentation needed to implement and use it effectively for creating cohorts of individuals with similar observable characteristics from EHR data sets.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Importance of portable and FAIR CPs</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>There is tremendous excitement for using real-world EHR data to discover important findings about human health and well-being. However, for discovery to happen, researchers need mechanisms like CPs to identify study cohorts for analysis. Beginning in the early 2010s, a growing literature explores various methods for the secondary use of EHR data for patient phenotyping to arrive at consistent study cohorts (Shivade et al. 2014, Banda et al. 2018). The heterogeneous nature of EHR data has inspired a wide variety of phenotyping methods, from those which rely solely on documented codes linked to terms in existing vocabularies to those which combine such codes with other concepts extracted from free text using natural language processing.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Our current focus is on packaging CPs inside FDOs for classifying patients as having or not having a phenotype of interest. This can be done within an individual health system, or at scale across a clinical data research network. Using CPs for cohort identification can reduce the time and expense of traditional data set building and clincal trial recruitment, and expand the potential scope of a study population(Boland et al. 2013).</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Creating and validating CPs requires time, resources, and both clinical and technical expertise. One estimate is that it can take 6-10 months to develop and validate a CP (Shang et al. 2019). And, as there is no standard data model within EHRs in the United States, many CPs are designed for performance at a single site, rather than for portability, which is understood as the ability to implement a phenotype at a different site with similar performance (Shang et al. 2019). While portability is increasingly recognized as an important element of phenotyping, and there have been recent efforts to develop more portable CPs, many of these processes still require significant technical expertise at the implementation site to adapt the phenotype for use on local data.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>There may also be significant advantages to making CPs FAIR. These include transparency in cohort selection, and better generalizability of results. FAIR CPs may also increase the potential for robust comparisons of data from related studies, leading to better evidence synthesis to improve delivery of care and ultimately human health.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Defining a new class of FDOs to hold and convey CPs</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We believe that packaging validated CPs inside digital objects may alleviate many of the pressures mentioned above, and contributes to making both the processes and products of clinical research more FAIR. To this end, our current work focuses on packaging a validated CP inside a machine-processable FDO. The phenotype of interest identifies pediatric and adult patients with a rare disease (Oliverio et al. 2021), and has several features which make it ideal for transformation to an executable FDO. First, the phenotype utilizes standards to define the clinical characteristics of interest, and is based on a common data model; these features increase the potential for both interoperability and reuse. Additionally, because the phenotype has been validated across three sites, its portability has already been demonstrated. Finally, the full computable phenotype has been shared as a series of SQL queries, including scripts for patient identification, deriving statistics, and validation, which have been annotated with instructions for implementation at other sites.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The goals of this work are: </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:list>\n              <jats:list-item>\n                <jats:p>To develop CPs as executable DOs, leveraging previous work to develop executable Knowledge Objects (KO) (Flynn et al. 2018)</jats:p>\n              </jats:list-item>\n              <jats:list-item>\n                <jats:p>To advance our understanding of how to define computable phenotypes as a class of FDO, including what is needed to meet the requirements of binding, abstraction, and encapsulation (Wittenburg et al. 2019)</jats:p>\n              </jats:list-item>\n            </jats:list>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>To develop CPs as executable DOs, leveraging previous work to develop executable Knowledge Objects (KO) (Flynn et al. 2018)</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>To advance our understanding of how to define computable phenotypes as a class of FDO, including what is needed to meet the requirements of binding, abstraction, and encapsulation (Wittenburg et al. 2019)</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Computable phenotypes, packaged as FDOs, may increase the potential both for the portability of a phenotype and the reusability of data resulting from its implementation.

Lessons learned from this process will increase our understanding of both the technical requirements, and how to address necessary components of abstraction, binding, and encapsulation so that these can function as FAIR Digital Objects.</jats:p>"

A sediment core of 39 cm length was grabbed from the deep-sea trench (1540 m depth) southern of Samothrace Island, Aegean Sea. The sediment core was then treated at the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, separated at 1cm increment samples, ranging from 0cm to 39 cm, dried, and milled. A first analysis of the samples was also conducted at HCMR using gamma spectroscopic techniques. Further spectroscopic analysis continued at Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens (NED-NTUA) using an Extended Range Germanium Detector. The following radionuclides were determined 210Pb, 234Th, 226Ra, 228Ra, 228Th, 137Cs and 40K. Additionally, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis was used and the following major and trace elements were identified and quantified: Al, V, La, Sc, Mn, As, Ga, Cr, Zn, Co, Rb, Fe, K, Na and Ce. Based on the analysis of each sample, the vertical distribution of most natural radionuclides showed no significant variation. The vertical distribution of anthropogenic 137Cs was very low and almost constant. Unsupported 210Pb activity was about six times higher than 226Ra, indicating high radon fluxes. Furthermore, neutron activation analysis results indicate that almost all elements are within the expected range based on literature, while K and Na show a slightly increased concentration. For the area, these findings indicate steady and calm sedimentation processes.</jats:p>"

In ideological and political teaching, the common vision of teachers and students is to carry out cooperative exploration and ultimately realize the progress and growth of common teachers and students, and implement the core of political science. Learning community in ideological and political teaching has the characteristics of group symbiosis, common value, cooperation and sharing, and democratic openness. Therefore, building a learning community in ideological and political teaching is conducive to the formation of a new teaching model of cooperative inquiry and the establishment of equality and democracy. The new teacher-student relationship can cultivate students’ higher-order thinking and promote more meaningful learning. It has been proved by practice that it is valuable to construct a learning community in the ideological and political teaching of universities. Teachers and students should change the traditional teaching concept. University political teachers should carefully prepare lessons, set up teaching design, be considerate to students, be close to reality, be close to knowledge itself, enhance the communication and interaction between teachers and students, and students and students, and actively build a learning community in the process of ideological and political teaching. To enable students to get new knowledge, solve challenging problems, and finally achieve progress and growth.</jats:p>",

This paper took a manufacturing company that masters core technology and has strong knowledge creation and spillover capabilities as the core manufacturing company. The core manufacturing company led two resource-complementary manufacturing companies in participating in shared manufacturing, and the additional benefits of each company participating in shared manufacturing were realized. Due to the bounded rational behavior of the participating companies and the difficulty in maximizing each’s own interests, this paper used the evolutionary game method and MATLAB to analyze the influencing factors of shared manufacturing among manufacturing companies. The goal of this study is to understand the decision-making behavior of manufacturing companies in a shared manufacturing context. The research results show that: The initial willingness to share, default losses, and excess income realized by the core manufacturing company as a result of delivering high service levels all contributed to the companies’ willingness to engage in shared production. The companies’ ability to participate in shared manufacturing was negatively impacted by cost-to-income ratio and speculative income. The allocation of additional income had a significant influence on the non-core enterprises’ decision-making: when the distribution ratio of additional income from non-core companies was low, non-core companies would be less willing to share. Although the additional income distribution ratio of core companies were high at the time, the service level of core companies would also decrease due to the reduction of non-core companies’ willingness to share.</jats:p>"

Regarding justice itself, this minimum depends on the key distinction between factual disagreements and those about what distributive justice ought to be. For example, is a free-market economy or one replete with state intervention better suited to the advancement of pluralist maximization with respect to all three facets of constitutional justice? In this context, the pluralist does not seek to maximize plurality but to uncover the best available means to a set goal. In contrast, a normative disagreement between a Nozickian libertarian vision of justice and a radical egalitarian one calls for pluralist accommodation. Pluralistic minima also arise concerning identity and recognition oscillating between the poles of inward retreat and outward lurch. Minima regarding autonomy and solidarity assure a baseline of care and concern among “insiders” within a just constitutional order while refraining from demeaning the dignity of “outsiders” and figure as prerequisites to justice in recognition and in representation. Next, the chapter tackles the dialectical nexus between a minimum of fixed of core constitutional prescriptions and the maximization of plurality consistent with deployment of a pluralist conception of the justice essentials. Finally, the chapter tackles the series of challenges and pathologies that currently stand in the way of a straightforward comprehensively pluralist realization of the justice essentials.</jats:p>",

To clarify these unknown factors, we investigate the effects of human sera on β2m amyloid fibril formation, revealing that sera markedly inhibit amyloid fibril formation. Results from over 100 sera indicate that, although the inhibitory effects of sera deteriorate in long-term dialysis patients, they are ameliorated by maintenance dialysis treatments in the short term. Serum albumin prevents amyloid fibril formation based on macromolecular crowding effects, and decreased serum albumin concentration in dialysis patients is a tertiary risk factor for the onset of DRA. We construct a theoretical model assuming cumulative effects of the three risk factors, suggesting the importance of monitoring temporary and accumulated risks to prevent the development of amyloidosis, which occurs based on supersaturation-limited amyloid fibril formation in a crowded milieu.</jats:p>"

Core in-cup tablets were prepared to achieve a prolonged release of Budesonide and for alleviating the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the pharmacokinetic patterns between an optimized core in cup tablet formulation and pure Budesonide suspension. In-vivo evaluation studies were performed based on the uniform and reliable results of in-vitro drug release studies. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were compared to obtain mean plasma drug concentration curve versus time. The pure drug suspension and Core-in-cup tablets formulation of Budesonide were administered to two groups of white New Zealand rabbits (n=6) through the oral route following cross over design pattern. The drug concentration in plasma samples were measured using LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each formulation. The comparison of the plasma time curves of the dosage forms showed that each dosage form caused significant differences in the drug plasma levels. The optimized core in cup tablet formulation shown some lag phase initially before releasing the drug. The mean residence time of core in cup tablet formulation was found to be more than the pure drug suspension formulation. The oral administration of Budesonide resulted in a low and quite variable AUC of 154.1±1.44 ng/ml/hr., whereas the optimized core-in-cup tablets resulted in AUC of 918.2±3.11 ng/ml/hr. The bioavailability of optimized formulation was enhanced six times compared with pure drug suspension. From the above results, it can be concluded that the prepared core in cup tablet can be considered as one of the promising formulation techniques for chronotherapeutic management of inflammatory bowel disease.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the alarmingly high benign findings in resected kidney masses highlight the need for improved preoperative diagnosis and patient selection.\nMethods: The purpose of this study is to review the success rate of SRM biopsy and to evaluate its impact on patient management.  A total of 168 percutaneous image-guided core needle biopsies (CNBs) of SRMs were retrieved at a tertiary academic center between 2015 and 2019. Subsequent treatment choices, side effects and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed.\nResults: The diagnostic rate of CNB was 86.9%. Benign neoplasms accounted for a significant portion (14.3%) of SRM. Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were the most common diagnoses (69.6%) as expected. In biopsy-resection correlation, the positive predictive value of CNB was 100%. Tumor typing and subtyping by CNB were highly accurate, 100% and 98.3% respectively. Nuclear grading for clear cell RCC was accurate in 83.8% cases.  The CNB results had significant impact on treatment. Most patients with RCCs underwent either resection (54.1%) or ablation (33.9%), in contrast to observation in benign neoplasms (90.5%). Most importantly, the benign resection rate (3.2%) in this series was much lower than the national average.\nConclusion: CNB provided accurate diagnoses for the majority of SRMs and revealed benign diagnoses in a subset of clinically suspicious lesions. Employment of CNB in suspicious SRM may help avoid overtreatment for benign lesions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Adolescence is a developmental period that encompasses, but is not limited to, puberty and continues into early adulthood. During this period, maturation and refinement are observed across brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is critical for cognitive function. Adolescence is also a time when excessive alcohol consumption in the form of binge drinking peaks, increasing the risk of long-term cognitive deficits and the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder later in life. Animal models have revealed that adolescent ethanol (EtOH) exposure results in protracted disruption of neuronal function and performance on PFC-dependent tasks that require higher-order decision-making. However, the role of astrocytes in EtOH-induced disruption of prefrontal cortex-dependent function has yet to be elucidated. Astrocytes have complex morphologies with an extensive network of peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs) that ensheathe pre- and postsynaptic terminals to form the ‘tripartite synapse.’ At the tripartite synapse, astrocytes play several critical roles, including synaptic maintenance, dendritic spine maturation, and neurotransmitter clearance through proximity-dependent interactions. Here, we investigate the effects of adolescent binge EtOH exposure on astrocyte morphology, PAP-synaptic proximity, synaptic stabilization proteins, and dendritic spine morphology in subregions of the PFC that are important in the emergence of higher cognitive function. We found that adolescent binge EtOH exposure resulted in subregion specific changes in astrocyte morphology and astrocyte-neuronal interactions. While this did not correspond to a loss of astrocytes, synapses, or dendritic spines, there was a corresponding region-specific and EtOH-dependent shift in dendritic spine phenotype. Lastly, we found that changes in astrocyte-neuronal interactions were not a consequence of changes in the expression of key synaptic structural proteins neurexin, neuroligin 1, or neuroligin 3. These data demonstrate that adolescent EtOH exposure results in enduring effects on neuron-glia interactions that persist into adulthood in a subregion-specific PFC manner, suggesting selective vulnerability. Further work is necessary to understand the functional and behavioral implications.</jats:p>"

To determine whether honeybee viruses can be transmitted to butterflies, a total of 120 butterflies were sampled at four locations in Slovenia. At each location, butterflies from three families (Pieridae, Nymphalidae, Hesperiidae/Lycenidae) and Carniolan honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica) were collected. The RNA of six honeybee viruses, i.e., acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), deformed wing virus A (DWV-A), Sacbrood bee virus (SBV), and Lake Sinai virus 3 (LSV3), was detected by a specific quantitative method (RT-PCR). The presence of ABPV, BQCV, LSV3, and SBV was detected in both butterflies and honeybees. All butterfly and bee samples were negative for CBPV, while DWV-A was detected only in honeybees. The viral load in the positive butterfly samples was much lower than in the positive bee samples, which could indicate that butterflies are passive carriers of bee viruses. The percentage of positive butterfly samples was higher when the butterflies were collected at sampling sites with a higher density of apiaries. Therefore, we believe that infected bees are a necessary condition for the presence of viruses in cohabiting butterflies. This is the first study on the presence of pathogenic bee viruses in butterflies.</jats:p>"

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers developed a 39-item questionnaire targeting OSH professionals to understand attitudes toward DRST and the current and intended uses of DRST at their place of employment. Eighty-eight OSH professionals completed the questionnaire between August and December 2021. Descriptive results of the study sample are provided but the focus of the study applies the open-ended responses to two questions, which was deductively analyzed. Descriptive results show that reliability and validity of data was a top concern while the open-ended qualitative feedback revealed three primary themes: (1) acceptability and trust in technology; (2) ease of use; and (3) support and guidelines. Results provide an opening to use core HSMS elements (i.e., management commitment and leadership, communication and coordination, and employee involvement) during DRST integration to demonstrate support for workers during times of ambiguity and change.</jats:p>"

We organize this discussion according to biases best assessed with respect to the study population (including confounding by indication, channeling bias, healthy user bias, and protopathic bias), the study design (including prevalent user bias and immortal time bias), and the data source (including misclassification bias and missing data/loss to follow up).

The end cores form due to a strong increasing acceleration at the filament ends that leads to a sweep-up of material during the filament collapse along its axis. As this growth mode is typically faster than any other core formation mode in a filament, the end cores usually dominate in mass and density compared to other cores forming inside a filament. However, observations of star-forming filaments do not show this prevalence of cores at the filament ends. We explore a possible mechanism to slow the growth of the end cores using numerical simulations of simultaneous filament and embedded core formation, in our case a radially accreting filament forming in a finite converging flow. While such a set-up still leads to end cores, they soon begin to move inwards and a density gradient is formed outside of the cores by the continued accumulation of material. As a result, the outermost cores are no longer located at the exact ends of the filament and the density gradient softens the inward gravitational acceleration of the cores. Therefore, the two end cores do not grow as fast as expected and thus do not dominate over other core formation modes in the filament.</jats:p>",

Here we found that <jats:italic>Pholiota squarrosa</jats:italic> lectin (PhoSL), a lectin that specifically binds core-fucose, inhibited HBV infection to a human NTCP-expressing HepG2 cell called C4, a cell line susceptible to HBV infection. PhoSL bound to HBV particles. Fut8KO-C4 cells markedly lost HBV infectivity, and addition of PhoSL facilitated the loss of infectivity. Furthermore, we found that PhoSL blocked the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a process enhancing HBV infection. Observation of the dynamics of fluorescent labeled PhoSL on C4 cells on the infection HBV showed that PhoSL-bound HBV was incorporated into host cells, suggesting that PhoSL could inhibit HBV infection after internalization. Since PhoSL reduced cccDNA formation, the process from internalization to cccDNA formation should be impaired by PhoSL. We believe that this finding should lead to development of new anti-HBV agents.</jats:p>"

They improve crashworthiness while maintaining low structural weight addition due to their high strength to weight ratios. The addition of core material has also shown to increase energy absorption capacity and increase structural stability during deformation. Specifically, the addition of functionally graded cellular cores maintained high strength to weight ratios and assisted the increase in strength and stability. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of induced folding of the outer tube structure to maximize energy absorbing performance of the axial crush tube member. This study was conducted through a numerical approach utilizing ABAQUS/Explicit dynamic modeling environment. To facilitate the induced folding mechanism, partial cuts were made around the tube periphery at discrete intervals. The depth of the cuts decreased from impact to distal end to force fold initiation in a descending pattern. Analysis criteria included: crushing force, deformation modes and energy-deformation stroke plots. The induced structural collapse due to the peripheral cuts promoted additional fold initiation at the cut sites providing elevated crushing forces and increase energy absorption. This behavior resulted in a 29.2% increase in reaction forces and 11.1% increase in energy absorption.</jats:p>",

For applications in electronics and optoelectronics, direct growth of wafer-scale and vertically stacked graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is vital. The fundamental problem, however, is the catalytically inert nature of h-BN substrates, which typically provide a low rate of carbon precursor breakdown and consequently a poor rate of graphene synthesis. Furthermore, out-of-plane deformations such as wrinkles are commonly seen in 2D materials grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Herein, a wrinkle-facilitated route is developed for the fast growth of graphene/h-BN vertical heterostructures on Cu foils. The key advantage of this synthetic pathway is the exploitation of the increased reactivity from inevitable line defects arising from the CVD process, which can act as active sites for graphene nucleation. The resulted heterostructures are found to exhibit superlubric properties with increased bending stiffness, as well as directional electronic properties, as revealed from atomic force microscopy measurements. This work offers a brand-new route for the fast growth of Gr/h-BN heterostructures with practical scalability, thus propelling applications in electronics and nanomechanical systems.</jats:p>",

Teacher cognition and actions were studied in context based on data from semi-structured interviews, mixed questionnaire and observations. Manual thematic analysis through using a priori and post priori codes was adopted to parse data and establish the influence of teacher cognition on teaching in the classroom and identify any common trends among participants. The results show that teacher cognition has a marked influence on teaching speaking. Congruence between cognition and teaching is apparent, with some instances of incongruence. Congruence between teacher cognition and teaching speaking rests on two factors – the marked influence of ‘apprenticeship of observation’ i.e., the influence of teachers’ personal experiences from years of education that shapes their thoughts and teaching and teacher understanding of teaching speaking as ‘doing’ speaking i.e., providing opportunities for students to speak in the classroom. Incongruence stems from the core-peripheral belief dynamic, where the predominance of core beliefs over peripheral beliefs affects the efficacy of teaching speaking. </jats:p>"

The acknowledgement of the critical theory lineage’s naturalist, realist and especially idealist features leads this reconstruction to ascribe a central role to certain pivotal concepts that deserve special attention – including nature, the construction of society, evolution, immanent–transcendence and the conceptual conditions or cognitive order of society. A side effect of this theoretical exposition is the exposure in the course of the argument of certain weaknesses often visible in the contemporary articulation of the theory of society in both critical theory and general social theory. Conceptual solutions to those deficiencies are simultaneously presented in a form appropriate to critical theory’s modal-based negative explanatory and positive disclosing critique. </jats:p>",

However, it is a known fact that far field stresses experience changes in orientation and magnitude due to the presence of geological structures and due to the excavations created by mining activities. As a result, in-situ stresses around drifts, ramps, and stopes in underground mines are quite different from far field or pre-mining stresses. The purpose of this research is to develop a simple and practical methodology for determining in-situ stresses. Stress relief occurs once the rock core is drilled off. Such relief is a function of the surrounding stress field. This study uses exploration rock cores that are drilled off for the purpose of orebody definition in the underground mine. The method measures and analyzes the diametral core deformations in laboratory. Two case studies from operating underground mines are presented for demonstration. In these case studies, rock core deformations are measured with a customized test apparatus and rock samples were prepared and tested for Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The differential stress, namely the difference between the local principal stresses in the plane perpendicular to the core rock axis is calculated. It is shown that this methodology is useful for determining the brittle shear ratio in the rock mass, which is of primary interest to ground control studies.</jats:p>",

The structural capacity is predicted by nonlinear finite‐element analyses, where the effect of chloride corrosion is implemented within the framework of PARC_CL_2.1 crack model. The proposed methodology is applied to a pre‐code six‐story reinforced concrete (RC) building with moment‐resisting (MR) frames and an internal core assumed as a testbed. For a given exposure class, pushover analyses are performed for different ages of the building. Time‐dependent fragility curves are then obtained through a procedure based on incremental static analysis. Different corrosion scenarios are assessed by considering deterioration effects applied either on the sole RC walls or on both walls and columns. The obtained results highlight that time‐dependent fragility curves are strongly affected by corrosion, therefore the date of construction should be considered in seismic risk mapping, not only for evaluating the effect of obsolete standard codes used in the design but also in terms of damage induced by aging and deterioration.</jats:p>",

Changes and improvements to automobiles have resulted in a significant amount of energy absorption capability through the vehicle chassis. Axial crushing members are often deployed in vehicle front end and side chassis structures and are designed to absorb a maximum amount of energy before complete deformation. These structures experience a series of progressive folding during axial deformation resulting in moderate and relatively constant force throughout the crushing behavior. To increase the performance of these structures, different cross-sectional shapes and core materials have been investigated. The present study investigates the addition of graded cellular core structure with zones of crushable foam and fluid inserts within the cell voids. The addition of crushable foam material aimed to provide stability to the crushing behavior of the structure. The incompressible nature of the fluid insert provided sections of increased structural strength and a more global crushing response. The finite element approach was conducted using ABAQUS dynamic environment and the square crush tubes were subjected to dynamic axial crushing. Foam and fluid addition provided additional energy absorption while creating a more global deformation response.</jats:p>",

We present a robust ML prediction model of TBC covering crystalline–crystalline and crystalline–amorphous interfaces, using disorder descriptors and atomic density. We also construct high-accuracy ML models for predicting both TBC and EBC and their ratio, using only small data of crystalline GBs. We found that the variations of interatomic angles and distance at GB are the most predictive descriptors for TBC and EBC, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Carbonates exhibits diverse flow characteristics at pore scale. Petrographic study reveals micro-level heterogeneities. Thin sections are key to assess reservoir quality although these are images and interpretations in text format. Thin section microscopic analysis is descriptive and subjective. To an extent, optical point counting is routinely used quantitatively to estimate porosity, cement, and granular features. Overall, thin section descriptions require specialist human skill and an extensive effort, as it is repetitive and time consuming. Thus, a manual process limits the overall progress of rock quality assessment. There is no recognized method to handle thin sections for direct input with conventional core data due to its image and descriptive nature of data. An automated image processing is one of the emerging concepts designed in this paper to batch process thin sections for digital reservoir descriptions and cross correlating the results with conventional core analysis data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Thin section images are photomicrographs under plane polarized light. Initially, denoise and image enhancement techniques were implemented to preserve elemental boundaries. Computational algorithms mainly, multilevel thresholding and pixel intensity clustering algorithms were programmed to segment images for extracting elements from segmented regions. The extracted elements were compared with original image for labeling. The labeled elements are interpreted for geological elements such as matrix, pores, cement, and other granular content. The interpreted geological elements are then measured for their physical properties like area, equivalent diameter, perimeter, solidity, eccentricity, and entropy. 2D-Porosity, polymodal pore size distribution, mean pore size, cement and granular contents were then derived for each thin section image. The estimated properties were compared with conventional core after calibrating with laboratory NMR data. The whole process is automated in a batch process for a specific reservoir type and computational cost is analyzed for optimization.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2D-porosity is in excellent agreement with core porosity, thus reducing uncertainty that arises from visual estimations. Scale related issues were highlighted between 2D porosity and core porosity for some samples. Polymodal pore size distributions are in good correlation with NMR T2 distribution compared to MICP distributions. The correlation coefficient was understood to be equivalent to surface relaxivity. A digital dataset consisting of 2D porosity, eccentricity, entropy, mean pore size, cement and grain contents is automatically extracted in csv format. The digital dataset, which was previously in text format in conventional analysis, is now a rich quantitative dataset.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper demonstrated a unique and customized solution to extract digital reservoir descriptions for geoscience applications. This significantly reduced the subjectivity in visual descriptions. The solution presented is scalable to large number of samples with significant reduction in turnaround and effort compared to conventional techniques. Additional merit is that the result from this method has direct correlation to conventional core data for improving rock typing workflows. This paper presents a novel means to use thin section images directly in digital format in geoscience applications.</jats:p>",

However,\nmost of the molecular mechanisms underlying these chemical inducers\nremain unknown. Here, we developed a lentinan-loaded hydrogel with a\ncore-shell structure and discovered how it protects plants from\ndifferent virus infections. The hydrogel was synthesized by adding a\nchitosan shell on the surface of the polyanion sodium\nalginate-Ca2+-lentinan (LNT) hydrogel (SL-gel) to form a CSL-gel.\nCSL-gels exhibit the capacity to prolong the stable release of lentinan\nand promote Ca2+ release. Application of CSL-gels on the root of plants\ninduces broad-spectrum resistance against TMV, TRV, PVX and TuMV).\nRNA-seq analysis identified that the calmodulin-like protein 19 gene\n(CML19) is upregulated by the sustained release of Ca2+ from the\nCSL-gel, and silencing and overexpression of CML19 alter the\nsusceptibility and resistance of tobacco to TMV. Our findings provide\nevidence that this novel and synthetic CSL-gel strongly inhibits the\ninfection of plant viruses by the sustainable release of LNT and Ca2+.\nThis study uncovers a novel mode of action by which CSL-gels trigger\nCML19 expression through the stable and sustained release of Ca2+.</jats:p>"

The tool was designed in 2009 to support SP in ascertaining prior capacities in PoEs and monitoring their progress in order to designate PoEs under IHR.The tool was translated in Italian.Coordination and communication among authorities involved in each PoE (C1),core capacity at all times (C2) and at PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) (C3) were assessed by cross border health Authorities for 2020 and 2021.For each of these sections the maximum score is 100%. For each year,a descriptive analysis was conducted and any differences in scores between the two years were noted.The presence of a contingency and vectors’ control plans was also investigated.The assessment was completed respectively for 2020 and 2021 by 24 and 25 airports, 53 and 52 ports. C1 in 2020 resulted on average 89% for airports and 95% for ports, in 2021 respectively 90% and 95%; C2 in 2020 resulted on average 64% for airports and 63% for ports, in 2021 respectively 63% and 64%; C3 in 2020 resulted on average 68% for airports and 61% for ports,in 2021 respectively 63% and 58%.Few differences in scores between 2020 and 2021 were noted in some PoEs. 4 PoEs declared the presence of a contingency plan only in 2021.Few PoEs stated to not have a vectors’ control plan in both years.The assessment pointed out a good level of coordination and communication among all the stakeholders involved, including the Italian Red Cross,but it revealed lower scores for the other IHR core capacities.

Urgency and precaution were the government’s primary considerations in March 2020, with proportionality and due process only peripheral decision premises. Voices of moderation were drowned out at critical moments to pave the way for a lockdown. Moreover, Norway’s lockdown decision lacked distinct and official agency, with none of the key actors able to say precisely when, where and by whom this decision of unprecedented size and scope had been taken. An interpretation using Graham Allison’s analytical models shows that the rational policy model most accurately captures the case. The suggested implication is that when senior political executives take active control of an ultra-high-stakes process, decisions are unlikely to be the product of political resultants or organisational output. </jats:p>",

Considering the importance of knowledge for answering questions correctly, this paper analyzes and researches the stratification, expression and participation process of knowledge in VQA and proposes a knowledge description framework (KDF) to guide the research of knowledge-based VQA (Kb-VQA). The KDF consists of a basic theory, implementation methods and specific applications. This paper focuses on describing mathematical models at basic theoretical levels, as well as the knowledge hierarchy theories and key implementation behaviors established on this basis. In our experiment, using the statistics of VQA’s accuracy in the relevant literature, we propose a good corroboration of the research results from knowledge stratification, participation methods and expression forms in this paper.</jats:p>"

After preparing the nanocatalyst and confirming its structure by different spectroscopic methods or techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Its performance under ultrasonic radiation and various conditions were examined. The yield of target derivatives was controlled under various conditions and it was found that it reaches more than 80% in just 10 min, which indicates the high performance of the nanocatalyst along with the synergistic effect of ultrasonic radiation. The structure of the products was identified by melting point as well as FT-IR and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopic methods.

This challenges the treatment of out‐of‐core models. Although applying out‐of‐core simplification methods to the model can fit in memory, this would induce distortion of the model surface, and so causing the skeleton to be off‐centered or changing the topological structure. In this paper, we propose an efficient out‐of‐core method for extracting skeletons from large volumetric models. The method takes a volumetric model as input and first computes an out‐of‐core distance transform. With the distance transform, we generate a medial mesh to capture the prominent features for skeleton extraction, which significantly reduces the data size and facilitates the process of large models. At last, we contract the medial mesh in an out‐of‐core fashion to generate the skeleton. Experimental results show that our method can efficiently extract high‐quality curve skeletons from large volumetric models with small memory usage.</jats:p>",

Some filovirus members, such as Ebola virus and Marburg virus, cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. The filovirus ribonucleoprotein complex, called the nucleocapsid, forms a double-layered helical structure in which a non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35), VP24, VP30 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). The inner layer consists of the helical NP–RNA complex, acting as a scaffold for the binding of VP35 and VP24 that constitute the outer layer. Recent structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanism of filovirus nucleocapsid formation. Here, we review the key characteristics of the Ebola virus and Marburg virus nucleocapsid structures, highlighting the similarities and differences between the two viruses. In particular, we focus on the structure of the helical NP–RNA complex, the RNA binding mechanism and the NP–NP interactions in the helix. The structural analyses reveal a possible mechanism of nucleocapsid assembly and provide potential targets for the anti-filovirus drug design.</jats:p>",

In commodity platforms, cores communicate data through the shared memory hierarchy and correctness is maintained by a cache coherence protocol. Recent works investigated the deployment of coherence protocols in real-time systems and showed significant performance improvements. Nonetheless, we find these works to require modifications to commodity coherence protocols, assume simple in-order pipelines, and most importantly suffer from significant latency delays due to coherence interference along with average performance degradation. In this work, we propose\n            <jats:sans-serif>PISCOT</jats:sans-serif>\n            : a predictable and coherent bus architecture that (i) provides a considerably tighter bound compared to the state-of-the-art predictable coherent solutions (4× tighter bounds in a quad-core system). (ii) It does so with a negligible performance loss compared to conventional high-performance architecture coherence delays (less than 4% for SPLASH-3 benchmarks). This improves average performance by up to 5× (2.8× on average) compared to its predictable coherence counterpart. Finally, (iii) it achieves that without requiring any modifications to conventional coherence protocols.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The core–mantle boundary (CMB) is the most abrupt internal discontinuity in the Earth, marking the solid–fluid boundary between mantle and outer core that strongly affects the dynamics of the Earth’s interior. However, good agreement between models of CMB topographic variations is still lacking. This is probably due to difficulties relating to observations on seismograms and to the lack of good models of lowermost mantle velocity structure. Using spectral-element synthetic seismograms and adjoint methods, we perform traveltime analyses of seismic waves interacting with the CMB. We focus on reflected and refracted P and S waves. We select some of the most important and routinely used seismic phases: ScS, SKS, SKKS, PcP, PKP, PKKP and PcS, given their path through mantle and core and their interaction with the CMB. These seismic waves have been widely deployed by seismologists trying to image CMB topography and lowermost mantle structure. To analyse the reliability of measuring their traveltimes to infer CMB topography, we perform experiments in two ways. First, we compute synthetic seismograms with a dominant period of T ≈ 11s, for computational efficiency, using existing models of CMB topography. We compare traveltime perturbations measured by cross-correlation on the synthetics to those predicted using ray theory. We find deviations from a perfect agreement between ray theoretical predictions of time shifts and those measured on synthetics with and without CMB topography. Second, we calculate Fréchet sensitivity kernels of traveltimes with respect to shear and compressional wave speeds. We also explicitly compute boundary sensitivities with respect to the CMB interface. We observe that the overall sensitivity of the traveltimes is mostly due to volumetric velocity structure and that imprints of CMB on traveltimes are less pronounced. Our study explains the observed difficulties relating to inferring CMB topography using traveltimes and provides a suite of finite frequency sensitivity kernels computed with the adjoint method. The kernels allow us to qualitatively explain the behaviour of measured traveltimes and understand the trade-off between velocity and CMB topography. They can also serve as reference of finite frequency effects on traveltimes of observed seismic phases. From our analyses we conclude that: i) traveltime anomalies measured on Swaves are more in accord with ray theoretical predictions, ii) PcP, PKP, ScS and SKS phases have more pronounced sensitivity to the boundary and iii) separating the greater effects of velocity from those due to the boundary structure is difficult, as they intricately affect the traveltime. We propose that jointly inverting for CMB topography and lowermost mantle velocity structure using full-waveform synthetics and adjoint sensitivity kernels can progress our understanding of deep Earth structure and finite frequency effects on observed waveforms.</jats:p>",

Antimicrobial surfaces can inhibit and reduce microbial adhesion to surfaces, preventing biofilm formation. Thus, this research aimed to investigate the bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on different sealants and stainless steel (SS) surfaces with or without antimicrobials on two Gram-positive biofilm forming bacterial strains. Antimicrobial surfaces were either incorporated or coated with anti-microbial, -fungal or/and bactericidal agents. Attachment (after 3 h) and early-stage biofilm formation (after 48 h) of Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis) and Microbacterium lacticum (M. lacticum) onto different surfaces were assessed using the plate count method. In general, bacterial adhesion on sealants was lower compared to adhesion on SS, for surfaces with and without antimicrobials. Antimicrobial coatings on SS surfaces played a role in reducing early-stage biofilm formation for S. capitis, however, no effects were observed for M. lacticum. S. capitis adhesion and biofilm formation were reduced by 8% and 25%, respectively, on SS coated with an antimicrobial substance (SS_4_M), compared to the same surface without the antimicrobial coating (SS_4_control). Incorporation of both antifungicidal and bactericidal agents (S_5_FB) significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.05) early-stage biofilm formation of M. lacticum, compared to the other sealants incoportating either solely antifungal agents (S_2_F) or no active compound (S_control). Furthermore, the thickness of the coating layer correlated weakly with the antimicrobial effect. Hence, equipment manufacturers and food producers should carefully select antimicrobial surfaces as their effects on bacterial adhesion and early-stage biofilm formation depend on the active agent and bacterial species.</jats:p>"

Films’ structural characteristics and morphological characterization were investigated by X-ray diffractometer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). In addition, parameters like crystal size were calculated. Results showed XRD patterns exhibit structure of polycrystalline of preferential orientation (111) direction. SEM technique shows that the nanoparticles presented are spherical. AFM image verified film-formed spherical particles distribute uniformly. The antibacterial diffusion method property of these nanoparticles was performed against Gram-negative bacteria of Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus, showing good control of said bacteria. The maximum level of inhibition was found in coli form bacteria with an average inhibition zone diameter with S. aureus, implying an increasing trend with increasing/decreasing loading volume of NC volume. Therefore, these nanomaterials, which can be prepared in a simple and cost-effective way, may be suitable for new types of germicidal materials.</jats:p>",

Dysarthria often leads to social isolation, poor psychological well-being and can prevent return to work and social lives. Currently a variety of outcome measures are used in clinical research and practice when monitoring recovery for people who have dysarthria. When research studies use different measures, it is impossible to compare results from trials and delays our understanding of effective clinical treatments. The aim of this study is to develop a core outcome set (COS) to agree what aspects of speech recovery should be measured for dysarthria after stroke (COS-Speech) in research and clinical practice. \n<jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold>The COS-Speech study will include five steps. 1. Development of a long list of possible outcome domains of speech that should be measured to guide the survey; 2. Recruitment to the COS-Speech study of three key stakeholder groups in the UK and Australia: stroke survivors, communication researchers and speech and language therapists/pathologists; 3. Two rounds of the Delphi survey process; 4. A consensus meeting to agree the speech outcomes to be measured and a follow up consensus meeting to match existing instruments/measures (from parallel systematic review) to the agreed COS-Speech; 5. Dissemination of COS-Speech. \n<jats:bold>Discussion </jats:bold>There is currently no COS for dysarthria after stroke for research trials or clinical practice. The findings from this research study will be a minimum COS, for use in all dysarthria research studies and clinical practice looking at post-stroke recovery of speech. These findings will be widely disseminated using professional and patient networks, research and clinical forums as well as using a variety of academic papers, videos, accessible writing such as blogs and links on social media. \n<jats:bold>Trial Registration</jats:bold> COS-Speech is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database, October 2021 https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1959. In addition, “A systematic review of the psychometric properties and clinical utility of instruments measuring dysarthria after stroke” will inform the consensus meeting to match measures to COS-Speech.

This conceptual elucidation task allows evaluating the legitimacy of the variable selection process and establishing why they are or are not representatives of the phenomenon of spiritual-religious experience. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) become an essential part of many portable devices and even electric vehicles than ever before. Among the various cathode materials, Ni rich layered cathode material has big attention because it has higher specific capacity and energy density. However, at a delithiated state, unstable Ni<jats:sup>4+</jats:sup> leads to oxygen release and structural degradation and as a result, irreversible phase transition from R3m to electrochemical inactive Fm3m is observed. So, various strategy is applying to overcome this limitation like three-component system (NCM) or surface coating. However, NCM still cannot solve that problem perfectly and surface coating makes a problem like reducing specific capacity caused by insulating coating material (Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, MnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>...etc) And also, this day, Co free structure of Ni rich cathode material has received more great attention as an alternative to NCM because of its hazardous toxicity and increasing price of Co. At this perspective, many studies have demonstrated Core-Shell or FCG (Full Concentration Gradient) structure can make better structural stability without Co metal than surface coating, which has insulated coating materials. In addition, core shell structure is easier to control the composition than FCG structure. However, in Core-Shell structure, interdiffusion of shell metal to core deteriorate the stability of Core-Shell material, so it needs very delicate heat treatment. And generally, to prevent interdiffusion from traditional core-shell structure, lower synthesis temperature or high valence metal dopant would be needed and that leads lower initial specific capacity or additional doped metal. So, we prevent the Mn interdiffusion by changing valence state of Mn in precursor through simple convection drying process not vacuum drying without decreasing synthesis temperature and additional dopant. Atomic interdiffusion in layered metal oxide structures follows the atomic migration through octahedral and tetrahedral sites. In case of various stated Mn, higher valence state Mn has higher energy barrier to migrate between each Oh and Td sites. Based on this theory, surface Mn rich shell can be oxidized easily under convection oven drying and highly oxidized Mn will be remained better than lower state Mn during high temperature calcination. These more remained Mn in shell can protect the particle surface from electrolyte attack and also higher valence state Mn makes slightly more Ni<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> due to thermodynamic stability and charge balance of Mn on the surface. And that Ni<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> in Li slab (Cation mixing) acts as a pillar to suppress irreversible phase transition of Ni rich materials. Through this surface passivation, phase transition (layered to rock salt ) propagation surface to bulk can be blocked. Furthermore, mechanical pulverization of secondary particle is also prevented because of less permeating electrolyte into bulk structure. Therefore, Li ion diffusion will not be sluggish after cycling as observed by GITT. In addition, more clear Ni rich core assure high specific capacity and faster electrochemical reaction kinetic without severe capacity fading. And also, in Full cell test (using graphite as anode), convection oven dried sample has better structure stability and that means our strategy for core-shell LiNi<jats:sub>0.97</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.03</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> sample can be good candidate to alternate conventional cathode active material for Lithium ion battery practically. As prepared materials, atomic distribution was observed by EDS and XPS analysis. This study suggests useless of vacuum drying and more cost effective way to prepare Co free Core Shell LiNi<jats:sub>0.97</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.03</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cathode material for Lithium Ion Batteries.    </jats:p>",

Insect vectors transmit the parasite and, due to the lack of vaccine availability and limited treatment options, we implemented an integrated core proteomics analysis to design a reverse vaccine candidate based on immune epitopes for disease control. Firstly, T. cruzi core proteomics was used to identify immunodominant epitopes. Therefore, we designed the vaccine sequence to be non-allergic, antigenic, immunogenic, and to have better solubility. After predicting the tertiary structure, docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were performed with TLR4, MHC-I, and MHC-II receptors to discover the binding affinities. The final vaccine design demonstrated significant hydrogen bond interactions upon docking with TLR4, MHC-I, and MHC-II receptors. This indicated the efficacy of the vaccine candidate. A server-based immune simulation approach was generated to predict the efficacy. Significant structural compactness and binding stability were found based on MDS. Finally, by optimizing codons on Escherichia coli K12, a high GC content and CAI value were obtained, which were then incorporated into the cloning vector pET2+ (a). Thus, the developed vaccine sequence may be a viable therapy option for Chagas disease.</jats:p>"

Here we use convolutional neural network models to identify the core rotational rates, rotation length scales, and the nuclear equation of state (EoS), using the 1824 waveforms from Richers et al. for a 12 solar mass progenitor. A high prediction accuracy for the classifications of the rotation length scales (93%) and the rotational rates (95%) can be achieved using the gravitational-wave signals from −10 to 6 ms core bounce. By including an additional 48 ms signal during the prompt convection phase, we could achieve an accuracy of 96% in the classification of the four main EoS groups. By combining the three models above, we could correctly predict the core rotational rates, rotation length scales, and the EoS at the same time with an accuracy of more than 85%. Finally, applying a transfer-learning method for an additional 74 waveforms from FLASH simulations, we show that our model using Richers’ waveforms could successfully predict the rotational rates from Pan’s waveforms even for a continuous value with mean absolute errors of 0.32 rad s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> only.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lymphatic vessels are crucial for tissue homeostasis and immune responses in vertebrates. Recent studies have demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) arise from both venous sprouting (lymphangiogenesis) and de novo production from non-venous origins (lymphvasculogenesis), which is similar to blood vessel formation through angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. However, the contribution of LECs from non-venous origins to lymphatic networks is considered to be relatively small. Here, we identify the <jats:italic>Islet1</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Isl1</jats:italic>)-expressing cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM) as a non-venous origin of craniofacial and cardiac LECs. Genetic lineage tracing with <jats:italic>Isl1<jats:sup>Cre/+</jats:sup></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Isl1<jats:sup>CreERT2/+</jats:sup></jats:italic> mice suggested that a subset of CPM cells gives rise to LECs. These CPM-derived LECs are distinct from venous-derived LECs in terms of their developmental processes and anatomical locations. Later, they form the craniofacial and cardiac lymphatic vascular networks in collaboration with venous-derived LECs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are two major sources of LECs, the cardinal vein and the CPM. As the CPM is evolutionarily conserved, these findings may improve our understanding of the evolution of lymphatic vessel development across species. Most importantly, our findings may provide clues to the pathogenesis of lymphatic malformations, which most often develop in the craniofacial and mediastinal regions.</jats:p>"

In the present study, using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the thermal conductivity of a single polyethylene chain, representing a typical polymer chain, was calculated as a function of strain. To investigate the effect of different modeling of covalent bonds, the results were compared for reactive and non-reactive potential models, the AIREBO and NERD potentials, respectively. When the strain ε was as small as ε &amp;lt; −0.03, i.e., under slight compression, the thermal conductivity values were similar regardless of the potential model and increased with increasing strain. However, the two potential models showed qualitatively different behaviors for larger strains up to ε &amp;lt; 0.15: the thermal conductivity calculated by the non-reactive potential continually grows with increasing strain, whereas that by the reactive potential model is saturated. The analysis of internal stress and vibrational density of states suggested that the saturation behavior is due to the weakening of the covalent bond force as the C–C bond elongates, and thus, the result of the reactive model is likely more realistic. However, for ε &amp;gt; 0.1, the reactive potential also produced unphysical results due to the effect of the switching function, describing the formation and breaking of covalent bonds. The present results indicate that careful selection of the potential model and deformation range is necessary when investigating the properties of polymers under tensile strain.</jats:p>",

Insecticide use has left signatures of selection in the fly genome, and both functional and quantitative genetic studies in the system have identified genes and variants associated with resistance. Here, we use D. melanogaster and leverage a bulk phenotyping and pooled sequencing “extreme quantitative trait loci” approach to genetically dissect variation in resistance to malathion, an organophosphate insecticide. We resolve 2 quantitative trait loci, one of which implicates allelic variation at the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1, a strong candidate based on previous work. The second shows no overlap with hits from a previous genome-wide association study for malathion resistance, recapitulating other studies showing that different strategies for complex trait dissection in flies can yield apparently different architectures. Notably, we see no genetic signal at the Ace gene. Ace encodes the target of organophosphate insecticide inhibition, and genome-wide association studies have identified strong Ace-linked associations with resistance in flies. The absence of quantitative trait locus implicating Ace here is most likely because our mapping population does not segregate for several of the known functional polymorphisms impacting resistance at Ace, perhaps because our population is derived from flies collected prior to the widespread use of organophosphate insecticides. Our fundamental approach can be an efficient, powerful strategy to dissect genetic variation in resistance traits. Nonetheless, studies seeking to interrogate contemporary insecticide resistance variation may benefit from deriving mapping populations from more recently collected strains.</jats:p>",

To reach a professional level, snooker players must acquire many physical and mental skills. Strengthening the core muscles, which provide a foundation for a successful limb function in skill sports such as snooker, can be achieved by performing Pilates exercises. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of core muscle training on skill and balance for snooker players. Methods: In this study, 30 male snooker players were divided into Pilates (n = 15) and control groups (n = 15) by randomization. The Pilates group performed the mat Pilates exercises three sessions per week consisting of 30 minutes of Pilates training in addition to one hour of routine snooker training per session for six weeks. The control group performed one-hour routine snooker training three sessions per week at the same time period. To assess the players' skills, the line-up test was used to measure the break score, and the foul number test was used to calculate the foul number. Players' balance was evaluated by the stork balance test. All tests were performed pre and post 6 weeks of exercise for between and within- group comparisons. Results: Line-up and stork test scores were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) in the Pilates group compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the foul numbers between groups after Six weeks of Pilates exercises. Conclusions: Six weeks of mat Pilates exercises improves the snooker players' balance ability and break scores.</jats:p>"

[2] However, the elemental distribution particularly for light elements like oxygen as well as the influence of the Co oxide on the ORR activity are still unclear to date.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We prepared a disordered PtCoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> alloy catalyst using wet-impregnation - freeze-drying - thermal annealing method. [3] After electrochemical activation by dealloying, the less noble metal is dissolved from the nanoparticle surface and the remaining Pt surface atoms are forming a protective particle shell referred to as core-shell catalyst. [2, 3] Using high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) we were able to explore the detailed structure of the activated PtCoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> catalyst with a Pt-enriched shell. Based on the EELS elemental maps of Pt, Co and O, we observed that oxygen is mainly located at the interface between the Pt-enriched shell and the PtCoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> alloy core. Thus, the CoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> species are highly stable during the electrochemical dealloying in acidic media.

The stability of the CoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> species and the electrochemical catalyst durability were tested by using an accelerated stress test (AST, 10,000 cycles from 0.5 to 1.0 VRHE) in acidic media. Here, the PtCoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> core-shell catalyst showed an improved electrochemical durability compared to Pt/C and maintains 85% of the initial ECSA, 54% of the initial ORR mass activity and 68% of the initial ORR specific activity, respectively. From the STEM-EELS and XPS measurements, we revealed an increase of the thickness of the Pt-enriched shell of several monolayers after the AST protocol. Very surprisingly, the cobalt oxide in the sub-surface layers still remains, but it is less narrowly distributed than before the AST experiment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Thus, we suggest that the Co oxide species in PtCoO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> alloy catalyst might have a positive effect on the ORR performance and durability and could even be a yet undiscovered alternative to metallic cobalt.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] G.W.

This allows simultaneous estimation of the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and Peltier/Seebeck coefficient of conductors without attaching an external heater. The thermal analysis developed here is applicable to a system with the interfacial thermal resistance between the target conductor and reference material. Our method enables the measurements while applying an external magnetic field, opening the way for investigating the magnetic field and/or magnetization dependences of the figures of merit and associated properties for the magneto-thermoelectric effects. We demonstrate the usability of this method by estimating the figures of merit for the Peltier/Seebeck, magneto-Peltier/Seebeck, and Ettingshausen/Nernst effects in a Bi–Sb alloy as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. The multi-harmonic thermal analysis method will, thus, aid in developing highly efficient thermoelectric materials and further investigations of magneto-thermal and magneto-thermoelectric transport properties.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the important area of the Tigris, Euphrates and Shatt Al-Arab rivers in Iraq, and the effect of pollutant to theses rivers, the object of study is the origin and sources of PAHs compounds in sediment core samples which collected in 2021 from six important stations that are (Tigris1, Tigris2, Euphrates1, Euphrates2, Shatt Al-Arab1, and Shatt Al-Arab2). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzes by using capillary gas chromatography. The results of PAHs shown in two pattern low and high molecular weight. The total PAHs ranged between 79.141 ng/g at station No. 6 to 3.830 ng/g at station No. 3. The rush to develop industries across the globe accelerates environmental damage brought on by many contaminants, including PAHs. Organic compounds in the PAHs class have two or more aromatic rings. PAHs can be pyrogenic, petrogenic, or biogenic depending on how they develop. Pyrogenic PAHs are produced when various fuels, oil and gas, waste, or other organic materials like fume from oil industries in the area. The investigation showed two patterns of sources petrogenic and pyrogenic with the petrogenic source predominating according to the ratios (low molecular weight/high molecular weight), anthracene/(anthracene+phenanthrene) and fluoranthene/(fluoranthene+pyrene). Additionally, findings indicated that sediment pollution is of a moderate pollution. By adhering to sedimentary particles, PAHs get into the sediments. Based on the physicochemical characteristics of each fraction and the surrounding environment, sediments also serve as a source for some contaminants that re-enter the water column. Lighter PAHs predominated in water samples, while heavier compounds predominated in sediment samples, according to several studies. In addition, it is difficult to remove the high concentrations of PAHs in riverine sediments brought on by industrial activity. While other research indicated significant PAHs pollution in a variety of global environments. Due to the fact that such research helps to lessen the obvious shortage of information regarding such pollutants in Iraqi rivers, this study gives as the baselines for coming research.</jats:p>"

We introduce a delay between two pulses of each pulse pair in front of the sample, and after the corresponding two consecutive reflections at the vibrating sample surface, the initially introduced delay is canceled by a modified Sagnac geometry. The remaining phase difference between the two pulses corresponds to the change in the axial position of the surface during the two consecutive reflections. The Sagnac geometry reduces the effect of phase jitter since both pulses propagate through nearly the same optical path (in opposite directions), and spurious signals are eliminated by time gating. We determine the amplitude of surface vibration on a surface-acoustic-wave device with an axial precision of 4 pm. This technique enables the highly accurate determination of extremely small displacements.</jats:p>",

The edge transport and power dissipation of W particles are simulated by EMC3-EIRENE. An in–out asymmetry of W<jats:sup>(1–28)+</jats:sup> ions density has been revealed in the in- and out-board divertor regions. This is mainly due to the stronger reversal flow velocity of W ions at the outboard divertor. The upward flow of W ions near the separatrix leads to a moderate W impurity leakage from the divertor on CFETR compared to the existing full W device ASDEX Upgrade due to the high plasma density near the CFETR divertor targets. Further, the density distribution and radiation loss of W ions in the core region are investigated by STRAHL code. The high charge-state W<jats:sup>(29–60)+</jats:sup> and W<jats:sup>(61–74)+</jats:sup> ions mainly reside in the regions of Ψ<jats:sub>N</jats:sub> = 0.20–0.98 and 0.00–0.90 (Ψ<jats:sub>N</jats:sub> is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux), respectively. The W induced energy dissipation in different regions is assessed according to both STRAHL and EMC3-EIRENE simulations. Particularly, the impacts of the W core radiation on the operation regime are discussed according to the H-mode threshold scaling law proposed by Martin <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic> (2008 <jats:italic>J.

Although broadly applied, the joint use of LMs and conjugated polymers are rarely explored due to the notoriously interfacial challenges of the high surface tension of LMs and the unfavorable rigid backbones of conjugated polymer chains. This work successfully introduced conjugated polymers (poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, (PEDOT:PSS)) into the system of liquid metals to provide a highly stable, aqueous, and electrically conductive ink (LM‐PEDOT:PSS inks, LMPInks) for flexible electronics. The PSS segments act as a strong ionic bridge to effectively stabilize core‐shell structure of the PEDOT and LMs in the homogenous ink. Different from previous insulated LM‐inks, LMPInk is aqueous and more importantly, electrically conductive without posttreatments due to the intrinsically conductive PEDOT:PSS. Interestingly, with low content of LM particles (&lt;2 wt%), the printed circuits inherit the valuable transparency of PEDOT:PSS (transmission &gt;92% in visible region), which has never been observed in LM‐based organic systems. Furthermore, such LMPInks show distinguished electrical robustness, which can automatically recover their initial electrical conductivity even after severe physical damage. With the above phenomenal advantages, various flexible circuits on different substrates are successfully provided.</jats:p>",

Dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic pathway is posited to contribute to opioid reinforcement, but the processes by which dopamine influences drug seeking have not been completely elucidated. To examine whether opioid seeking during abstinence is associated with alterations in dopamine transmission, female and male rats self‐administered oxycodone under an intermittent access schedule of reinforcement. Following self‐administration, rats underwent a forced abstinence period, and cue‐induced seeking tests were conducted to assess oxycodone seeking. One day following the final seeking test, rats were sacrificed to perform ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry and western blotting in the nucleus accumbens. Rats displayed reduced dopamine uptake rate on abstinence day 2 and abstinence day 15, compared to oxycodone‐naïve rats. Further, on abstinence day 15, rats had reduced phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter. Additionally, local application of oxycodone to the nucleus accumbens reduced dopamine uptake in oxycodone‐naïve rats and in rats during oxycodone abstinence, on abstinence day 2 and abstinence day 15. These observations suggest that abstinence from oxycodone results in dysfunctional dopamine transmission, which may contribute to sustained oxycodone seeking during abstinence.</jats:p>",

The buccal epithelium sampling was performed at 07:00 am and 07:00 pm in one day by cytological brush. The surveyed patients were examined chronotypically using the Horn-Ostberg test. The determination of the mRNA expression of the Per1, Clock, Bmal1, Cry1 genes was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Results. Per1 expression was higher in the morning, regardless of chronotype, age, and gender. The expression of the Clock demonstrated the prevalence of the evening in both chronotypes, in both men and women. Bmal1 was better expressed in the evening, regardless of age, gender, and chronotype. The expression of Cry1 did not show statistically significant differences between the indicators. Conclusions. The evening expression of Clock was higher in people with the evening chronotype than in people with the morning chronotype. The chronotype did not show any effect on the expression of Per1, Bmal1, and Cry1. Age and sex did not show any effect on the expression of the core clock genes.</jats:p>"

However, they are mainly produced from fossil resources. Therefore, the development of bio‐based RDPPs is important to reduce the carbon footprint of these additives. In this work, two types of core–shell nanoparticles with a high percentage of bio‐based content are synthesized and show to be good candidates as RDPPs. In the first case, up to 75% of bio‐based content is obtained by combining lauryl acrylate, derived from coconut and palm kernel oil, as main core material, with isobornyl methacrylate, coming from pine resin, exploited to create the outer harder shell. In the second case, a degradable macromonomer obtained by the ring opening polymerization of lactide using 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate as initiator is used as the core‐forming monomer to obtain degradable RDPPs. In both cases, the particles are synthesized with a two‐step emulsion polymerization process conducted in one pot and then spray‐dried to obtain the RDPPs of interest. The morphology and redispersibility of the powders are characterized. Finally, their use as concrete additives is preliminarily assessed by evaluating their effect on changes in the surface morphologies of concrete specimens.</jats:p>",

Force-time and force-deflection diagrams, maximum contact forces, contact times, and deflections corresponding to the peak forces, and absorbed energies of sandwich composites were obtained for each impact energy level in detail.

The plate type fuel is an alternative since the Indonesian industry has been able to produce such fuel elements. The change of core configuration is expected to improve the reactor performance for irradiation facilities and fuel element lifetime. The SRAC2006 is used to perform neutronic calculations while the nuclear fuel lifetime is calculated by SWAT. This study begins with performing a core properties comparison of UZrH1.6 as the current fuel material and U3Si2-Al as the fuel material candidate. The results show that the Kartini reactor core is possible to load U3Si2-Al as the fuel material and makes higher excess reactivity compared to the current fuel material. Furthermore, U3Si2-Al in the plate type element geometry is variedly arranged in the new reactor core configuration to optimize the neutronic core parameters. The new core configuration is composed of 10 standard fuel elements, 4 fuel control elements, and the graphite material baffle that is located between the active core and annular reflector for serves as an additional reflector. The configuration produced sufficient core excess reactivity and adequate shutdown margin. It also produced negative temperature feedback reactivity and power peaking factor that fulfilled the safety requirements. Improvement of new reactor core performance was obtained by more irradiation facilities, higher thermal neutron flux, and longer maximum estimated burn up compared to the current core configuration.</jats:p>",

This paper illustrates how to achieve this goal using data from a qualitative study that aimed to characterize how PSTs enact the core practice of eliciting and working with student thinking in the three key stages of collaborative group work in rehearsals: whole‐class warm‐up, small group work, and whole‐class share‐out. Based on existing teaching practices synthesized from prior studies, as well as empirical data from the study, we identify the intermediate‐level practices (teaching moves) and technique‐level practices (talk moves) enacted by PSTs when orchestrating group work as well as the PSTs' strengths and missed opportunities in enacting these different grain‐sized practices. Findings reveal that, although the PSTs were able to enact a variety of talk moves when orchestrating group work, they missed opportunities to engage in intermediate‐level practices. For example, there were only a few instances in which the PSTs could explicitly work with the student thinking they noticed while circulating among the groups during whole‐class share‐out. We also identify three ways in which the PSTs used this intermediate‐level practice, reflective of their differing orientations toward using student thinking. We propose an integrative framework that decomposes the focal core practice into a nested set of practices of varying grain sizes, including medium grain‐sized teaching moves and small grain‐sized talk moves, during and across the key stages of group work. We discuss the implications of our findings for science teacher preparation and methodological approaches for capturing PSTs' enactment of the focal core practice, as well as the possible contributions of the framework.</jats:p>",

Without paying attention to atomistic details, continuum mechanics can provide us very accurate predictions as long as continuum approximation is valid. There are various continuum mechanics formulations available in the literature. The most common formulation was proposed by Cauchy 200 years ago and the equation of motion for a material point is described by using partial differential equations. Although these equations have been successfully utilised for the analysis of many different challenging problems of solid mechanics, they encounter difficulties when dealing with problems including discontinuities such as cracks. In such cases, a new continuum mechanics formulation, peridynamics, can be more suitable since the equations of motion in peridynamics are in integro-differential equation form and do not contain any spatial derivatives. In nano-materials, material properties close to the surfaces can be different than bulk properties. This variation causes surface stresses. In this study, modified core–shell model is utilised to define the variation of material properties in the surface region by considering surface effects. Moreover, directional effective material properties are obtained by utilising analytical and peridynamic solutions.</jats:p>",

Pre and post training outcome measures included one repetition maximum (1-RM) leg press for lower body strength, standing vertical jump (VJ) for lower body power, and double leg lowering (DLL), hip abduction isometric strength (HAIS), and Sorensen (SOR) tests for core stability. Results: There was a significant (p≤ 0.05) main effect of time across all variables, such that both groups improved scores on 1-RM leg press, VJ, DLL, HAIS, and SOR. Additionally, the magnitude of improvement (Cohen’s d) was larger in UL for all variables except VJ, which was larger in the BL group. Conclusion: This study adds to the growing body of literature investigating the effects of UL resistance training in athletic populations. Similar improvements following UL or BL resistance training suggest that both methods can effectively enhance strength, power, and core stability.

It was confirmed that the independently accessed core gate can be used for adjustment of the firing threshold voltage to compensate random conductance variation before the learning and to fix inference error caused by unwanted synapse conductance change after the learning. This threshold voltage tuning can also be utilized for homeostatic function during the learning process. Furthermore, a myelination function which controls the transmission rate was obtained based on the inherent asymmetry between the source and drain in vertical NW structure. Finally, using the CSDG NW neuron device, a letter recognition test was conducted by SPICE simulation for a system-level validation. This multi-functional neuron device can contribute to construct a high-density monolithic SNN hardware combining with the previously developed vertical synapse MOSFET devices.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, the effects of an integrated core and plyometric training program on rhythmic gymnastics (RG) performance are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an integrated functional CPT program on young rhythmics gymnasts’ postural performance. A sample of 44 young female rhythmic gymnasts from a competitive team (age = 10.5 ± 1.8 years) participated in the study. The subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. Pre- and posttest design was used. Postural control was assessed using single-leg stance tests and RG-specific balances over a force platform and evaluated by expert RG judges. The experimental group (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 23) completed an 8-week functional CPT program based on RG technical requirements. Meanwhile, the control group (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 21) received their usual training sessions. A mixed model of analysis of variance was applied to evaluate the effects of an intrasubject factor and an intersubject factor on each of the dependent variables. After 8 weeks, the experimental group obtained significant better results in some variables of the right support leg with eyes open and left support leg with eyes open single-leg support (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .01), improvements were also found in some specific RG balances: Arabesque measured on the force platform (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .01) and the side leg with help balance scored by the judges (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .01). In conclusion, an integrated functional CPT program improved postural control in young rhythmic gymnasts. Coaches should consider using this CPT to improve RG performance.</jats:p>",

Objectives: Considering the importance of the role of environmental barriers in disability and function, this study aimed to investigate the environmental barriers affecting the function of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) based on the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for MS. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on individuals with MS who are registered in the ICF Medical Commission. The participants completed the consent form, the Persian version of the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and a demographic questionnaire based on the ICF Core Set for MS. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 25). Results: A total of 140 individuals with MS (34 males and 106 females) participated in this study. The most frequently reported environmental barriers were structural and physical, and the least frequently reported barriers were related to work and school. The barriers related to attitudes and support were significantly associated with the motor function (P = 0.003) and total FIM score (P = 0.002). The variables of attitudes and support and policies were the main predictors of motor function (RS = 0.093, P &lt; 0.001) and the total FIM score (RS = 0.109, P &lt; 0.001), respectively. None of the barriers was significant and predictive of cognitive function. Conclusions: Since environmental barriers can affect the function of MS patients, authorities should implement the necessary strategies to eliminate these barriers and facilitate participation.</jats:p>"

Nanoparticle size is important in super-resolution microscopy to get an accurate size of the object of interest from image analysis. Due to their self-blinking behavior and metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF), Ag@SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and Au@Ag@SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanoparticles have shown promise as probes for localization-based super-resolution microscopy. Here, several noble metal-based dye-doped core-shell nanoparticles have been investigated as self-blinking nanomaterial probes. It was observed that both the gold- and silver-plated nanoparticle cores exhibit weak luminescence under certain conditions due to the surface plasmon resonance bands produced by each metal, and the gold cores exhibit blinking behavior which enhances the blinking and fluorescence of the dye-doped nanoparticle. However, the silver-plated nanoparticle cores, while weakly luminescent, did not exhibit any blinking; the dye-doped nanoparticle exhibited the same behavior as the core fluorescent, but did not blink. Because of the blinking behavior, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) super-resolution analysis was able to be performed with performed on the gold core nanoparticles. A preliminary study on the use of these nanoparticles for localization-based super-resolution showed that these nanoparticles are suitable for use in STORM super resolution. Resolution enhancement was two times better than the diffraction limited images, with core sizes reduced to 15 nm using the hybrid Au–Ag cores. </jats:p>",

Herein, it is demonstrated with various bare polymeric core NPs, such as poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether‐block‐PLGA, and poly(caprolactone), that certain observed core‐shell structures are actually artifacts caused by the staining process. To address this issue, fluorescence quenching was applied to quantify the proportion of fully coated NPs and statistical TEM analysis was used to identify and differentiate whether the observed core‐shell structures of CM‐coated PLGA (CM−PLGA) NPs are due to artifacts or to the CM coating. Integrated shells in TEM images of negatively stained CM−PLGA NPs are identified as artifacts. The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM‐coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers to use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.</jats:p>",

In this study, thirty-two yeasts isolated from lychees were screened for thermotolerance, and seven selected isolates were identified as Candida tropicalis (isolates H8, H19, and H23), Meyerozyma guilliermondii (isolates H1 and H12) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (isolates H10 and H18). They tolerated up to 45 °C, 12% (v/v) ethanol concentration, 10 g/L acetic acid, and 5 g/L furfural, respectively, and produced 47.96 to 70.18 g/L of ethanol from 160 g/L glucose at 40 °C during 48 h of fermentation. Among the evaluated yeasts, M. guilliermondii H1 showed great potential for second-generation bioethanol fermentation with its ability to ferment xylose and arabinose. Under the optimal conditions resulting from a Plackett Burman design and a Box Behnken design, the highest ethanol concentration of 11.12 g/L was produced from 40 g/L substrate-based sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (non-detoxified hydrolysate) at 40 °C by M. guilliermondii H1. These findings suggested that the newly isolated thermotolerant yeast M. guilliermondii H1 is a good candidate for ethanol production from agricultural wastes.</jats:p>"

As anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), ZnO/Co3O4 has good cycling stability, the specific discharge capacity of ZnO/Co3O4 is stable at about 640 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, and its coulombic efficiency (CE) is stable above 95% after the first 20 cycles. When the current density is 0.6 A/g, the discharge capacity is 420 mAh g−1. This excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to its unique porous hollow structure and unique heterojunction electrode interface, which improves the Li+ storage capacity, increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, and improves the overall electrochemical activity. In addition, the synergistic effect of ZnO and Co3O4 also plays an important role in improving the electrochemical performance.</jats:p>"

Ice-core nitrate isotopes are suspected\nto be influenced by column ozone variability and δ15N(NO3-) has been sought to serve as a proxy of column\nozone variability. In this study, we examined the ability of ice-core\nnitrate isotopes to reflect column ozone variability by measuring δ15N(NO3-) and Δ17O(NO3-) in a shallow\nice core drilled at the South Pole. The ice core covers the period 1944–2005, and during this period δ15N(NO3-) showed\nlarge annual variability ((59.2 ± 29.3) ‰ ), but\nwith no apparent response to the Antarctic ozone hole. Utilizing a snow\nphotochemical model, we estimated 6.9 ‰ additional\nenrichments in δ15N(NO3-) could be caused by the\ndevelopment of the ozone hole. Nevertheless, this enrichment is small and\nmasked by the effects of the snow accumulation rate at the South Pole over the same period of the ozone hole. The Δ17O(NO3-) record\nhas displayed a decreasing trend by ∼ 3.4 ‰\nsince 1976. This magnitude of change cannot be caused by enhanced\npost-depositional processing related to the ozone hole. Instead, the Δ17O(NO3-) decrease was more likely due to the proposed\ndecreases in the O3 / HOx ratio in the extratropical Southern\nHemisphere. Our results suggest ice-core δ15N(NO3-)\nis more sensitive to snow accumulation rate than to column ozone, but at\nsites with a relatively constant snow accumulation rate, information of column ozone variability embedded in δ15N(NO3-) should be\nretrievable.\n                    </jats:p>"

The scattering of electromagnetic (EM) plane waves by the aforementioned configuration was studied; the EM waves impinged obliquely upon the structure and were arbitrarily polarized. The formulation used was based on the boundary-value approach coupled with the generalized separation of variables method. The EM field in each region of space was expanded in cylindrical wave-functions. Furthermore, the translational addition theorem of these functions was applied in order to match the EM field components on any cylindrical interface and enforce the boundary conditions. The end result of the analysis is an infinite set of linear algebraic equations with the wave amplitudes as unknowns. The system is solved by the truncation of series and unknowns and then matrix inversion; thus, we provide a semi-analytical solution for the scattered far-field and, as a consequence, for the scattering cross section of the complex cylindrical structure. The numerical results focus on calculations of the electric- and magnetic-field intensity of the far-field as well as of the total scattering cross section of several geometric configurations that fall within the aforementioned general structure. The effect of the geometrical and electrical characteristics of the structure on the scattered field was investigated. Specifically, the cylinders’ size and spacing, their conductivity and permittivity as well as the incidence direction were modified in order to probe how these variations are imprinted on scattering. Moreover, comparisons with previously published results, as well as convergence tests, were performed; all tests and comparisons proved to be successful.</jats:p>"

Thus, the studies of thermal, optical and electrochemical properties were carried out based on differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, electronic absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The ongoing consideration of experimental results was complemented by theoretical calculations using the density functional theory method. The donor activity of obtained compounds was tested in bulk-heterojuntion photovoltaic cells with structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/imine:PCBM/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/imine:P3HT:PCBM/Al).

Among diverse nanomaterials, electrospun nanofibers provide several advantages over other nanomaterials, including a high aspect ratio, uniform distribution, and a facile fabrication process. In the present study, an electrode composed of a core-shell (PVDF)-(Al) structured nanofiber mesh film was fabricated via electrospinning and sputtering processes, without any hightemperature heat treatment or wet chemical treatment. A free-standing circular collector was used to form a PVDF nanofiber mesh film, to perform the conformal coating of Al onto the PVDF surfaces. The parameters of the tip-to-collector distance and the electrospinning voltage needed to stably form a PVDF nanofiber mesh film were determined. The sheet resistance of the mesh film was dramatically reduced from 1870 Ω/sq. to 154 Ω/sq. when the sputtering time was increased from 2 min to 4 min, an outcome explained by the changed surface morphology of the Al coating layer. The sheet resistance decreased from 657 Ω/sq. to 15.4 Ω/sq. with an increase in the electrospinning time from 2 min to 8 min due to the increased numbers of nanofibers and junctions. When the transmittance at 550 nm with respect to the sheet resistance was plotted for these mesh films, the graph was divided into the bulk and percolation regimes. Mesh films with transmittance rates that exceeded 85% exhibited sheet resistance that clearly increased with an increase in transmittance, indicating a percolation network. Finally, the durability of the core-shell (PVDF)-(Al) structured nanofiber mesh film was evaluated using a repetitive bending test, the results of which clearly showed superior performance over Al thin film. With inexpensive metal Al, a competitive flexible and transparent electrode was fabricated in the form of a core-shell (PVDF)-(Al) structured nanofiber mesh film.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or Krebs cycle, is the central pathway of energy production in eukaryotic cells and plays a key part in aerobic respiration throughout all kingdoms of life. The enzymes involved in this cycle generate the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2 by a series of enzymatic reactions, which are utilized by the electron transport chain to produce ATP. One of the pivotal enzymes in this cycle is 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC), which generates NADH by oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. OGDHC is a megadalton protein complex originally thought to be assembled just from three catalytically active subunits (E1o, E2o, E3). In fungi and animals, however, the protein MRPS36 has more recently been proposed as a putative additional component. Based on extensive XL-MS data obtained from measurements in mice and bovine heart mitochondria, supported by phylogenetic analyses, we provide evidence that MRPS36 is an essential member of OGDHC, albeit only in eukaryotes. Comparative sequence analysis and computational structure predictions reveal that in eukaryotic OGDHC, E2o does not contain the peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD), present in bacterial and archaeal E2o’s. We propose that in eukaryotes MRPS36 evolved as an E3 adaptor protein, functionally replacing the PSBD. We further provide a refined structural model of the complete eukaryotic OGDHC containing 16 E1o, 12 E3, and 6 subunits of MRPS36 accommodated around the OGDHC core composed of 24 E2o subunits (3.45 MDa). The model provides new insights into the OGDH complex topology and stipulates putative mechanistic implications.</jats:p>"

It is shown that the different number of α and β electrons in the d shell of Mn perturbs the inner shells, with shifts between the α and β eigenvalues that can be as large as 6 eV for the 3s level, and is far from negligible also for the 2s and 2p states. The valence electrons of F are polarized by the majority spin electrons of Mn, and in turn, spin polarize their 1s electrons. When a pseudopotential is used, such a spin polarization of the core functions of Mn and F can obviously not take place. The importance of such a spin polarization can be appreciated by comparing (i) the spin density at the Mn and F nuclear position, and then the Fermi contact constant, a crucial quantity for the hyperfine coupling, and (ii) the ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic energy difference, when obtained with an all electron or a pseudopotential scheme, and exploring how the latter varies with pressure. This difference is as large as 50% of the all electron datum, and is mainly due to the rigid treatment of the F ion core. The effect of five different functionals on the core spin polarization is documented.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to synthesize core-shell nanoparticles <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> green method which utilised crude peels extract of <jats:italic>Garcinia mangostana</jats:italic> as reducing and stabilising agents for drug delivery. Gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles (Au-AgNPs) were synthesized through seed germination process in which gold nanoparticles acted as the seed. A complete coating was observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) when the ratio of AuNPs and AgNPs was 1:9. The size of Au-AgNPs was 38.22 ± 8.41 nm and was mostly spherical in shape. Plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was loaded on the Au-AgNPs to investigate their anticancer activity. In HCT116 colon cancer cells, PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs (IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> = 10.78 μg/ml) showed higher inhibitory action than the free PCA (IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>= 148.09 μg/ml) and Au-AgNPs alone (IC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>= 24.36 μg/ml). Up to 80% inhibition of HCT116 cells was observed after the treatment of PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs at 15.63 μg/ml. The PCA-loaded Au-AgNPs also showed a better selectivity towards HCT116 compared to CCD112 colon normal cells when tested at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that Au-AgNPs system can be used as a potent nanocarrier to combat cancerous cells by offering additional anticancer properties to the loaded drug.</jats:p>"

A simple learning procedure of output weights is used for reservoir computing. However, the lack of training of input-node and inter-node connection weights limits the performance of reservoir computing. The use of multiple reservoirs can be a solution to overcome this limitation of reservoir computing. In this study, we investigate parallel and deep configurations of delay-based all-optical reservoir computing using semiconductor lasers with optical feedback by combining multiple reservoirs to improve the performance of reservoir computing. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid configuration to maximize the benefits of parallel and deep reservoirs. We perform the chaotic time-series prediction task, nonlinear channel equalization task, and memory capacity measurement. Then, we compare the performance of single, parallel, deep, and hybrid reservoir configurations. We find that deep reservoirs are suitable for a chaotic time-series prediction task, whereas parallel reservoirs are suitable for a nonlinear channel equalization task. Hybrid reservoirs outperform other configurations for all three tasks. We further optimize the number of reservoirs for each reservoir configuration. Multiple reservoirs show great potential for the improvement of reservoir computing, which in turn can be applied for high-performance edge computing.</jats:p>",

In the multivariate analyses, the prostate volume was shown to be the only significant predictor of overall complications, infectious complications, bleeding related complications, and Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 2 complications after prostate biopsy (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> &lt; .001). The present study demonstrates the safety of MRI-TRUS FTPB in terms of complications, compared with that of TRUS-PB. Although the combination of MRI-TRUS FTPB and 12-core TRUS-PB provides enhanced diagnostic power, MRI-TRUS FGB alone could provide a reasonable diagnostic value for prostate cancer if the apparent diffusion coefficient suspicious grade of prostate cancer is ≥4. When the Likert suspicious grade of prostate cancer on the apparent diffusion coefficient map of multiparametric MRI was 3, 13.9% (27/194) of the patients were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa); 44.4% (12/27) of them were confirmed as csPCa at the MRI-targeted cores. When the apparent diffusion coefficient suspicious grade was ≥4, 43.0% (108/251) were diagnosed with csPCa; 76.8% (83/108) of them were confirmed to have csPCa at the MRI-targeted cores.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Extensive measurements of sound speed and attenuation have been performed on sandy sediments over the last few decades, which have motivated a variety of physical sediment acoustics models. Recently, the seabed characterization experiment (SBCEX) was performed in 2015–2017, in part, to quantify the geoacoustic properties of a clayey-silt accumulation, known as the New England Mud Patch (NEMP). Due to the variability and frequency range reported by the various direct measurements and geoacoustic inversions, the sound speed measured in the NEMP lacked any noticeable frequency dependence. In 2022, an additional coring cruise was completed in the NEMP area and included shipboard core and resonance logger (CARL) measurements, expanding upper limit of the band to 1 MHz. CARL measured sound speed and attenuation as a function of depth from 100 kHz to 1 MHz using a time-of-flight technique, and sound speed along the entire core length from 12 kHz to 16 kHz using a resonance technique. Positive dispersion and depth dependance was observed in the 200 kHz to 1 MHz band. The frequency and depth dependence of the CARL measurements will be presented and compared with previously published model fits to the 2015–2017 SBCEX dataset. [Work sponsored by ONR.]</jats:p>",

To explore the possible link between product creativity and business model, we conduct a study on ArtiShock Theatre—Kazakhstan’s first independent theatre. Our study suggests that a creative enterprise can address both competition and environmental shocks through the process consisting of exploratory re-forming, experimental organizing leading to the development of ‘challenging stereotypes’ as a core competence.

Their diversity and abundance can be affected by agricultural practices which include cropping systems such as rotations and intercropping. Despite the importance of cropping systems in increasing productivity, knowledge of the fungal mycobiome and the core inhabitants for under-utilised cereal and legume crops, particularly over a period, is still limited. The core mycobiomes in plant tissues and bulk soils of a cereal–legume intercrop were characterized over two years using high-throughput sequencing. The intercropping trial consisted of sorghum, Bambara groundnut, cowpea, dry bean, and soybean. A greater number of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) were found in plant tissues compared to those from the soils and between year one and year two. Principal coordinate analyses revealed that fungal communities for each year were relatively distinct, particularly for the soils. The core mycobiome was dominated by a Davidiellaceae sp. (Cladosporium), Didymellaceae sp. 1 (Phoma), Didymellaceae sp. 2 (Epicoccum), Fusarium sp. 2, Unidentified (Ascomycota), and Cryptococcus MOTUs that were present in all plant tissues and soils of year one and two. Other key MOTUs were only specific to a year, substrate, or crop. Although the mycobiome of sorghum were more distinct than the cores of the legumes, there were still MOTUs dominant across all of the crops. Characterization of this baseline core across two years provides insight into those fungi that are always present in these crops, and that could be utilized in improving crop performance and productivity.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, a beam with a highly-peaked transverse spatial profile can achieve a higher fraction of the total beam charge in the core. The same effect can be seen when the witness beam’s transverse momentum profile has a peaked non-Gaussian distribution.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, new information concerning the optical properties of black phosphorus (BP) sheets chemically/electrochemically functionalized with diphenyl amine (DPA) and its macromolecular compound (poly(diphenylamine) (PDPA)) in the absence/presence of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is reported. Raman scattering and FTIR spectroscopy studies indicate that the interaction of BP with PTA leads to the elimination of the PxOy layer onto the surface of the BP sheets. In the case of the chemical interaction of BP with DPA, the reaction product corresponds to DPA chemically functionalized BP sheets having an imino-phosphorane (IP) structure. The electrochemical oxidation of BP sheets chemically functionalized with DPA in the presence of PTA leads to an increase in the weight of P-N bonds as a consequence of the generation of PDPA doped with the PTA heteropolyanions, as shown by FTIR spectroscopy and Raman scattering. This process is evidenced by a shift of the Raman line from 362 cm−1 to 378 cm−1, assigned to the A1g mode. This change was explained by taking into account the compression of the layers containing P atoms, which is induced by PDPA macromolecular chains. The decrease in the intensity of the PL spectra of DPA as well as PDPA, in the presence of BP, indicates that BP acts as a PL quenching agent for these compounds. A preferential orientation of the PDPA doped with the PTA heteropolyanions on the surface of BP sheets is highlighted by the variation of the binding angle of the PDPA on the surface of BP sheets from 44.7° to 39.9°.</jats:p>"

Their green/yellow emission exhibits pronounced vibrational structure and high resistance toward photobleaching, while broad red photoluminescence is sensitive to solvents, temperature, and UV–IR. Under UV–IR, the red emission is gradually bleached due to the photoinduced dehydration of the deprotonated surface of CDs in dimethyl sulfoxide, while this process is hindered in water.

The study of the association of phenotypic traits with genetic factors is vital for the rapid and efficient identification and selection of eggplant genetic resources for breeding purposes with desired traits. The eggplant resources (587) collected from different countries, including Korea, were used for establishing the core collection. A total of 288 accessions were selected from 587 Solanum accessions based on 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers together with 17 morphological traits. This core collection was further used to analyze the genetic associations of eggplant morphological variations. A large variation was found among the evaluated eggplant accessions for some agro-morphological traits. Stem prickles and leaf prickles showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.83***), followed by days to flowering and days to maturity (r = 0.64***). A total of 114,981 SNPs were filtered and used for phylogenetic tree analysis, population structure analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS). Among the agro-morphological traits, significantly associated SNPs were found for six traits. A total of 377 significantly associated SNPs with six agro-morphological traits were identified. These six traits and the number of SNPs were: days to maturity (51), flower size (121), fruit width (20), harvest fruit color (42), leaf prickles (38), and stem prickles (105). The largest fraction of significant SNPs (11.94%) was obtained on chromosome Ch01, followed by Ch07 and Ch06 with 11.67% and 10.08%, respectively. This study will help to develop markers linked to the most important agro-morphological traits of eggplant genetic resources and support the selection of desirable traits for eggplant breeding programs.</jats:p>"

The measurement of CBT has been shown to predict heat-related illness and its severity, but the current measurement methods are not practical for use in high acuity and high motion settings due to their invasive and obstructive nature or excessive costs. Noninvasive predictions of CBT using wearable technology and predictive algorithms offer the potential for continuous CBT monitoring and early intervention to prevent HRI in athletic, military, and intense work environments. Thus far, there has been a lack of peer-reviewed literature assessing the efficacy of wearable devices and predictive analytics to predict CBT to mitigate heat-related illness. This systematic review identified 20 studies representing a total of 25 distinct algorithms to predict the core body temperature using wearable technology. While a high accuracy in prediction was noted, with 17 out of 18 algorithms meeting the clinical validity standards. few algorithms incorporated individual and environmental data into their core body temperature prediction algorithms, despite the known impact of individual health and situational and environmental factors on CBT. Robust machine learning methods offer the ability to develop more accurate, reliable, and personalized CBT prediction algorithms using wearable devices by including additional data on user characteristics, workout intensity, and the surrounding environment. The integration and interoperability of CBT prediction algorithms with existing heat-related illness prevention and treatment tools, including heat indices such as the WBGT, athlete management systems, and electronic medical records, will further prevent HRI and increase the availability and speed of data access during critical heat events, improving the clinical decision-making process for athletic trainers and physicians, sports scientists, employers, and military officers.</jats:p>"

In this context, it is of practical significance to measure the logistics capacity of the core cities along the B&amp;R. Since combing domestic and overseas research, this paper first uses clustering analysis to screen out nine core cities along the B&amp;R and then uses fuzzy matter-element analysis to measure their urban logistics capacity and sort them. The results show that the urban logistics capacity in the eastern coastal areas of China is higher than that in northwest and southwest China. The logistics capacity of cities along “The 21st Century Sea Silk Road” is more robust than that of others and through the urban agglomeration could further achieve economies of scale. The logistics capacity of cities along the “Silk Road Economic Zone” should improve the construction of logistics infrastructure and enhance logistics information in the future.</jats:p>",

To overcome the difficulty in treating intestinal E. coli infections, an oral intelligent-responsive chitosan-oligosaccharide (COS)–sodium alginate (SA) composite core-shell nanogel loaded with enrofloxacin was explored. The formulation screening, characteristics, pH-responsive performance in gastric juice and the intestinal tract, antibacterial effects, therapeutic effects, and biosafety level of the enrofloxacin composite nanogels were investigated. The optimized concentrations of COS, SA, CaCl2, and enrofloxacin were 8, 8, 0.2, and 5 mg/mL, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency, size, loading capacity, zeta potential, and polydispersity index of the optimized formulation were 72.4 ± 0.8%, 143.5 ± 2.6 nm, 26.6 ± 0.5%, −37.5 ± 1.5 mV, and 0.12 ± 0.07, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that enrofloxacin-loaded nanogels were incorporated into the nano-sized cross-linked networks. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the nanogels were prepared by the electrostatic interaction of the differently charged groups (positive amino groups (-NH3+) of COS and the negative phenolic hydroxyl groups (-COO−) of SA). In vitro, pH-responsive release performances revealed effective pH-responsive performances, which can help facilitate targeted “on-demand” release at the target site and ensure that the enrofloxacin has an ideal stability in the stomach and a responsive release in the intestinal tract. The antibacterial activity study demonstrated that more effective bactericidal activity against E. coli could have a better treatment effect than the enrofloxacin solution. Furthermore, the enrofloxacin composite nanogels had great biocompatibility. Thus, the enrofloxacin composite core-shell nanogels might be an oral intelligent-responsive preparation to overcome the difficulty in treating intestinal bacterial infections.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A cornerstone of broken windows theory concerns public perceptions of disorder and crime, and the citizens’ “panic response” with the onset of disorder in their neighborhoods. Naturally, assuming this dynamic to exist lends support for a significant expansion of police operations from traditional crime control to order maintenance. More specifically, the advocates of the theory presume that citizens view disorder and crime as two distinctive constructs, and further that the former triggers the latter. Broken windows theory was quite popular during the 1990s and early 2000s, a period in which order maintenance or quality of life policing reached its apex of popularity. Findings from recent studies on public perceptions of disorder and crime, however, have called into serious question: the cognitive distinction between crime and disorder. Using data collected from a random telephone survey of residents residing in the Houston metropolitan area, we follow this line of research and test the hypothesized dynamics underlying broken windows theory. Our principal findings suggest that neither a one-factor model (convergent) nor a two-factor model (discriminant) fit the empirical data when an appropriate concept validation process is carried out. Implications are drawn for broken windows theory and some specific recommendations are made for future research at the end of the study. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ice core drilling with air reverse circulation is a promising technology that uses high-speed airflow to transport the ice core from the bottom of the hole along the central passage of the drill pipe to the surface. Understanding how the ice core moves through the pipe is crucial for this technology in order to calculate the pneumatic parameters. In this paper, experimental study and the CFD dynamic mesh technique are used to analyze the ice core transport process and flow field characteristics. In order to prove the correctness of the dynamic mesh technique, the simulation results were verified with the experimental results, and it was found that all the simulation data were in agreement with the experimental data trend, and the maximum error was less than 10%. According to the study, once the ice core’s velocity reaches its maximum throughout the transport process, it does not change. The ice core’s maximum velocity increases with the diameter ratio and decreases with the length-to-diameter ratio, while eccentricity has no impact on the maximum velocity. When the air velocity reaches 21 m/s, the diameter ratio for the ice core with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 increases from 0.80 to 0.92, and the maximum velocity increases from 8.92 m/s to 17.45 m/s. Data fitting demonstrates that the equation Vmax=−1.04V0 + 1.04Va describes the relationship between the ice core’s maximum velocity, Vmax, and air velocity, Va. Finally, we obtain the ice core’s suspension velocity model using CFD simulation to calculate the suspension velocity, V0.</jats:p>"

Vertical piezoelectric force microscopy observation indicated that the spontaneous polarization Ps with a downward direction was dominant, and the epitaxial KNN thin films were naturally polarized. The epitaxial KNN thin films exhibited low relative dielectric constant (εr ∼ 267). In addition, piezoelectric coefficients |e31,f| showed a constant value of about 6.5 C m−2 with the increase in applied positive voltages. Relatively high converse |e31,f| values were obtained at low applied voltages due to an intrinsic piezoelectric effect. Therefore, the epitaxial KNN thin films might enable piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems driven at low applied voltages.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dry iron core reactors are widely used in various power quality applications. Manufacturers want to optimize the cost and loss simultaneously, which is normally achieved by the designers’ experience. This approach is highly subjective and can lead to a non-ideal product. Thus, an objective dry iron core reactor design approach to balance the cost and loss with a scientific basis is desired. In this paper, a multi-objective optimal design method is proposed to optimize both the cost and loss of the reactor, which provides an automatic and scientific design method. Specifically, a three-dimensional finite element model of dry iron core reactor is established, based on which the dependency of cost and loss upon the wire size of the reactor’s winding is studied by using joint Matlab-finite element method (FEM) simulation. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to search for the Pareto optimal solution set, out of which the optimal wire size of the reactor is determined by using the fusion of the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method and the entropy weight method. TOPSIS helps the designer to balance the concern between cost and loss, while the entropy weight method can determine the weight information through the dispersion degree of cost and loss. This methodology can avoid personal random subjective opinion when selecting the design solution out of the Pareto set. The calculation shows that the cost and loss can be reduced by up to 17.85% and 19.45%, respectively, with the proposed method. Furthermore, the obtained optimal design is approved by experimental tests.</jats:p>"

First, it is one of the ways which might help to fight antimicrobial resistance and bacterial contamination due to uncontrolled biofilm growth. Second, minimizing harmful environmental outcomes due to the overuse of toxic chemicals is one of the highest priorities nowadays. We propose the application of two common natural compounds, chitosan and tannic acid, for the creation of a highly crosslinked polymer blend with not only intrinsic antimicrobial properties but also reducing and stabilizing powers. Thus, the fast and green synthesis of fine spherically shaped Ag nanoparticles and further study of the composition and properties of the colloids took place. A positively charged core-shell nanocomposition, with an average size in terms of the metal core of 17 ± 4 nm, was developed. Nanoantimicrobials were characterized by several spectroscopic (UV-vis and FTIR) and microscopic (transmission and scanning electron microscopies) techniques. The use of AgNPs as a core and an organic polymer blend as a shell potentially enable a synergistic long-lasting antipathogen effect. The antibiofilm potential was studied against the food-borne pathogens Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes. The antibiofilm protocol efficiency was evaluated by performing crystal violet assay and optical density measurements, direct visualization by confocal laser scanning microscopy and morphological studies by SEM. It was found that the complex nanocomposite has the ability to prevent the growth of biofilm. Further investigation for the potential application of this stable composition in food packaging will be carried out.</jats:p>"

We found Pt shells on Pd rods to be negatively charged because of charge transfer from the Pd substrate when the shell thicknesses were 0.5 or 1 monolayer (ML). The activities of the ORR of the model surface with a Pt shell of 0.5 or 1 ML were similar and more than twice the activities of a Pt/C or Pt rod. The relationship between the ORR activity and the thickness of the Pt shell was the exact opposite of the relationship between the Pt binding energy and the Pt shell thickness. The indication was that more negatively charged Pt had higher ORR activity. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that a single layer of Pt atoms located on Pd was negatively charged compared to pure Pt and resulted in a lower barrier to the rate‐limiting step of the ORR.</jats:p>",

Consequently, underwater sound propagation in the area has also become more variable. The most profound PO feature that breaks off from Gulf Stream instabilities is warm core rings, which have complex interactions with bathymetry and seasonal shelf water masses. Warm core rings can cause shelf water streamers to extend offshore, resulting in surface and/or subsurface acoustic ducting conditions. This study observed acoustic surface ducting and breakdown conditions induced by a shelf water streamer at the New England shelfbreak. Ducting conditions were variable when a subsequent warm core ring intruded the acoustic source and receiver network, mixing with the shelf water streamer and influencing the sound propagation during and after the acoustic duct breakdown period. The field observations were also compared with a broadband numerical model. With increasing gulf stream warm core ring formations, streamer induced surface ducts are becoming more relevant in shelf break acoustics. [Work supported by the Office of Naval Research.]</jats:p>",

Essential gene sets have been determined for several members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the<jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>Keio single-gene deletion library often regarded as a gold standard for gene essentiality studies. However, it remains unclear how gene essentiality varies between related strains and species. To investigate this, we have assembled a collection of thirteen sequenced high-density transposon mutant libraries from five genera within the Enterobacteriaceae. We first benchmark a number of gene essentiality prediction approaches, investigate the effects of transposon density on essentiality prediction, and identify biases in transposon insertion sequencing data. Based on these investigations we develop a new classifier for gene essentiality. Using this new classifier, we define a core essential genome in the Enterobacteriaceae of 201 universally essential genes, and reconstruct an ancestral essential gene set of 296 genes. Despite the presence of a large cohort of variably essential genes, surprisingly we find an absence of evidence for genus-specific essential genes. A clear example of this sporadic essentiality is given by the set of genes regulating the σ<jats:sup>E</jats:sup>extracytoplasmic stress response, which appears to have independently become essential multiple times in the Enterobacteriaceae. Finally, we compare our essential gene sets to the natural experiment of gene loss in obligate insect endosymbionts that have emerged from within the Enterobacteriaceae. This isolates a remarkably small set of genes absolutely required for survival, and uncovers several instances of essential stress responses masked by redundancy in free-living bacteria.</jats:p>"

A common approach to phylogenomics is to extract related genes from each organism, build a multiple sequence alignment and then reconstruct evolution relations through a phylogenetic tree. Often a set of highly conserved genes occurring in single-copy, called core genes, are used for this analysis, as they allow efficient automation within a taxonomic clade. Here we introduce the Universal Fungal Core Genes (UFCG) database and pipeline for genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of fungi. The UFCG database consists of 61 curated fungal marker genes, including a novel set of 41 computationally derived core genes and 20 canonical genes derived from literature, as well as marker gene sequences extracted from publicly available fungal genomes. Furthermore, we provide an easy-to-use, fully automated and open-source pipeline for marker gene extraction, training and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The UFCG pipeline can identify marker genes from genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data, while producing phylogenies consistent with those previously reported, and is publicly available together with the UFCG database at https://ufcg.steineggerlab.com.</jats:p>",

The flexural properties of the beams were derived using a three-point bending test.

According to the maximum sphere algorithm, a digital core pore network model is extracted and established, and the probability distribution characteristics of pore radius, throat radius, pore throat ratio and core pore throat coordination number of different rock samples are studied. The results show that the reservoir space of the samples in the study area is dominated by dissolution pores and micro fractures, with pore radius ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm, throat radius from 0.1 to 7 μm, pore throat ratio from 0 to 4, and coordination number from 0 to 7. The overall pore throat ratio, throat radius and poor throat connectivity are the main reasons for the low core permeability in the study area. It is found that the 3D digital core technology can more accurately evaluate the internal heterogeneity of rocks, and the calculated pore structure parameters include both connected pore information and isolated pore information. Compared with conventional mercury injection and nuclear magnetic resonance, the 3D digital core technology has obvious advantages in the evaluation of rock micro pore structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of pulsed electric fields (PEF) on the in vitro starch digestibility properties of oat flour. A wide range of PEF process intensity was investigated (electric field strength between 2.1 and 4.5 kV/cm and specific energy inputs between 52 and 438 kJ/kg using 20 μs square wave bipolar pulse at 100 Hz). The results revealed that PEF applied at a high electric field strength and energy &lt;216 kJ/kg was favourable in slowing down the rate of starch digestibility (by 48%) during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. This is accompanied by a significant decrease (from 15% to 7–10%) in the proportion of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and a significant increase (from 77% to 84–85%) in resistant starch (RS) fraction. The application of PEF at energy level &gt;421 kJ/kg at any field strength intensities raised the RDS (from 15% to 19–20%), but the rate of starch digestion was not affected (maintained at 3.3–3.7 × 10−2 min−1 vs. untreated at 3.8 × 10−2 min−1). Further analysis of the structure, particle size, and thermal stability of PEF-treated oat flour through fractionation into three distinct flour segments revealed that PEF could cause major modifications in the particle size, damage and aggregation of starch granules, and destruction of the long- and short-range ordered structures of starch. Data gathered in this study indicate that PEF treatment can be a reliable strategy to modulate the in vitro starch digestibility of oat flour, either by reasonably slowing down the digestion rate or enabling a slightly higher amount of starch to be readily accessible by digestive enzymes without affecting the digestion rate.</jats:p>"

However, similar zircon crystallization ages from different source regions greatly hamper the interpretation of sediment dispersal and recycling processes. The Alleghenian–Ouachita–Marathon (AOM) foreland and vicinity in North America is a region where some dominant DZ age groups could come from both the southern Appalachians in the eastern United States and the Gondwanan terranes in Mexico. In this study, we present 1045 new DZ U–Pb ages and 81 DZ core–rim age pairs in lower Permian sandstone in the Permian Basin and Miocene sandstone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). These new data were integrated with published DZ single U–Pb age and core–rim ages from syn‐ to post‐orogenic strata in the Permian Basin, Marathon foldbelt, southern Appalachian foreland basin and eastern GOM to interpret the sediment‐dispersal models in the AOM foreland and eastern GOM. Our models show that during the Leonardian Stage, sediments derived from the Appalachians were first delivered to the US midcontinent and then recycled to the Permian Basin; during the Miocene, sediment from the Appalachians fluxed to the eastern GOM, with no longshore mixing from the western GOM. These models based on the integration of single U–Pb and core–rim ages are consistent with published results that used other methods, including zircon single U–Pb age, zircon Hf isotopic data, zircon (U–Th)/He age, sedimentology and stratigraphy. Our results demonstrate that although some limitations exist, zircon core–rim age is a powerful tool, adding an extra constraint on the interpretation of sediment‐dispersal systems. This tool is particularly applicable to the post‐orogenic stage, during which the sediment pathways are more complicated because of the dominant input from distal sources. Insights gained in this study imply that this novel strategy of using core and rim ages could be integrated with other methods to better understand sediment dispersal.</jats:p>",

Therefore, we need to improve not only ORR activity, but also oxygen diffusivity of Pt-based cathode catalysts for PEFCs. In this study, highly interconnected mesoporous carbon (MPC) [2] was selected as a support of Pd@Pt core-shell catalyst. The Pd@Pt core-shell catalyst NPs were supported on different particle size of the MPC and cell performance was investigated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>2.

As-received MPC with an average size of ca. 2 μm was pulverized to ca. 800, 450, and 250 nm by a wet bead-milling process. The Pd core NPs were loaded on MPCs by an impregnation-thermal reduction method and the Pt shell was formed on the Pd core NPs by a direct displacement reaction method [3]. Characterizations of the MPC, the Pd/MPC cores and the Pt/Pd/MPC catalysts were conducted by N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas adsorption, TG-DTA, XRD, XRF, TEM, SEM, CV and the ORR activity of the catalysts was evaluated by the RDE method. MEAs with 1×1 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> were fabricated by a decal method using a reinforced membrane (12 µm in thickness, Gore) and a GDL (TORAY). The Pt metal loading at the cathode was 0.1 mg-Pt/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Nafion<jats:sup>® </jats:sup>DE2020 was used as an ionomer for the catalyst ink preparation (I/C was set to 0.83). I-V performance was evaluated at 80<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C, 35-95% RH. H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas (418 mL/min.) and air (998 mL/min.) were supplied to the anode and the cathode, respectively, and H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas was pressurized to 150 kPa (ambient + 50 kPa) at gas-outlet.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>3. Results and Discussion</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas adsorption data were analyzed by the <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-plot method and the changes in the total, external and internal surface area of the MPCs pulverized for different times are shown in Figure 1. It was shown that the total and the external surface area increased, while the internal surface area decreased with pulverization time. These results suggest that fresh surface was newly formed by the pulverization, and the fraction of the internal surface was decreased. Figure 2 shows cross-sectional TEM images of the Pt/Pd/MPC catalysts using different sizes of MPC supports (ca. 2,000, 800, 450 and 250 nm), which indicates that the catalyst NPs were uniformly supported throughout the interior of MPC regardless of the particle size of MPC. The ECSA of the Pt/Pd/MPC catalysts changed little with the particle size of MPC (ca. 120 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g-Pt), while the ORR mass activity at 0.9 V was the highest (1,533 A/g-Pt) when the catalyst NPs were supported on relatively large MPC (800 nm).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>I-V curves at 80<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C, 35% RH of the MEAs using the Pt/Pd/MPC cathode catalysts using different sizes of MPC supports are demonstrated in Figure 3. Interestingly, the cell voltage was higher over the entire current density range for Pd@Pt catalysts using MPCs with larger particle sizes (2000 and 800 nm). This tendency was also observed at a high relative humidity of 95% RH. These results suggest that the Pd@Pt catalyst NPs supported on larger MPC (2,000 and 800 nm) contributed to ORR in the high current density range even when the relative humidity was low. Figure 4 compares the connectivity of mesopores in Ketjen Black EC-600JD (KB-600JD, LION) and CNovel<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> MH-18 visualized from 3D-TEM observation results. It is clear that the MPC has a higher mesopore’s connectivity than KB-600JD. Figure 5 shows cross-sectional SEM images of the Pt/Pd/MPC. Larger pores were observed inside of the MPC support. Therefore, it is considered that the high connectivity of the mesopores and the presence of larger pores inside of the MPC support contributed to the superior I-V performance observed in MEAs using the catalysts supported on MPCs with particle size of ca. 2,000 and 800 nm. At present, it is not clear why the catalysts supported on smaller MPCs (450 and 250 nm) exhibited inferior I-V performance, though the oxygen diffusion inside MPCs should be easier than that for larger ones.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This study was partly supported by NEDO, Japan.

The DEGs have been compared with genes in the modules of weighted gene co-expression network analysis to relevant specific traits towards identifying core genes. The expression pattern of transcription factors, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme), and resistance genes was analyzed. The present investigation is supportive of our findings that the gene ontology, immunity stimulus, and resistance genes are upregulated, but physical and metabolic processes such as cell wall organizations and pectin synthesis were downregulated respectively. Our results are indicative that terpene synthase TPS6 and TPS11 are involved in the defense mechanism against fungal infections in maize silk.</jats:p>"

The exact problem under the magnetic field is solved using the Laplace method, which has not been done. The advantages of this method are the simplicity of solving and reducing to zero the error percentage that exists in numerical solutions. The results are compared with previous works. Finally, the effect of various parameters such as magnetic, porosity coefficient, elastic constant, thickness ratio, and velocity of moving load on the dynamic response of the sandwich beam is investigated. It should be noted that the results can be used to construct this type of structure. </jats:p>",

The ROET, which is an expansion of the reaction electronic theories (e.g., the frontier orbital theory) in terms of orbital energies, elucidates the reactive orbitals driving reactions and the charge transferability indices of the reactions. Performing the ROET analyses of these reactions shows that the charge transfer directions given in the rule‐based diagrams of the electronic theory are reproduced even for the functional groups of charge transfer destinations in all but only two processes for 38 reaction processes. The ROET analyses also make clear the detailed orbital‐based pictures of these bond formation reactions: that is, the use of the out‐of‐plane antibonding <jats:italic>π</jats:italic> orbitals in acidic conditions (enol‐mode) and in‐plane antibonding <jats:italic>π</jats:italic> orbitals in basic conditions (enolate‐mode), which explain the experimentally assumed mechanisms such as the <jats:italic>π</jats:italic>‐bond formations in acidic conditions and <jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>‐bond formations at <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐carbons in basic conditions. Furthermore, the ROET analyses explicate that the methyl group initially accepts electrons and then donates them to the bond formations in the target reactions. It is, consequently, suggested that the ROET serves a theoretical foundation for the electronic theory of organic chemistry.</jats:p>",

Moreover, results of a brain-behavior correlation analysis implicate neural entrainment as the underlying mechanism of area 55b’s contribution to music perception. In view of the current results and prior literature, area 55b is proposed as a keystone of sensorimotor integration, a fundamental brain machinery underlying simple to hierarchically complex behaviors. Refining the neuroanatomical and physiological understanding of sensorimotor integration is expected to have a major impact on various fields, from brain disorders to artificial general intelligence.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT  Bhutan’s developmental priorities have evolved to attune with the national needs and global environment. The education policies have also changed, as evident from several policy documents and guidelines. It is apparent that the education policies and practices are primarily influenced by Western thoughts and ideologies. This transpired from the country’s emerging engagements with the international actors and its resultant phenomenon of policy borrowing and emulations of best practices. While sharing educational philosophies and policies are pervasive, without careful attention to the critical ideas of contextualisation and appropriate recognition of local values, policy borrowing can be counterproductive to national aspirations.     With the rapid socio-economic development in the country as it emerges as an active participant in global affairs, the Bhutanese youths are exposed to foreign influences and cultures. There is a potential risk of losing the country’s rich repository of value systems if the education policies are not adapted to re-emphasise on inculcation of core Bhutanese values in education systems.     Given the education reform agenda espoused by His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the 5th King of Bhutan, this paper reviews the national education policy documents with specific reference to the Quarterly Education Policy Guidelines from 1988 to 2020, which is considered an equivalent of policy directives in the absence of an Education Act. The paper populates on an apparent loss of the local values to the burgeoning Western models for educational efficiencies. It renews an emphasis on the traditional values in the education reform policies for Bhutan.      Keywords: Globalization, local values, national ideologies, education, reform</jats:p>"

Mutations that lead to deficiency in NOX2 activity correlate with increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, resulting in chronic granulomatous disease. The core of NOX2 is formed by a heterodimeric transmembrane complex composed of NOX2 (formerly gp91) and p22, but a detailed description of its structural architecture is lacking. Here, we present the structure of the human NOX2 core complex bound to a selective anti-NOX2 antibody fragment. The core complex reveals an intricate extracellular topology of NOX2, a four-transmembrane fold of the p22 subunit, and an extensive transmembrane interface which provides insights into NOX2 assembly and activation. Functional assays uncover an inhibitory activity of the 7G5 antibody mediated by internalization-dependent and internalization-independent mechanisms. Overall, our results provide insights into the NOX2 core complex architecture, disease-causing mutations, and potential avenues for selective NOX2 pharmacological modulation.</jats:p>"

Despite its widespread use and advantages, the honeycomb core is frequently damaged during production and operation, even if the damage is not visible on the face-sheet. In this study, an ultrasonic-guided wave (GW) propagation technique is utilized for robust and reliable nondestructive evaluation of a honeycomb composite sandwich panel (HCSP) in the presence of core crush damage. A 2D semi-analytical model was developed to understand the dispersion characteristics in the HCSP and to identify various modes of GW propagation in the signals. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out using abaqus to study the guided wave interaction with core crush damage. For this purpose, two numerical models were considered (a realistic model with both crushed core and cavity, and a simplified model that only comprises the cavity) and experimentally validated using a contact-type transducer. The presence of core crush damage in an HCSP increases the amplitude and group velocity of the primary antisymmetric mode, and this characteristic has been used for localization of the core crush region in the HCSP. Finally, a damage detection algorithm using signal difference coefficient is presented for successful localization of the core crush region within a square monitoring area. Unlike other studies reported in the literature, we demonstrate the utility of the simplified numerical model for studying GW interactions with core crush defect and experimentally validate the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique to localize core crush defect on an HCSP.</jats:p>",

With increasing concerns about climate change, EV is considered as a next generation vehicle because EV did not emit pollutants such as CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, NO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> and SO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>. Over the past years, Nd<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>14</jats:sub>B is mainly used as PM in EV due to excellent maximum energy product (BH<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) around room temperature. However, The Nd<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>14</jats:sub>B has relatively low operating temperature (&lt;200℃), which limits high speed operation. On the other hand, SmCo<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> possesses high thermal, chemical stability and coercivity (H<jats:sub>c</jats:sub>), making it a suitable magnetic material for high speed operation in harsh environment. However, unfortunately SmCo<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> PM was only used in limited areas due to the lower M<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>, M<jats:sub>r</jats:sub>, BH<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> than Nd<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>14</jats:sub>B. Therefore, interest in research to improve magnetic properties of SmCo<jats:sub>5 </jats:sub>is increasing. In particular, exchange coupling in core/shell structure between hard magnetic core and soft magnetic shell has attracted much attention because it can increase M<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>, M<jats:sub>r</jats:sub>, BH<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> simultaneously while reducing high price RE element. In our work, we utilized electroless deposition on SmCo<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> Nanoparticles (NPs) to fabricate exchange coupled SmCo<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>/FeCo hard/soft nanocomposites because of low cost and easy to control the soft phase thickness by modulating electrolyte bath parameters such as pH, temperature and additives. However, prior research clarified that the exchange coupling in 0-Dimensional NPs via electroless deposition was difficult because of inevitable particle aggregation caused by magnetic dipoles. Thus, inhibition of particle aggregation would be significant breakthrough.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic (RTK) technique is used to achieve relative positioning centimeter levels among multiple agents on the move. A typical GNSS RTK estimates the relative positions of multiple rover receivers with respect to a single-base receiver. In a fleet of rover GNSS receivers, this approach is inefficient because each rover receiver only uses GNSS measurements of its own and those sent from a single-base receiver. In this study, we propose a novel GNSS RTK framework that facilitates the precise positioning of a swarm of moving vehicles through the GNSS measurements of multiple receivers and broadcasts fixed-integer ambiguities of GNSS carrier phases. The proposed framework not only provides efficient RTK positioning but also reliable performance with a limited number of GNSS satellites in view. Our experimental flight tests with six GNSS receivers showed that the systematic procedure of the proposed framework could maintain lower than 6 cm of 3D RMS positioning errors, whereas the conventional RTK failed to resolve the correct integer ambiguities of double difference carrier phase measurements more than 13% in five out of nine total baselines.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a novel diamond-assisted ring-core fiber (DRF) is proposed. With the introduction of a low-refractive-index diamond-shaped region located in the center of the core, the proposed fiber effectively eliminates spatial degeneracy of the LPmn mode groups and maintains a low level of birefringence. Under the fiber structure parameters proposed in this paper, the effective refractive index difference (Δneff) between the spatial modes supported by the fiber in the entire C-band is greater than 2.25 × 10−4, and the Δneff between adjacent modes falls within the scope of (2.11~9.41) × 10−4. The degree of degenerate separation between the two polarization modes of all modes is very low, which is 2~3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the spatial mode. By discussing the mode characteristics of DRF and several other center-assisted ring-core fibers, the method that can be used to manipulate the spatial mode degenerate separation with structural symmetry is obtained, which can be applied to provide guidance for similar fiber designs. The proposed fiber structure is a promising candidate in space division multiplexing systems.</jats:p>"

When considering concentrating solar power (CSP) coupled with an sCO2 power block and sensible thermal storage, the technology presents a clean source for utility-scale power generation to support baseload or peak-load electrical demand. However, the LCOE of the technology is still considered higher than the competing technologies and should be reduced to better compete in the market; 2030 targets for dispatchable solar plants are 5¢/kWh for baseload CSP and 10¢/kWh for peaker plants, as set by the United States Department of Energy. In response to this need, this study is targeting improvements in the power cycle precooler to reduce power block contribution to LCOE. This study considers a dry cooler, as CSP plants are sensitive to water consumption because many installations are slated for remote or arid locations where solar irradiance is very high, but water is scarce. Furthermore, the power block footprint for an sCO2 system is quite compact, especially as compared to a steam cycle. Therefore, there is interest in installing a more compact dry cooler that is proportional to the reduced footprint sCO2 power block, while conventional dry coolers are an order of magnitude larger. The competing goals of size, performance, and cost were considered in this study to develop a compact dry cooler that can easily be packaged with the power block, significantly reducing the installation and transport cost compared to the current state of the art, while maintaining or improving upon the heat transfer performance and impact on plant LCOE. This paper details the high-level findings of a large dry cooler sensitivity study for design point selection, design of the compact dry cooler, expected year-round performance for the dry cooler and the power cycle, and the predicted LCOE for a 30-year plant life. It was found that an aluminum heat exchanger core can be suitably designed to meet the pressure and temperature requirements for a precooler in an sCO2 recompression Brayton cycle. The dry cooler assembly was found to have improved heat transfer performance, allowing for increased cycle efficiencies and a reduced plant LCOE. When coupled with a centrifugal blower and compact transition duct, the dry cooler assembly was able to reduce the installation footprint by over 50%.</jats:p>",

This notion is previously observed through a legal perspective, recognition and respect, as well as the absence of discrimination and religious conflict. However, this article looks at a different viewpoint, by utilising the dynamics of halal dining as an analytical tool to examine dimensions of religious tolerance. The study unpacks the religious tolerance experience in halal dining among Muslims and non-Muslims in Peninsular and East Malaysia. We compare the data of religious tolerance in halal dining from both Peninsular and East Malaysian experiences. Data was collected through quantitative surveys and interviews with Muslim and non-Muslim respondents. The findings show that Malaysians practise a high level of tolerance in dining with a few exceptions. These findings exhibit a new dimension of dining as a practical analytical tool, which might have hitherto been neglected in measuring religious tolerance within a multi-religious context.</jats:p>"

Nitrogen-doped core-sheath graphene-based fibers (NSG@GFs) were obtained with subsequently thermally carbonized polypyrrole/small-sized graphene oxide and graphene oxide fiber slurry (PPY/SGO@GOF). Both nitrogen doping and small-sized graphene sheets can improve the utilization of graphene layers in graphene-based fiber electrode by preventing stacking of the graphene sheets.

The energy density of NSG@GF reaches 3.40 μWh cm−2 after nitrogen doping, which is 2.59 times of that of as-prepared one.

Focusing on two forms of strategic risk – resource allocation risk taking and strategic non‐conformity – we develop hypotheses examining the contingencies across levels of environmental concentration, dynamism, and munificence. We test our hypotheses on a panel of 106 CEOs from publicly traded US companies over a period from 1998 to 2004 using historiometric analyses. Supporting our hypotheses, findings indicate that the effects of CEO CSE on resource allocation risk taking and strategic non‐conformity are contingent on industry concentration and environmental dynamism.

After rehabilitation training, there was no statistically marked difference in eye-opening trajectory length between both groups (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <mi>P</mi>\n                        <mo>&gt;</mo>\n                        <mn>0.05</mn>\n                     </math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vision in the midwater of the open ocean requires animals to perform visual tasks quite unlike those of any other environment. These tasks consist of detecting small, low contrast objects and point sources against a relatively dim and uniform background. Deep-sea animals have evolved many extraordinary visual adaptations to perform these tasks. Linking eye anatomy to specific selective pressures, however, is challenging, not least because of the many difficulties of studying deep-sea animals. Computational modelling of vision, based on detailed morphological reconstructions of animal eyes, along with underwater optics, offers a chance to understand the specific visual capabilities of individual visual systems. Prior to the work presented here, comprehensive models for apposition compound eyes in the mesopelagic, the dominant eye form of crustaceans, were lacking. We adapted a model developed for single-lens eyes and used it to examine how different parameters affect the model’s ability to detect point sources and extended objects. This new model also allowed us to examine spatial summation as a means to improve visual performance. Our results identify a trade-off between increased depth range over which eyes function effectively and increased distance at which extended objects can be detected. This trade-off is driven by the size of the ommatidial acceptance angle. We also show that if neighbouring ommatidia have overlapping receptive fields, spatial summation helps with all detection tasks, including the detection of bioluminescent point sources. By applying our model to the apposition compound eyes of<jats:italic>Phronima</jats:italic>, a mesopelagic hyperiid amphipod, we show that the specialisations of the large medial eyes of<jats:italic>Phronima</jats:italic>improve both the detection of point sources and of extended objects. The medial eyes outperformed the lateral eyes at every modelled detection task. We suggest that the small visual field size of<jats:italic>Phronima</jats:italic>’s medial eyes and the strong asymmetry between the medial and lateral eyes reflect<jats:italic>Phronima</jats:italic>’s need for effective vision across a large depth range and its habit of living inside a barrel. The barrel’s narrow aperture limits the usefulness of a large visual field and has allowed a strong asymmetry between the medial and lateral eyes. The model provides a useful tool for future investigations into the visual abilities of apposition compound eyes in the deep sea.</jats:p>"

We employ radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to model light AGN jet feedback with different accretion modes (Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton and cold accretion) in an idealized Perseus-like cluster. Independent of the probed accretion model, accretion efficiency, jet density and resolution, the cluster self-regulates with central entropies and cooling times consistent with observed cool-core clusters in this non-cosmological setting. We find that increased jet efficiencies lead to more intermittent jet powers and enhanced star formation rates. Our fiducial low-density jets can easily be deflected by orbiting cold gaseous filaments, which redistributes angular momentum and leads to more extended cold gas distributions and isotropic bubble distributions. In comparison to our fiducial low momentum-density jets, high momentum-density jets heat less efficiently and enable the formation of a persistent cold gas disc perpendicular to the jets that is centrally confined. Cavity luminosities measured from our simulations generally reflect the cooling luminosities of the intracluster medium and correspond to averaged jet powers that are relatively insensitive to short periods of low-luminosity jet injection. Cold gas structures in our MHD simulations with low momentum-density jets generally show a variety of morphologies ranging from discy to very extended filamentary structures. In particular, magnetic fields are crucial to inhibit the formation of unrealistically massive cold gas discs by redistributing angular momentum between the hot and cold phases and by fostering the formation of elongated cold filaments that are supported by magnetic pressure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The recovery of a new Antarctic ice core spanning the last ~1.5 million years will advance our understanding of climate system dynamics during the Quaternary. Recent glaciological field surveys have been conducted to select the most suitable core location near Dome Fuji (DF), Antarctica. Specifically, ground-based radar-echo soundings have been used to acquire highly detailed images of bedrock topography and internal ice layers. In this study, we use a one-dimensional (1-D) ice flow model to compute the temporal evolutions of age and temperature, in which the ice flow is linked with not only transient climate forcing associated with past glacial‒interglacial cycles, but also transient basal melting diagnosed along the evolving temperature profile. We investigated the influence of ice thickness, accumulation rate, and geothermal heat flux on the age and temperature profiles. The model was constrained by the observed temperature and age profiles reconstructed from DF ice‒core analysis. The results of sensitivity experiments indicate that ice thickness is the most crucial parameter influencing the computed age of the ice because it is critical to the history of basal temperature and basal melting, which can eliminate old ice. The 1-D model was applied to a 54 km long transect in the vicinity of DF and compared with radargram data. We found that the basal age of the ice is mostly controlled by the local ice thickness, demonstrating the importance of high spatial resolution surveys of bedrock topography for selecting ice-core drilling sites.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this work, a new approach is presented for determining the equation of state for pure neutron matter. This is valid in the temperature- and density-regime where the system behaves like a nonideal gas. Further, the calculations involved are confined to the nonrelativistic and low-energy ([Formula: see text] 150 MeV) regime. The approach is based on evaluating the quantum second virial coefficient [Formula: see text] of the system, where the input potential is the Reid-93 soft-core potential for [Formula: see text], together with the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP) for higher [Formula: see text]. The many-body phase shifts are determined within the framework of a generalized scattering theory, taken here as the Galitskii–Migdal–Feynman formalism. The integral equations involved are solved using a highly-accurate matrix-inversion method. These medium phase shifts are then inserted in the Beth–Uhlenbeck formula to determine [Formula: see text]. Once this coefficient has been calculated, other thermophysical properties of the system can be readily computed according to standard expressions. Specifically, these properties include the equation of state (pressure–temperature–density relations), Helmholtz (free) energy, entropy, mean internal energy, specific heat capacity and chemical potential. Our results are compared, whenever possible, to those of previous calculations. The agreement is, on the whole, fair considering that the available calculations vary considerably among themselves. </jats:p>",

Stillbirth prevention and bereavement care following stillbirth remains a challenge, particularly in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMiC). One approach to improvement is the prioritisation of women/family-centred care. However, there are a large variety of outcomes measured in stillbirth studies and consensus on the outcomes that matter most to women and families is often lacking, which can impact on the ability to make informed decisions about improved care practices. To help mitigate this problem, a core outcome set (COS) has been developed for stillbirth prevention and another COS has recently been finalised for care after stillbirth. Despite the majority of stillbirths occurring in LMiC involvement in these studies is ‘tokenistic’ and therefore the outcomes may not reflect the needs of parents or communities in these settings.

The thermal decomposition activation energy calculation for stranded carbon fiber composite cores was carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The activation energy E of stranded carbon fiber composites was calculated according to the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa, Kissinger, and Coast–Redfern methods, which were 168.76 kJ/mol, 166.79 kJ/mol, and 160.35 kJ/mol, respectively. The results from these different treatments were within 10% or less, and thus the thermochemical reactions of stranded carbon fiber composite cores were considered to be effective. The life prediction model of the carbon fiber composite core was developed based on the kinetic equation of thermal decomposition. The service life is related to the reaction mechanism function G(α) and the reaction rate parameter k(t). The reaction mechanism function G(α) = ((1 − α)−3.3 − 1)/3.3 and the reaction rate parameter k(t) = 2.14 × 1012exp(E/RT) were obtained by fitting the thermal weight loss data of stranded carbon fiber composite cores. Based on the 5% mass loss criterion for the end of life of stranded carbon fiber composites, the service life of the carbon fiber composite core is given at various operating temperatures.</jats:p>"

Oncogenic subversion of CRC TFs is well documented, but the role of loss of tumor suppressors plays remains unclear. Zinc-finger TF CASZ1 is a chromosome 1p36 (chr1p36) tumor suppressor. Single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses indicate that CASZ1 is highly expressed in developing chromaffin cells coincident with an expression of NB CRC TFs. In NB tumor cells, the CASZ1 tumor suppressor is silenced while CRC components are highly expressed. We find the NB CRC component HAND2 directly represses CASZ1 expression. ChIP-seq and transcriptomic analyses reveal that restoration of CASZ1 upregulates noradrenergic neuronal genes and represses expression of CRC components by remodeling enhancer activity. Our study identifies that the restored CASZ1 forms a negative feedback regulatory circuit with the established NB CRC to induce noradrenergic neuronal differentiation of NB.</jats:p>"

To explore the combinatorial approach, multiple therapeutic agents are typically loaded in the delivery vehicles, controlling their release profiles and executing subsequent therapeutic purposes. Herein, we report the fabrication of core (silica)-shell (mesoporous silica nanoparticles, MSNs) architectures to deliver methylene blue (MB) and cupric doxorubicin (Dox) as model drugs for synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). MB, as the photosensitizer, is initially loaded and stabilized in the silica core for efficient singlet oxygen generation under light irradiation towards PDT. The most outside shell with imidazole silane-modified MSNs is immobilized with a chemotherapeutic agent of Dox molecules through the metal (Copper, Cu)-ligand coordination interactions, achieving the pH-sensitive release and triggering the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide and subsequent Fenton-like reaction-assisted Cu-catalyzed free radicals for CDT. Further, the designed architectures are systematically characterized using various physicochemical characterization techniques and demonstrate the potent anti-cancer efficacy against skin melanoma. Together our results demonstrated that the MSNs-based core-shell nanoarchitectures have great potential as an effective strategy in synergistically ablating cancer through chemo-, chemodynamic, and photodynamic therapies.</jats:p>"

Between 30 and 120 GPa, a C23-like (Co2P, Pnma, Z = 4) Fe2S structure is observed and determined to exhibit a highly compressible a axis. A softening of the a axis occurs between 120 and 150 GPa and a relative stiffening of the b and c axes accompanies this compressibility change. Above 150 GPa, the a axis stiffens as the b and c axes soften, and a C37-like (Co2Si, Pnma, Z = 4) Fe2S unit cell is measured. On the basis of these changes in unit cell geometry, a pressure-induced C23–C37 Fe2S phase transition is inferred between 120–150 GPa. The C23 and C37 (Pnma, Z = 4) structures are closely related and share the same site symmetries. Forming the C37 structure from the C23 structure requires a shortening of the a axis and lengthening of the b and c axes accompanied by a four- to fivefold coordination change. The softening of the a axis above 120 GPa may therefore indicate the onset of a coordination change, and the final compressibility change above 150 GPa may mark the completion of this phase transition. The presented pressure-temperature (P-T) stabilities of C23 and C37 structures of Fe2S are in agreement with and resolve the differing observations of two previous studies (Tateno et al. 2019; Zurkowski et al. 2022). As C37 Fe2S is observed to core-mantle boundary pressures and high temperatures, the C37 Fe2S density profile through Earth’s outer core was determined by fitting the C23 Fe2S equation of state (&amp;lt;120 GPa) and applying a 1.6% volume reduction based on the C37 Fe2S volume residuals to this fit. Comparing the density of liquid C37 Fe2S with that of liquid hcp-Fe (Dewaele et al. 2006) and the seismologically determined density deficit of Earth’s core (Irving et al. 2018), 13.9 ± 1.5 wt% and 8.6 ± 0.8 wt% sulfur are required to match the densities at the CMB and ICB, respectively, for a purely Fe-S core.</jats:p>",

Characteristically, these tumors arise in patients with sickle cell trait or other hemoglobinopathies. Recent characterization efforts have unraveled oncogenic pathways that drive tumorigenesis. Among these, gene sets that characterize replicative stress and the innate immune response are upregulated in RMCs. Despite comprehensive genetic and transcriptomic characterizations, commonalities or differences to other SMARCB1 deficient entities so far have not been investigated. We analyzed the methylome of seven primary RMC and compared it to other SMARCB1 deficient entities such as rhabdoid tumors (RT) and epithelioid sarcomas using 850 K methylation arrays. Moreover, we evaluated the differential gene expression of RMC using RNA-sequencing in comparison to other rhabdoid tumors. In accordance with previous gene expression data, we found that RMCs separate from other SMARCB1 deficient entities, pointing to a potentially different cell of origin and a role of additional genetic aberrations that may drive tumorigenesis and thus alter the methylome when compared to rhabdoid tumors. In a focused analysis of genes that are important for nephrogenesis, we particularly detected genes that govern early nephrogenesis such as FOXI1 to be hypomethylated and expressed at high levels in RMC. Overall, our analyses underscore the fact that RMCs represent a separate entity with limited similarities to rhabdoid tumors, warranting specific treatment tailored to the aggressiveness of the disease.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change and human activities significantly affected environmental changes in drylands. However, the relative roles remain unclear regarding these factors’ effects on environment changes in drylands. Herein, we analyzed vegetation change trends using remote-sensing datasets to determine the interactions of vegetation, climate, and anthropogenic activities in an arid region of China, Kubuqi Desert. Our study showed that 67.64% of the pixels of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) increased in 2020 in comparison with those of 1986. The FVC exhibited a significant greening trend (0.0011/yr, p &lt; 0.05) in 1986–2020 as a whole. This greening trend revealed two distinct periods separated by a turning point in 2001. There was no clear trend of FVC before 2001, and then there was a dramatically greening trend since 2001 in most regions of the study area. The increasing rate (0.0036/yr) in the later period was three times higher than the entire period. The accelerated increasing trend was due to the variable compound effects of climate and human activities. The correlation between FVC and precipitation was mainly positive, which outweighs the significantly negative correlation between vegetation and temperature. However, both climatic factors cannot well explain the trends of vegetation dynamics, implying a possible role for human activities. Generally, climate change and anthropogenic activities contributed 42.15% and 57.85% to the overall vegetation variations in 1986–2020. Specifically, the relative role of the two factors was vastly different in two distinct periods. Climate change led the dominant roles (58.68%) in the vegetation variations in 1986–2001, while anthropogenic activities dominated (86.79%) in driving vegetation recovery in the period after 2001. Due to the massive ecological conservation programs such as the Grain for Green Project launched in 2001, substantial deserts have been transformed into grasslands and forests. This analysis highlights the ecological policies largely responsible for vegetation restoration and provides references for ecological protection and sustainable development in eco-fragile ecosystems.</jats:p>"

The predominant lithounits are ferruginous quartzites, felsic volcanic rocks, and with minor intrusions of amphibolites. The encountered felsic volcanic rocks are rhyolites varying from pink (rich in K‐feldspar) to grey (rich in Na‐feldspar and amphiboles). The rhyolitic rocks have undergone intense hydrothermal alteration. The alteration zones are defined by the presence of biotite‐chlorite‐garnet‐gahnite; biotite‐sericite‐chlorite‐anthophyllite and anthophyllite‐actinolite‐tremolite‐carbonate mineral assemblages. Sulphide pits, highly leached zones with occasional bluish tinges, limonitic patches are present in the felsic volcanic rocks, followed by semi‐massive to disseminated sulphide mineralization indicative of Kuroku‐ type Zn–Cu–Pb volcanic‐hosted Massive Sulphide (VHMS) mineralization. Scanning electron microscope and energy‐dispersive x‐ray spectroscopy studies documented sphalerite, pyrite, chalcophyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and minor Au–Ag phases. The Sarni rhyolites exhibit chalcopyrite disease in sphalerite, replacement, and overgrowth ore‐textures. The high HFSE, low Zr/Y ratio, pronounced negative Eu anomalies characterize the felsic volcanic rocks as FIIIb type with high zircon saturation temperatures of 856–931°C. These rhyolites are formed at a back‐arc rift setting in an ensialic island‐arc tectonic regime. The synvolcanic structures facilitated the magma ascent to the surface. The hydrothermal circulation due to adequate heat flow in the back‐arc rift environment, in an episodic multicyclic process provided sufficient time for accumulation of sulphides from the seafloor, which was later deposited to form a VHMS mineralization. We also report tungsten (W) mineralization in the quartz veins of these felsic volcanic rocks. It is suggested that the felsic magma has interacted with metasedimentary sequences and assimilated W‐ore bearing fluids, and during remobilization in the later stages of tectonic activity enabled the deposition of tungsten in these quartz veins.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One of the most challenging issues in the treatment of substance use disorder, including misuse of opioids such as oxycodone, is persistent vulnerability to relapse, often triggered by cues or contexts previously associated with drug use. In rats, cue‐induced craving progressively intensifies (‘incubates’) during withdrawal from extended‐access self‐administration of several classes of misused drugs, including the psychostimulants cocaine and methamphetamine. For these psychostimulants, incubation is associated with strengthening of excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) through incorporation of α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole propionic acid receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are therefore Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>‐permeable (CP‐AMPARs). Once CP‐AMPAR upregulation occurs, their stimulation is required for expression of incubation. It is not known if a similar mechanism contributes to incubation of oxycodone craving. Using male rats, we established that incubation occurs by withdrawal day (WD) 15 and persists through WD30. Then, using cell‐surface biotinylation, we found that surface levels of the AMPAR subunit GluA1 but not GluA2 are elevated in NAc core and shell of oxycodone rats on WD15, although this wanes by WD30. Next, using intra‐NAc injection of the selective CP‐AMPAR antagonist Naspm before a seeking test, we demonstrate that CP‐AMPAR blockade in either subregion decreases oxycodone seeking on WD15 or WD30 (after incubation), but not WD1, and has no effect in saline self‐administering animals. The Naspm results suggest CP‐AMPARs persist in synapses through WD30 even if total cell surface levels wane. These results suggest that a common neurobiological mechanism contributes to expression of incubation of craving for oxycodone and psychostimulants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent studies of behavioural physiology on animals have suggested the crucial role of peripherally physiological signals in eliciting arousal and emotion. Heart rate (HR) is one of the useful and critical signals to measure autonomic regulation as a physiological basis for arousal and emotion in response to biologically significant stimuli such as social encounter with conspecific individuals. However, our understanding of peripherally physiological response such as HRs and autonomic activities under social contexts of non-human animals is still limited, particularly in birds. Here, we examined the autonomic activity of behaving crows exposed to a dominant and a subordinate conspecific by using non-invasive electrocardiogram recording. We found different patterns of autonomic responses dependent on the relative dominance position: dominant crows encountering subordinates showed the elevation of sympathetic activity, whereas subordinates encountering dominants showed decreased HR with elevated parasympathetic activity. This is the first study in birds to report different autonomic responses dependent on relative dominance positions during dyadic social encounters. The present study advances our understanding of the role of the peripheral autonomic system, as an interactive system with the brain, in eliciting emotion/arousal associated with socially challenging environments from an evolutionary perspective.</jats:p>",

It consisted of two parts: In the first part, participants filled in a newly developed questionnaire about their psychological needs, access and barriers within the healthcare system and their contact with their doctor in these matters. Then, patients were screened for MHIs with the help of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). When a score above seven was scored on the HADS, patients were additionally screened for specific MHIs using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV Axis I Disorders.

As the initiators of medical decision-making in daily routine, physicians should be aware of and concerned about the SDM process. Thus, professional competency development for SDM has become increasingly critical for physicians’ training. Therefore, this study investigates the professional competency and the important competency development aspects/criteria of SDM tasks through expert interviews and literature research. The study adopts the SAA (satisfaction-attention analysis) method to assess the status of competency development aspects/criteria and determine the NRM (network relation map) based on the DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) technique. The results demonstrate that the CE (concept and evaluation) aspect is the dominant aspect, and the CR (communication and relationship) aspect is the aspect being dominated. The CE aspect influences the aspects of SP (skill and practice), JM (joint information and decision making) and CR, and the SP aspect affects the aspects of JM and CR. Then, the JM aspect affects the CR aspect. The study also suggests suitable adoption paths of competency development for SDM tasks using the NRM approach. It provides recommendations and strategic directions for SDM competency development and sustainable training programs.</jats:p>"

The <jats:italic>O. rufipogon</jats:italic> accessions were classified into ten groups. The mean Nei’s diversity index and Shannon–Wiener index (I) were 0.187 and 0.308, respectively, in all populations, indicating that <jats:italic>O. rufipogon</jats:italic> accessions had rich genetic diversity. There were also differences in the genetic diversity of <jats:italic>O. rufipogon</jats:italic> resources in the 14 regions.

Because early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention are crucial to survival of infected cats, the objective of this study was to develop an ELISA capable of detecting cytauxzoonosis and differentiating acute vs. chronic infection in clinical feline blood samples. A microsphere immunoassay (MIA) was developed to evaluate the production of Cytauxzoon felis-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serial plasma samples from cats with experimental C. felis infection by targeting a C. felis-specific transmembrane protein (c88). Recombinant c88 protein was utilized to develop indirect ELISAs to detect IgM and IgG antibodies in clinical plasma samples from: PCR-positive cats with acute C. felis infection (n = 36), C. felis-negative cats with pyrexia (n = 10), healthy C. felis-negative cats (n = 22), and chronic C. felis carriers (n = 4). Anti-c88 IgM antibodies were detectable at day 12 post-tick infestation in cats with experimental C. felis infection (within 24 hours of developing clinical signs), while anti-c88 IgG was detectable at day 15 post-tick infestation – indicating IgM could be used to detect early infection. Using a cut-off value of 19.85 percent positive, the C. felis IgM ELISA detected acute cytauxzoonosis in 94.44% (34/36) of cats presented with clinical signs of acute cytauxzoonosis with 100% specificity (indicating a “Strong Positive” result). When a lower cutoff of 8.60 percent positive was used, cytauxzoonosis was detected in the 2 remaining PCR-positive cats with 87.88% specificity (indicating of a “Weak Positive” result). One C. felis-negative, febrile cat had high IgG, and chronic carriers had variable IgM and IgG results. Combined interpretation of IgM and IgG ELISAs did not reliably differentiate acute vs. chronic infection. While further validation on assay performance is needed, the C. felis IgM ELISA is a promising test to detect acute cytauxzoonosis and can be utilized to develop a point-of-care test for clinical use.</jats:p>"

Due to a tight stabilization of the repetition frequencies, it was possible to accumulate the data over 48 minutes in a triggerless manner without signal degradation. The fractional frequency stability of the measured terahertz signal is evaluated to be ∼8.0 × 10<jats:sup>−17</jats:sup> after 730 s. The frequency accuracy of the obtained terahertz spectrum is ensured by phase-locking the two frequency combs to a frequency standard. To clarify the performance of our system, we characterized the absorption line of water vapor around 0.557 THz. The good agreement of the measured center frequency and linewidth with the values predicted from the HITRAN database verifies the suitability of our ASOPS THz-TDS system for precise measurements.</jats:p>",

We obtained 639 bacterial and 310 fungal core OTUs, which were mainly affected by soil pH and organic matter (OM). The core taxa were grouped into four ecological clusters (i.e. high pH, low pH, high OM and low OM) for sharing similar habitat preferences. Furthermore, structural equation modelling (SEM) and correlation analyses revealed that the diversity and composition of core microbiomes, as well as the metagenome‐derived microbial functions, were related to belowground biomass and saponin contents. Key microbial genera related to the two plant indicators were also identified.

The usage of bi-thickness cladding tubes with additional high refractive index layers on our geometrically optimized structure improves birefringence nearly by one order: the highest birefringence is 4.7 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> at 1.51 µm and sustains &gt; 1 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> for a wide bandwidth of 100 nm with a larger core diameter of 26 µm. Elliptical nesting on our proposed structure lowers the confinement loss to 0.007 dB/m at 1.51 µm and maintains a loss of &lt; 1 dB/m for a wide range of 210 nm. A polarization extinction ratio of 300 and higher order mode extinction ratio of 63, for our fiber, ensure a single polarization and single mode operation at 1.51 µm. Moreover, the proposed fiber exhibits a bend robust performance with a very low bend loss of 0.009 dB/m at a small bend radius of 6 cm and sustains a bend loss of &lt; 0.01 dB/m from a bend radius of 4 cm and above. Hence, our presented fiber, containing the above excellent characteristics, may be fruitful for designing polarization-controlled devices (fiber optic sensors, fiber optic amplifiers, fiber optic gyroscope, etc.) in the field of optical communication.</jats:p>",

The growth of PANi chains is manifested by PMMA due to the formation of H-bonding between imine and carbonyl groups of PANi and MMA units, respectively, and are responsible for ion exchange sites. FTIR spectroscopy was used for structural elucidation of composites while elemental analysis was accomplished by XPS and EDX spectroscopy. The morphology of the prepared PANi/PMMA/PPG-b-PEG-b-PPG@FG composites was inspected by the SEM. The structure and crystallinity of the composites was investigated via XRD. The improved thermal stability and properties of the nanocomposites were observed using TGA and DSC. The conductivity measurements were used to characterize the electrical conductivity performance of the resulting composites.

Twenty-five male endurance athletes (age, 36 ± 12 y; VO2max, 57.5 ± 7.0 mL⋅kg−1⋅min−1) completed three trials consisting of 60 min running at 59.3 ± 1.7% vVO2max in a hot environment. During trials, the highest HR and TS, SR, and Trec at the end of trials were recorded. Following a baseline trial, participants performed HAz followed by a post-HAz trial and then completed five days HA, followed by a post-HA trial. A decision tree indicated cut-points of HR (&lt;−13 bpm), SR (&gt;0.3 L·h−1), and TS (≤−0.5) to predict lower Trec. When two or three variables met cut-points, the probability of accuracy of showing lower Trec was 95.7%. Greater adaptations in Trec were observed when two or three variables met cut-points (−0.71 ± 0.50 °C) compared to one (−0.13 ± 0.36 °C, p &lt; 0.001) or zero (0.0 3 ± 0.38 °C, p &lt; 0.001). Specificity was 0.96 when two or three variables met cut-points to predict lower Trec. These results suggest using heart rate, sweat rate, and thermal sensation adaptations to indicate that the adaptations in Trec is beneficial following heat adaptations, especially in field settings, as a practical and noninvasive method.</jats:p>"

A 500 kV compact overhead line in southern China was taken as an example, the proposed risk assessment method was used to carry out a risk assessment of the ice-shedding line with an ice thickness of 15 mm, and the suppression effects of different spacer arrangement schemes on the ice-shedding line were analyzed. The results showed that the impact coefficient of the conductor reached 1.88, the maximum jump height of the lower phase conductor reached 22.596 m, and the interphase clearance of the conductor decreased sharply when the lower phase conductor of 500 kV case line underwent full-span ice-shedding synchronously. The ice-shedding line displayed both a discharge risk and a mechanical failure risk. When interphase spacers were installed at L/3 from both ends of the span for the upper-left phase and the lower phase, the upper-right phase, and the lower phase, the impact coefficient of the line became 1.76, which was lower than the recommended value of 1.8; there was no mechanical failure risk; and the maximum jump height became 10.266 m.

These factors are intertwined with a multitude of social and ideological conditions for acceptance and legitimacy, which have received less systematic empirical attention especially from the perspective of the actors who implement the offsets. In this paper, we empirically analyse how companies and authorities, the central actors applying biodiversity offsetting in practice, perceive the social acceptance in the design and implementation of the emerging mechanism in Finland. The interview data analysed with three interlinked dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio‐political acceptance, market acceptance and community acceptance reveal where the mechanism's implementation may face friction with the central actors. While the importance of social acceptance of biodiversity offsetting shows to be a priority for the actors that will be implementing the mechanism and carrying the responsibility of the offsets in practice, the division of roles and benefits remains a point of tension, in the political sphere, in the market and in the community. Our analysis points to the necessity of integrating social and local values alongside ecological and economic ones as a way to address social acceptance. Finding the limits to flexibility between ecological, economic and social aspects is important in order to reach the diverse objectives of a BO mechanism.</jats:p>",

Cyclooctane, alongside other medium-sized rings, is of interest as a novel molecular platform for the construction of target-oriented leads. Additionally, cyclooctane derivatives are well known to be prone to transannular reactions, which makes them a promising object in the search for novel approaches to polycyclic structures. In the present work, a series of cyclooctanediones was studied in Corey-Chaykovsky reactions, and novel spirocyclic bis(oxiranes) containing cyclooctane core, namely, 1,5-dioxadispiro[2.0.2.6]dodecane and 1,8-dioxadispiro[2.3.2.3]dodecane, were synthesized. Ring opening of the obtained bis(oxiranes) upon treatment with sodium azide was investigated, and it was found that the reaction path is determined by the reciprocal orientation of oxygen atoms in the oxirane moieties. Diastereomers of the bis(oxiranes) with cis-orientation underwent independent ring opening, supplying corresponding diazidodiols, while in the case of stereoisomers with trans-orientation, domino-like reactions occurred, including intramolecular nucleophilic attack and the formation of a novel three- or six-membered O-containing ring. Summarily, a straightforward approach to polyfunctional compounds containing cyclooctane or oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane cores, employing bis(oxiranes), was elaborated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tHydrogen has attracted increasing attention as clean energy for fuel cells over the past decade. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is considered the most feasible production method. However, its practical efficiency depends significantly on the photogeneration rate of electron (e<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) and hole (h<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) on a semiconductor photoanode and the rapid separation of these charge carriers. Also, a proper match of small and large bandgap positions is necessary. 3D core-shell heterostructures of WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MoO<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>/Co‐Pi and BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> were synthesized using hydrothermal/electrodeposition and electrodeposition/plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PECALD), respectively. The as-prepared WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MoO<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>/Co‐Pi hetero-photocatalyst exhibited significantly high photoelectrochemical activity, where its photocurrent efficiency was 4.6 times greater than that of the constituent WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. For the BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> photoelectrode, an optimal thickness of the MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> layer was controlled by the number of PEALD cycles. The highest photocurrent (2.1 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>) was produced from the electrode with a 6 nm layer-thickness, 2.4 times higher than the pristine BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> at an external bias of 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The appropriate bandgap alignment between layers can corroborate such drastic improvement in the PEC properties. A detailed investigation into the photoelectrochemical reaction mechanism showed that enhancement of the PEC performance was attributed to the finely deposited MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> layer, which expands the spectral absorption edge of solar light and enhances the suppression of electron-hole pair recombination because of the proper alignment match between the two semiconductors with a small and large bandgap. Furthermore, a heterojunction charge-transfer mechanism was proposed to verify the role of the co-catalyst, Co‐Pi, in enhancing the photocurrent at the WO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>MoO<jats:sub>6 </jats:sub>photoanode under the same applied bias.    </jats:p>",

Brinson's model is applied in this research to estimate the recovery stress produced by SMAs. A comparative study is performed to show the ability of the proposed model to offer high solution accuracy at low computational costs. Specifically, the results of the present research exhibit less than a 2% difference from those obtained from the mixed LW/ESL models in the framework of Carrera's unified formulation (CUF). As the second goal, the influences of some parameters such as the pre‐strain of SMAs, the volume fraction of SMAs, and core thickness on the fundamental frequencies of SMA‐reinforced sandwich plates are examined. The results reveal that depending on the geometric parameters and operating temperature, SMAs may have constructive or destructive effects on the free vibration of sandwich plates.</jats:p>",

With the seminal discovery of an interconnected network of hypothalamic arcuate neurons co-expressing kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy neurons), the KNDy hypothesis was developed to explain how gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses are generated. Key to this hypothesis is dynorphin released from KNDy neurons acting in a paracrine manner on other KNDy neurons via kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling to terminate neural “pulse” events. While in vitro evidence supports this aspect of the KNDy hypothesis, a direct in vivo test of the necessity of KOR signaling in kisspeptin neurons for proper LH secretion has been lacking. We therefore conditionally knocked out KOR selectively from kisspeptin neurons of male and female mice and tested numerous reproductive measures, including in vivo LH pulse secretion. Surprisingly, despite validating successful knockout of KOR in kisspeptin neurons, we found no significant effect of kisspeptin cell-specific deletion of KOR on any measure of puberty, LH pulse parameters, LH surges, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, estrous cycles, or fertility. These outcomes suggest that the KNDy hypothesis, while sufficient normally, may not be the only neural mechanism for sculpting GnRH and LH pulses, supported by recent findings in humans and mice. Thus, besides normally acting via KOR in KNDy neurons, endogenous dynorphin and other opioids may, under some conditions, regulate LH and FSH secretion via KOR in non-kisspeptin cells or perhaps via non-KOR pathways. The current models for GnRH and LH pulse generation should be expanded to consider such alternate mechanisms.</jats:p>",

Choosing suitable travel cities and scenic spots among the many alternatives and planning travel routes are the two most troublesome problems for people. For the first question, this paper uses the multi-criteria decision-making method—best-worst method (BWM) to build a priority model of core scenic spots to help people filter out the cities and core scenic spots with the highest travel value from a large number of tourist attractions. For the second question, this paper uses the genetic algorithm to plan the travel route of core scenic spots, so as to reduce the cost of tourists in the travel process and improve the travel happiness as much as possible. Subsequently, a case about the selection of core scenic spots and travel route planning in Hubei Province of China was presented. Among them, 6 cities (i.e. 24 core scenic spots) with the highest travel priority were selected by the score of BWM. Then, the genetic algorithm was programmed by MATLAB to obtain the optimal travel routes of these 24 core scenic spots, with a total distance of 1355.72 km. This paper will promote the practical application of BWM  and genetic algorithm.</jats:p>"

The topological characteristics of brain networks that promote protection against cognitive decline in aging are unknown. Here, we investigated whether the robustness and resilience of brain networks, queried via the delineation of the brain’s core network structure, relate to age and cognitive performance in a cross-sectional dataset of healthy middle- and old-aged adults (\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            = 478, ages 40 to 90 y). First, we decomposed each subject’s functional brain network using\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            -shell decomposition and found that age was negatively associated with robust core network structures. Next, we perturbed these networks, via attack simulations, and found that resilience of core brain network nodes also declined in relationship to age. We then partitioned our dataset into middle- (ages 40 to 65 y,\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            = 300) and old- (ages 65 to 90 y,\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            = 178) aged subjects and observed that older individuals had less robust core connectivity and resilience. Following these analyses, we found that episodic memory was positively related to robust connectivity and core resilience, particularly within the default node, limbic, and frontoparietal control networks. Importantly, we found that age-related differences in episodic memory were positively related to core resilience, which indicates a potential role for core resilience in protection against cognitive decline. Together, these findings suggest that robust core connectivity and resilience of brain networks could facilitate high cognitive performance in aging.\n          </jats:p>",

Methods: In this study, we use immunoprecipitation of epitope tagged endogenous PGC-1β and inducible PGC-1β mutants to show that amino acid motif LRELL on PGC-1β is responsible for the physical interaction with ERRα and promotes ERRα mRNA and protein expression. We use RNAsequencing to determine the genes regulated by both PGC-1β &amp; ERRα and find that mitochondrial Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) is the gene that decreased most significantly after depletion of both genes. Results: Depletion of PCK2 in colorectal cancer cells was sufficient to reduce anchorage-independent growth and inhibit glutamine utilization by the TCA cycle. Lastly, shRNA-mediated depletion of ERRα decreased anchorage-independent growth and glutamine metabolism, which could not be rescued by plasmid derived expression of PCK2. Discussion: These findings suggest that transcriptional control of PCK2 is one mechanism used by PGC-1β and ERRα to promote glutamine metabolism and colorectal cancer cell survival.</jats:p>"

To reduce the impact of the optical noise, research teams are turning to new and novel architectures of solid-core and hollow-core optical fiber. We studied the impact when co-propagating a single-photon level (850 nm) and two classical optical signals (940 nm and 1550 nm) while utilizing a nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (NANF) with two low-loss windows. The 940 nm signal was shown to impact the single-photon measurement due to the silicon detector technology implemented; however, multiplexing techniques and filtering could reduce the impact. The 1550 nm signal was shown to have no detrimental impact. The results highlight that both high bandwidth optical traffic at 1550 nm and a QC channel at 850 nm could co-propagate without degradation to the QC channel.</jats:p>",

The core prevents unauthorized data extraction by encrypting data on the fly.

We present 1.5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images of the radio continuum emission from the radio-intermediate quasar (RIQ) J2242+0334 at <jats:italic>z </jats:italic>= 5.9. This object was previously detected at both 1.5 GHz and 3 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) as a point source. However, there is no clear detection in the VLBA images at both the full resolution of 10.7 mas × 4.5 mas (61.7 pc × 26.0 pc) and a tapered resolution of 26 mas × 21 mas (150 pc × 121 pc). This suggests that the radio emission from the quasar is diffuse on milliarcsecond scales with surface brightness fainter than the 3<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic> detection limit of 40.5 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>Jy beam<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the full-resolution image. The radio emission in the RIQ J2242+0334 is likely to be wind-like (i.e., diffuse) rather than in the form of collimated jets. This is different from the previous radio detections of the most luminous quasars at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> ∼ 6 that are usually dominated by compact, high brightness temperature radio sources. Meanwhile, compared with RIQs at low redshifts, the case of J2242+0334 suggests that not all RIQs are beamed radio-quiet quasars. This optically faint RIQ provides an important and unique example to investigate the radio activity in the less powerful active galactic nuclei at the earliest cosmic epoch.</jats:p>",

Such variations reflect the diverse range of differentiation and evolution processes experienced by their parent bodies. A key in deciphering iron isotope variations among planetary samples is to understand how iron isotopes fractionate during core formation. Here we report new Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X‐ray Scattering experiments on silicate glasses of bulk silicate Earth compositions to measure their force constants at high pressures of up to 30 GPa. The force constant results are subsequently used to constrain iron isotope fractionation during core formation on terrestrial planets. Using a model that integrates temperature, pressure, core composition, and redox state of the silicate mantle, we show that core formation might lead to an isotopically light mantle for small planetary bodies but a heavy one for Earth‐sized terrestrial planets.</jats:p>",

The serious wetting deformation not only aggravates the collapse settlement of upstream rockfill but also intensifies differential settlement of the dam crest during impoundment, and then causes cracks on the dam crest. On the basis of the proposed wetting deformation model and its simulation method of wetting deformation, this paper simulated the impoundment process of Guanyinyan core wall rockfill dam and studied the deformation characteristic of the dam during impoundment. In addition, the smeared cracking model was used to simulate the crack propagation on the dam crest, and the crack develop and spread mechanism was analysed. The results show that the simulated deformation can fit the in‐situ data well, and the simulated crack propagation is in good agreement with the actual situation. Once watered, the upstream rockfill and core wall have significant settlement, and the whole dam crest has obvious horizontal displacement towards the upstream. It is on the same order of magnitude that the increment of horizontal displacement and settlement at the top of the dam during impoundment. In the process of impoundment, the upper part of the dam tends to deform towards the reservoir area, which will lead to tensile cracks appearing in the rockfill areas on both upstream and downstream sides of the core wall of the dam crest, and the propagation direction of the cracks is basically parallel to the adjacent core wall surface. With the water level rising, the cracks on the downstream side of the dam crest mainly extend vertically, and the cracks on the upstream side of the dam crest not only extend vertically, but also extend horizontally.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) provides a great challenge in operational forecasting and contributes significantly to the development of major TCs. RI is commonly defined as an increase in the maximum sustained surface wind speed of at least a certain threshold within 24 hr. The most widely used threshold is 30 kt (15.4 m/s), which was determined statistically. Here we propose a new definition for RI by objectively clustering TCs using the intensification rate, initial intensity, and radius of the maximum wind speed (RMW). A group of 770 samples is separated at a threshold of 45 kt (23.2 m/s). The threshold is 40 kt (20.6 m/s) for the western North Atlantic, where TC size measurements are more reliable. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed threshold is robust even considering the uncertainty in RMW of as high as 30 km. We show that, when a TC undergoes RI, its maximum wind speed is approximately 60 ± 15 kt (30.9 ± 7.7 m/s) and the RMW is 45 ± 20 km. The new threshold outperforms the conventional threshold of 30 kt/24 hr in describing the bimodal distribution of lifetime maximum intensity and explaining the annual count of Category 5 TCs. This new definition provides a more physically based threshold and describes a more reliable representation of extreme events. Although more comparisons are needed for operational application, it is likely to be desirable for case‐based process studies and could provide a more valuable metric for TC intensification classification and research.</jats:p>",

The conditions for RSAE spontaneous decay are investigated, and the saturation level and the consequent fuel ion heating rate are also derived. The channel is expected to be crucial for future reactors operating under reversed shear configurations, where fusion alpha particles are generated in the tokamak core with the magnetic shear being, typically, reversed, and there is a dense RSAE spectrum due to the small alpha particle characteristic dimensionless orbits.</jats:p>",

The Rs1−/Y rat exhibited very early onset and rapidly progressive photoreceptor degeneration. The outer limiting membrane (OLM) was disrupted and discontinuous by post-natal day (P15) and allowed photoreceptor nuclei to dislocate from the outer nuclear layers (ONL) into the sub-retinal side of the OLM. Dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) a-wave and b-wave amplitudes were considerably reduced to only 20–25% of WT by P17. Microglia and Müller glial showed cell marker activation by P7. Intravitreal application of AAV8-RS1 at P5–6 induced RS1 expression by P15 and rescued the inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) cavity formation otherwise present at P15, and the outer-retinal structure was less disrupted. This Rs1−/Y exon-1-del rat model displays substantially faster rod cell loss compared to the exon-1-del Rs1-KO mouse. Most unexpected was the rapid appearance of schisis cavities between P7 and P15, and then cavities rapidly disappeared by P21/P30. The rat model provides clues on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying XLRS pathology in this model and points to a substantial and early changes to normal retinal development.</jats:p>"

The cores of both 30° and 90° Shockley partial dislocations, their possible reconstructions and their electronic structures were analyzed and compared systematically. Shockley partial dislocations were found to have a variety of core structures while exhibiting different bonding states like: deformed Ga–N bonds, Ga–Ga and N–N homo-nuclear bonds, as well as Ga– and N–dangling bonds. We have demonstrated that the core reconstruction of these dislocations is not always energetically favourable in wurtzite GaN, as it is the case in elemental semiconductors. It results from interplay between the energy gain from eliminating dangling and forming homo-nuclear bonds and the energy excess from the induced strain of hetero-nuclear Ga–N bonds within the core. Depending on their core configurations, Shockley partial dislocations are expected to have different electronic behaviours in wurtzite GaN, as they can act either as sources of parasitic luminescence or non-radiative recombination centres, or give pathways to leakage currents. We have demonstrated that deep states associated with dislocations are not due to the dangling bonds, as generally believed, but rather to Ga–Ga bonds in their cores, and that N–N bonds do not lead to any gap states. These results are of high relevance as guidelines in defect engineering strategies aiming at producing dislocations with a particular electronic behaviour in wurtzite GaN.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common autoimmune disease worldwide. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of noncoding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs). In addition to their roles in numerous biological processes, circRNAs are also linked to a vast range of diseases including UC. Although previous studies have examined many circRNAs, the physiological and pathological roles of the circRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network in UC remain unclear. Thus, we constructed a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network based on the ceRNA hypothesis by analyzing data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) database. Genes with higher degree values than others in the ceRNA network were selected as central nodes when constructing the corresponding core subnetworks. To fully understand the biological function of the ceRNA network, we entered all differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) from the ceRNA network into the Database for Annotation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), which was used to perform Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. We further entered DEmRNAs into the STRING database for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The results elucidated that the ceRNA network comprised 403 circRNA nodes, 5 miRNA nodes, 138 mRNA nodes, and 559 edges. Three core ceRNA subnetworks centered on hsa-miR-342-3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, and hsa-miR-142-3p were reconstructed in this study. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses identified 167 enriched GO categories and 14 enriched KEGG pathway terms. The core PPI network was composed of 15 core targets, of which CD44, HIF1A, and MMP2 were the most significant. In summary, 3 hub miRNAs (hsa-miR-342-3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-142-3p) and 3 hub genes (CD44, HIF1A, and MMP2) might play an important role in the development of UC. These hub nodes, first proposed here, might also be used as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.</jats:p>",

The present study aimed to determine whether the neurobiological basis of FOMO encompasses core regions of the reward or social brain, and the associations with the level of problematic smartphone or social media use. We capitalized on a dimensional neuroimaging approach to examine cortical thickness and subcortical volume associations in a comparably large sample of healthy young individuals (n = 167). Meta-analytic network and behavioral decoding were employed to further characterize the identified regions. Higher levels of FOMO associated with lower cortical thickness in the precuneus. In contrast, no associations between FOMO and variations in striatal morphology were observed. Meta-analysis decoding revealed that the identified precuneus region exhibited a strong functional interaction with the default mode network (DMN) engaged in social cognitive and self-referential domains. Together the present findings suggest that individual variations in FOMO are associated with the brain structural architecture of the right precuneus, a core hub within a large-scale functional network resembling the DMN involved in social and self-referential processes. FOMO may promote escalating social media and smartphone use via social and self-referential processes rather than reward-related processes per se.</jats:p>"

Disassembly of amyloid‐fibers contributes to biofilm‐dispersal in the blood‐circulation, from which bacteria should be cleared by the host immune system. However, often the immune system is insufficiently prepared for increasing bacterial concentrations in blood, causing septic symptoms. Here, poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(β‐amino ester),  pH‐responsive micelles are prepared for co‐delivery of (‐)‐epigallocatechin‐3‐<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>‐gallate (EGCG) as a dispersant. Hydrophilic EGCG can not be loaded in the micellar core, but is cross‐linked in the micellar shell through pH‐reversible, boronic‐ester binding. Disassembly of micelles under acidic biofilm conditions facilitates release of EGCG and dispersal of biofilm‐bacteria. When core‐loaded with ciprofloxacin, in‐shell EGCG prevents ciprofloxacin‐leakage at physiological pH. Bacterial killing by core‐loaded ciprofloxacin in <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> biofilms is enhanced when released in combination with EGCG in vitro and in vivo. In mice, micelles with in‐shell EGCG self‐target after tail‐vein injection to an infection site, yielding dispersal of pathogens with mild septic symptoms and bacterial killing by the immune system. Septic symptoms disappear slightly faster when micelles are additionally core‐loaded with ciprofloxacin. Thus, micelles with in‐shell EGCG yield balanced biofilm dispersal inducing only mild septic symptoms, which is good news in an era of increasing antibiotic‐resistance.</jats:p>",

From the same sample, we selected a control group of children ( n = 42) matched for IQ, age, and visuospatial memory but with average mathematical skills. Children with dyscalculia showed deficits in both symbolic and nonsymbolic number sense assessed with simple computerized tasks. Performance in the digit-comparison task and the numerosity match-to-sample task reliably separated children with developmental dyscalculia from controls in cross-validated logistic regression (area under the curve = .84). These results support a number-sense-deficit theory and highlight basic numerical abilities that could be targeted for early identification of at-risk children as well as for intervention. </jats:p>",

Osteoporosis with iron accumulation is a distinct endocrine disease with complicated pathogenesis regulated by several proteins. However, the comprehensive proteome-wide analysis of human bone is lacking. Using multiplex quantitative tandem mass tag-based proteomics, we detected 2900 and quantified 1150 proteins from bone of 10 postmenopausal patients undergoing hip replacement. Comparing with non-osteoporosis patients, a total of 75 differentially expressed proteins were identified, comprising 53 downregulated proteins and 22 upregulated proteins. These proteins primarily affect oxidoreductase activity, GTPase activity, GTP binding, and neural nucleus development, were mainly enriched in neural, angiogenesis and energy-related pathways, and formed complex regulatory networks with strong interconnections. We ultimately identified 4 core proteins (GSTP1, LAMP2, COPB1, RAB5B) that were significantly differentially expressed in the bone of osteoporosis patients with iron accumulation, and validated the changed protein level in the serum of the medical examination population. Our systemic analysis uncovers molecular insights for revealing underlying mechanism and clinical therapeutics in osteoporosis with iron accumulation.</jats:p>"

Herein, we have compared the ultrafast carrier dynamics in CSS-QDs and InP/ZnS core/shell QDs (CS-QDs) using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The results show that the ZnSe midshell intensifies the electron delocalization and prolongs the in-band relaxation time of electrons from 238 fs to 350 fs, and that of holes from hundreds of femtoseconds to 1.6 ps. We also found that the trapping time caused by deep defects increased from 25.6 ps to 76 ps, and there were significantly reduced defect emissions in CSS-QDs. Moreover, the ZnSe midshell leads to a significantly increased density of higher-energy hole states above the valence band-edge, which may reduce the probability of Auger recombination caused by the positive trion. This work enhances our understanding of the excellent performance of the CSS-QDs applied to light-emitting diodes, and is likely to be helpful for the further optimization and design of optoelectronic devices based on the CSS-QDs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We revealed the difference in the mechanism of photodynamic therapy (PDT) between two photosensitizers: porphylipoprotein (PLP), which has recently attracted attention for its potential to be highly effective in treating cancer, and talaporphyrin sodium (NPe6). (1) NPe6 accumulates in lysosomes, whereas PLP is incorporated into phagosomes formed by PLP injection. (2) PDT causes NPe6 to generate reactive oxygen species, thereby producing actin filaments and stress fibers. In the case of PLP, however, reactive oxygen species generated by PDT remain in the phagosomes until the phagosomal membrane is destroyed, which delays the initiation of RhoA activation and RhoA*/ROCK generation. (4) After the disruption of the phagosomal membrane, however, the outflow of various reactive oxygen species accelerates the production of actin filaments and stress fibers, and blebbing occurs earlier than in the case of NPe6. (5) PLP increases the elastic modulus of cells without RhoA activity in the early stage. This is because phagosomes are involved in polymerizing actin filaments and pseudopodia formation. Considering the high selectivity and uptake of PLP into cancer cells, a larger effect with PDT can be expected by skillfully combining the newly discovered characteristics, such as the appearance of a strong effect at an early stage.</jats:p>"

Interactions between neurons and Schwann cells may protect against the neurotoxicity of nanoparticles. In this study, we developed a co-culture model consisting of immortalized rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and rat Schwann cells and employed it to investigate our hypothesis that co-culturing DRG neurons with Schwann cells imparts protection on them against neurotoxicity induced by silver or gold nanoparticles. Our results indicated that neurons survived better in co-cultures when they were exposed to these nanoparticles at the higher concentrations compared to when they were exposed to these nanoparticles at the same concentrations in monotypic cultures. Synapsin I expression was increased in DRG neurons when they were co-cultured with Schwann cells and treated with or without nanoparticles. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was increased in Schwann cells when they were co-cultured with DRG neurons and treated with nanoparticles. Furthermore, we found co-culturing with Schwann cells stimulated neurofilament polymerization in DRG neurons and produced the morphological differentiation. Silver nanoparticles induced morphological disorganization in monotypic cultures. However, there were more cells displaying normal morphology in co-cultures than in monotypic cultures. All of these results suggested that co-culturing DRG neurons with Schwann cells imparted some protection on them against neurotoxicity induced by silver or gold nanoparticles, and altering the expression of neurofilament-L, synapsin I, and GFAP could account for the phenomenon of protection in co-cultures. </jats:p>",

The response surface methodology (RSM), along with a central composite design (CCD), was used to investigate the effect of independent variables (G/NCS, hydrothermal time, and S/Ni) on the specific capacitances of the NCS@G/Ni composite electrodes. RSM analysis revealed that the developed quadratic model with regression coefficient values of more than 0.95 could be well adapted to represent experimental results. Optimized preparation conditions for NCS@G were G/NCS = 6.0%, hydrothermal time = 10.0, and S/Ni = 6.0 of NCS@G (111) sample. The maximum specific capacitance of NCS@G (111)/Ni fabricated at the optimal condition is about 216% higher than the best result obtained using the conventional experimental method. The enhanced capacitive performance of the NCS@G (111) sample can be attributed to the synergistic effect between NCS nanoparticles and graphene, which has the meso/macropores conductive network and low diffusion resistance. Notably, the NCS@G (111) could not only provide numerous reaction sites but also prevent the restacking of graphene layers. Furthermore, a supercapattery cell was fabricated with an (G + AC)/Ni anode, a NCS@G (111)/Ni cathode, and a carboxymethyl cellulose–potassium hydroxide (CMC-KOH) gel electrolyte. The NCS@G (111)//(G + AC) demonstrates an outstanding energy density of 80 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 4 kW kg−1, and a good cycling performance of 75% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Applying the synthesis strategy of RSM endows remarkable capacitive performance of the hybrid materials, providing an economical pathway to design promising composite electrode material and fabricate high-performance energy storage devices.</jats:p>"

To assure a practical Courant‐Friedrichs‐Lewy number for stability, a horizontally explicit and vertically implicit algorithm was applied in this model through a third‐order implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta scheme. A two‐dimensional adaptive grid was applied in the horizontal directions to generate the computational meshes, with variable resolutions according to the evolution of the predicted variables during the simulations, while the vertical grid is fixed considering the characteristics of atmospheric flows and the computational efficiency in practical applications. The Berger–Oliger block‐structured adaptive algorithm was adopted in this study. Blocks with different resolutions can be constructed straightforwardly on each patch of the cubed sphere and an algorithm to exchange both solution and block information between adjacent patches was designed in order to implement a global model. The nonhydrostatic governing equations are solved by a three‐point multimoment constrained finite‐volume scheme. Using the compact stencil for spatial reconstructions, the interpolation operations between coarse–fine blocks can be implemented efficiently and the local‐based scheme is also helpful to suppress the computational modes around the coarse–fine interfaces due to the abrupt change of grid resolution. Additionally, flux corrections were conducted along the block boundaries and the resulting dynamical core is rigorously conservative. The proposed model was evaluated by calculating several idealized benchmark tests, and the effectiveness of the adaptive model in saving computational costs was verified in this study.</jats:p>",

High temperature reservoirs in Limau block of South-Sumatran basin is an onshore mature field which has been identified as a potential chemical EOR candidate.

We previously reported in-plane lateral one-dimensional Schottky junctions (SJs) on few-atom-layer 2H-phase semiconductor-molybdenum disulfide by forming a 1T′-metal phase using laser beam (LB) irradiation and clarified their unique optoelectronic properties. Although the LB-derived 1T′/2H phase SJs provided efficient photocurrent generation, they had a large number of defects owing to the excess heat accumulation caused by the LB. Here, we observe partial electric hysteresis properties in photogenerated currents (Iphoto) on the SJs under reverse bias voltage regions and reveal that they are very sensitive to the voltage sweep direction and its switching (holding) time. The properties persist under dark ambient conditions for a few minutes, even after photo-irradiation is complete. The temperature dependence reveals that a defect-derived deep carrier trap-center, which is unique to the present 1T′ phase, can be the cause of these phenomena. A larger Iphoto and an increase in photogeneration efficiency are obtained by eliminating this trap center through thermal annealing. In contrast, it is expected that these hysteresis properties lead to atomically thin photo-memristor devices for opto-neuromorphic systems.</jats:p>",

This study extends rheological characterization with viscoelastic mechanical modeling to evaluate resistance to UV aging using Sasobit and SBS compound-modified binder blended with nano-titanium dioxide (TiO2). The extended method comprises characterizations using several rheological properties and a viscoelastic mechanical model, named the 2S2P1D model, on modified asphalt after 3 days, 6 days and 9 days of ultraviolet (UV) aging. The rheological properties of the UV-aged binders were tested at high and medium temperatures in terms of viscosity, complex modulus, phase angle and fatigue factor. Rheological test results showed that nanoparticles generally had no apparent effect on the complex modulus of aged binders regardless of UV aging times. However, the aged binder with nanoparticles showed better fatigue resistance than aged binders without nanoparticles after 3 days of UV aging. As an extension, the black space diagram and 2S2P1D model were used to investigate the viscoelastic properties of these aged binders. The k and h values, as important model parameters, were almost the same and less than one for all UV-aged binders. All investigated aged asphalt binders showed characteristics of a viscoelastic solid in terms of the master curves of the complex modulus and phase angle, and the master curves of the phase angle for all UV-aged binders did not meet the time–temperature equivalence. Moreover, these observations from the 2S2P1D model revealed that aging durations did not affect the viscoelastic mechanical characteristics of warm mix asphalt in this study. The method adopted in this study may promote a comprehensive evaluation of asphalt properties after UV aging, especially considering the viscoelastic mechanical performance.</jats:p>"

One presumably effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance of the HOFs is to produce a core–shell composite by fabricating a particular nanostructure using stable HOFs. To this end, the surface‐functionalized metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are used as the host matrix to support the in situ assembly and subsequent multisite growth of the stable HOFs. MOF@HOF eventually obtains core–shell hybrids, i.e., NH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐UiO‐66@DAT‐HOF. This newly synthesized core–shell nanostructure exhibits excellent stability and superb photocatalytic performance. For example, in terms of tetracycline degradation, the optimal composite presents an apparent reaction rate constant of 60.7 and 7.6 times higher than its parent materials NH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐UiO‐66 and DAT‐HOF. Such a pronounced enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency of the hybrid material is attributed to the broader visible‐light utilization range compared to its individual parent material as well as the efficient separation of charge carriers supported by the S‐scheme heterojunction. In addition, it is particularly notable that the photocatalytic efficiency of the yielded core–shell nanostructure can remain high after several‐cycle applications. This work provides a universal scheme for synthesizing the MOF@HOF core–shell hybrids.</jats:p>",

The secore complexes are further combined with chitosan‐based shells and functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cell penetrating peptides. This modular approach allows to evaluate the effect of functional shell components on physicochemical particle characteristics and biological effects. The optimized ternary complex combines a core‐dCS‐linear PEI/DNA complex with a shell consisting of dCS‐PEG‐COOH, which results in improved nucleic acid encapsulation, cellular uptake and transfection potency in human hepatoma HuH‐7cells and murine primary hepatocytes. Effects on transgene expression are confirmed in wild‐type mice following retrograde intrabiliary infusion.

Recent palaeogenomic studies support scenarios in which the core Indo-European languages spread with the expansion of Early Bronze Age Yamnaya herders that originally inhabited the East European steppes. Questions on the Yamnaya and Pre-Yamnaya locations of the language community that ultimately gave rise to the Indo-European language family are heavily dependent on linguistic reconstruction of the subsistence of Proto-Indo-European speakers. A central question, therefore, is how important the role of agriculture was among the speakers of this protolanguage. In this study, we perform a qualitative etymological analysis of all previously postulated Proto-Indo-European terminology related to cereal cultivation and cereal processing. On the basis of the evolution of the subsistence strategies of consecutive stages of the protolanguage, we find that one or perhaps two cereal terms can be reconstructed for the basal Indo-European stage, also known as Indo-Anatolian, but that core Indo-European, here also including Tocharian, acquired a more elaborate set of terms. Thus, we linguistically document an important economic shift from a mostly non-agricultural to a mixed agro-pastoral economy between the basal and core Indo-European speech communities. It follows that the early, eastern Yamnaya of the Don-Volga steppe, with its lack of evidence for agricultural practices, does not offer a perfect archaeological proxy for the core Indo-European language community and that this stage of the language family more likely reflects a mixed subsistence as proposed for western Yamnaya groups around or to the west of the Dnieper River.</jats:p>"

Hence, the present paper adopts a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning network model to forecast the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) by exploiting global positioning system (GPS) observables, at a low latitude Indian location in Bangalore (IISC; Geographic 13.03° N and 77.57° E), during the 24th solar cycle. The proposed model uses about eight years of GPS-TEC data (from 2009 to 2017) for training and validation, whereas the data for 2018 was used for independent testing and forecasting of TEC. Apart from the input TEC parameters, the model considers sequential data of solar and geophysical indices to realize the effects. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing the forecasted TEC values with the observed and global empirical ionosphere model (international reference ionosphere; IRI-2016) through a set of validation metrics. The analysis of the results during the test period showed that LSTM output closely followed the observed GPS-TEC data with a relatively minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.6149 and the highest correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.992, as compared to IRI-2016. Furthermore, the day-to-day performance of LSTM was validated during the year 2018, inferring that the proposed model outcomes are significantly better than IRI-2016 at the considered location. Implementation of the model at other latitudinal locations of the region is suggested for an efficient regional forecast of TEC across the Indian region. The present work complements efforts towards establishing an efficient regional forecasting system for indices of ionospheric delays and irregularities, which are responsible for degrading static, as well as dynamic, space-based navigation system performances.</jats:p>"

The mapping of genomic alterations and their role in lung-cancer progression has been followed by the development of new therapeutic options. Several novel drugs, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, have significantly improved outcomes. However, many patients with lung cancer do not benefit from existing therapies or develop progressive disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality despite initial responses to treatment. Alterations in DNA-damage repair (DDR) genes represent a cancer hallmark that impairs a cell’s ability to prevent deleterious mutation accumulation and repair. These alterations have recently emerged as a therapeutic target in breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. The role of DDR alterations remains largely unknown in lung cancer. Nevertheless, recent research efforts have highlighted a potential role of some DDR alterations as predictive biomarkers of response to treatment. Despite the failure of PARP inhibitors (main class of DDR targeting agents) to improve outcomes in lung cancer patients, there is some evidence suggesting a role of PARP inhibitors and other DDR targeting agents in benefiting a distinct subset of lung cancer patients. In this review, we will discuss the existing literature on DDR alterations and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) state as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets in both non-small cell lung and small cell lung cancer.</jats:p>"

However, commercial application of this material is impeded by its rapid capacity degradation associated with structural instability. In this work, 0.01mol Al3+ Doped Li(Ni-Ni0.9Co0.1)O2 cathode material is prepared by heat treatment of a mixture of stoichiometric amounts of nano-sized Al(OH)3 powders, co-precipitated (Ni-Ni0.9Co0.1)(OH)2 precursors, and LiOH·H2O. The results show that Al3+ doping significantly improves the cycling properties of Li(Ni-Ni0.9Co0.1)O2 cathode material. Under a voltage range of 3–4.5 V, 0.02 mol% Al3+ doped Li(Ni-Ni0.9Co0.1)O2 cathode material shows an initial discharge capacity of 210 mAh/g at 0.1C, with a capacity retention of 97% for subsequent 100 cycles at 1C at room temperature. In contrast, bare Li(Ni-Ni0.9Co0.1)O2 shows a capacity retention of only ~62.8% under the same conditions, with an initial specific discharge capacity of 220 mAh/g. The improvement in cycling performance is attributed to stabilization of the layered structure by Al3+ , mitigated migration of Ni2+ to the Li layer, improved lithium diffusion kinetics and reduced lattice expansion/shrinkage during cycling. Stabilization of the layered structure by Al3+ doping is further reflected by the observation of fewer cracks in cathode electrodes after prolonged cycling.    </jats:p>",

Magnetic fields are believed to play an important role in their dynamics and shaping morphology. We aim to study any possible correlation that might exist between the magnetic fields orientation inside the clouds and the magnetic fields at envelope scales and their connection with respect to the observed morphology of the selected clouds. We examine the magnetic field orientation towards the clouds L1512, L1523, L1333, L1521E, L1544, L1517, L1780, and L183, using optical and Planck polarization observations. We also found the correlation between the ambient magnetic field and core orientations derived using Astrodendrogram on the Herschel 250 $\\mu$m data. We find that the magnetic fields derived from optical and Planck agree with each other. The derived magnetic fields are aligned along the observed emission of each cloud as seen in Herschel 250 $\\mu$m data. We also find that the relative orientation between the cores and the magnetic fields is random. This lack of correlation may arise due to the fact that the core orientation could also be influenced by the different magnetization within individual clouds at higher densities or the feedback effects which may vary from cloud to cloud. The estimated magnetic field strength and the mass-to-flux ratio suggest that all the clouds are in a magnetically critical state except L1333, L1521E, and L183, where the cloud envelope could be strongly supported by the magnetic field lines.</jats:p>",

The Pt/deAl-Beta@Mg(OH)2 catalytic system is designed to obtain a higher 1,2-PDO production yield. The optimal yield of 1,2-PDO is 34.1%. The unique shell-core structure of the catalyst demonstrates stability, with a catalytic yield of over 30% after three times of use. The primary process path from glucose to 1,2-PDO, glucose-hexitol-1,2-PDO, is speculated by the experiments of intermediate product selectivity. The alkaline catalytic mechanism of the reaction process is elucidated by studying catalyst characterization and analyzing different time courses of products. The introduction of Mg(OH)2 improves the target yield by promoting the isomerization from glucose to fructose and retro-aldol condensation (RAC) conversion, with pseudo-yield increases of 76.1% and 42.1%, respectively. By studying the processes of producing lactic acid and 1,2-PDO from glucose, the glucose hydrogenolysis flow chart is improved, which is of great significance for accurately controlling 1,2-PDO production in industrial applications. The metal, acid, and alkali synergistic catalytic system constructed in this paper can provide a theoretical basis and route reference for applying biomass conversion technology in practice.</jats:p>"

In more than 60% of AML patients, the PI3K/AKTs/mTOR signaling pathway is aberrantly activated because of oncogenic driver alterations and further enhanced by chemotherapy as a mechanism of drug resistance. Against this backdrop, very recently we have started a multidisciplinary research project focused on AKT1 as a pharmacological target to identify novel anti-AML agents. Indeed, the serendipitous finding of the in-house compound T187 as an AKT1 inhibitor has paved the way to the rational identification of new active small molecules, among which T126 has emerged as the most interesting compound with IC50 = 1.99 ± 0.11 μM, ligand efficiency of 0.35, and a clear effect at low micromolar concentrations on growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in AML cells.

When Helicobacter pylori was positive, eradication therapy was performed. Among them, 124 patients completed the study protocol (follow-up duration &gt; 3 years or development of metachronous recurrence during the follow-up). Methylation levels of MOS were measured at baseline using quantitative MethyLight assay from the antrum.Results Median follow-up duration was 49.9 months. MOS methylation levels at baseline were not different by age, sex, and current H. pylorii infection, but they showed a weak correlation with operative link on gastritis assessment (OLGA) or operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia assessment (OLGIM) stages (Spearman’s ρ=0.240 and 0.174, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). During the follow-up, a total of 20 metachronous gastric neoplasms (13 adenomas and 7 adenocarcinomas) were developed. Either OLGA or OLGIM stage was not useful in predicting the risk for metachronous recurrence. In contrast, MOS methylation high group (≥ 34.82%) had a significantly increased risk for metachronous recurrence compared to MOS methylation low group (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 14.79; p=0.007).Conclusion MOS methylation can be a promising marker for predicting metachronous recurrence after endoscopic resection of gastric neoplasms. To confirm the usefulness of MOS methylation, validation studies are warranted in the future (ClinicalTrials No. NCT04830618).</jats:p>",

In this study, three kinds of polyethylene (PE) with different rigidity are used respectively to prepare polypropylene/ethylene–propylene rubber/polyethylene (PP/EPR/PE) ternary composites by melt blending, in which the EPR‐to‐PE ratio is 1:1. Atomic force microscopy‐infrared (AFM−IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicate that core‐shell rubber particles with a PE core and an EPR shell are formed in situ and uniformly dispersed in the PP matrix. Mechanical measurements show that at the same modifier content the PP composites toughened with these core‐shell rubber particles exhibit higher toughness and stiffness than that with EPR alone, and the more rigid the PE core, the greater the effects. These results are in quantitative agreement with a recent theoretical model, providing solid experimental evidence in support of the latter. Furthermore, this work demonstrates an economical approach to toughening PP by partial substitution of the EPR with the much cheaper PE for better performance.</jats:p>",

Here, we continued the study of this peptide’s mode of action and explored the correlation between the biological activity and its primary structure. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the ultrastructural effects of SmAPα1-21 in conidial cells. New peptides were designed by modifying the parent peptide SmAPα1-21 (SmAPH19R and SmAPH19A, where His19 was replaced by Arg or Ala, respectively) and synthesized by the Fmoc solid phase method. Antifungal activity was determined against F. graminearum. Membrane permeability and subcellular localization in conidia were studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy and CLSM. SmAPα1-21 induced peroxisome biogenesis and oxidative stress through ROS production in F. graminearum and was internalized into the conidial cells’ cytoplasm. SmAPH19R and SmAPH19A were active against F. graminearum with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 38 and 100 µM for SmAPH19R and SmAPH19A, respectively. The replacement of His19 by Ala produced a decrease in the net charge with a significant increase in the MIC, thus evidencing the importance of the positive charge in position 19 of the antifungal peptide. Like SmAPα1-21, SmAP2H19A and SmAP2H19R produced the permeabilization of the conidia membrane and induced oxidative stress through ROS production. However, SmAPH19R and SmAPH19A were localized in the conidia cell wall. The replacement of His19 by Ala turned all the processes slower. The extracellular localization of peptides SmAPH19R and SmAPH19A highlights the role of the His19 residue in the internalization.</jats:p>"

We have determined the elemental concentrations and zinc stable isotope ratios (δ<jats:sup>66</jats:sup>Zn) in bulk sediments and the trace metal concentrations in chemical fractions of a 9-m-long sediment core from Osaka Bay. Our goals were (1) to reconstruct the historical trace metal contamination, and (2) to identify anthropogenic Zn sources and the solid phases of anthropogenic trace metals. The core provided a continuous environmental record of the last 2300 years based on radiocarbon dating of molluscan shells. Copper, Zn, and Pb showed an initial enrichment from the 1670s AD, which could be caused by human activities due to an increasing population. In agreement with previous findings, the trace metal concentrations slightly increased from the 1870s, strongly increased from the beginning of the twentieth century, and peaked around 1960 before environmental pollution control laws were enacted. Increasing trace metal concentrations in the acid-labile and reducible fractions obtained by the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction procedure toward the surface indicate carbonates and Mn oxyhydroxides were the primary fractions for anthropogenic trace metals. The δ<jats:sup>66</jats:sup>Zn values (1) were constant until the 1940s, suggesting that the average δ<jats:sup>66</jats:sup>Zn of industrial sources was indistinguishable from that value of the natural background, (2) showed a slight decrease from the 1950s and remained constant until the present, and (3) fell in a binary mixing process between a lithogenic (~ + 0.27‰) and an anthropogenic endmember (~ + 0.17‰), the latter likely representing a mixture of various Zn sources such as road dust, tire wear, industrial effluents, and effluents from wastewater treatment plants. We conclude the combination of Zn stable isotopes together with chemical fractions obtained by the BCR method represents a promising approach to assess the trace metal sources and their potential mobility in sediment cores from anthropogenically affected coastal areas.</jats:p>"

This study was devoted to the identification of potential prognostic biomarkers based on the tumor microenvironment associated with immunotherapy for melanoma. This study integrates a couple of melanoma single cell and transcriptome sequencing datasets and performs a series of silico analyses as nicely as validation of molecular biology techniques. A core set of immune escape related genes was identified through Lawson et al. and the ImmPort portal. The differential proteins were identified through the cBioPortal database. Regression analysis was used to profile independent prognostic factors. Correlation with the level of immune cell infiltration was evaluated by multiple algorithms. The capacity of LCK to predict response was assessed in two independent immunotherapy cohorts. High LCK expression is associated with better prognosis, high levels of TILs and better clinical staging. Pathway analysis showed that high expression of LCK was significantly associated with activation of multiple tumor pathways as well as immune-related pathways. LCK expression tends to be higher in immunotherapy-responsive patients and those with lower IC50s treated with chemotherapeutic agents. RT-qPCR detected that LCK expression was significantly upregulated in melanoma cell lines. Single-cell transcriptome analysis showed that LCK was specifically highly expressed on T cells. CellChat analysis confirmed that LCK in C2 subpopulations and T cell subpopulations exerted immune promotion between cells by binding to CD8 receptors. In conclusion, LCK is a reliable biomarker for melanoma and will contribute to its immunotherapy.</jats:p>"

Therefore, simple deposition experiments of thermoplastic PEEK/CF prepreg tapes on a PEI closed-cell foam were carried out. 3D surface profile measurements and peel tests according to DIN EN 28510-1 standard were used to investigate the joining area and bonding quality. The results show that a cohesive bond is formed between the deposited tapes and the foam core, however the foam structure in the area of the deposited tapes deforms in dependence of the process parameters, and increasingly with higher deposition temperatures. Due to the deformations that occur during tape deposition, the thermomechanical foam behavior under the TAFP process conditions was investigated in more detail in a subsequent study for an extensive parameter space using a simple experimental setup. Results show that for suitable process parameters, namely a short contact time and a high temperature, the foam deformation can be minimized with the simultaneous formation of a thin melting layer required for cohesive bonding.

However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia‐induced ferroptosis resistance.

Owing to the good carrier of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>as fuel, PM‐CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone.

As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases encoded in language models—statistical estimates of the relationships between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this work, we investigate how differences in gender-specific word frequency distributions and language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of dataset bias removal via data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and reduce biases in natural language processing pipelines.</jats:p>",

This work examines these effects for heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), an ubiquitous combination given the role of hBN as an encapsulating material. By comparing results of density functional calculations with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results, we explore the hybridisation between the valence states of the TMD and hBN layers, and show that it introduces avoided crossings between the TMD and hBN bands, with umklapp processes opening ‘ghost’ avoided crossings in individual bands. Comparison between density functional theory (DFT) and ARPES spectra for the MoSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/hBN heterostructure shows that the valence bands of MoSe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and hBN are significantly further separated in energy in experiment as compared to DFT.

Here, the optofluidic light cage consisting of a sparse array of micrometer encircling a hollow core represents an innovative concept, particularly for on-chip waveguide-based spectroscopy. In the present work, we demonstrate the potential of the optofluidic light cage concept in the context of integrated on-chip fluorescence spectroscopy. Specifically, we show that fluorescent light from a dye-doped aqueous solution generated in the core of a nanoprinted dual-ring light cage can be efficiently captured and guided to the waveguide ports. Notably, the fluorescence collection occurs predominantly in the fundamental mode, a property that distinguishes it from evanescent field-based waveguide detection schemes that favor collection in higher-order modes. Through exploiting the flexibility of waveguide design and 3D nanoprinting, both excitation and emission have been localized in the high transmission domains of the fundamental core mode. Fast diffusion, detection limits comparable to bulk measurements, and the potential of this approach in terms of device integration were demonstrated. Together with previous results on absorption spectroscopy, the achievements presented here suggest that the optofluidic light cage concept defines a novel photonic platform for integrated on-chip spectroscopic devices and real-time sensors compatible with both the fiber circuitry and microfluidics. Applications in areas such as bioanalytics and environmental sciences are conceivable, while more sophisticated applications such as nanoparticle tracking analysis and integrated Raman spectroscopy could be envisioned.</jats:p>",

The density-based method, as one of the various clustering algorithms, has achieved good performance. However, it works poor in dealing with multidensity and complex-shaped datasets. Moreover, the result of this method depends heavily on the parameters we input. Thus, we propose a novel clustering algorithm (called the MST-DC) in this paper, which is based on the density core. Firstly, we employ the reverse nearest neighbors to extract core objects. Secondly, we use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to cluster the core objects. Finally, the remaining objects are assigned to the cluster to which their nearest core object belongs. The experimental results on several synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of the MST-DC to Kmeans, DBSCAN, DPC, DCore, SNNDPC, and LDP-MST.</jats:p>",

The intensity of the low‐wavenumber (289 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) peak showed no polarization dependence. The high‐wavenumber (386 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) peak and the continuous background signal were strongly polarized in the incident light polarization direction. These responses were almost independent of the in‐plane crystal orientation to the incident polarization, as is the manifestation of the \n point group symmetry of the unit cell of Co<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Sn<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. According to the group theory and Raman tensor analyses, the low‐ and high‐wavenumber Raman signals are attributed to Γ point phonon modes with \n and \n symmetries, respectively. Furthermore, line shape analyses revealed that the high‐wavenumber \n mode exhibited asymmetric peak feature well described by the Breit–Wigner–Fano function. These results suggest the Fano resonance between the \n phonon scattering with the continuous electronic background associated with low energy excitations near the Fermi energy. The clarified phonon energies and symmetries, as well as the electronic contribution to the Raman scattering, will not only be useful as a fingerprint to readily verify the experimentally grown or theoretically calculated crystal structure but also suggest importance of Raman spectroscopy as an effective tool to study low energy excitations and their interactions in Co<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Sn<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.</jats:p>",

Methods  This study was conducted a pre and post quasi experimental study for single-group with 109 students in the 4th grade of Nursing school at H University, located in G province. The in-school practice training lasted 90 hours for two weeks, in parallel with online and offline learnings such as online lectures, home visits, self-learning, face-to-face simulation practice, and core skill evaluation. Data were collected by online questionnaires, and data analysis was performed with the SPSS win 25.0 program and the corresponding sample T-test. Results  It was found that the in-school practice education in community health nursing improved the self-directed learning(t=6.22, p=.000) and core nursing competency(t=6.89, p=.000) of nursing students. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the infection control awareness(t=1.89, p=.062), but there was significant increase of the awareness of the hand hygiene(t=2.44, p=.016) and linen(t=2.69, p=.008) which were listed in the sub-category. Conclusions  This study confirmed the positive effects of the in-school practice that integrates the online-learning and face-to-face simulation for community health nursing science while field clinical practice is limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, it is necessary to develop more programs that include various contents embracing field practice and in-school practice adjusted with the characteristics of the local community and to study effective teaching methods.</jats:p>",

In this study, we investigated the tissue distribution of SAA derived peptides in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of human myocardium with amyloidosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). In the whole SAA protein, four trypsin-digested peptides in the range of SAA2-67 were visualized and the N-terminal peptide; SAA2-15, was selectively localized in the Congo red-positive region. The C-terminal peptides; SAA47-62, SAA48-62, and SAA63-67 were detected not only in the Congo red-positive region but also in the surrounding negative region.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>(1) Background: Hemodynamic assessment of prosthetic heart valves using conventional 2D transthoracic Echocardiography-Doppler (2D-TTE) has limitations. Of those, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area measurement is one of the major limitations of the continuity equation, which assumes a circular LVOT. (2) Methods: This study comprised 258 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), who were treated with the ACURATE neo2. The LVOT area and its dependent Doppler-derived parameters, including effective orifice area (EOA) and stroke volume (SV), in addition to their indexed values, were calculated from post-TAVI 2D-TTE. In addition, the 3D-LVOT area from pre-procedural MDCT scans was obtained and used to calculate corrected Doppler-derived parameters. The incidence rates of prosthesis patient mismatch (PPM) were compared between the 2D-TTE and MDCT-based methods (3) Results: The main results show that the 2D-TTE measured LVOT is significantly smaller than 3D-MDCT (350.4 ± 62.04 mm2 vs. 405.22 ± 81.32 mm2) (95% Credible interval (CrI) of differences: −55.15, −36.09), which resulted in smaller EOA (2.25 ± 0.59 vs. 2.58 ± 0.63 cm2) (Beta = −0.642 (95%CrI of differences: −0.85, −0.43), and lower SV (73.88 ± 21.41 vs. 84.47 ± 22.66 mL), (Beta = −7.29 (95% CrI: −14.45, −0.14)), respectively. PPM incidence appears more frequent with 2D-TTE- than 3D-MDCT-corrected measurements (based on the EOAi) 8.52% vs. 2.32%, respectively. In addition, significant differences regarding the EOA among the three valve sizes (S, M and L) were seen only with the MDCT, but not on 2D-TTE. (4) Conclusions: The corrected continuity equation by combining the 3D-LVOT area from MDCT with the TTE Doppler parameters might provide a more accurate assessment of hemodynamic parameters and PPM diagnosis in patients treated with TAVI. The ACURATE neo2 THV has a large EOA and low incidence of PPM using the 3D-corrected LVOT area than on 2D-TTE. These findings need further confirmation on long-term follow-up and in other studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare form of liver cancer primarily affecting children and young adults. Although considered a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FLC has unique molecular and pathologic characteristics, suggesting that it may require different treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are used in the treatment of HCC, but efficacy and safety in FLC has not been characterized. Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with FLC to determine responses to ICI therapy. Response rates were assessed based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, and Kaplan–Meier statistics were used for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: FLC tumors were characterized by low tumor mutational burden (TMB) and absent PD-L1 expression. We identified 19 patients who received ICIs, including 15 who received ICI therapy alone [programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, +/− cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor]. Objective tumor responses were observed in 3/19 patients (15.8%), including 2/15 patients (13.3%) who received ICIs alone, all partial responses. Median PFS and OS were 5.5 and 26.0 months, respectively. Grade 3–4 immune related adverse events were observed in 4/19 (21.1%) patients. Conclusions: ICI therapy has modest clinical activity in FLC, and novel therapeutic combinations are needed.</jats:p>"

Three architectures are designed for considerations pertaining to energy migration and energy transfer within nanoparticles: outside-in, inside-out, and local energy transfer. The outside-in architecture produces the maximum upconversion luminescence, around 6-times brighter than that of the inside-out at the single-particle level. Monte Carlo simulation suggests a topology-dependent energy migration favoring the upconversion luminescence of outside-in structure. The optimized outside-in structure shows more than an order of magnitude enhancement of upconversion brightness compared to the conventional core-shell structure at the single-particle level and is used for long-term single-particle tracking in living cells. Our findings enable rational nanoprobe engineering for single-molecule imaging and also reveal counter-intuitive relationships between upconversion nanoparticle structure and optical properties.</jats:p>"

Recently discovered topological phases of light endow the photonics devices with extraordinary properties, such as reflectionless propagation and robustness against impurities or defects, which is vital for terahertz integrated devices. Leveraging the robustness of topological edge states combined with a low-loss silicon platform is poised to offer a remarkable performance of the terahertz devices providing a breakthrough in the field of terahertz integrated circuits and high-speed interconnects. In this Perspective, we present a brief outlook of various terahertz functional devices enabled by a photonic topological insulator that will pave the path for augmentation of complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatible terahertz technologies, essential for accelerating the vision of 6G communication and beyond to enable ubiquitous connectivity and massive digital cloning of physical and biological worlds.</jats:p>",

Analysis of charge exchange recombination spectroscopy reveals flat or hollow carbon density profiles in the core, and impurity confinement times consistently shorter than energy confinement times. Bayesian inferences of impurity transport coefficients based on laser blow-off injections and forward modeling via the Aurora package (Sciortino <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic> 2021 <jats:italic>Plasma Phys.

Impurity profile shapes remain flat or hollow in all cases. Inferred radial profiles of diffusion and convection are compared to neoclassical, quasilinear gyrofluid, and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. Heat transport is observed to be better captured by reduced turbulence models with respect to particle transport. State-of-the-art gyrokinetic modeling compares favorably with measurements across multiple transport channels. Overall, these results suggest that diverted negative triangularity discharges may offer a path to a highly-radiative L-mode scenario with high core performance.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a navigation system using a technique to reject the outliers measured by sensors. The navigation system was designed to include sensor modeling, navigation filters, and outlier rejection. The sensors used in the navigation system are the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and global positioning system. Before the experiment, a navigation simulation was performed to evaluate the results and validate the proposed navigation algorithm. The results of the experiment verified that the navigation system, including outlier rejection, had less positional error than that of the general navigation system. </jats:p>",

However, it is not clear yet whether such functional configurations would be able to identify the NCC. We scanned resting‐state fMRI data from 21 subjects during wakefulness, propofol‐induced sedation, and anesthesia. Graph‐theoretical analyses were conducted on awake fMRI data to search for the NCC candidates as brain regions that exhibit both high rich‐clubness and high modular variability, which were found to locate in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices. Another independent data set of 10 highly‐sampled subjects was used to validate the NCC distribution at the individual level. Brain module‐based dynamic analysis revealed two discrete reoccurring brain states, one of which was dominated by the NCC candidates (state 1), while the other state was predominately composed of primary sensory/motor regions (state 2). Moreover, state 1 appeared to be temporally more stable than state 2, suggesting that the identified NCC members could sustain conscious content as metastable network representations. Finally, we showed that the identified NCC was modulated in terms of functional connectedness and modular variability in response to the loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia. This work offers a framework to search for neural correlates of consciousness by charting the brain network topology and provides new insights into understanding the roles of different regions in underpinning human consciousness.</jats:p>",

A\nunique opportunity to investigate decadal to millennial variability during\npast glacial and interglacial periods is provided by the high-resolution\nwater isotopic record (δ18O and δD) available for the\nEDC ice core. We present here a continuous compilation of the EDC water\nisotopic record at a sample resolution of 11 cm, which consists of 27 000\nδ18O measurements and 7920 δD measurements (covering,\nrespectively, 94 % and 27 % of the whole EDC record), including\npublished and new measurements (2900 for both δ18O and δD) for the last 800 kyr. Here, we demonstrate that repeated water isotope\nmeasurements of the same EDC samples from different depth intervals obtained using different analytical methods are comparable within analytical uncertainty. We thus combine all available EDC water isotope measurements to\ngenerate a high-resolution (11 cm) dataset for the past 800 kyr. A\nfrequency decomposition of the most complete δ18O record and a\nsimple assessment of the possible influence of diffusion on the measured\nprofile shows that the variability at the multi-decadal to multi-centennial\ntimescale is higher during glacial than during interglacial periods and\nhigher during early interglacial isotopic maxima than during the Holocene.\nThis analysis shows as well that during interglacial periods characterized\nby a temperature optimum at the beginning, the multi-centennial variability\nis strongest over this temperature optimum.\n                    </jats:p>"

Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH 7.4 and two‐dimensional membrane‐like assemblies at pH 3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H‐aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three‐dimensional organization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In large-scale disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, quick and sufficient transportation of emergency relief supplies is required. Logistics activities conducted to quickly provide appropriate aid supplies (relief goods) to people affected by disasters are known as humanitarian logistics (HL), and play an important role in terms of saving the lives of those affected. In the previous last-mile distribution of HL, supplies are transported by trucks and helicopters, but these transport methods are sometimes not feasible. Therefore, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transport supplies is attracting attention due to their convenience regardless of the disaster conditions. However, existing transportation planning that utilizes UAVs may not meet some of the requirements for post-disaster transport of supplies. Equitable distribution of supplies among affected shelters is particularly important in a crisis situation, but it has not been a major consideration in the logistics of UAVs in the existing study. Therefore, this study proposes transportation planning by introducing three crucial performance metrics: (1) the rapidity of supplies, (2) the urgency of supplies, and (3) the equity of supply amounts. We formulated the routing problem of UAVs as the multi-objective, multi-trip, multi-item, and multi-UAV problem, and optimize the problem with Q-learning (QL), one of the reinforcement learning methods. We performed reinforcement learning for multiple cases with different rewards and quantitatively evaluated the transportation of each countermeasure by comparing them. The results suggest that the model improved the stability of the supply of emergency relief supplies to all evacuation centers when compared to other models.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, a large effective SANE of 2.8 μV/K was obtained in the Fe4N film on the STO(001) substrate. The origin of the enhanced effective SANE is the negatively large Seebeck coefficient (SSE) in an oxygen deficient STO layer near the surface of the STO substrate.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 345 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Rural and non-English speaking populations experience a disproportionate burden of financial toxicity and access to services for their cancer care. Lessening the Impact of Financial Toxicity (LIFT) is an intervention designed to address financial toxicity (FT) through financial navigation (FN). FN identifies patients at risk for FT, assesses eligibility for financial support, clarifies costs, and develops strategies to cope with costs. LIFT was successful in reducing financial toxicity in preliminary studies among English-speaking patients with high levels of FT in a single large academic cancer center. To benefit diverse patients with FT in cancer programs across the US, there is a need to adapt LIFT. Adapting LIFT requires distinguishing between its core functions— the components of LIFT key to its effectiveness and implementation, and its forms— the activities that comprise LIFT, facilitate its implementation, and may be adapted to accommodate new populations and contexts. We completed the first stage of adaptation, identifying LIFT core functions. Methods: We conducted interviews with individuals responsible for LIFT’s design and implementation. Interview questions were based on Kirk’s methods for identifying core functions and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using a codebook based on the Model for Adaptation Design and Impact, we coded interview transcripts and identified themes related to how LIFT engaged cancer program staff in FN (implementation core functions) and decreased FT (intervention core functions). Results: Eight interview participants filled various roles in designing and implementing LIFT (e.g., P.I.s; FNs). LIFT intervention core functions include a systematic way of cataloging knowledge, resources, and tracking patient information; using patient-specific needs to guide access to resources; ongoing, dynamic assistance and strong one-on-one relationships between navigators and patients; and removing common barriers to accessing resources. Conclusions: We identified core functions key to LIFT’s effectiveness and implementation. Next steps include identifying systematic differences between LIFT’s original context and population and new ones. Successfully adapting LIFT has the potential to extend its benefits to diverse patients in cancer programs throughout the US, such as Spanish-speaking patients served by rural community cancer programs. </jats:p>",

However, few cases exist in which the pollutant capture efficiency inside the fume hood is precisely analyzed and quantitatively visualized. In this study, the capture performance of a fume hood under actual use conditions was evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The factors that could affect the performance, that is, the exhaust airflow rate, experimental instruments inside, worker in front, and heat source within the fume hood, were parametrically considered. The numerical analyses revealed that experimental instruments near the opening surface significantly affected the airflow into the fume hood and decreased its capture performance. Under the inadequate condition of a low exhaust airflow rate, pollutant leakage inside the chamber was observed due to the presence of a worker in front of the fume hood and the heat source inside. Furthermore, the pollutant capture performance was slightly improved by changing the layout/position of the experimental instrument.</jats:p>",

Functional experiments in lineage-selective SEs demonstrated their specific roles in directed differentiation of hMSCs.

For the hydrodynamics, we use two models: a simple thermal bomb model and a specified hydrodynamics model for SN1987A. For the presupernova model, we take an updated model, adjusted to explain SN1987A, which employs recent developments in the (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>) reaction rates for nuclei near the stability line (<jats:italic>A</jats:italic> ∼ 100). As for the neutrino luminosity, we adopt two different models: equivalent neutrino luminosity and nonequivalent luminosity models. The latter is taken from a synthetic analysis of CCSN simulation data, which quantitatively presented the results obtained by various neutrino transport models. Relevant neutrino-induced reaction rates are calculated using a shell model for light nuclei and a quasiparticle random phase approximation model for heavy nuclei. For each model, we present abundances of the light nuclei (<jats:sup>7</jats:sup>Li, <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>Be, <jats:sup>11</jats:sup>B, and <jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C) and the heavy nuclei (<jats:sup>92</jats:sup>Nb, <jats:sup>98</jats:sup>Tc, <jats:sup>138</jats:sup>La, and <jats:sup>180</jats:sup>Ta) produced by the neutrino process. The light nuclei abundances turn out to be sensitive to the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein (MSW) region around O-Ne-Mg layer while the heavy nuclei are mainly produced prior to the MSW region. Through detailed analyses, we find that neutrino self-interaction becomes a key ingredient, in addition to the MSW effect, for understanding the neutrino process and the relevant nuclear abundances. The normal mass hierarchy is shown to be more compatible with the meteorite data. The main nuclear reactions for each nucleus are also investigated in detail.</jats:p>",

However, based on the high-energy output and estimated age of K2-3, it is unlikely that K2-3b and c retain solar composition atmospheres. We pass the planet parameters and high-energy stellar spectrum to atmospheric models. Dialing the high-energy spectrum up and down by a factor of 10 produces significant changes in trace molecule abundances, but not at a level detectable with transmission spectroscopy. Though the K2-3 planets span the small-planet radius valley, the observed system architecture cannot be readily explained by photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. We instead propose that (1) the K2-3 planets are all volatile-rich, with K2-3d having a lower density than typical of super-Earths, and/or (2) the K2-3 planet architecture results from stochastic processes such as planet formation, planet migration, and impact erosion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the rising demand for lightweight and high-performance shielding systems, sandwich panels made of thin rigid face sheets and cellular material cores have recently received much attention. The present study aims to investigate the perforation behaviour of lightweight sandwich panels made of fibre reinforced composite face sheets and aluminium foam core under quasi-static and dynamic testing conditions. A particular focus is made on the fibre hybridization effect on the overall panel behaviour. Impact perforation tests were conducted using an inverse perforation technique. Instead of conventional free-flying projectile impact tests, studied samples are fixed in a hollow projectile. Then, this assembly is accelerated toward an instrumented steel perforator replacing the incident bar of a split Hopkinson pressure bar. Consequently, this modified split Hopkinson pressure bar system can be used as both a perforator and a measuring device. Therefore, the piercing force-displacement curves, the energy absorption capability as well as the penetration and damage mechanisms of the tested panels was analysed and compared to quasi-static perforating tests. To better assess the testing results, quasi-static tensile and bending tests were carried out on the face sheets materials. Moreover, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were performed on the aluminium foam core using conventional test methods and direct split Hopkinson pressure bar. Unlike the aluminium alloy face sheets, the experimental findings revealed that the sandwich panels with composite face sheets demonstrated higher rate sensitivity, better perforation resistance and specific energy absorption capability. Results have also shown that the hybridization of carbon and glass fabrics combined their best tension and bending properties as well as their higher dynamic strength, which has increased the sandwich panel's perforation resistance. </jats:p>",

Then, the acceleration response data generated by road vibration are obtained by solving the road finite element model. Finally, the power density spectrum of the acceleration response is taken as input excitation, and the deformation response of the PCB under vehicle–road coupling vibration is analyzed. The experimental results show that when the vehicle is driving close to the roadside, the vibration caused by vehicle–road coupling will lead to a large deformation of the PCB, and the deformation value reaches 0.170 mm, which can cause structural damage to the PCB. This shows that the vehicle–road coupling vibration can affect the reliability of the roadside electromechanical equipment; thus, the optimal design of the PCB layout is created.

Although mutation in core promoter sequences is expected to cause abnormal gene expression leading to pathogenic consequences, limited supporting evidence showed the involvement of core promoter mutation in diseases. Our previous study showed that the core promoter is highly polymorphic in worldwide human ethnic populations in reflecting human history and adaptation. Our recent characterization of the core promoter in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer, in a Chinese TNBC cohort revealed the wide presence of core promoter mutation in TNBC. In the current study, we analyzed the core promoter in a Thai TNBC cohort. We also observed rich core promoter mutation in the Thai TNBC patients. We compared the core promoter mutations between Chinese and Thai TNBC cohorts. We observed substantial differences of core promoter mutation in TNBC between the two cohorts, as reflected by the mutation spectrum, mutation-effected gene and functional category, and altered gene expression. Our study confirmed that the core promoter in TNBC is highly mutable, and is highly ethnic-specific.</jats:p>",

Near-diffraction-limited MIR light was transmitted by HCFs at wavelengths of 3.12–3.58 µm using a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) as the light source. The HCFs were purged beforehand with argon in order to remove or reduce loss due to parasitic gas absorption (HCl, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, etc.). The minimum fiber loss values were 0.05 and 0.24 dB/m at 3.4–3.6 µm and 4.5–4.6 µm, respectively, with the 4.5–4.6 µm loss figure representing, to the best of our knowledge, a new low loss record for a HCF in this spectral region. At a coupling efficiency of ∼70%, average powers of 592 mW and 133 mW were delivered through 5 m and 108 m of HCF, respectively. Assuming the 120-ps duration of the MIR pulses remained constant over the low-dispersion HCF (theoretical maximum: 0.4 ps/nm/km), the corresponding calculated peak powers were 4.9 kW and 1.1 kW.</jats:p>",

Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between animal facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multicentre study, whereby inbred C57BL/6J mice from a single breeding cohort were allocated to and reared in 5 different animal facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of the rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that environmental variation among animal facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organisation. We detected changes in chromatin organisation in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between animal facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. Furthermore, they highlight an important limitation of inferences from single-laboratory studies and thus argue that study designs should take environmental background into account to increase the robustness and replicability of findings.</jats:p>"

We follow the simulations through shock revival up to several seconds post-bounce, and show that the EC rates produce a consistent imprint on CCSN properties, often surpassing the role of the progenitor itself. Notable impacts include the timescale of core collapse, the electron fraction and mass of the inner core at bounce, the accretion rate through the shock, the success or failure of revival, and the properties of the central compact remnant. We also compare the observable neutrino signal of the neutronization burst in a DUNE-like detector, and find consistent impacts on the counts and mean energies.

Recent work has shown that low-mass helium shell models reproduce observations of normal SNe Ia. We present 3D radiative transfer simulations for a suite of 3D simulations of the double detonation explosion scenario for a range of shell and core masses. We find light curves broadly able to reproduce the faint end of the width–luminosity relation shown by SNe Ia, however, we find that all of our models show extremely red colours, not observed in normal SNe Ia. This includes our lowest mass helium shell model. We find clear Ti ii absorption features in the model spectra, which would lead to classification as peculiar SNe Ia, as well as line blanketing in some lines of sight by singly ionized Cr and Fe-peak elements. Our radiative transfer simulations show that these explosion models remain promising to explain peculiar SNe Ia. Future full non-LTE simulations may improve the agreement of these explosion models with observations of normal SNe Ia.</jats:p>",

Despite reduced viremia, HIV-2-infected individuals display signs of chronic immune activation. In HIV-1-infected individuals, B-cell hyperactivation is driven by continuous antigen exposure. However, the contribution of viremia to B-cell perturbations in HIV-2-infected individuals remains largely unexplored. Here, we used polychromatic flow cytometry, consensus hierarchical clustering and pseudotime trajectory inference to characterize B-cells in HIV-1- or HIV-2-infected and in HIV seronegative individuals. We observed increased frequencies of clusters containing hyperactivated T-bethighCD95highCD27int and proliferating T-bet+CD95highCD27+CD71+ memory B-cells in viremic HIV-1 (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), viremic HIV-2 (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.014, respectively) and in treatment-naïve aviremic HIV-2 (p = 0.004 and p = 0.020, respectively)-infected individuals, compared to seronegative individuals. In contrast, these expansions were not observed in successfully treated HIV-1-infected individuals. Finally, pseudotime trajectory inference showed that T-bet-expressing hyperactivated and proliferating memory B-cell populations were located at the terminal end of two trajectories, in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. As the treatment-naïve aviremic HIV-2-infected individuals, but not the successfully ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals, showed B-cell perturbations, our data suggest that aviremic HIV-2-infected individuals would also benefit from antiretroviral treatment.</jats:p>"

The lattice mismatch between the core and shell materials can cause strong interface strain, which affects the surface structures. Therefore, surface functional properties such as catalytic activities can be designed by fine-tuning the misfit strain at the interface. To precisely control the core-shell effect, it is essential to understand how the surface and interface strains are related at the atomic scale. Here, we elucidate the surface-interface strain relations by determining the full 3D atomic structure of Pd@Pt core-shell nanoparticles at the single-atom level via atomic electron tomography. Full 3D displacement fields and strain profiles of core-shell nanoparticles were obtained, which revealed a direct correlation between the surface and interface strain. The strain distributions show a strong shape-dependent anisotropy, whose nature was further corroborated by molecular statics simulations. From the observed surface strains, the surface oxygen reduction reaction activities were predicted. These findings give a deep understanding of structure-property relationships in strain-engineerable core-shell systems, which can lead to direct control over the resulting catalytic properties.</jats:p>"

Using dietary data from the 1997–2011 National Birth Defects Prevention Study, we determine how maternal dietary profiles associate with orofacial clefts among offspring.

Through the overall alignment process, HARSGs with groove densities of 500 gr/mm, 1800 gr/mm, and 3600 gr/mm were fabricated through anisotropic wet etching in KOH solution, producing ultra-high aspect ratios and etch rate ratios greater than 200.</jats:p>",

Solid dose formulation technologies can be adapted for delivery of different vaccine formats including live attenuated vaccines, which remain the ‘gold standard’ for many disease targets. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSV) cause one of the most economically important diseases affecting the global pig industry. Despite several shortcomings, live attenuated vaccines are widely used to control PRRSV. We optimised a freeze-dried USDI formulation of live attenuated PRRSV-1, which fully retained infectious titre, and evaluated its immunogenicity in comparison to virus delivered in liquid suspension via intramuscular and subcutaneous needle inoculation. Pigs vaccinated with the USDI formulation displayed vaccine viraemia, and PRRSV-specific antibody and T cell responses comparable to animals immunised with the liquid vaccine. The USDI vaccine formulation was stable for at least 6 months when stored refrigerated. These data demonstrate the potential for a solid dose vaccine delivery system as an alternative to conventional needle-syringe delivery of live attenuated PRRSV vaccines.</jats:p>"

Gain of 1q (1q+) is of special interest given its high prevalence and is currently actively studied for its prognostic value. However, the underlying mutational mechanisms and functional effects remain unknown. In a national unbiased cohort of 30 primary WTs, we integrated somatic SNVs, CNs and SVs with expression data and distinguished four clusters characterized by affected biological processes: muscle differentiation, immune system, kidney development and proliferation. Combined genome-wide CN and SV profiles showed that tumors profoundly differ in both their types of 1q+ and genomic stability and can be grouped into WTs with co-occurring 1p−/1q+, multiple chromosomal gains or CN neutral tumors. We identified 1q+ in eight tumors that differ in mutational mechanisms, subsequent rearrangements and genomic contexts. Moreover, 1q+ tumors were present in all four expression clusters reflecting activation of various biological processes, and individual tumors overexpress different genes on 1q. In conclusion, by integrating CNs, SVs and gene expression, we identified subgroups of 1q+ tumors reflecting differences in the functional effect of 1q gain, indicating that expression data is likely needed for further risk stratification of 1q+ WTs.</jats:p>"

The onset and progression of RP has physiological consequences that affects the ocular environment. Some of the key non-genetic factors which hasten the retinal degeneration in RP include oxidative stress, hypoxia and ocular inflammation. In this study, we investigated the status of the ocular immune privilege during retinal degeneration and the effect of ocular immune changes on the peripheral immune system in RP. We assessed the peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation by retinal antigens and their immune response status in RP patients. Subsequently, we examined alterations in ocular immune privilege machineries which may contribute to ocular inflammation and disease progression in rd1 mouse model.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>In RP patients, we observed a suppressed anti-inflammatory response to self-retinal antigens, thereby indicating a deviated response to self-antigens.

While B is the element that facilitates the increase in the hardness and the degree of wear resistance, it is also an effective glass former, controlling the formation of a much-desired amorphous structure with specific magnetic properties. Major difficulties related to the proper engineering of Fe-B thin films lay especially in their preparation under well-defined compositions, which in turn, should be accurately determined. The present study closely analyzes the morpho-structural and magnetic properties of thin coatings of Fe-B of approximately 100 nm thickness and with the nominal B content ranging from 5 at. % to 50 at. %. The comparison between films obtained by two preparation methods, namely, the thermionic vacuum arc and the magnetron sputtering is envisaged. Morpho-structural properties were highlighted using X-ray diffraction supplemented with X-ray reflectometry and scanning electron microscopy, whereas the elemental investigations were performed by X-ray dispersive spectroscopy and Rutherford back-scattering spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the Fe-B layers were carefully investigated by the vectorial magneto-optic Kerr effect and conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy. The high capability of Mössbauer Spectroscopy to provide the phase composition and the B content in the formed Fe-B intermetallic films was proven, in correlation to Rutherford back-scattering techniques, and to explain their magnetic properties, including the magnetic texture of interest in many applications, in correlation with longitudinal magneto-optic-Kerr-effect-based techniques.</jats:p>"

The AYA years include key developmental milestones distinct from younger and older patients, and cancer interrupts attainment of critical life goals. Lack of consensus on a standardized approach to assess HRQoL and treatment-related toxicity in AYA CCTs has limited the ability to improve patient outcomes. The National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Trials Network AYA PRO Task Force was assembled to reach consensus on a core set of PROs and foster its integration into AYA CCTs. Eight key considerations for selecting the core PRO AYA battery components were identified: relevance to AYAs; importance of constructs across the age continuum; prioritization of validated measures; availability of measures without licensing fees; availability in multiple languages; applicability to different cancer types and treatments; ability to measure different HRQoL domains and toxicities; and minimized burden on patients and sites. The Task Force used a modified Delphi approach to identify key components of the PRO battery. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the PRO Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Measurement System met all criteria and were selected to assess HRQoL and treatment toxicity, respectively. Investigators are rapidly incorporating the recommendations of the Task Force into AYA trials. Inclusion of a standardized assessment of HRQoL and treatment toxicities in AYA CCTs is a vital first step to develop interventions to improve health outcomes for AYAs diagnosed with cancer.</jats:p>",

Different mass fractions of ATP and ZIF-67@ATP were added to ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)/magnesium hydroxide (MH) composites as flame retardant synergists. The flame retardancy of EVA composites was evaluated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI) test, UL-94 test and cone calorimeter test. Composites containing 3 wt% of ZIF-67@ATP reached an LOI value of 43% and a V-0 rating in the UL-94 test, and the ignition time of the composite increased from 38 s to 56 s. The tensile strength and impact strength of the composites did not change significantly, but the elongation at break increased greatly. Typically, for composites containing 4 wt% of ZIF-67@ATP, the elongation at break of the composites increased from 69.5% to 522.2% compared to the samples without the synergist.

The purpose of this study was to explore the key features, perceived impact, and implementation considerations related to holding interprofessional team meetings as part of an intensive lifestyle medicine program. In this mixed-methods study, focus groups were conducted with 15 lifestyle medicine clinicians from various healthcare disciplines who had participated in interprofessional team meetings. Quantitative descriptive statistics of the meeting minutes were also calculated. Clinician-perceived benefits from participating in interprofessional team meetings included increased acquisition of knowledge, access to other clinicians, collaborative decision-making, patient satisfaction, and achievement of patient-centered goals. Participants described the importance of preparing an agenda for the interprofessional team meetings in advance, but a major implementation challenge was the time required to prepare for and conduct the meetings. Commitment and financial support by organization and program leadership were reported as key facilitators to implementing the meetings. Clinicians perceive significant value from incorporation of interprofessional team meetings into an intensive lifestyle medicine program, but successful implementation of meetings requires investment from all levels within a healthcare system. </jats:p>",

As sulfate radical (SO4•−) could be useful for eliminating emerging contaminants, oxone appears as a favorable source reagent of SO4•− for degrading BHPM. Even though cobalt is a useful catalyst for activating oxone to generate SO4•−, it would be even more promising to utilize ambient-visible-light irradiation to enhance oxone activation using cobaltic catalysts. Therefore, in contrast to the conventional cobalt oxide, cobalt titanium oxide (CTO) was investigated for chemical and photocatalytic activation of oxone to eliminate BHPM from water. Especially, a special morphology of nanosheet-assembled configuration of CTO was designed to maximize active surfaces and sites of CTO. Thus, CTO outperforms Co3O4 and TiO2 in degrading BHPM via oxone activation. Furthermore, the substituent of Ti enabled CTO to enhance absorption of visible light and possessed a much smaller Eg. These photocatalytic properties intensified CTO’s activity for oxone activation. CTO possessed a significantly smaller Ea of degradation of USFs than other catalytic systems. Mechanistic insight for degrading BHPM by CTO + oxone was explicated for identifying contribution of reactive oxygen species to BHPM degradation. The BHPM degradation pathway was also investigated and unveiled in details via the DFT calculation. These results validated that CTO is a superior cobaltic alternative for activating oxone to eliminate BHPM.</jats:p>"

Initiation of this process is caused by the inheritance of an adaptive immune system that is predisposed to responding to beta-cell antigens, most notably to insulin itself, coupled with unknown environmental insults priming the autoimmune reaction. While autoimmunity is a primary driver in beta-cell death, there is growing evidence that cellular stress participates in the loss of beta-cells. In the beta-cell fragility model, partial loss of islet mass requires compensatory upregulation of insulin production in the remaining islets, driving a cellular stress capable of triggering apoptosis in the remaining cells. The Glis3-Manf axis has been identified as being pivotal to the relative fragility or robustness of stressed islets, potentially operating in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here, we have used an AAV-based gene delivery system to enhance the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Manf in the beta-cells of NOD mice. Gene delivery substantially lowered the rate of diabetes development in treated mice. Manf-treated mice demonstrated minimal insulitis and superior preservation of insulin production.

Soils were acid digested using a microwave digestion system, elements were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and SOM was calculated by loss-on-ignition. The non-influenced and vertebrate-influenced soils had similar concentrations of most of the trace elements assessed, however, we observed a significant increase in SOM and P that was positively correlated with the concentrations of As, Cd, Se, Sr and Zn. Although marine vertebrates did not appear to significantly increase the elemental concentrations in the soils examined here, there is a clear evidence of selective enrichment indicating a zoogenic influence. Comparing our results with other studies, we conclude that soil elemental levels are result from an interplay between local geology, vertebrate diet and colony size.

These features will greatly reduce complications in micro-device fabrication and patterning of PZT/Si heterostructures. However, piezoelectric performance of a PZT film is usually dominated by its preferred crystalline orientation, with (001) being superior than (110) and (111). Such a vectorial dependence seriously restricts applications of PZT films grown on (111) Si, which are usually not (001)-textured. In this work, highly (001)-oriented PZT thick films (∼1.5 μm) with a 53/47 Zr/Ti ratio were prepared on (111) Si substrates via a multi-layer buffering technique, i.e., through the use of a (111)Pt/Ti bi-layer and a LaNiO3 buffer layer. The PZT films were sputter-deposited at a low temperature (350 °C) and then crystallized in a (001) texture via a rapid thermal annealing (RTA). The e31,f transverse piezoelectric coefficient was up to ∼11.6 C/m2 for PZT films with a RTA time of 2 minutes. Such an e31,f value is comparable to that of PZT films grown on (100) Si. This work opens up many possibilities for Piezo-MEMS by demonstrating the desirable combination of a large piezoelectricity in (001) PZT with a good patternability of (111) Si.</jats:p>",

The successful visualization, integration, and interpretation of quantitative vein abundance data, associated selvages of wall-rock alteration mineralogy, sulfide mineral proportions, and metal zoning facilitate the path to discovery and orebody delineation. The application of the Anaconda method, developed by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company geologists in the 1960s, to geologic mapping and drill core logging has facilitated the discovery and resource expansion in the giant Alpala porphyry Cu-Au-Ag deposit in northern Ecuador and the Cortadera porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit cluster in northern Chile. In both porphyry systems, high-grade zones have been targeted through the delineation of an intrusion and vein chronology that allows for the recognition of early-stage causal intrusions, zones of abundant porphyry-style quartz veins, and elevated chalcopyrite to pyrite ratios. Increased amounts of molybdenum, as molybdenite along fractures and in quartz veins, as well as anhydrite veins and disseminations, correlate with proximity to the deposit cores. The field-based methods presented in this article have proven useful in porphyry exploration for decades. The application of the Anaconda method of geologic mapping and core logging by geologists can assist in the targeting of high-grade cores of deposits and improved estimation of metal resources.</jats:p>",

Simulated and experimental results show that TIPM can eliminate the correlation between phase, intensity, and polarization of quantum states caused by phase-dependent loss. The design can tolerate a significant fabrication mismatch and is universal to multi-material platforms. Furthermore, TIPM increases the modulation depth achievable by EOPMs in standard process design kit (PDK).

Serial magneto-thermal coupling treatment experiments of 1420 Al-Li alloy and the pure aluminium diffusion couple, together with the gallium interlayer, is carried out in a superconducting high magnetic field device. Various parameter combinations are used to produce different samples on which interface organization and connection performance are studied. Electron microscopic analysis reveals various interface topographies and fracture morphologies after shear strength tests. Influence of diffusion bonding temperature on element diffusion under a high uniform magnetic field is investigated. The diffusion activation energy of Mg element in pure aluminum under a 12 T magnetic field is calculated in this paper. It is found that the bonding quality and bonding performance of the interface are improved greatly after heat treatment with a strong magnetic field, and the bonding temperature is an important factor affecting the interface bonding and bonding strength. The diffusion coefficient of the Mg element in the 1420 Al-Li alloy to L2 pure aluminum increases with the increase of diffusion bonding temperature. Reducing the activation energy of elemental diffusion is beneficial to atomic diffusion.</jats:p>"

However, lignocellulosic biomass from Acacia spp. may be utilised for diverse biorefinery applications. In this study, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), high-performance anion-exchange chromatography pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and lignin content determinations were used for a comparative compositional characterisation of A. dealbata, A. longifolia and A. melanoxylon. Additionally, biomass was treated with three white-rot fungi species (Ganoderma lucidum, Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor), which preferentially degrade lignin. Our results showed that the pre-treatments do not significantly alter neutral sugar composition while reducing lignin content. Sugar release from enzymatic saccharification was enhanced, in some cases possibly due to a synergy between white-rot fungi and mild alkali pretreatments. For example, in A. dealbata stems treated with alkali and P. ostreatus, saccharification yield was 702.3 nmol mg−1, which is higher than the samples treated only with alkali (608.1 nmol mg−1), and 2.9-fold higher than the non-pretreated controls (243.9 nmol mg−1). By characterising biomass and pretreatments, generated data creates value for unused biomass resources, contributing to the implementation of sustainable biorefining systems. In due course, the generated value will lead to economic incentives for landowners to cut back invasive Acacia spp. more frequently, thus reducing excess biomass, which exacerbates wildfire risk.</jats:p>"

However, converting raw RPPA data into normalized, analysis-ready data remains a challenging task. Here, we present the RPPA SPACE (RPPA Superposition Analysis and Concentration Evaluation) R package, a substantially improved successor to SuperCurve, to meet that challenge. SuperCurve has been used to normalize over 170 000 samples to date. RPPA SPACE allows exclusion of poor-quality samples from the normalization process to improve the quality of the remaining samples. It also features a novel quality-control metric, ‘noise’, that estimates the level of random errors present in each RPPA slide. The noise metric can help to determine the quality and reliability of the data. In addition, RPPA SPACE has simpler input requirements and is more flexible than SuperCurve, it is much faster with greatly improved error reporting.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The standalone RPPA SPACE R package, tutorials and sample data are available via https://rppa.space/, CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPPASPACE/index.html) and GitHub (https://github.com/MD-Anderson-Bioinformatics/RPPASPACE).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

These yarns undergo tensile fatigue loading, a typical phenomenon that happens on various parts of clothing, during use and wear. The study on the response of yarns during cyclic loading is essential because it leads to a better understanding of the growth characteristics when repeatedly loaded during the use of core spun yarn fabrics. In this study, the impact of various production parameters such as linear density, stretch percentage, twist multiplier, and the number of cyclic loading on the fatigue value of core-spun yarns was investigated. 18 different core spun yarns were manufactured by modified ring spinning to investigate the effect of various production parameters on fatigue value before and after 10, 20, and 30 load cycles. Experimental results showed that there is an increase in fatigue value with an increase in the number of load cycles. Statistical analysis showed that there is a significant effect of linear density, stretch percentage, and twist multiplier on the fatigue value of yarn. There is a reduction in fatigue value with an increase in linear density, stretch percentage, and twist multiplier of yarn. The contribution of the number of cyclic loading was found to be more dominating in comparison to other process parameters like linear density, twist multiplier, and stretch percentage on the fatigue value of core-spun yarns.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The application of graphene in new light-emitting devices has been extensively studied since the demonstration of the ultrafast luminescence from single-layer graphene. The control of luminescence using doping techniques is crucial for these applications. In particular, for the application of graphene in flexible and wearable devices, electrochemical doping is a promising approach, and its influence on luminescence properties of the resulting material needs to be examined. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of the electrochemical doping of graphene using an ion gel on the photoluminescence (PL) of graphene at the emission energy ℏω of 0.9 eV. The Fermi energy EF of graphene was controlled from +40 to −560meV, and femtosecond PL was observed. The PL intensity was maximum when EF was −440meV (|EF|≈ℏω/2). This trend of the PL intensity is due to (i) an increase in the PL emission rate owing to the doping-induced empty states in the valence band acting as the final states of the radiative relaxation of hot electrons and (ii) an increase in the non-radiative relaxation rate owing to the acceleration of carrier–carrier scattering by the doping-induced increase in the density of states around the EF.</jats:p>",

Herein, spectroscopic imaging-scanning tunneling microscopy was employed to investigate the correlated states residing in 1D electrons of the monolayer and bilayer MoSe2 mirror twin boundary (MTB). The Coulomb energies, determined by the wire length, drive the MTB into two types of ground states with distinct respective out-of-phase and in-phase charge orders. The two ground states can be reversibly converted through a metastable zero-energy state with in situ voltage pulses, which tune the electron filling of the MTB via a polaronic process, substantiated by first-principles calculations. Our Hubbard model calculation with an exact diagonalization method reveals the ground states as correlated insulators from an on-site U-originated Coulomb interaction, dubbed the Hubbard-type Coulomb blockade effect.

ICF Core Sets and ICF Checklists are streamlined disease-specific resources for clinical use, service provision, and for use in health economics and health policy. ICF can disclose strengths and weaknesses across multiple patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and help consolidate best-fitting question-items from multiple PROMs. Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), are generally progressive, with restrictive physiology sometimes occurring in the context of multi-organ autoimmunity/inflammatory conditions such as connective tissue diseases (CTDs). In spite of significant associated morbidity and potential disability, ILD has yet to be linked to the ICF.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Each instrument and their question-items within the consensus-recommended core sets for clinical trials in ILD were deconstructed to single concept units, and then linked per updated ICF linkage rules. Inter-linker agreement was established. Three additional subsequently validated measures were also included.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> One-hundred-eleven ICF categories were identified for ten PROMs and three traditional objective measures that were amenable to ICF linkage. The proportion of agreement ranged from 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.91) to 0.93 (0.76, 0.99) with the overall proportion of inter-linker agreement being very high 0.86 (0.82, 0.89) for the initial instruments, with 94–100% for the three additional PROMs. Thirty-four new ‘Personal Factors’ emerged to capture disease-specific qualities not elsewhere described in ICF, e.g. ‘pf_embarrassed by cough’ or ‘pf_panic/afraid when can’t get a breath’.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This first known effort in ICF linkage of ILD has provided important revelations on the current utility of the ICF in lung disease. Results have indicated areas for meaningful assessment of ICF descriptors for lung impairment. The mapping across PROMs provides insight into possibilities of developing more streamline and precise instrumentation. Finally, familiarity with the ICF in ILD may enable clinicians to experience a smoother transition with the imminent harmonization of ICD and ICF, ICD-11.</jats:p>"

However, it remains unclear how specialists adapt to only limited nutritional conditions in nature. In this study, we addressed this question by focusing on Drosophila fruit flies. The generalist Drosophila melanogaster can consume a wide variety of foods that contain high glucose levels. In contrast, the specialist Drosophila sechellia consumes only the Indian mulberry, known as noni (Morinda citrifolia), which contains relatively little glucose. We showed that the lifespan of D. sechellia was significantly shortened under a high-glucose diet, but this effect was not observed for D. melanogaster. In D. sechellia, a high-glucose diet induced disorganization of the gut epithelia and visceral muscles, which was associated with abnormal digestion and constipation. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that many immune-responsive genes were suppressed in the gut of D. sechellia fed a high-glucose diet compared with those fed a control diet. Consistent with this difference in the expression of immune-responsive genes, high glucose-induced phenotypes were restored by the addition of tetracycline or scopoletin, a major nutritional component of noni, each of which suppresses gut bacterial growth. We propose that, in D. sechellia, a high-glucose diet impairs gut immune function, which leads to a change in gut microbiota, disorganization of the gut epithelial structure and a shortened lifespan.</jats:p>",

They have been found to elicit enhanced, long-lived B cell responses. The basis for improved efficacy of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines remains unresolved, including whether recruitment of CD4 T cells specific for the ferritin component of these vaccines contributes to cognate help in the B cell response. Using influenza HA-ferritin nanoparticles as a prototype, we have performed an unbiased assessment of the CD4 T cell epitope composition of the ferritin particles relative to that contributed by influenza HA using mouse models that express distinct constellations of MHC class II molecules. The role that these CD4 T cells play in the B cell responses was assessed by quantifying follicular helper cells (T<jats:sub>FH</jats:sub>), germinal center (GC) B cells, and antibody secreting cells. When mice were immunized with equimolar quantities of soluble HA-trimers and HA-Fe nanoparticles, HA-nanoparticle immunized mice had an increased overall abundance of T<jats:sub>FH</jats:sub> that were found to be largely ferritin-specific. HA-nanoparticle immunized mice had an increased abundance of HA-specific isotype-switched GC B cells and HA-specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) relative to mice immunized with soluble HA-trimers. Further, there was a strong, positive correlation between CD4 T<jats:sub>FH</jats:sub> abundance and GC B cell abundance. Thus, availability of helper CD4 T cell epitopes may be a key additional mechanism that underlies the enhanced immunogenicity of ferritin-based HA-Fe-nanoparticle vaccines.</jats:p>"

The surgical delivery of the photovoltaic subretinal implant causes minor RT changes that settle after 3 months, and then remain stable over long-term with no adverse structural or functional effects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The “core and strap-on boosters” layout of launch vehicle (LV) stages is quite common in heavy LV development. However, POGO oscillations in liquid-propellant LVs with this stage layout have some features.       It is shown that the structure of LVs of this type as a dynamic object has a dense spectrum of natural frequencies and complex spatial mode shapes. The longitudinal oscillations of the identical elements of the LV side strap-on boosters may be in phase or in antiphase, while the longitudinal mode shapes of the LV central core and strap-on boosters may differ both in phase and in amplitude. In flight, the thrust of the engines of the side strap-on boosters may also oscillate in phase or in antiphase, as a result of which the interaction of the LV structure with the sustainer propulsion systems of the side strap-on boosters may have both a stabilizing and a destabilizing effect on the POGO stability of a liquid-propellant LV.       This paper presents a mathematical model of the “liquid-propellant propulsion systems – LV structure” dynamic system. The model describes the interaction of the longitudinal vibrations of the structure of a two-stage “core and strap-on boosters” LV with the core and strap-on booster propulsion systems. The free longitudinal vibrations of the structure of a ‘core and strap-on boosters’ LV were simulated using computer-aided finite element design tools (CAE systems). The simulation was the first to account for the dissipation of the liquid propellant and LV structure oscillation energy.       The paper suggests an approach to analyzing the POGO stability of liquid-propellant “core and strap-on boosters” LVs with the use of the Nyquist criterion generalized to the case of multidimensional dynamic systems. The approach is based on opening the thrust feedback loops of the “liquid-propellant propulsion systems – structure” closed-loop dynamic system and studying the stability of the one-channel systems obtained in this way. Based on the proposed approach, the interaction between the longitudinal vibrations of the “core and strap-on boosters” LV structure and low-frequency processes in the liquid-propellant sustainer propulsion systems of the LV first stage was studied numerically.</jats:p>",

The human isoform 1 (hPGK1) is associated with cancer development and rare genetic diseases that affect several of its features. To investigate how mutations affect hPGK1 folding landscape and interaction networks, we have introduced mutations at a buried site in the N-terminal domain (F25 mutants) that either created cavities (F25L, F25V, F25A), enhanced conformational entropy (F25G) or introduced structural strain (F25W) and evaluated their effects using biophysical experimental and theoretical methods. All F25 mutants folded well, but showed reduced unfolding cooperativity, kinetic stability and altered activation energetics according to the results from thermal and chemical denaturation analyses. These alterations correlated well with the structural perturbation caused by mutations in the N-terminal domain and the destabilization caused in the interdomain interface as revealed by H/D exchange under native conditions. Importantly, experimental and theoretical analyses showed that these effects are significant even when the perturbation is mild and local. Our approach will be useful to establish the molecular basis of hPGK1 genotype–phenotype correlations due to phosphorylation events and single amino acid substitutions associated with disease.</jats:p>"

To determine mechanisms by which neutrophils, as early responders to bacterial challenge, direct inflammatory programming of human intestinal epithelium, we established a multi-component human intestinal organoid (HIO) model of STM infection. HIOs were micro-injected with STM and seeded with primary human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN-HIOs). PMNs did not significantly alter luminal colonization of<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>, but their presence reduced intraepithelial bacterial burden. Adding PMNs to infected HIOs resulted in substantial accumulation of shed TUNEL<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>epithelial cells that was driven by PMN Caspase-1 activity. Inhibition of Caspases-1, -3 or -4 abrogated epithelial cell death and extrusion in the infected PMN-HIOs but only Caspase-1 inhibition significantly increased bacterial burden in the PMN-HIO epithelium. Thus, PMNs promote cell death in human intestinal epithelial cells through multiple caspases as a protective response to infection. IL-1β was necessary and sufficient to induce cell shedding in the infected HIOs. These data support a critical innate immune function for human neutrophils in amplifying cell death and extrusion of human epithelial cells from the<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>-infected intestinal monolayer.</jats:p>"

The surface plasmon excited grating target enhances the electron flux and temperature by factor of 6.0 and 3.6, respectively, compared to that of the plane substrate. Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate that fast electrons are emitted in different directions at different stages of the laser interaction, which are related to the resultant surface magnetic field evolution.

We investigated immune responses towards inactivated whole influenza virus particle vaccine (WPV) formulations, predicated to be more immunogenic, in a non-human primate model, as an important step towards clinical testing in humans. Comprehensive analyses were used to capture 46 immune parameters to profile how WPV-induced responses differed to those elicited by antigenically-similar SV formulations. Naïve cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with either monovalent or quadrivalent WPV consistently induced stronger antibody responses and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres against vaccine-matched viruses compared to SV formulations, while acute reactogenic effects were similar. Responses in WPV-primed animals were further increased by boosting with the same formulation, conversely to modest responses after priming and boosting with SV. 28-parameter multiplex bead array defined key antibody features and showed that while both WPV and SV induced elevated IgG responses against A/H1N1 nucleoprotein, only WPV increased IgG responses against A/H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and HA-Stem, and higher IgA responses to A/H1N1-HA after each vaccine dose. Antibodies to A/H1N1-HA and HA-Stem that could engage FcγR2a and FcγR3a were also present at higher levels after one dose of WPV compared to SV and remained elevated after the second dose. Furthermore, WPV-enhanced antibody responses were associated with higher frequencies of HA-specific B-cells and IFN-γ-producing CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T-cell responses. Our data additionally demonstrate stronger boosting of HI titres by WPV following prior infection and support WPV administered as a priming dose irrespective of the follow up vaccine for the second dose. Our findings thus show that compared to SV vaccination, WPV-induced humoral responses are significantly increased in scope and magnitude, advocating WPV vaccination regimens for priming immunologically-naïve individuals and also in the event of a pandemic outbreak.</jats:p>"

The complex nature of the pharmaceutical care process is an indication for an essential tool that investigates drug use pattern in health facilities. The WHO released the core drug use indicators to address these issues. The study assessed drug use in a tertiary hospital in southeast Nigeria based on WHO core drug use indicators.  Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used and the study was conducted from October 2021 to June 2022. Retrospectively, 300 prescriptions were selected and reviewed using systematic random sampling for a year from 2020 -2021 to investigate prescribing indicators. A total of 120 randomly selected patients and pharmacy personnel were observed and interviewed to investigate the patient-care and facility-specific indicators. The WHO/INRUD core drug use indicators were used to assess the patterns of drug use in comparison to the result gotten.  Results: The average number of drugs per encounter was 2.76, the Percentage of drugs prescribed by generic names was 78.02%, the Percentage of antibiotics prescribed was 33.33%, and the Percentage of injections prescribed was 1.67%. Average consulting time in minutes was 17.5 minutes, the average dispensing time in seconds was 92.1 seconds, the Percentage of drugs actually dispensed was 76.97%, Percentage of adequately labeled was 100%, and the percentage of patients’ knowledge of correct dosage was 90%. The facility did not have an Essential Drug List but had all (100%) the key drugs listed by the WHO drug list.  Conclusion: All of the prescribing indicators deviated from the WHO/INRUD recommended optimal values. Patient-care and facility-specific indicators deviated from the optimal values except that of the average consultation time, average dispensing time, percentage of drugs adequately labeled, and 100% availability of key drugs. Although a few of the WHO benchmark for rational drug use were met, the outcomes were not satisfactory and required interventions to improve rational drug use in the facility.</jats:p>"
