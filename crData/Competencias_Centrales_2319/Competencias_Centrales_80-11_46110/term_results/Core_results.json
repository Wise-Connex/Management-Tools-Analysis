Acoustic waveguide probes, located in the engine at the combustor, in the turbine exit and in the core nozzle, were used to measure internal fluctuating pressures. Low-frequency acoustic power determined at the core nozzle exit corresponds in level to the farfield acoustic power at engine speeds below 70% of maximum, the approach condition. At engine speeds above 70% of maximum, the jet noise dominates in the farfield, greatly exceeding that of the core. From coherence measurements, it is shown that the combustor is the dominant source of the low-frequency core noise. The results obtained from the JT-15D engine compare favorably with those obtained previously from a YF-102 engine, both engines having reverse flow annular combustors and being in the same size class.</jats:p>",

The n=0→1 inelastic cross section energy dependence is studied between the first and second thresholds of an harmonic oscillator target description. A strong dependence on the coupling matrix is found for the resonance structures and widths, while an ultrasimple evaluation of perturbative corrections for locating the resonance positions is also discussed.

The quaternary structure of multisubunit biomolecules can be studied by this new method if total reconstitution works in a quantitative way and if extensive replacement of C‐bound hydrogen (H) by deuterium (<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>H) is possible. A substitution of the selected subunits by their fully deuterated analogues was used for the analysis of the overall shapes of the core subunits α<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, β and β′<jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> and for the determination of the intersubunit centre‐to‐centre distances. The contrast between the buffer and the remaining ‘hydrogenated’ enzyme vanishes if the buffer contains 42%<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O (matching of scattering length densities). The isotopic hybridization of the enzyme fulfils the conditions of isomorphous replacement as required: molecular functions, like enzyme activity, were completely preserved.</jats:p><jats:p>The orientations of the core subunits within the holoenzyme were derived by comparing theoretical and experimental pair distance distribution functions, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>), obtained from the scattering in tensity differences of the pair‐labelled (e.g. both β and β′ labelled) and both mono‐labelled molecules by direct Fourier transformations. Additional, the subunit shapes were refined by <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>) analyses.
