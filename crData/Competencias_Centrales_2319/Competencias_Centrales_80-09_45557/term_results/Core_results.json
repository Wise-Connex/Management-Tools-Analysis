      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1896 when Emil Wiechert proposed his model of the Earth with an iron core and stony shell, scientists generally believed that the entire earth was a solid as rigid as steel. R. D. Oldham’s identification of P and S waves in seismological records allowed him to detect a discontinuity corresponding to a boundary between core and shell (mantle) in 1906, and Beno Gutenberg established the depth of this boundary as 2900 km. But failure to detect propagation of S waves through the core was not sufficient evidence to persuade seismologists that it is fluid (contrary to modern textbook statements). Not until 1926 did Harold Jeffreys refute the arguments for solidity and establish that the core is liquid. In 1936 Inge Lehmann discovered the small inner core. K. E. Bullen argued, on the basis of plausible assumptions about compressibility and density, that the inner core is solid. Attempts to find seismic signals that have passed through the inner core as S waves have so far failed (with one possible exception), but analysis of free oscillations provided fairly convincing evidence for its solidity.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of rock characteristics alone on misciblє displacement behavior through a combination of displacement testing and modeling. Modeling was used to characterize the displacements and to extrapolate the observed phenomena to untestable conditions. The displacement tests were used to calibrate the model and to test the model's predictive capabilities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A number of stabilized CO2 displacements and xylene displacing iso-octane tests were conducted in both outcrop sandstones and San Andres reservoir carbonate core samples. By flooding with xylene displacing iso-octane, phase behavior complications and viscous fingering were avoided. Such an idealized displacement represented the \"best case\" laboratory miscible displacement. Effluent concentration profiles for the xylene displacing iso-octane floods were matched to the capacitance-dispersion model of Coats and Smith1 to estimate the magnitude of axial dispersion and so-called \"dead-end\" pore volume or capacitance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The latter quantity was found to be essentially zero in outcrop sandstones but quite variable in the highly heterogeneous San Andres carbonates, attaining values as high as 50%. Axial dispersion followed similar trends. The carbonates displayed more variable and larger axial dispersion than the sandstones.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>First contact and CO2 miscible flooding residual oil saturations were compared in the same core samples. Both measures of residual oil saturation were in agreement and depended on the particular sample. These data suggest microscopic heterogeneity is a primary determinant of residual oil saturation to miscible flooding when viscous fingering is controlled. Microscopic heterogeneity resulting from a non-uniform pore structure was characterized by the level of dispersion and capacitance in the rock sample. In addition, both laboratory data and model prediction showed that the effect of dispersion and capacitance on residual oil saturation decreased as the displacement was extrapolated to reservoir rates and system lengths of a few feet. This implies that microscopic heterogeneity is more important in laboratory systems than in field displacements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents a procedure for indexing n-person cooperative games in terms of degree of nonsymmetry. This ordinal-level index is limited to sidepayment games, but applies generally to games of three or more players. To validate the index, a laboratory experiment was conducted with four-person games differing in degree of nonsymmetry and in core size. The results show that, while core size had no significant effects, the players' payoffs varied significantly as a function of nonsymmetry. Strong players received increasingly more and weak players received increasingly less as nonsymmetry increased. Tests for goodness of fit of several prominent solution concepts show that, across experimental treatments, the Shapley value predicts better than other solutions. Shapley is followed in order by the disruption nucleolus, the nucleolus, and finally the equality solution. These tests also show that all of the theories decline in predictive accuracy as the degree of nonsymmetry increases. Reasons for this trend are discussed in terms of predictive patterns and payoff variances. </jats:p>",

The standard deviation of the obtained correlation is ~ 0.5 eV, which is substantially better than the earlier CNDO/2 GPM and RPM results. The scatter of the correlated values is diminished to roughly 1/3 of the previous CNDO/2 results. The merits and shortcommings of the electrostatic potential model are briefly discussed. It is concluded that the present approach provides a useful tool for studying ESCA shifts in large molecules of biochemical interest.</jats:p>",
