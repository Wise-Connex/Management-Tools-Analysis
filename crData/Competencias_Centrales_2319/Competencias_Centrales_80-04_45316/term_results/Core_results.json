Both the N ls and 3a1 hole states are found to be planar. In comparison with the ground state, the N–H bond length is significantly shortened for the core hole state but relatively unchanged for the 3a1 hole state. The results lead to a core ESCA spectrum dominated by a progression of closely spaced vibrational peaks of the pure bending mode and to a 3a1 x-ray spectrum with excited stretch–bend combination bands.</jats:p>",

The differences in BE relative to pyridine are analysed in terms of existing theoretical approaches (electrostatic, ground potential, and relaxation potential models) and compared with [Formula: see text] values calculated for analogous monosubstituted benzenes. One finds good correlations of [Formula: see text] with solution determined σ-substituent values although some substituent values deviate from the correlation probably due to solution effects which are not present in the gas phase. Correlations between [Formula: see text] and <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>N nmr chemical shifts are poor, particularly for electron withdrawing substituents. The relationship between [Formula: see text] and gas phase basicity values (ΔG<jats:sup>0</jats:sup>) is good, and it appears as if the [Formula: see text] is more sensitive to the substituent than ΔG<jats:sup>0</jats:sup>.
