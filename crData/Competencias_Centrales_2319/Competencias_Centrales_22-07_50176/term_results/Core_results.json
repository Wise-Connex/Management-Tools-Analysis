The preparation process is simple and implies the attachment of metalized fiber networks to a PDMS sheet substrate while heating and applying compression. The resulting composite is versatile and can be cut in different shapes as a function of the application sought. When an electric current passes through the metallic web, heat is produced, leading to local dilatation and to subsequent controlled deformation. Because of this, the artificial muscle displays a fast and ample movement (maximum displacement of 0.8 cm) when applying a relatively low voltage (2.2 V), a consequence of the contrast between the thermal expanse coefficients of the PDMS substrate and of the web-like electrode. It was shown that the electrical current producing this effect can originate from both direct electric contacts, and untethered configurations i.e. radio frequency induced. Usually, for thermal activated actuators the heating is produced by using metallic films or conductive carbon-based materials, while here a fast heating/cooling process is obtained by using microfiber-based heaters. This new approach for untethered devices is an interesting path to follow, opening a wide range of applications were autonomous actuation and remote transfer of energy are needed.</jats:p>"

The W<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> test which has been proposed to determine the abrasion resistance of rocks used as natural building stones is carried out on only prismatic samples. In the design of rock engineering structures such as tunnels, dams and investigations for various purposes, samples are supplied as cylindrical cores from exploration drillings. The applicability of this test on cylindrical samples is the scope of this study. Physical and mechanical properties of nine types of rock materials are determined on these core samples in accordance with the relevant standards and suggested methods. In the context of this study, core samples with average diameters of 26.76, 39.72, 47.80, 58.16 and 67.51 mm were prepared. After that, the Wide Wheel Abrasion tests on core samples (I<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>) were carried out. It is obvious that the abrasion values obtained on samples with different diameters will differ. To overcome this uncertainty applying core abrasion test on samples with 50 mm diameter is suggested and it is proposed as core abrasion index (I<jats:sub>A−50</jats:sub>). If needed, applicability of I<jats:sub>A−50</jats:sub> test on half-cut cores (I<jats:sub>A−HC</jats:sub>) was also investigated, and significant linear correlation was obtained. I<jats:sub>A−50</jats:sub> values were correlated with rock material parameters and significant relationships were proposed. It is believed that practical, economical, and non-destructive determination of I<jats:sub>A−50</jats:sub> values will be effective to make the approach more widespread, and it will be useful in various rock engineering applications as a new parameter.</jats:p>"

Thermal fluctuation of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions with spin-transfer torque (STT) shows promise for unconventional computing, whereas its rigorous representation, based on the Néel-Arrhenius law, has been controversial. In particular, the exponents for thermally-activated switching rate therein, have been inaccessible with conventional thermally-stable nanomagnets with decade-long retention time. Here we approach the Néel-Arrhenius law with STT utilising superparamagnetic tunnel junctions that have high sensitivity to external perturbations and determine the exponents through several independent measurements including homodyne-detected ferromagnetic resonance, nanosecond STT switching, and random telegraph noise. Furthermore, we show that the results are comprehensively described by a concept of local bifurcation observed in various physical systems. The findings demonstrate the capability of superparamagnetic tunnel junction as a useful tester for statistical physics as well as sophisticated engineering of probabilistic computing hardware with a rigorous mathematical foundation.</jats:p>"

The framework is reminiscent of state-sum models and lattice topological quantum field theories, but is formalised and unified in terms of tensor networks. In contrast to existing tensor network ansatzes for the study of ground states of topologically ordered phases, the tensor networks in our formalism represent discrete path integrals in Euclidean space-time. This language is more directly related to the Hamiltonian defining the model than other approaches, via a Trotterization of the respective imaginary time evolution. We introduce our formalism by simple examples, and demonstrate its full power by expressing known families of models in 2+1 dimensions in their most general form, namely string-net models and Kitaev quantum doubles based on weak Hopf algebras. To elucidate the versatility of our formalism, we also show how fermionic phases of matter can be described and provide a framework for topological fixed point models in 3+1 dimensions.</jats:p>"

Given the long-range nature of the couplings, \nwe consider two setups: one in which the number of particles coupled to the \nbaths is fixed (intensive coupling) and one in which it is proportional\nto the size N (extensive coupling).\nIn both cases, we compute analytically the heat fluxes and the kinetic temperature \ndistributions using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, both in the classical and quantum regimes. In the large N limit, we derive the \nasymptotic expressions of both quantities as a function of N and the temperature difference between the baths. We discuss a peculiar feature of the model, namely that the bulk \ntemperature vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, due to a decoupling of the dynamics of the inner part of the system from the baths. At variance with the usual\ncase, this implies that the steady-state depends on the initial state\nof the bulk particles.  \nWe also show that quantum effects are relevant only below a characteristic \ntemperature that vanishes as 1/N.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Discontinuities in foam-core composite sandwich panels are challenging to assess, in part due to shortcomings in the fundamental understanding of failure processes occurring in the foam. Extensive testing and analysis are frequently required to overcome this lack of understanding when evaluating large-scale structures. This integrated experimental and analytical study investigates the effect of core thickness mismatches on the load carrying capabilities of composite sandwich structures. These mismatches are commonly found in large composite components in aerospace, marine, automotive and other industries and can cause major reductions in sandwich shear strength. Mismatches result from joints between separate pieces of foam core within the sandwich, becoming potential failure initiation sites. Quantifying the reduction in shear strength is difficult due to the complex interaction between the facesheets, butt-joints and core. Sandwich structures containing butt joints are investigated through a research effort that included fabrication, testing, analysis, and nondestructive evaluations. The strength reduction of sandwich beams due to the presence of butt joints is quantified via three-point bend (3PTB) testing for various types of mismatches such as height and thickness of the butt joint. Key mechanical properties of the foam and the lamina are measured through testing and incorporated into analytical models. A stress area approach is proposed as a failure criterion, as test results show this to be promising in predicting the strength reductions measured in the 3PTB testing and the failure initiation site. </jats:p>",

In TERS, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is commonly used for tip position control. AFM is often controlled under the contact mode for TERS, whereas the tapping mode, which is another major operation mode, has not often been employed despite several advantages, such as low sample damage. One of the reasons is the low TERS signal intensity because the tip is mostly away from the sample during the tapping motion. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the effect of the tapping amplitude on the TERS signal. We numerically evaluated the dependence of the TERS signal on tapping amplitude. We found that the tapping amplitude had a significant effect on the TERS signal, and an acceptable level of TERS signal was obtained by reducing the amplitude to a few nanometers. We further demonstrated amplitude-controlled tapping-mode TERS measurement. We observed a strong dependence of the TERS intensity on the tapping amplitude, which is in agreement with our numerical calculations. This practical but essential study encourages the use of the tapping mode for further advancing TERS and related optical techniques.\n</jats:p>"

Consequently, organizational scholars have increasingly studied individual-level antecedents of employee pro-environmental or “green” behavior (EGB). We argue that, to advance this literature and to inform effective interventions, research should investigate how EGB, as a compound performance domain, is associated with antecedents and consequences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, team, work context, organization, society). Accordingly, we pursue three interrelated goals with this paper. We first present a comprehensive review of research on EGB, including definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. Second, we develop an integrative conceptual model of EGB as the core of organizational environmental sustainability. Third, we conclude with recommendations for future theory development and methodological improvements, as well as practical implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management.</p>"

The inverse structure showed a reasonably good and stable external quantum efficiency due to the well-balanced carrier densities at both low and high voltages which was confirmed by an electrical simulation study. Also, the peak position of the hole and electron recombination rate in the inverse structure was located on the ITO side, which is beneficial for reducing exciton quenching and photon absorption by metallic electrodes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The continuous release of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) into the environment may bring along health concerns following human exposure. One important source of ENMs are silver nanoparticles (NPs) that are extensively used as anti-bacterial additives. The introduction of ENMs into the human body can occur via ingestion, skin uptake, or the respiratory system. Therefore, evaluating how NPs translocate over bio-membranes is essential in assessing their primary toxicity. Unfortunately, data regarding membrane-NP interaction is still scarce, as is a theoretical and in-silico insight that governs adhesion and translocation for the most relevant NPs and membranes. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular descriptions alleviate this situation but are hampered by the absence of a direct link to specific NP materials and membrane adhesion mechanisms. Here, we interrogate the relationship between the standard CG NP representation and the adhesion characteristics of a model lung membrane. We find that the standard model is inapt of describing silver (Ag) NPs of different sizes, meaning that a matching CG representation for one size is not transferable to other sizes. In addition, we identify two basic types of primary adhesion - (partial) NPs wrapping by the membrane and NP insertion into the membrane - that depend on the NP’s overall hydrophobicity and significantly differ in terms of lipid coatings. The non-transferability of the standard CG model forms an inspiration for introducing a core-shell model even for bare NPs that are uniform in composition. We show that this extension allows us to reproduce the size-dependent adhesion properties of bare Ag NPs at the atomistic scales. Next, we evaluate adhesion signatures for bare Ag NPs up to 10 nm diameter, illustrating that the previously atomically resolved lipid response to binding is correctly reproduced at the CG level. The simulation for the largest NP provides insight into the role of water in trapping NPs into defected mixed monolayer- bilayer states. This metastable situation is well beyond the previously considered elastic models and implicit-solvent molecular descriptions. We expect this development to be instrumental for simulating NP membrane adhesion towards experimental length and time scales for particular NP materials.</jats:p>"

The rate equations are solved numerically using the Euler method for an OSL and an organic semiconductor laser diode, including 4,4′-bis[(N-carbazole)styryl]biphenyl (BSB-Cz) as a gain medium. The results showed that the loss mechanisms that affect the exciton and photon densities cause an increase in the laser threshold and a decrease in the slope efficiency. Further, we demonstrated that by using a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter as a gain medium, the triplet excitons could be harvested by increasing the reverse intersystem crossing rate (<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>\n                     <jats:italic>RISC</jats:italic>\n                  </jats:sub>), resulting in an appreciable decrease of the laser threshold and an increase of the slope efficiency.

This nanosegregated phase was identified using polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction analysis. In this nanosegregated phase, the enantiomeric domains grew to a few millimeters and a giant circular dichroism was observed.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the differential effects of ADIM, AB, and DNS on diaphragm movement, abdominal muscle thickness difference, and external abdominal oblique (EO) electromyography (EMG) amplitude. METHODS: Forty-one participants with core instability participated in this study. The subjects performed ADIM, AB, and DNS in random order. A Simi Aktisys and Pressure Biofeedback Unit (PBU) were utilized to measure core stability, an ultrasound was utilized to measure diaphragm movement and measure abdominal muscles thickness and EMG was utilized to measure EO amplitude. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted at P&lt; 0.05. RESULTS: Diaphragm descending movement and transverse abdominis (TrA) and internal abdominal oblique (IO) thickness differences were significantly increased in DNS compared to ADIM and AB (P&lt; 0.05). EO amplitude was significantly increased in AB compared to ADIM, and DNS. CONCLUSIONS: DNS was the best technique to provide balanced co-activation of the diaphragm and TrA with relatively less contraction of EO and subsequently producing motor control for efficient core stabilization.</jats:p>",

The uneven nature of digitalization has been established at various levels: global, national and sectoral. As a result of the uneven nature development of the digital economy, two sectors of this economy have been pointed out. They may be identified as the core and periphery of the digital economy. It has been revealed that the differences between the core and the periphery of the digital economy are generally due to the elements specific character of the working environment (manufacturing situation).

Later on, the authors describe the material circularity in the concept of close-loop and open-loop production. Further on, the authors examine the recycling of different waste categories as an essential element necessary for the circularity, give the results of reviewing various sectors and present key elements affecting material circularity. The authors revised the set of variables and formed a correlation matrix and used a dynamic regression model to identify the circular material use rate. The authors suggested a three-level methodology that provided a dynamic regression model that could be applied for forecasting the size of circular material use rate in European Union countries. The empirical research results show that the key elements affecting the circularity of materials are private investments dedicated for recycling, the recycling of electronic waste and other municipal waste.</jats:p>"

Single core Fe3O4@PDA, Fe3O4@SiO2-FITC-SiO2 and Fe3O4@SiO2-RITC-SiO2 MNPs were functionalized with fluorescent components with emission at different wavelengths, 424 nm (polydopamine), 515 (fluorescein) and 583 nm (rhodamine), and their ability as transfection and imaging agents was explored with HeLa cells. Moreover, different multi-core iron oxide MNPs (Fe3O4@CS, Fe3O4@SiO2 and Fe3O4@Citrate) coated with organic (citrate and chitosan, CS) and inorganic (silica, SiO2) shells were tested as efficient nanoheaters for magnetic hyperthermia applications for mild thermal heating procedures as an alternative to simple structures based on single-core MNPs.

Materials and Methods: A sample of 61 collegiate athletes from Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University participated in the study. Their core stability was assessed through their McGill and DLL test scores. Their upper-extremity performance was assessed through their UQYBT, MBTT and FTPI test scores. Results: The McGill test score had a significant strong positive correlation with the MBTT score (p = 0.02, r = 0.67) and a significant moderate positive correlation with the UQYBT score (p = 0.01, r = 0.46). There was no significant correlation between the McGill and FTPI test scores (p ≥ 0.05). The DLL test score was positively correlated with the MBTT score (p = 0.02, r = 0.25) but had no significant correlation with the other sports performance variables (p ≥ 0.05). Conclusion: The study results suggest that core stability measures are positively correlated with most of the upper-extremity athletic-performance measures in collegiate athletes. The MBTT score was found to be the most significantly correlated with the scores in both core stability tests among all the upper-extremity athletic-performance tests in this study. However, due to the nature of this study, a cause–effect relationship cannot be established on the basis of the study’s findings, and the study results should be interpreted with caution.</jats:p>"

Forward modelling assuming a cylindrical shape shows the patch is ~600 km wide, ~20 km high, and its shear velocities are ~25% reduced. The ULVZ is comparable to other broad ULVZs mapped on the core-mantle boundary near Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa.  Strikingly, all four hotspots where the mantle plume appears rooted by these ‘mega-ULVZs’, show similar anomalous isotopic signatures in He, Ne, and W in their ocean island basalts. This correlation suggests mega-ULVZs might be primordial or caused by interaction with the core, and some material from ULVZs is entrained within the plume.

So far, there are no scales to measure these core strengths. In the present study, we applied an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to select three 6-item scales from the 96-item IPIP-VIA-R inventory. Thereby, we constructed balanced-keyed scales that cover the heterogeneous constructs well, showed good model fit and reliability across six samples from Germany and the U.K. (total N = 2,754), and achieved scalar measurement invariance across countries. Furthermore, we demonstrated the scales’ validity by locating the three core strengths in a nomological net with personality and value metatraits, life satisfaction, and behavioral criteria. Available in the public domain, these both valid and economic core strengths scales may further stimulate integrative research on personality and values.</p>"

Here, we assess commonalities and differences between exudates of different plant species, diurnal exudation dynamics, as well as the accompanying methodological aspects of exudate sampling. \nWe find that exudates should be collected for hours rather than days as many metabolite abundances saturate over time, that growth in sterile, nonsterile, or sugar-supplemented environments significantly alters exudate profiles (sugar-supplemented: more carbohydrates, less organic acids, organoheterocyclic compounds). Brachypodium distachyon grown in. nonsterile conditions further display distinct root morphology compared to sterile or sugar-supplemented conditions. A comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, and Medicago truncatula shoot, root, and exudate metabolite profiles revealed clear differences between these species, but also a core metabolome for tissues and exudates. Exudate profiles also exhibit a diurnal signature.

( 中 論 Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way) written by Nagarjuna is the most fundamental classic work of the Madhyamaka School, and it is also the core essence of the teachings of the Middle Way idea. Nagarjuna used a distinctive dialectical methodology in Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way to break away from other sects thoughts and vigorously promote the meaning of “Emptiness” of Mahayana Buddhism. The method of dialectics in Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way is not negated simply for negation. However, the purpose of this negation is to express affirmation instead. By denying the contradiction in the other different theories, the objective of affirming the correctness of the his own theory is achieved. Furthermore, the meaning of “Emptiness” expressed by Nagarjuna is not the void of nothingness, but the standpoint of the middle way, emphasizing the emptiness of nature while not denying the absence of existence. Hence, he criticized all thoughts that did not conform to the true meaning of the middle way, and expounded that the true nature of reality was emptiness. This paper will deconstruct the main idea of Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way from the three aspects of the emptiness of nature, eight negations of the middle way, and the conventional truth and the ultimate truth to further explore the meaning of Nagarjuna’s middle way.</jats:p>"

Similar to foam and honeycomb, folded cores are widely used in aerospace as the cores for sandwich structures due to their excellent mechanical properties and light structural weight. In general, the core’s configuration is heterogeneous and anisotropic, while from a macroscopic point of view it is considered homogeneous. Analytical solutions of equivalent mechanical properties are generally obtained by equivalent methods and modified by numerical simulations due to the complexity of the configuration. We can find the best combination of a core’s parameters by using analytical solutions. The faceted regular folded configuration (RFC), consisting of repetitive identical cells, can be expanded to a plane. According to the principle of equivalent load-deformation, this article investigates the equivalent mechanical properties of the V-type folded core (VFC). The analytical solutions of Ez—equivalent elastic modulus in Direction z, equivalent shear modulus in Plane xz—Gxz, and equivalent shear modulus in Plane yz—Gyz have been obtained and verified by numerical simulations. In addition, the reliability of the equivalent mechanical properties is further demonstrated by the case study. By applying the analytical solutions, the optimization process of VFC can be simplified and sped up, which is of great engineering significance to the aircraft design process.</jats:p>"

I hold that, given some assumptions, constitutional courts should replace majority rule with supermajority rules to declare statutes unconstitutional. I assume that (i) there are substantive standards for assessing the constitutionality of legislation; (ii) given reasonable disagreement, statutes should be presumed constitutional; (iii) my claims only apply to some constitutional adjudication systems; and (iv) my claims only apply to “well-functioning democracies.” Given these assumptions, I argue that constitutional courts should use supermajority rules to declare statutes unconstitutional for three reasons: first, supermajority rules may boost judges’ accuracy more than majority rule on mathematical grounds and on deliberative grounds; second, supermajority rules may increase constitutional courts’ reputation by signaling consensus; and third, supermajority rules may embody the presumption of constitutionality of legislation. I finish by tackling some possible objections. Specifically, I tackle the concern that, under supermajority rules, too many statutes that should be declared unconstitutional would stay constitutional; the concern that supermajority rules in constitutional adjudication could be used to erode a democracy; and the concern that, under supermajority rules, some declarations of unconstitutionality that one judges as correct may not have happened.</jats:p>",

Fifteen genes overlap between the glycan biosynthesis-related genes defined by GlycoMaple and the antioxidative response genes defined by GO:0006979, one of which is FUT8. 5-Hydroxy-4-phenyl-butenolide (5H4PB) extracted from Chinese aromatic vinegar induces the expression of a series of antioxidant response genes that protect cells from oxidative stress via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2–antioxidative response element pathway. Here, we show that FUT8 is upregulated in both our RNA-seq data set of 5H4PB-treated cells and publicly available RNA-seq data set of cells treated with another antioxidant, sulforaphane. Applying our RNA-seq data set to GlycoMaple led to a prediction of an increase in the core fucose of N-glycan that was confirmed by flow cytometry using a fucose-binding lectin. These results suggest that FUT8 and core fucose expression may increase upon the antioxidant response.</jats:p>"

In aqueous solution, the particles self-assemble into micelle-type structures consisting of a solvent-exposed, hydrophilic DNA shell and a hydrophobic lipid core.

Furthermore, we provide an example of the programmability of the nanoparticles. By functionalizing the DNA shell with a spliced leader (SL)-RNA-specific DNAzyme, we target a second trypanosome-specific pathway (dual-target approach). The DNAzyme provides a backup to counteract the recovery of compromised parasites, which reduces the risk of developing drug resistance.</jats:p>"

It has the characteristics of high efficiency, low power consumption and scalability. It has applications in several fields, such as industrial environments, military weapons systems, aerospace technology, and biomedicine. The core function of a multicore processor is an algorithm that can realize the expansion of the capacity of the isoparametric center and the lifting space, whose main idea is to optimize the spatial distribution by changing the input vector. Traditional solution methods generally use iterative or variational methods to solve nonlinear programming problems, but linear algebraic function models are widely used because of their simplicity and ease of numerical computation. The discrete and multi-attribute matrix combination algorithm can be used to realize the process of transforming complex problems into easier solutions. This paper introduces the basic concepts of linear programming and conducts simulation experiments with a multicore processor, and then makes improvements to a typical optimization problem. This paper analyzes the mathematical principles and steps of the nonlinear mapping algorithm; then MATLAB is used as a platform to study the design process of the multicore set-driven function. Finally it verifies that the method is feasible in solving complex models by arithmetic examples.</jats:p>",

For applications, it is important to further improve its specific activity (activity per atomic site) and maximize its number of active sites. An effective approach to realize the above strategy is using core-shell structures, where the core can introduce profound nucleation sites and modify the electronic structure of surface oxyhydroxide. In this talk, I will present our recent studies of CoPx@FeOOH electrocatalysts for OER. The structures were synthesized on highly-conductive nickel foams by hydrothermal and subsequent phosphidation at elevated temperatures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the Fe peaks for CoPx@FeOOH are positively shifted to a higher oxidation state compared with that of pristine FeOOH, which is more favorable to catalyze OER. In addition, the electrochemically active surface area is also improved by approximately 2.5 times. As a result, it can drive an OER current density of 800 mV/cm2 at 303 mV overpotential in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to pristine FeOOH and IrO2. Besides the performance in fresh water based electrolyte, I will also introduce its activity and stability in saline water as well as designing core-shell structures in other materials systems.    </jats:p>",

Despite its widespread expression, loss of EPCAM function has so far only been reported to prominently affect intestinal development, resulting in severe early onset enteropathy associated with impaired growth and decreased survival in both humans and mice. In this study, we show that the critical role of EPCAM is not limited to intestinal tissues and that it shares its essential function with its only known homolog, Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2). EPCAM-deficient mice show significant growth retardation and die within 4 weeks after birth. In addition to changes in small and large intestines, loss of EPCAM results in hyperkeratosis in the skin and forestomach, hair follicle atrophy leading to alopecia, nephron hypoplasia in the kidney, proteinuria, and altered production of digestive enzymes by the pancreas. Expression of TROP2 partially, but not completely, overlaps with EPCAM in a number developing epithelia. Although loss of TROP2 had no gross impact on mouse development and survival, TROP2 deficiency generally compounded developmental defects observed in EPCAM-deficient mice, led to an approximately 60% decrease in embryonic viability, and further shortened postnatal lifespan of born pups. Importantly, TROP2 was able to compensate for the loss of EPCAM in stabilizing claudin-7 expression and cell membrane localization in tissues that co-express both proteins. These findings identify overlapping functions of EPCAM and TROP2 as regulators of epithelial development in both intestinal and extraintestinal tissues.</jats:p>",

Several studies have indicated the involvement of the gut microbiota–brain (GMB) axis. This narrative review hypothesizes that AN is driven by malnutrition-induced alterations in the GMB axis in susceptible individuals. According to this hypothesis, initial weight loss can voluntarily occur through dieting or be caused by somatic or psychiatric diseases. Malnutrition-induced alterations in gut microbiota may increase the sensitivity to anxiety-inducing gastrointestinal hormones released during meals, one of which is cholecystokinin (CCK). The experimental injection of a high dose of its CCK-4 fragment in healthy individuals induces panic attacks, probably via the stimulation of CCK receptors in the brain. Such meal-related anxiety attacks may take part in developing the clinical picture of AN. Malnutrition may also cause increased effects from appetite-reducing hormones that also seem to have roles in AN development and maintenance. The scientific background, including clinical, microbiological, and biochemical factors, of AN is discussed. A novel model for AN development and maintenance in accordance with this hypothesis is presented. Suggestions for future research are also provided.</jats:p>"

Due to the difficulty in accessing female gametes and zygotes of flowering plants, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying initiation embryogenesis despite the crucial importance of this process for seed crops. In this study, we reveal four levels of factors involved in rice zygotic cell cycle control and characterize their functions and regulation. Protein-protein interaction studies, including within zygote cells, and <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> biochemical analyses delineate a model of the zygotic cell cycle core complex for rice. In this model, CDKB1, a major regulator of plant mitosis, is a cyclin (CYCD5)-dependent kinase; its activity is coordinately inhibited by two cell cycle inhibitors, KRP4 and KRP5; and both KRPs are regulated via F-box protein 3 (FB3)-mediated proteolysis. Supporting their critical role in controlling the rice zygotic cell cycle, mutations in KRP4, KRP5, and FB3 result in the compromised function of sperm cells and abnormal organization of female germ units, embryo and endosperm, thus significantly reducing seed-set rates. This work helps reveals regulatory mechanisms controlling the zygotic cell cycle toward seed formation in angiosperms.</jats:p>"

However, most of these investigated the US context or were conducted in the previous century. This study examines the role of both partners’ educational attainments in couple migration in recent years in a new context: the Netherlands. The Netherlands is one of the countries in which women surpass men in educational attainment. We take a geographical perspective and test Costa and Kahn’s (2000) hypothesis that power couples – two partners with university degrees – are more likely than other couples to migrate to metropolitan areas with dense labour markets in order to solve their “colocation problem.” Data are derived from the Dutch Labour Force Survey between 2006 and 2015. The research population consists of all opposite-sex married and unmarried couples aged 18-45 (N = 90,314 couples). By linking the respondents to integral register data, we tracked all couples until three years after the interview date. The results show that both men’s and women’s human capital increases migration propensities, although effect sizes are relatively small. Social factors such as the geographical distance to birthplace and parents appear to play a significant role in couple migration. We found only partial support for Costa and Kahn’s (2000) colocation hypothesis. Power couples who live in the core region are less likely than other couples to migrate to more peripherally located regions. However, periphery-to-core migration is only affected by the male partner’s human capital, not by hers. Hence, the concentration of power couples in Dutch metropolitan areas probably stems from highly educated, single, young, urban adults who migrated there individually and who tend to stay there after union formation.</jats:p>"

A systematic review of the contemporary literature was first performed to build a competency framework. Subsequently, an online survey was administered to 196 faculty members of the top 10 leading maritime universities as identified from the Worldwide Maritime School Rankings produced by Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The collected data were analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis to extract the main competencies of MBE. The results uncovered five key competencies from 22 sub-competencies. Thereafter, Hierarchical Regression Modeling was used to examine the effects of the key competencies on perceived teaching performance. After controlling for teaching experience and job position, it was found that the five competency requirements, in descending order of their importance, have significant positive effects on teaching performance: Pedagogy, Maritime, Interpersonal, Business and Digital. Academically, this study consolidates the literature and identifies the emerging core competencies that are expected from MBE in the digital era. The study also implicates education policy formulation, offering directions for institutions to allocate their resources, develop suitable training and assessment programs, and facilitate benchmarking.</jats:p>"

To address this puzzle, we study an Italian work integration social enterprise that engaged in anti-Mafia work to support its core work of reintegrating people with mental health issues. We unveiled the process whereby it came to engage in this distal community work, how this work facilitated the destigmatization of the beneficiaries and, ultimately, their reintegration in the community. We contribute to the literature on prosocial organizing by providing a more complex and nuanced view of the relationship between core and community work, as well as how to manage stigma. </jats:p>",

As network traffic increases, cyber threats also increase, resulting in an increasing importance on traffic analysis. The existing packet processing engine generates a signature by analyzing the characteristics of the attack after the occurrence of suspicious traffic, and based on this, it is difficult to properly respond to new and variant attack traffic because a manual response method is performed to detect the same attack. In addition, even during a network operation, only analysis results generated by passive filtering appear, and when abnormal or suspicious traffic is observed, the quality of the report is often affected by the analysis capability of the administrator. The packet processing method proposed in this paper applies the core isolation method to the NUMA structure applied to the existing 20 Gbps packet processing engine to increase the accessibility of the existing NUMA memory structure and lower the packet drop rate to enable high-capacity 30 Gbps traffic processing. Using the proposed processing engine, it is possible to determine the degree of possibility of abnormal traffic, preferentially by a quick analysis of suspicious traffic rather than a detailed analysis of traffic.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Planktic foraminifera are widely used in paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies. The accuracy of such reconstructions depends on our understanding of the organisms' ecology. Here we report on field observations of planktic foraminiferal abundances (&gt;150 µm) from five depth intervals between 0–500 m water depth at 37 sites in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. The total planktic foraminiferal assemblage here comprises 29 morphospecies, with 11 morphospecies accounting for 90 % of the total assemblage. Both species composition and dominance in the net samples are broadly consistent with the published data from the corresponding surface sediments. The abundance and vertical distribution of planktic foraminifera are low offshore western Sumatra and increase towards offshore southern Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands (LSI). Average living depth of Trilobatus trilobus, Globigerinoides ruber, and Globigerina bulloides increases eastward, while that of Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, and Globorotalia menardii remains constant. We interpret the overall zonal and vertical distribution patterns in planktic foraminiferal abundances as a response to the contrasting upper-water-column conditions during the southeast monsoon, i.e., oligotrophic and stratified offshore Sumatra (non-upwelling) vs. eutrophic and well mixed offshore Java–LSI (upwelling).\nOverall, the inferred habitat depths of selected planktic foraminifera species show a good agreement with those from sediment trap samples and from surface sediments off Sumatra, but not with those from surface sediments off Java–LSI. The discrepancy might stem from the different temporal coverage of these sample types. Our findings highlight the need to consider how foraminiferal assemblages and ecology vary on shorter timescales, i.e., from “snapshots” of the water column captured by a plankton net to seasonal and interannual variability as recorded in sediment traps, and how these changes are transferred and preserved in deep-sea sediments.\n                    </jats:p>"

For this purpose, a three-dimensional, eight-story reference building model without any irregularity was designed in accordance with the Turkish Building Earthquake Code (TBEC-2018). Later, the building models with irregularities were created using the reference building model. In the building models with seismic isolators and fixed supports, fiber hinges were used for columns and beams to model nonlinear behavior. Moreover, nonlinear behavior at the isolation level was taken into account in building models with seismic isolators. Eleven different earthquake records were scaled using the geometric scaling method. Bi-directional nonlinear response history analysis (NRHA) was performed simultaneously for both horizontal components of the earthquake records in all building models. In addition to boundary analyses (Lower Bound and Upper Bound), which do not take into account the strength loss defined by the codes, analyses considering the strength loss as a result of heating in the lead core due to cyclical motion (Temperature Including) were carried out for building models with seismic isolators. In the analyses, displacement, acceleration, story drift ratio, base shear ratio, and damage mechanisms in the columns and beams obtained from the fixed-base and isolated-base structures were compared. In addition, the results of the analysis, in which the loss of strength due to temperature increase due to cyclical motion in the lead core is taken into account, were compared with the results obtained from the boundary analysis. As a result of the study, it was deduced that significant improvements were observed in the structural behavior of all regular and irregular models with seismic isolators under earthquake effects.</jats:p>"

In<jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>, two PIWI family proteins, several Tudor-domain containing (Tdrd) proteins and RNA helicases are assembled at perinuclear region of germline cells, forming nuage to process into piRNAs. Among those, Tejas (Tej), a fly homolog of mouse Tdrd5, has been known as a robust nuage component required for piRNA biogenesis in germline cells, yet its molecular functions remained elusive. To understand its molecular basis on nuage assembly and functions for piRNA biogenesis, we investigated subcellular localization of fluorescent-tagged nuage proteins including Tej and monitored the behavior of piRNA precursors. Tej functions as a core component for assembly of Vasa and Spindle-E to nuage granules through distinct motifs, respectively. The loss of Tej function resulted in malformation of nuage and accumulation of piRNA precursors<jats:italic>en route</jats:italic>in processing, perturbing further piRNA biogenesis in germline cells. Our study also revealed that the low complexity region of Tej regulates the mobility of nuage by phase separation. Collectively, we propose that Tej plays a pivotal role in processing of piRNA precursors by assembling RNA helicases, Vasa and Spindle-E, to nuage, by controlling the dynamics of nuage components.</jats:p>"

Teachers can give learners skills according to the way they are prepared. Learners with visual impairments in special schools and students at tertiary level manifest deficits in critical skills required in academic success and transition in general. The nature of education of their teachers and challenges encountered during teacher preparation were not well established. The present study explored challenges faced in the preparation of teachers of learners with visual impairments in expanded core curriculum. Purposive sampling was used to select twenty-two teachers, two special education curriculum specialists and three Teacher educators. Open-ended questionnaires were used to collect data from teachers of learners with visual impairments and semi structured interviews were conducted with teacher educators and curriculum specialists. The findings indicated that teacher education/preparation in ECC was insufficient, and the institutions concentrated on braille literacy; and orientation and mobility. The remaining skills in ECC were ignored. Preparation incorporated few practical sessions and was highly theoretical. The major challenges among others were time constraints; insufficient resources in education; enrolments of student teachers; discrepancy between education and implementation; methodological issues. The opportunities were available to improve education were: employ more staff; embark on specialised education; advocacy and collaboration: offering continuous professional development for teachers. The study highlights the nature of preparation of teachers of learners with visual impairment. The teacher education institutions need to realign the curriculum through collaborative approach with other stakeholders so that teachers can effectively deliver skills to the learners.</jats:p>"

It is however, more apt to dig into their fundamental causative factors. This paper realizes that specialist valuer or appraiser has a chain of sequential tasks anchored on his distinguishing competencies. At the heart of this is sufficient knowledge of the attributes of his subject of valuation. Twenty-two (22) Nigerian valuers based within Lagos Metropolis were made to carry out valuation assessment of selected landed and non-landed property assets and were also examined on their perception of the adequacy of their acquired Body of Knowledge (BOK) relevant to each asset category. The variation/dispersion in their valuations is revealed by the Standard Deviation of the distribution, for Landed Property, being 7.77 while that of Non-Landed Property is 32.24; By employing the 10% maximum variation rule of Glover (1985), 9% of the valuers fall outside the limit in respect of Landed Property whereas, the figure rose to 64% for Non-Landed Property assets. This is indicative of remarkably higher internal inconsistencies among respondent valuers on Non-Landed Property Assets. Multiple regression analysis of the results indicated that all the adaptive knowledge variables exert positive influence on valuer’s competence in valuation of both Landed Property and Non-Landed Property Assets. In view of these findings, there is urgent need to review and expand underlying curriculum for training prospective valuers towards aligning theory with practice and enhance their competence across property types.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The second generation nuclear power plants were designed and built to withstand without loss to the systems, structures, and components necessary to ensure public health and safety during design basis accidents (DBAs). In the transient and accident analysis the effects of single active failures and operator errors were considered. There are also accident sequences that are possible but were judged to be too unlikely and therefore were not fully considered in the design process of second generation reactors. In that sense, they were considered beyond the scope of design-basis accidents that a nuclear facility must be designed and built to withstand. Such accident sequences have been analysed in the past to fully understand the capability of a design. The requirements to analyse such sequences for existing reactors have been introduced after Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. In 2012 the design extension conditions (DECs) were introduced in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements for the design of nuclear power plants (NPPs). Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) requirements of existing reactors for DEC were introduced in 2014. The purpose of considering DEC is to further improve safety by enhancing the plant’s capability to withstand the conditions generated by accidents that are more severe than DBAs. This concept by IAEA and WENRA (WENRA definition of DEC is consistent with IAEA definition from 2012, in which DEC with prevention of core melt is called DEC A) is not completely new, since some multiple failures have already been considered in the design of existing reactors, for example anticipated transients without scram and station blackout. The research for beyond design basis accidents with non-degraded core (i.e. DEC A) for existing reactors has been already done in 80’s and 90’ of the previous century. The purpose of this paper is to review that research. The tests performed include total loss of feedwater, station blackout, small break without high pressure safety injection, steam generator tube rupture with no high pressure safety injection etc. Besides review of experiments performed on integral test facilities, examples of DEC A tests, which have been analysed at Jožef Stefan Institute using RELAP5 or TRACE computer code in the last three decades, will be presented too.</jats:p>"

Different from existing summarization or event tasks, Multi-document Event Summarization (MES) aims at the query-level event sequence generation, which has extra constraints on event expression and conciseness. Identifying and summarizing the key event from a set of related articles is a challenging task that has not been sufficiently studied, mainly because online articles exhibit characteristics of redundancy and sparsity, and a perfect event summarization needs high level information fusion among diverse sentences and articles. To address these challenges, we propose a two-phase framework for the MES task, that first performs event semantic graph construction and dominant event detection via graph-sequence matching, then summarizes the extracted key event by an event-aware pointer generator. For experiments in the new task, we construct two large-scale real-world datasets for training and assessment. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the related baseline methods, with the most dominant event of the articles effectively identified and correctly summarized.</jats:p>"

Improving the energy storage density of dielectric composites can start from two aspects: increasing the dielectric constant and breakdown field strength of materials. In this paper, the metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-67 were selected, the polydopamine (PDA) core shell were coated on the surface of ZIF-67, and nano-Ag were embedded in the PDA, and MOF@PDA-Ag hybrid nanoparticles were prepared. Nanoparticles were introduced into the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix, and MOF@PDA-Ag/PVDF nanocomposites were prepared. The results show that ZIF-67 promote the generation of β-phase in the PVDF matrix, which improve the overall polarization capacity of the composites, thereby improving the mechanical properties and dielectric properties of the materials. Under the strengthening effect of nano-Ag, the dielectric constant of 7 wt% 10MOF@PDA-Ag/PVDF nanocomposite film reaches 15.6 (100 Hz), which is 54.5% higher than that of pure PVDF. Under the influence of the insulation stability of ZIF-67 and PDA and the Coulomb blocking effect of nano-Ag, the breakdown field strength of 5 wt% 10MOF@PDA-Ag/PVDF nanocomposite film is increased to 159kV/mm, which is 62.2% higher than that of pure PVDF.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A novel control strategy that combines model predictive control (MPC) with semi-active vibration control that uses a highly effective, energy-efficient, and stable piezoelectric transducer is proposed in this paper. Incorporating MPC into semi-active vibration control enables significant improvements in control performance and robustness. However, it is challenging to directly predict and optimize the input trajectory because the semi-active input has a state-dependent discontinuous nature. To realize effective optimal control, we need a strategy that can predict the discontinuous semi-active input trajectory in a reasonable manner and is computationally cost-efficient. The proposed method employs a prediction algorithm based on a tree data structure. The proposed algorithm achieves flexible prediction and optimization of a semi-active input trajectory with a simple tree traversal. In addition, the proposed method employs a switching criterion to minimize the computational cost and implement fast prediction and optimization. The proposed method is called predictive switching vibration control with tree-based formulation and optimization, or the PSTFO method. The simulation proved that the proposed PSTFO method can predict discontinuous semi-active input and realizes optimal vibration control performance and high robustness. In addition, the high control performance and robustness of the proposed method were experimentally validated. </jats:p>",

The appreciable dispersion is realized by adjusting the structural parameters of NLC-PCF, which is characterized by three zero-dispersion wavelengths (ZDWs), flat dispersion with the fluctuation of fewer than 40 ps·nm<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>·km<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>, and high nonlinearity as high as 5500 W<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>·km<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>. The propagation of femtosecond pulse and supercontinuum generation (SCG) in NLC-PCF is studied numerically when the pump wavelength is located in the normal and abnormal dispersion region near different ZDW through solving the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (GNLSE) by the split-step Fourier method. The numerical results show that a highly coherent supercontinuum (SC) spanning from 1.3 to 2.8 µm is obtained when the pump pulse with the center wavelength of 1910 nm, the peak power of 1000 W, and pulse width of 50 fs propagated in the 5 cm long NLC-PCF. This research can find applications in the fields of novel liquid-core PCF design and ultrashort pulse propagation.</jats:p>"

Posttranslational modifications of tau interfere with this binding, leading to tau aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the structure of the microtubule-binding domain of tau. Wild-type tau that contains four microtubule-binding repeats and a pseudorepeat R′ is studied. Complexed with taxol-stabilized microtubules, the immobilized residues exhibit well-resolved two-dimensional spectra that can be assigned to the amino-terminal region of R4 and the R′ domain. When tau coassembles with tubulin to form unstable microtubules, the R′ signals remain, whereas the R4 signals disappear, indicating that R′ remains immobilized, whereas R4 becomes more mobile. Therefore, R′ outcompetes the other four repeats to associate with microtubules. These NMR data, together with previous cryo–electron microscopy densities, indicate an extended conformation for microtubule-bound R′. R′ contains the largest number of charged residues among all repeats, suggesting that charge-charge interaction drives tau-microtubule association.</jats:p>",

We successfully quantify the rich structural variety of core-shell nanoparticles including bond length, coordination number, local bond orientation order, grain boundary, and five-fold symmetry, all in 3D at atomic resolution. Instead of forming an atomically-sharp boundary, the core-shell interface is atomically diffuse with an average thickness of 4.2 Å, irrespective of the particle’s size, morphology, or crystallographic texture. The high concentration of Pd in the interface is highly related to the electric double layers of the Pd seeds. These results advance our understanding of core-shell structures at the fundamental level, providing potential strategies into nanomaterial manipulation and chemical property regulation.</jats:p>"

For a developer to develop a V2X device or application, its performance requirements must first be determined. Furthermore, the developer selects the hardware system to enable the service to function while satisfying the performance requirements. Through this process, the developer designs and creates the program in a manner that considers thread configuration and core mapping with the given hardware resources. Then, the performance evaluation of a system is tested via instruction-level program analysis with executable programs. This process is an essential procedure for developing a program that satisfies the performance requirements. However, the debugging procedure repeated through program development, performance analysis, and program modification requires significant time and is costly. Hence, to reduce the time and cost of unnecessary work, we propose a thread-level modeling and analysis method using a queueing theory for a V2X communication device that can be applied at the design level. First, we propose a thread-level performance modeling and analysis method based on queuing theory in a multi-core-based vehicle service system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Among the various types of steel bridge girders, trusses seem one of the most powerful and reliable. The individual members may be simple, but the nodes are the complex parts, especially if more than 4 members are connected. In view of the complexity, internal welds become inevitable and are inaccessible after finishing, which is overlooked easily during construction. The proposal is to eliminate those of the inside welds that may be dispensable. If some of them would be eliminated, the consequences may be acceptable, or require minor modifications only. The assumption is tried out on the example of a structure replacing a historic bridge. This structure is composed of rectangular hollow profiles, connected at nodes. Member forces and bending moments, have been determined. If the internal welds are about to be eliminated, an alternative load path is found. The calculation of stresses in the various fillet welds is based on the assumption of evenly distribution of forces. The weld stresses can be calculated by the derived formulas. The results show some welds require strengthening, due to the elimination of the more complicated internal welds. This concerns ultimate limit state. Thus, the possibility is confirmed that some of the internal welds may be eliminated, although there still is no proof the method may be applied to more complex nodes. Research must be continued to clarify this. For the type of hollow core members being considered, omitting of some internal welds may well be an acceptable alternative. </jats:p>",

Air-core transformers have the advantage of lacking magnetic saturation and iron losses, making them suitable for high-frequency applications. We designed and manufactured a transformer for a determined frequency and inductance value. The design of this passive component aims to both keep the magnetic field inside the transformer and manage the thermal energy efficiently. The electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties are simulated and then verified by experiments with a specific test bench. The transformer reaches high performances for a higher frequency than usual for an equivalent power transfer in automotive applications.</jats:p>"

This provides a conundrum, as the housekeeping genes that were so often mutated in response to these diverse selective pressures tend to be among the genes that are most conserved in their sequences across the bacterial phylogeny. In order to further examine this apparent discrepancy, we characterized the precise positions of the RNAPC involved in adaptation to a large variety of selective pressures. We found that RNAPC lab adaptations tended to occur at positions displaying traits associated with higher selective constraint. Specifically, compared to other RNAPC positions, positions involved in adaptation tended to be more conserved in their sequences within bacteria, were more often located within defined protein domains, and were located closer to the complex’s active site. Higher sequence conservation was also found for resource exhaustion adaptations occurring within additional housekeeping genes. Combined, our results demonstrate that the positions that change most readily in response to well-defined selective pressures exerted in lab environments are often also those that evolve most slowly in nature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hydrogenation of CO and CO2 from industrial exhaust gases into CH4 represents a promising method for sustainable chemical energy storage. While iron-based catalysts are in principle suitable for that purpose, the active metal Fe undergoes a complex transformation during the chemical reaction process. However, only little is known about the change in catalytically active species under reaction conditions, primarily caused by structural changes in the catalyst material, so far. By using core–shell model materials, factors that alter the catalyst structure can be excluded, making it possible to observe the direct influence of the reactants on the activity in the present work. Furthermore, stoichiometric analysis was used as a key tool for the evaluation of individual key reactions in the complex reaction network purely from experimental data, thus making it possible to draw conclusions about the catalyst state. In the case of CO hydrogenation, the presumed Boudouard reaction and the associated carburization of the catalyst can be quantified and the main reaction (CO methanation) can be determined. The results of the CO2 hydrogenation showed that the reverse water–gas shift reaction mainly took place, but under an ongoing change in the catalytic active iron phase. Due to the systematic exchange between CO and CO2 in the reactant gas stream, a mutual influence could also be observed. The results from the stoichiometric analysis provide the basis for the development of kinetic models for the key reactions in future work.</jats:p>"

When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry–Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site‐selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4‐acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50 % improvement in site‐selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.</jats:p>",

In this study, the corresponding indicators were selected from three dimensions of cultivation education, collaborative education, and situational education to form the element community of evaluation indicators. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method were used to empirically evaluate the implementation of the key mechanism of GI EEE. The results are as follows. (1) The key education of GI EEE includes cultivation education of micro dimension, collaborative education of medium dimension, and situational education of macro dimension. (2) The most important education is to strengthen the ethics education of GI engineering in the training process of college students. The coordination of GI EEE is becoming more and more important, and the integration and construction are the important pursuit of GI EEE. (3) The cultivation education, collaborative education, and situational education of GI EEE are all at a general level. (4) There is not only a gap between theory and practice in GI EEE but also insufficient attention to localization and coordination issues. The willingness of the government to participate in the ethical education of GI engineering is very insufficient.

Four databases were searched (PsycINFO; PubMed; CINAHL; Web of Science) along with reference lists. Thirty-six cross-sectional studies were included (7,812 chronic pain patients).

Significant associations were found between functioning and six processes of psychological flexibility (i.e., acceptance, defusion, present moment, committed action, self as context, and values). Except for the relationship between defusion and functioning, the relationships between the other five psychological flexibility processes and functioning were all moderated by domains of functioning. No moderators were found regarding age, percentage of females, country, or type of instrument used to measure functioning. These findings may carry significant implications for chronic pain patients and clinical workers. It might be more effective to focus on functioning-related psychological flexibility processes rather than all therapy packages if the relationships between functioning and specific processes of psychological flexibility were better informed.

The dysprosium-166/holmium-166 (<jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Dy/<jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Ho) in vivo generator shows great potential for treating large malignancies due to the long half-life time of the mother nuclide <jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Dy and the emission of high energy β<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> from the daughter nuclide <jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Ho. However, the internal conversion occurring after β<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> decay from <jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Dy to <jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Ho could cause the release of about 72% of <jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Ho when <jats:sup>166</jats:sup>Dy is bound to conventional chelators.

A Core Collection is a subset of reduced size, chosen to represent the diversity of a collection with a minimum of redundancies. Because diversity is distributed between and within groups with different degrees of organization, accessions should be classified adequately into related groups before the selection of a Core Collection. In this research, different classification strategies for the Uruguayan Maize Collection were compared, and the best was used to select a Core Collection. The following classification strategies were compared following a multivariate approach using the available maize data base: i) racial classification, ii) geographic origin (south and north of the country), and iii) a combination of kernel type and geographic origin. The third option was considered the best classification criterion, since it takes into account two points which are closely related to the distribution of diversity: genotypic composition and geographical origin. The following five groups were identified in the collection: a) Pop, b) Floury, e) Dent, d) Southern Flint-semiflints, and e) Northern Flint-semiflints. A total of 90 accessions were selected to constitute the Uruguayan Maize Core Collection. Each group was represented in the Core in proportion to the logarithm of its size. The ranges of 17 variables in the Core were compared with those in the entire collection to verify the representativeness of the subset. On average, 91.2% of the ranges were retained in the Core, confirming its representativeness.</jats:p>"

A substantial number of patients now achieve complete remission after induction therapy, and more sensitive methods are needed to assess response. Minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD) has been incorporated in many clinical trials as well as in clinical practice. The importance of MRD assessment and correlation between MRD negativity and prolonged progression-free and overall survival has been confirmed in numerous clinical trials and several meta-analyses. Recent studies have even suggested that MRD negativity can partly overcome the impact of the negative prognostic factors such as high-risk cytogenetics or adverse revised international scoring system (R-ISS) stage. MRD can be measured in the bone marrow via imaging and via emerging blood-based techniques. The most common methods are multicolor flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing of bone marrow samples. Using these methods in optimal settings, MRD negativity with a sensitivity level of 10−6 can be detected. In this review, we discuss the benefits and limitations of these techniques as well as the clinical implications.</jats:p>"

Three‐core power cable systems are a significantly more complicated thermo‐electrical system than single‐core power cables, primarily due to the geometric asymmetry and the number of heat sources. There are tools available that can model thermal transients in three‐core cable systems, but these tools demand a nontrivial level of prerequisite knowledge and training on the part of the user. Therefore, this research aimed at developing and testing a first principle model specifically tuned for thermal transients in three‐core cables. The model has been tested by comparing its predictions with empirical temperature data collected from heat cycle testing on three‐core cables at Nexans' facilities. To increase the quality of the predictions, part of the research was also to measure the thermal properties of swellable tape and filling compound (used in three‐core cables). The first principle model's predictions correspond well with the empirical data, the research results are promising. The model must be tested more thoroughly with different use cases before it can complement or replace current working methods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of hazards induced by the exploitation of geo-resources focuses growing interest of science, industry, public administration, non-governmental organisations and the general public. Anthropogenic seismicity, i.e. the undesired dynamic rock mass response to geo-resources exploitation, is one of the examples of unwanted by-products of the technological operation of humans. The socio-economic impact of the induced seismicity is very significant. Induced earthquakes can cause material loss, injuries and even fatalities. Restricted access to data constitutes a barrier to assessing and mitigating the associated hazards. To respond to the need of the scientific community the Thematic Core Service Anthropogenic Hazards (TCS AH) has been created within the framework of the European Plate Observing System, a solid earth science European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). TCS AH is an open consortium of 13 European institutions. TCS AH provides access to a novel e-research infrastructure, the EPISODES Platform (former name: IS-EPOS platform) to foster both research and training on induced seismicity and geo-hazards related to the exploration and exploitation of geo-resources. The EPISODES Platform is connected to international data nodes which offer open access to multidisciplinary datasets, called episodes. Episodes comprise geoscientific and associated data from industrial activity along with a large set of embedded applications for their efficient data processing, analysis and visualization. The EPISODES Platform opens also the possibility to create new applications and combine implemented applications with the user's codes. The team-working features of the EPISODES Platform facilitate collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific research, public understanding of science, citizen science applications, knowledge dissemination, and the teaching of anthropogenic hazards related to geo-resource exploitation. This study presents the current results of the TCS AH research infrastructure integration and also indicates the benefits of their usage for science, education, and innovation.</jats:p>",

We tested Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1) as a potential mediator of this activity, but demonstrate that a significant component of Scrib and Dlg regulation of Lgl is PP1 independent, and found no evidence for a Scrib-Dlg-PP1 protein complex. However, the Dlg SH3 domain plays a role in Lgl protection and, in combination with the N-terminal region of the Dlg HOOK domain, in recruitment of Scrib to the membrane.

Using our method, we showed that it is possible to perform 3D reconstruction from synthetic and actual electron microscope images using an initial model and to generate the initial model itself. We also examined whether the optimization function used in the stochastic gradient descent method can be applied with loose constraints to improve the convergence of initial model generation and confirmed the effect. In order to investigate the advantage of generating a smooth sampling distribution from the stochastic model, we compared the distribution of estimated projection directions with the conventional method of performing a global search using spherical gridding.

The EEJ index (i.e., EUEL) over the periods of the solar cycle 24 (2008–2018) was utilized specifically during magnetically quiet days (Kp &lt; 3). As the result, both parts symmetrically showed that MCEJ and ACEJ were positively and negatively correlated with the F10.7 index. Contrarily, MCEJ and ACEJ were asymmetrically prominent in the east and west. CEJ types also varied symmetrically with the season, especially for MCEJ and ACEJ (at high level), prominent during Equinox and J-solstice. Post-sunset depletion (PSD) in both parts was symmetrically solar activity independent, as no correlation with the F10.7 index was observed in the extended observation. PSD that varied symmetrically with season was also solar activity independent, except in the east during Equinox, where it was negatively correlated with the F10.7 index. Our finding also revealed that PSD was prominent during Equinox, except for the high level in the west part.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to several characteristics, such as geometry, compact core, high coolant flow, and high neutron flux, the burn-up study of the RSG-GAS multi-purpose reactor provides challenges when employing a neutronic calculation. For the burn-up analysis, two calculating methodologies are used in the RSG-GAS: deterministic and probabilistic methods. The deterministic codes such as WIMSD-5B and Batan-FUEL are utilized, whereas the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code Serpent 2 is used for the stochastic method. WIMSD-5B is being used to produce a four-group cross-section that is needed by Batan-FUEL to do full core diffusion calculations. Burn-up calculations were performed at the whole fuel assemblies inside the core to see if the deterministic code, WIMSD-5B/Batan-FUEL, could accurately replicate the burn-up behavior of the RSG-GAS research reactor. The Serpent 2 calculation was also done with the exact models to provide a comparison. The results show that both Serpent 2 and WIMSD-5B/Batan-FUEL can perform the RSG-GAS burn-up analysis if appropriate treatments are made to the deterministic codes at both the assembly and core levels. There is a 5% difference in calculated fuel burn-up between deterministic and stochastic approaches.  </jats:p>"

This algorithm makes use of multiple agents on parallel instances of the environment so that each agent adds knowledge to the system, which is weighted by a value of Advantage that evaluates its interaction in the environment. This assessment is performed on OpenAI's CartPole-v0 playground, so the results are comparable and easily reproducible.

Para a coleta de dados foi utilizado o roteiro de observação qualitativa, ficha de avaliação, diário de bordo e roda de conversa. Na intervenção foi realizado o teste de 1 minuto em sete exercícios diferentes e foi ministrada aulas com variação de ênfase muscular a cada semana. Diante da observação, foi notado que a professora era comprometida, estudiosa e motivava a turma, e que o local era um ambiente climatizado, com diversos recursos disponíveis. No decorrer do estágio, foi relatada pelos participantes a importância dos testes como estímulo para a assiduidade nas aulas, o efeito das variações de movimento na aprendizagem de outros exercícios e ausência de dor. Além disso, acredita-se que houve aumento de força no core em razão dos resultados numéricos do teste. O percurso foi marcado pelo desafio da rotatividade dos praticantes, da satisfação em acompanhar a evolução dos participantes e ambiente promotor de autonomia. Portanto, a realização de teste abdominal pode ser uma alternativa nas academias de ginástica para estimular a adesão e assiduidade dos clientes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tThe rapid growth of the role of renewable energy sources dictates new requirements for the efficiency, stability and scales of electrochemical energy storage devices for stationary applications [1]. Among the storage systems, redox flow batteries (RFBs) are regarded as a promising technology, since their advantages of excellent scalability, low cost, easy fabrication and operation, long lifetime, and safety. Today inorganic RFBs are penetrating the market, however, low specific capacity in conjunction with low electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes (≈1.5 V) and safety issues, hinders their wide-scale commercialization. [2]. Replacing the inorganic materials with environment-friendly organic redox-active molecules may solve the capacity problems and safety issues. Moreover, the application of non-aqueous electrolytes provides a wide electrochemical stability window (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, up to 5 V for acetonitrile) enabling high-voltage batteries with increased energy density [3].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Within the framework of the current project, we implemented a comprehensive study for a large group of novel highly soluble organic materials based on aromatic amines with general formulas of NPh<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>R<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>Br<jats:sub>m </jats:sub>(<jats:bold>M1</jats:bold>-<jats:bold>M4</jats:bold>) and<jats:sub> </jats:sub>N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Ph<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>R<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>Br<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> (<jats:bold>M5</jats:bold>-<jats:bold>M7</jats:bold>) where R=-(OCH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-OCH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (<jats:bold>Fig. 1a</jats:bold>). All the compounds demonstrated high solubility in MeCN (from &gt;2.2 M up to complete miscibility), which can potentially enable outstanding specific capacities of organic RFBs approaching 134 Ah L<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> [4]. Compounds demonstrated one or two quasi-reversible electron transition processes with redox potential up to 0.6 V <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> Ag/AgNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> electrode, which makes them perspective for the investigation in the RFBs as catholyte materials.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For the RFB investigation butylviologen perchlorate (-0.75V vs. Ag/AgNO<jats:sub>3, </jats:sub>~1.15 V battery voltage) was chosen as the redox pair (<jats:bold>Fig. 1b, d</jats:bold>). On the first step, the selection of the most appropriate electrolyte was performed: it was shown that the usage of electrolytes that contained lithium cations (Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) and hexafluorophosphate anions (PF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:sup>-</jats:sup>) leads to fast decreasing of all the parameters of the RFBs, whereas the usage of the tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) and NaClO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> produces the stable characteristics (<jats:bold>Fig. 1e</jats:bold>). Final RFB tests proved that the most promising systems are capable to exhibit 65% of maximum capacities and more than 95% coulombic efficiency after 50 cycles [4] (<jats:bold>Fig. 1f</jats:bold>).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the next step, we focused on the creation of low-voltage anolyte material: thus, we synthesized and investigated novel phenazine derivative with oligomeric ethylene glycol ether substituents as promising anolyte material for non-aqueous organic RFBs (<jats:bold>Fig. 1c</jats:bold>) [5]. The designed compound undergoes a reversible and stable reduction at -1.72 V vs. Ag/AgNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and demonstrates excellent (&gt;2.5 M) solubility in MeCN. A non-aqueous organic redox flow battery assembled using novel phenazine derivative as anolyte and substituted triarylamine derivative as a catholyte exhibited high specific capacity (~93% from the theoretical value), &gt;95% coulombic efficiency, 65% utilization of active materials and good charge-discharge cycling stability (<jats:bold>Fig. 1g</jats:bold>).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To summarize, triarylamine-based and phenazine-based materials establish themselves attractive for future research: obtained redox potentials, high solubility, fast diffusion and kinetics opens promising future directions for their usage as organic cathodic and anodic materials for non-aqueous RFBs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] Panwar N., Kaushik, S., Kothari S. <jats:italic>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</jats:italic> \n                  <jats:bold>2011</jats:bold>, <jats:italic>15</jats:italic> (3), 1513-1524.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[2] Placke T., Heckmann A., Schmuch, R., Meister P., Beltrop K., Winter, M. <jats:italic>Joule</jats:italic> \n                  <jats:bold>2018</jats:bold>, <jats:italic>2</jats:italic> (12), 2528-2550.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[3] Elgrishi N., Rountree K., McCarthy B., Rountree E., Eisenhart T., Dempsey J. <jats:italic> J.

While this expanded diversity can provide novel insights into microbial population structure, most tools available for core-genome estimation are sensitive to genome completeness. Consequently, a major portion of the huge phylogenetic diversity uncovered by environmental genomic approaches remains excluded from such analyses. We present mOTUpan, a novel iterative Bayesian method for computing the core genome for sets of genomes of highly diverse completeness range. The likelihood for each gene cluster to belong to core or accessory genome is estimated by computing the probability of its presence/absence pattern in the target genome set. The core-genome prediction is computationally efficient and can be scaled up to thousands of genomes. It has shown comparable estimates to state-of-the-art tools Roary and PPanGGOLiN for high-quality genomes and is capable of using genomes at lower completeness thresholds. mOTUpan wraps a bootstrapping procedure to estimate the quality of a specific core-genome prediction, as the accuracy of each run will depend on the specific completeness distribution and the number of genomes in the dataset under scrutiny. mOTUpan is implemented in the mOTUlizer software package, and available at github.com/moritzbuck/mOTUlizer, under GPL 3.0 license.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tOne of the attractive methods used to prepare hydrogen gas is the electrolysis of alcohols such as methanol and ethanol in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) cell. Platinum is the most common catalyst used to provide high selectivity for C-C bond cleavage for ethanol, leading to an increase in the amount of hydrogen gas produced. However, the cost of the Pt and poisoning of the surface by the adsorbed CO intermediate limit its use. Combining Pt with other metals such as ruthenium in the form of core-shell nanoparticles enhances its ability for alcohol oxidation [1,2]. Therefore, more hydrogen gas is evolved in a PEM electrolysis cell, especially at lower applied potentials. In addition, these modified catalysts can be used in the anodes of direct alcohol fuel cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here, we aimed to prepare Pt-based core-shell nanoparticles in which commercial catalysts PtRu and Ru were used as the core, and different amounts of Pt were deposited on their surface as a shell (PtRu@Pt and Ru@Pt). These catalysts were prepared using the polyol method without adding any stabilizer that would block their surface and affected their alcohol oxidation activity. The formation of these core-shell nanoparticle catalysts was confirmed by using thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, the effect of the Pt thickness on methanol and ethanol electrochemical oxidation was studied using cyclic voltammetry at room temperature and a PEM electrolysis cell at 80 °C.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results show that methanol and ethanol oxidation activity increased greatly as the thickness of the Pt shell was increased, although the half potential was shifted to a higher potential. Moreover, the addition of the Pt to the shell increased the limiting current, indicating that the selectivity toward CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> formation increased and that more hydrogen was being produced. Finally, Ru as a core showed a lower improvement for methanol oxidation than PtRu. However, Ru@Pt catalysts with more than one Pt monolayers gave higher ethanol oxidation performances than the PtRu@Pt catalysts.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Acknowledgments</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Memorial University.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References:</jats:bold> \n                  <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>T.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces a new algorithm to calculate and optimize no-load noise (sound pressure) of power transformers, and to identify iron sheet parameters. The calculation consists of two steps: the 1st step consists in calculating an initial sound pressure level (A-Evaluation) which has approx. 70 % accuracy within a tolerance interval of ±2dB (A). The 2nd step consists in estimating the expected deviation from the initial calculation to reach 90 % accuracy in the final results. This deviation could be due to material handling, quality tolerance, core manufacturing, etc. The optimization process consists of two parts: the 1st part takes place before choosing a certain iron sheet for calculation to identify the sheet parameters required for computational accuracy (“Sheet Optimization”). The 2nd part consists in considering a core design with an undesirable sound pressure level in order to reduce it to an acceptable limit. This part takes into account the other limitations such as no-load losses and transformer dimensions (“Design Optimization”). For new iron sheets in the market, there is no measurement history to rely on. However, the algorithm is also capable of identifying the sheet parameters for calculation based on the available algorithm data base and the magnetostriction measurements of the iron sheet manufacturer.</jats:p>"

These PCHEs are fabricated through a diffusion bonding process. This fabrication step changes the microstructure of wrought metal plates. The current ASME design code does not support the PCHE design for NGNPs due to a lack of test data. Hence, there has been initiative towards elevated temperature mechanical property characterization of the diffusion bonded material. One of the most common channel shapes is a semicircular channel with sharp corners. These corners act as a stress riser at the diffusion bonding interface. Evaluating elevated temperature mechanical performance of diffusion bonded material in the presence of stress risers is an essential step towards the ASME code development of PCHE design. This study selected two specimen geometries: the first is a PCHE bar specimen for tensile loading with three rows and three columns of channels, and the second is a lab-scaled PCHE with six rows and eight columns of channels. A set of elevated temperature monotonic and cyclic tests were conducted on the PCHE bar specimen to evaluate the mechanical performance under axial tensile loadings to study the failure mechanism. The lab-scaled PCHE specimens were tested under overpressure loads at room temperature, and pressure creep and pressure creep-fatigue loadings to mimic the realistic loading conditions observed in typical NGNPs. The X-ray scans of channeled specimens show interesting observations. The test results and observations are presented in the paper.</jats:p>",

Then, Numerical simulations in the environment of ANSYS have been carried out for the developed configurations as well as the traditional AP one to predict their penetration abilities. Finally and according to the PRODAS and simulation results, the designs with best results are chosen to be manufactured and tested by firing against ARMOX-500 steel alloy targets.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current paper, we argue that the ground state of a hadron contains a significant perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) core as the result of color gauge invariance and the values of chiral and gluon vacuum condensates. The evaluation within the method of dispersion sum rules (DSR) of the vacuum matrix elements of the correlator of local currents with the proper quantum numbers leads to the value of the radius of the pQCD core of a nucleon of about 0.4–0.5 fm. The selection of the initial and final states allows to select processes in which the pQCD core of the projectile gives the dominant contribution to the process. It is explained that the transparency of nuclear matter for the propagation of a spatially small and color-neutral wave packet of quarks and gluons—a color transparency (CT) phenomenon—for a group of hard processes off nuclear targets can be derived in the form of the QCD factorization theorem accounting for the color screening phenomenon. Based on the success of the method of DSR, we argue that a pQCD core in a hadron wave function is surrounded by the layer consisting of quarks interacting with quark and gluon condensates. As a result, in the quasi-elastic processes e+A→e′+N+(A−1)∗, the quasi-Feynman mechanism could be dominating in a wide range of the momentum transfer squared, Q2. In this scenario, a virtual photon is absorbed by a single quark, which carries a large fraction of the momentum of the nucleon and dominates in a wide range of Q2. CT should reveal itself in these processes at extremely large Q2 as the consequence of the presence of the Sudakov form factors, which squeeze a nucleon.</jats:p>"

The processing of huge real-world data through distributed computing system becomes obscure because the major concern in large-scale distributed systems is to guarantee the completion of data processing task to be done within a budget and time constraints. This paper proposes a cost-optimized data parallel task scheduling in multi-core resources to address the above issue. By running concurrent executions on a multi-core resource, the number of parallel executions could be increased correspondingly, thereby it is able to finish the task within the deadline. A model is developed here to optimize the operational cost of data parallel task by feasibly assigning load fractions to each multi-core resource. This work experimented with data parallel task. The outcome of the work gives better solutions in terms of processing task by deadline at optimised computational cost.</p>",

It is relevant all over the world and affects primarily public servants in the position of power. One of the most important state systems is law enforcement and the problem of corruption in its ranks is of significant importance and has not been resolved almost all over the world. Most often, this problem is considered in the legal and criminological spheres, but it has not received a final solution. In recent years, there has been a tendency to consider this problem from the standpoint of psychology and deviantology, and separate studies of the psychological causes of corrupt behavior have been conducted.&#x0D;\nA theoretical analysis of the most relevant scientific works on the psychology of corrupt behavior of police officers made it possible to identify the most significant personal qualities that contribute to corrupt behavior, among which the motivation and values of the individual are most often mentioned.&#x0D;\nIn order to confirm the importance of the individual values in the formation of corrupt behavior, we conducted an empirical study of the terminal values and core values of both current employees of the State traffic inspectorate and former employees imprisoned for committing corruption crimes under Art. 290 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (taking a bribe) and Art. 286 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of power). To prove our hypothesis, we carried out a comparative analysis of indicators of terminal values and core values between the chosen samples.&#x0D;\nBased on the results of the analysis, we were able to confirm the significant influence of the individual values on the manifestation of corrupt behavior. The analysis revealed that the persons who committed corruption crimes preferred material values, personal and family values, the desire to stand out and be independent. The obtained research results can be used by the professional psychologists in the candidates selection in the law enforcement and in the organization of psychological support and prevention of corrupt behavior among the police officers.</jats:p>",

Based on the obtained results, two optimal injection schemes are selected to form the spoiler structure. The experimental results show that the best molding quality can be achieved from the thick-end injection with a thin-end exit scheme.

It was selected among a group of more than 100 prototypes and his commercial availability is expected by 2030. GFR has common goals as the rest GIF advanced reactor types: economy, safety, proliferation resistance, availability and sustainability. Several GFR fuel design concepts such as plates, rod pins and pebbles are currently being investigated in order to meet the high temperature constraints characteristic for a GFR working environment. In the previous study we have compared the fuel depletion results for heterogeneous GFR fuel assembly (FA), obtained with TRITON6 sequence of SCALE6.0 with the results of the MCNPX-CINDER90 and TRIPOLI-4-D codes. Present work is a continuation of neutronic criticality analysis of heterogeneous FA and full core configurations of a GFR concept using 3-D Monte Carlo codes KENO-VI/SCALE6.0 and MCNP5. The FA is based on a hexagonal mesh of fuel rods (uranium and plutonium carbide fuel, silicon carbide clad, helium gas coolant) with axial reflector thickness being varied for the purpose of optimization. Three reflector materials were analyzed: zirconium carbide (ZrC), silicon carbide (SiC) and natural uranium. ZrC has been selected as a reflector material, having the best contribution to the neutron economy and to the reactivity of the core. The core safety parameters were also analysed: a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity was verified for the heavy metal fuel and coolant density loss. Criticality calculations of different FA active heights were performed and the reflector thickness was also adjusted. Finally, GFR full core criticality calculations using different active fuel rod heights and fixed ZrC reflector height were done to find the optimal height of the core. The Shannon entropy of the GFR core fission distribution was proved to be useful technique to monitor both fission source convergence (stationarity) and core eigenvalue convergence (keff) to fundamental eigenmode with MCNP5. All calculations were done with ENDF/B-VII.0 library. The obtained results showed high similarity with reference results.</jats:p>"

Here, we modified the Bosanquet equation such that it could consider more factors that contribute to the filling process. First, we introduced the air flowing out of the tube as the liquid inflow. Next, we considered the increase in hydraulic resistance due to the surface roughness of the inner tube. Finally, we further considered the advancing contact angle, which varies during the filling process. When these three factors were included, the modified Bosanquet equation was well correlated with the experimental results, and the R square—which indicates the fitting quality between the simulation and the experiment—significantly increased to above 0.99.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) approaches for nuclear reactor applications have been extensively developed in recent years. The challenge for BEPU approaches is to achieve multi-physics modeling with an acceptable computational cost while preserving a reasonable fidelity of the physics modeled. In this work, we present the core multi-physics computational framework developed for the efficient computation of uncertainties in Light Water Reactor (LWR) simulations. The subchannel thermal-hydraulic code CTF and the nodal expansion neutronic code PARCS are coupled for the multi-physics modeling (CTF-PARCS). The computational framework is discussed in detail from the Polaris lattice calculations up to the CTF-PARCS coupling approaches. Sampler is used to perturb the multi-group microscopic cross-sections, fission yields and manufacturing parameters, while Dakota is used to sample the CTF input parameters and the boundary conditions. Python scripts were developed to automatize and modularize both pre- and post-processing. The current state of the framework allows the consistent perturbation of inputs across neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling. Improvements to the standard thermal-hydraulics modeling for such coupling approaches have been implemented in CTF to allow the usage of 3D burnup distribution, calculation of the radial power and the burnup profile, and the usage of Santamarina effective Doppler temperature. The uncertainty quantification approach allows the treatment of both scalar and functional quantities and can estimate correlation between the multi-physics outputs of interest and up to the originally perturbed microscopic cross-sections and yields. The computational framework is applied to three exercises of the LWR Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling Phase III benchmark. The exercises cover steady-state, depletion and transient calculations. The results show that the maximum fuel centerline temperature across all exercises is 2474K with 1.7% uncertainty and that the most correlated inputs are the 238U inelastic and elastic cross-sections above 1 MeV.</jats:p>"

How to collect and analyze the sewage parameter variables in the sewage treatment process to ensure the intelligent measurement and accurate operation of the parameters in the treatment application is an urgent problem to be solved. This paper is mainly based on the computer-aided control system built by the ARM9 core embedded chip, and the feasibility and effectiveness of fuzzy neural network algorithms are discussed to improve the intelligent processing of sewage treatment parameters. After analyzing the principle and implementation flow of fuzzy control and neural network, starting from the characteristics of data collected by ARM9 core chip, the hybrid algorithm model is optimized and improved to further improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm. The simulation experiment proves that the optimized fuzzy neural control algorithm can effectively identify the dissolved oxygen, nitrate nitrogen, and other parameter data in the sewage treatment, and the recognition accuracy is very close to the true precision. Based on biosensors, the ARM9 core chip control system established by a recursive fuzzy neural network can greatly improve the tracking and control ability of parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentration and nitrate nitrogen concentration in microbial degradation. This has a good development prospect in wastewater treatment control applications. The experimental results show that the recursive fuzzy neural network algorithm proposed in this paper can dynamically track and control the nitrate concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration and ensure that the control is within the accuracy range. The accuracy of recognition is very close to the real accuracy.</jats:p>",

However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into higher‐order assemblies. This work shows that tyrosine‐rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation in a well‐defined pH window and transform into stable membrane‐enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and cross‐linking at the liquid–liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine‐rich peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The membranes have an effective molecular weight cut‐off of 2.5 kDa, as determined from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled peptides, RNA, and polymers into the membrane‐enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub><jats:italic>T</jats:italic>, which is substantially lower than phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness.

Recently, to mitigate this issue, passive radiative cooling has attracted great interest. By reflecting the solar irradiance and selectively emitting mid-infrared thermal radiation, net cooling can be realized by passive radiative cooling without any power input. However, practically, a cooling effect is not desired all year round. To solve this problem, in this study, we propose a thermal-controllable passive radiative cooling coating (TPRCC) consisting of a hierarchically porous structured polymer embedded with thermochromic core-shell microparticles, which can automatically regulate the solar reflectivity by the ambient temperature. This study aims to develop a simple method to fabricate the proposed TPRCC with several common colors (i.e. grey, green, yellow, and red) as well as to investigate its cooling power modulation ability numerically. Based on the results of the study, among those colors, the green-TPRCC achieves the best radiative cooling and cooling power modulation ability, which shows the adjustable solar reflectivity between 68.64% to 92.60% under medium concentrations of thermochromic dyes with estimated 265 W/m2 cooling power modulation ability. Overall, the proposed TPRCC shows tremendous potential to be applied on exterior walls of smart-green buildings, and thus save a large amount of energy consumed by air conditioning systems thanks to its functionality and adjustable appearance.</jats:p>",

The overconsumption of sugar-derived calories is a major driver of obesity and other metabolic diseases. A fine-grained appreciation of the dynamic regulation of sweet taste signaling mechanisms will be required for designing novel noncaloric sweeteners with better hedonic and metabolic profiles and improved consumer acceptance. Sweet taste receptor cells express at least two signaling pathways, one mediated by a heterodimeric G-protein coupled receptor encoded by taste 1 receptor members 2 and 3 (TAS1R2 + TAS1R3) genes and another by glucose transporters and the ATP-gated potassium (KATP) channel. Despite these important discoveries, we do not fully understand the mechanisms regulating sweet taste signaling. We will introduce the core components of the above sweet taste signaling pathways and the rationale for having multiple pathways for detecting sweet tastants. We will then highlight the roles of key regulators of the sweet taste signaling pathways, including downstream signal transduction pathway components expressed in sweet taste receptor cells and hormones and other signaling molecules such as leptin and endocannabinoids.</jats:p>"

From the point of view of prioritizing severe accident management strategies it looks like the priority mitigation action should be to reestablish the emergency core cooling in the reactor pressure vessel. The reason is the longer time window available before the water inventory in the spent fuel pool would be evaporated and spent fuel exposed to overheating. However, if such actions would not be successful and reactor core would, consequently, be damaged, potential design basis leakage (or even greater leakage) from the containment to the fuel handling building (FHB) can affect already established TSC measures or operator accessibility to FHB, or it can jeopardize functioning of the systems, structures and components due to radioactive releases and presence of hydrogen (independently of the fact that containment atmosphere can be inerted by steam or that containment may be equipped with passive autolytic recombiners (PARs)).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optical control ability of photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is a distinctive property suitable for improving sensing and plasma performance. This article proposes a dual-core D-channel PCF sensor that can detect two samples simultaneously, which effectively solves the problems of coating difficulty and low wavelength sensitivity. The PCF has four layers of air holes, which dramatically reduces the optical fiber loss and is more conducive to the application of sensors in actual production. In addition, by introducing dual cores on the upper and lower sides of the central air hole, reducing the spacing between the core and the gold nanolayer, a stronger evanescent field can be generated in the cladding air hole. The optical fiber sensor can detect the refractive index of two samples simultaneously with a maximum sensitivity of 21300 nm/RIU. To the best of our knowledge, the sensitivity achieved in this work is the highest sensitivity with the dual sample synchronous detection sensors. The detection range of the refraction index is 1.35–1.41, and the resolution of the sensor is 4.695 × 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup>. Overall, the sensor will be suitable for medical detection, organic chemical sensing, analyte detection, and other fields.</jats:p>",

Controlling the fluorescence lifetime of QDs shells is imperative for various applications, including light-emitting diodes and single-photon sources. In this work, novel Cu-doped CdS/ZnS shell structures were developed to enhance the photoluminescence properties. The objective was to materialize the Cu-doped CdS/ZnS shells by the adaptation of a two-stage high-temperature doping technique. The developed nanostructures were examined with relevant characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) emission/absorption spectroscopy. Studying fluorescence, we witnessed a sharp emission peak at a wavelength of 440 nm and another emission peak at a wavelength of 620 nm, related to the fabricated Cu-doped CdS/ZnS core/shell QDs. Our experimental results revealed that Cu-doped ZnS shells adopted the crystal structure of CdS due to its larger bandgap. Consequently, this minimized lattice mismatch and offered better passivation to any surface defects, resulting in increased photoluminescence. Our developed core/shells are highly appropriate for the development of efficient light-emitting diodes.</jats:p>"

This grounding method brings a continuous circulating current between the metal shield and metal armor layer compared to the subequipment protection grounding. In order to quantitatively study the circulating current condition of the through line and its influence on the reliability of the railroad power through line, the induced electric potential and circulating current generation mechanism of the single-core cable of the through line and its influencing factors were firstly analyzed in depth. Then, based on the cross-sectional structure of the single-core cable and the location of the traction network and cable in the roadbed section, a traction power supply model was established and simulated for the interlayer-induced potentials and circulating currents due to the two grounding protection methods under no load, single train operation, and heavy load four-train operation of the line. Finally, three actual sections of the Shanghai–Kunming and Nan–Kunming high-speed railroads in China were selected to collect and analyze the loop flow data with no load and with vehicles passing through, and finally the loop flow law of single-core cable for railroad electric through traffic was derived. The analysis shows that when the metal sheath of a single-core cable is grounded by ordinary equipment, the circulating current generated does not exceed 1% of the core current, which meets the relevant safety standards, but the induced voltage in the case of large loads will exceed 50 V safety voltage.</jats:p>"

Second, what is the state of theory in IR? We conducted (co-) citation analyses of both Web of Science (WoS) and—for the first time— non-WoS publications from Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. With regard to the first question, we find that global IR resembles a core–periphery structure as a “hub and spoke” system whereby transatlantic core nodes are interconnected to each other and to some periphery nodes, while the periphery nodes are connected to the core but not to each other. IR scholarship in the periphery quotes the transatlantic theory cluster but is not linked to each other, not even in the same region. Knowledge produced in the periphery has to go through the transatlantic core in order to be recognized globally. As to the transatlantic core, we identify two major (co-) citation clusters: one committed to IR theory-building across issue areas from a variety of perspectives and the other focused on security studies with a strong emphasis on quantitative methods. With regard to the second question, global IR hangs together through references to the IR theory cluster consisting of North American and European authors who appear to define what IR theory is. Scholars in the periphery refer to this transatlantic IR theory cluster when engaging in theory-building. IR theories have become rather diverse and pluralistic, even in the core. While scholars still refer to the big “isms,” they use them around the globe in a synthesizing manner.</jats:p>",

The 2015 edition of the National Building Code of Canada has increased the height limit for light-frame wood construction from 4 to 6 stories. With the increase in building height, it was noticed that light-frame wood structures may be governed by inter-story drift under wind and seismic loads. To reduce the inter-story drift, a hybrid system, consisting of CLT cores and light-frame structures, is proposed. The efficiency of this hybrid system is dependent on the performance of the connections between the two sub-systems. In this project, self-tapping screws (STSs) were used to connect the CLT core and light-frame wood structures on the floor level. Monotonic and reversed-cyclic tests were carried out on CLT-wood frame connections connected with STSs inserted at 45°, 90°, and mixed angles (45° and 90°). The connection performance was evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness, ultimate displacement, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity. Results show that a joint with STSs inserted at 45° had high stiffness and ductility but low energy dissipation, while connections with STSs installed at 90° had high ductility and energy dissipation but low stiffness. Connections with STSs inserted at mixed angles (45° and 90°) achieved the advantages of both configurations when the STSs were inserted at 45° or 90° individually, i.e., high stiffness, ductility, and energy dissipation. The ductility and energy dissipation were significantly improved compared with connections with STSs only inserted at 45° or 90°. This mixed angle connection can be an ideal design for connecting light-frame wood structures to a CLT core to resist wind and seismic load.</jats:p>"

For the first time, reliable detection of structural cracks with a given minimum value was achieved, despite the random nature of the ultimate strength of the optical fibers. This was achieved using arrays of several optical fibers placed on the structural element. The detection of such cracks allows the degree of structural danger of buildings affected by earthquake or other destructive phenomena to be determined. The implementation of this technique is simple and cost effective. For this reason, it may have a broad application in permanent damage-detection systems in buildings in seismic zones. It may also find application in automatic systems for the detection of structural damage to the load-bearing elements of land vehicles, aircraft, and ships.</jats:p>"

The PNB backbones were synthesized via ring‐opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene, and then L‐lactide (LA) was first grafted to the backbones to form PLA side‐chains by ring‐opening polymerization. Afterwards, styrene was further grafted to the PLA cantilever with triothiocarbonate modification via reversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer polymerization to form PLA‐b‐PS side‐chains. Controllable polymerization was achieved by introducing each block in stages. A novel structure with PLA and PS block arranged in tandem was constructed, and their morphologies of self‐assembly in bulk were investigated by transmission electron microscopy imaging. The results demonstrated that the compositions and molecular weight of the side‐chains in the BBPs affected the self‐assembling morphologies of the BBPs significantly, and revealed that the polymers were with core‐shell structures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Context   In ruminant animals, such as sheep, the maintenance of a stable core body temperature is achieved through the controlled process of thermoregulation. The live export of sheep from Australia can expose sheep to heat stress, especially when vessels near, or cross, the equator, that can impact on animal welfare by causing hyperthermia.     Aim   The use of thermologgers located in the rumen of sheep could provide a direct, real-time method to monitor the thermal status of sheep during live export without the need to handle animals during shipping. We determined the relationship between core temperature and rumen temperature during changes in various factors that impact on an animal’s heat balance.     Methods   Sixteen wethers were implanted with thermologgers in the rumen to measure rumen temperature and in the abdominal cavity to measure core temperature. The sheep were exposed to environmental conditions similar to those experienced by sheep on live export vessels. The environment was assessed using the wet-bulb temperature. In the first trial, eight Merinos were shorn while the remaining eight retained their fleece. In the second trial all sheep were shorn, and eight sheep were offered a chaff diet and eight a pelletised diet while the wet bulb temperature increased. The rumen and core temperatures were compared.     Key results   We show that when core temperature increased during exposure to heat load, so did rumen temperature and, despite relatively large changes in overall body temperature, the difference between these temperatures remained stable. The daily average relationship between rumen and core temperatures was 0.5 ± 0.1°C and that difference was not affected by water ingestion, length of fleece, diet composition, or exposure to hot and humid conditions similar to those reported on live export vessels.     Conclusion and implications   By subtraction of 0.5°C from the measured rumen temperature in live export sheep, the use of rumen thermologgers would provide a reliable measure of core temperature and hence an indication of the thermal status of the sheep throughout the export journey.</jats:p>"

The study attempted to investigate the connection between core self-evaluations, job satisfaction, and turnover intention using self-determination theory to investigate the parallel mediating role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on the relationship. Through application of structural equation modeling, the findings showed that CSEs had an impact on job satisfaction and turnover intention, mainly through the mediating role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The mediating role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation provided new insight into the connections between core self-evaluations, job satisfaction, and turnover expectations.</jats:p>"

The density evolution of the collapsing core is given by a one-zone model. We assume two types of dust model: dust composed only of silicate (silicate dust) and dust with a surface covered by H2O ice (H2O ice dust). When only considering collisional coagulation, the non-ideal MHD effects are not effective in the high-density region for both the silicate and H2O ice dust cases. This is because dust coagulation reduces the abundance of small dust particles, resulting in less efficient adsorption of charged particles on the dust surface. For the silicate dust case, when collisional fragmentation is included, the non-ideal MHD effects do apply at a high density of nH &amp;gt; 1012 cm−3 because of the abundant production of small dust particles. On the other hand, for the H2O ice dust case, the production of small dust particles due to fragmentation is not efficient. Therefore, for the H2O ice dust case, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects apply only in the range nH ≳ 1014 cm−3, even when collisional fragmentation is considered. Our results suggest that it is necessary to consider both dust collisional coagulation and fragmentation to activate non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects, which should play a significant role in the star and disc formation processes.</jats:p>",

A fundamental question is whether any observed differences are due to differing methodologies or to differences in the behavior of proteins in solution versus in the crystalline state. Here, we compare the properties of the hydrophobic cores of high‐resolution protein crystal structures and those in NMR structures, determined using increasing numbers and types of restraints. Prior studies have reported that many NMR structures have denser cores compared with those of high‐resolution X‐ray crystal structures. Our current work investigates this result in more detail and finds that these NMR structures tend to violate basic features of protein stereochemistry, such as small non‐bonded atomic overlaps and few Ramachandran and sidechain dihedral angle outliers. We find that NMR structures solved with more restraints, and which do not significantly violate stereochemistry, have hydrophobic cores that have a similar size and packing fraction as their counterparts determined by X‐ray crystallography at high resolution. These results lead us to conclude that, at least regarding the core packing properties, high‐quality structures determined by NMR and X‐ray crystallography are the same, and the differences reported earlier are most likely a consequence of methodology, rather than fundamental differences between the protein in the two different environments.</jats:p>",

The value of the socialist core value system lies in that under the influence of educators, educators, recognizers, communicators and other factors, people's psychological activity process has experienced three stages: obedience, assimilation and internalization, and people's psychological attitude has changed from passive to active., And skills are subject to active and voluntary acceptance. The socialist core value system is the core guiding content of Ideological and political education.

At the same time, the study investigated the changes of emotional and behavioral states in the education system. This scale is used to test the philosophy of human nature, that is, the subjects' estimation of the general behavior patterns of others. Human nature can be divided into six different components: 1 Trustworthiness: the degree to which people are regarded as moral, honest and reliable. 2. Altruism: selflessness, sincere compassion and care for others. 3. Independence: the firmness of adhering to one's own beliefs in the face of the trend of seeking common ground in society. 4. Strength of will and Rationality: People's confidence in the degree of understanding their behavior and overcoming their shortcomings. 5. Complexity of human nature: whether people are complex or simple, difficult to understand or easy to understand. 6. Variability of human nature: the degree of natural difference between individuals and the degree of variability of basic human nature. The research shows that the first four variables and the last two variables are basically independent of each other. The author of this scale first compiled an original scale containing 120 items (each of the above six variables accounts for 20 items, of which 10 items are marked with positive scores and the other 10 items are marked with negative scores), and used it to measure 177 groups. After item analysis, a total of 36 items that are most difficult to distinguish are eliminated, and the remaining items are composed of 6 subscales. Each subscale includes 7 items, of which 7 items are recorded with positive scores and 7 items are recorded with negative scores. Each item has a score of 6 levels, from + 3 (fully agree) to - 3 (fully disagree). The score range of each subscale is between - 42 and + 42, and the middle value is 0.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The realization of the value of Ideological and political education depends on practice.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tFor the use of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in heavy duty applications, on-site generation of hydrogen rich gas by reforming hydrocarbons or methanol are a suitable alternative to pure H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> due to higher availability and higher energy density of hydrocarbon fuels [1]. The so-called reformate contains in addition of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> also CO, which is a catalyst poison. PtRu alloys are the most promising catalysts for PEM fuel cells operated with reformate due to their high CO-tolerance [2]. It is known that the less noble Ru is unstable in acidic PEMFC conditions and is lowering the durability of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by dissolution and crossing over through the membrane to the cathode [3]. Ru dissolution and crossover result in a decreased CO-tolerance on the anode and a lower activity of the cathode towards oxygen reduction due to Ru blocking the Pt surface of the cathode catalyst [4]. To prolong the lifetime and CO-tolerance of reformate PEMFCs, the stability of the anode catalysts must be improved. One approach is nano-structuring the catalysts by encapsulating the less noble Ru-core with a Pt-shell. In doing so, the corrosion resistant Pt-shell supposes to protect the Ru-core from dissolution and thus mitigates the Ru crossover phenomenon.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, the influence of the Pt-shell thickness on the stability and performance of the Ru@Pt catalysts is investigated. Two catalysts with varying Pt-shell thicknesses were synthesized on Vulcan XC72R carbon via a two-step polyol. The catalyst with the thinner Pt-shell is called Ru@1Pt and with the thicker shell Ru@2Pt. The as-synthesized catalysts were physically characterized by XRD, ICP-OES, TEM and EDS. A representative EDS map of Ru@1Pt is shown in fig. 1a. The physical characterization of the obtained catalysts unveils a Ru@Pt core-shell structure with crystalline hcp Ru and fcc Pt. To further investigate the catalysts electrochemically, MEAs were manufactured using Ru@Pt catalysts as anodes and commercial membranes and cathode catalysts. An accelerated stress test (AST) was developed to target Ru dissolution by potential cycling and was applied to investigate and compare the stability of the catalysts. The MEAs were electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry, CO-stripping and U-I curves before, during and after the AST. Post-mortem cross-section STEM analysis of the stressed cells were performed to evaluate the elemental composition and morphology of the anode and cathode after the stress test.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During the AST, CO-stripping on the Ru@1Pt anode showed a peak shift to higher potentials, indicating a decrease in CO-tolerance due to Ru loss. By contrast, on the Ru@2Pt anode, the peak shifted to lower potentials implying a stronger promoting influence of Ru. On the cathode side, CV measurements before and after the AST revealed a double layer increase and a decrease in the HUPD. This change implies the poisoning of Pt with Ru and were more pronounced for Ru@1Pt compared to Ru@2Pt. As seen by the CO-stripping and CV results, the Ru dissolution and crossover was more severe for Ru@1Pt than for Ru@2Pt. Hence, a higher fuel cell performance loss was observed for the cell with Ru@1Pt in H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, as can be seen in fig. 1b. In addition, further U-I curves were measured under varying reformate conditions to identify the influence of CO on the cell performance. Cross-section EDS maps of the stressed MEAs were used to evaluate the Ru dissolution and its distribution in the different layers of the MEA. A higher Ru:Pt ratio was found on the cathode for the cell with Ru@1Pt compared to a cell with Ru@2Pt, which further verifies a higher degree of Ru crossover for the catalyst with the thinner Pt-shell. The above findings could evidence that the shell thickness plays a significant role in the corrosion resistance of core-shell reformate anode fuel cell catalysts.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] B.

In the SS-FON considered, the quality of transmission (QoT) of optical signals is degraded due to the inter-core crosstalk (XT) effect occurring in MCFs. To account for the XT impairment when planning lightpath connections, we make use of a reliable QoT model based on the OSNR estimation, in which the XT impairment is integrated with other physical-layer impairments. To model the lightpath planning optimization problem, we develop a novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation that incorporates the OSNR model. In addition, we propose an efficient heuristic method that is capable of solving larger instances of the optimization problem considered. The results of numerical experiments indicate the low scalability of the MIP method due to the presence of XT and high effectiveness of the heuristic method. The analysis of three different network topologies and two types of MCFs shows a high impact of XT on network performance and limited performance gains from the presence of the central core in a 7-core MCF.</jats:p>"

Historical whaling records and predictive density modeling suggest that these whales potentially could occur more broadly throughout the GOM. High levels of anthropogenic activities in the GOM, including oil and gas exploration and extraction, fisheries, shipping, and the unprecedented<jats:italic>Deepwater Horizon</jats:italic>oil spill, highlight the need to better understand the distribution, ecology, and threats to this small population to improve protection of these endangered whales. We used long-term passive acoustic recordings from the northwestern GOM shelf break to explore the extent of Rice’s whale distribution in the northern GOM and to evaluate whether they exhibit seasonal movements throughout this range. We describe 6 new stereotyped variants of Rice’s whale long-moan calls, found predominantly in the western GOM, that share distinctive features with typical eastern long-moans, including a 150 Hz starting tone, an approximately 100 Hz tail with amplitude modulation, and a long call duration ranging from 10 to 35 s. Western long-moan variants were detected at 3 northwestern sites, occurring sporadically throughout the year on as many as 16% of days at the westernmost site, and infrequently at an eastern core-habitat site. These results indicate that some whales persistently occur over a broader range in the GOM than previously understood, which is important to consider when designating critical habitat and assessing threats to this Critically Endangered species.</jats:p>",

While synthetic polymers have been widely used in this process, mechanical degradation tends to occur at near-wellbore regions where flow rate is high. In this paper, we evaluated the polymer mechanical degradation in both core samples and capillary tubes. Results showed that the degradation tended to be severer when the polymer solution flowing through tighter core samples or through capillary tubes with smaller diameter. After mechanical degradation, the polymer average molecular weight was lower and its distribution became wider, indicating the irreversible fragmentation of polymer molecules. The critical shear rate, beyond which evident polymer degradation occurred, tended to be lower for sandstone cores than that for carbonate cores in the same permeability range. On the other hand, the critical shear rates obtained from capillary tubes were significantly higher than those from the core samples. Correlations between the polymer degradation in core samples and in capillary tubes were established, which can be used to estimate the polymer mechanical degradation in reservoir rocks from the more convenient measurement using capillary tubes. This study provides a robust technique for polymer evaluation, and the results are also helpful for better understanding of the polymer flow in porous media.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of digital technologies is in many ways associated with an improvement of integrated technologies, microelectronic components, and the capabilities of hardware acceleration of the most computationally complex operations. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are actively used for prototyping or the small-scale production of special purpose digital signal processing (DSP) devices. The implementation of DSP algorithms is variative in nature and affects important indicators of a produced device, such as the accuracy of the numerical solution, performance, structural/functional complexity, etc. The architectural features of the FPGA can be used for choosing an effective DSP algorithm in the form of solving the multicriteria discrete optimization problem. This paper analyzes and selects an effective algorithm for calculating the integer square root, which is one of the most frequently used digital signal processing operations. A behavioral model based on a non-restoring algorithm is presented. The SystemVerilog description of the module for calculating the square root, presented in the form of a universal configurable IP core, has been developed and synthesized. The configuration allows one to change the width of the input data bus and select the serial or parallel processing mode for scalar or vector data. The results of testing and comparison of the obtained characteristics with the corresponding Xilinx Cordic IP core are presented. The field test of the proposed IP core implemented in the Xilinx FPGA SOC xc7z045ffg900-2 has demonstrated the gain in the maximum system frequency at 174 MHz in the sequential mode with a 48-bit input bus and 169 MHz in the pipelined mode at a reduction of both the structural complexity and the number of used FPGA internal resources in comparison with the Xilinx Cordic IP core.</jats:p>"

The polymer brush is designed through Si-C covalent bond of vinyl monomers by thermal hydrosilylation reaction. According to the results, the PBCS structure provides three significant functions on Si particles because of the intramolecular effect of hydrogen bonding with PBCS and binder delivers a good dispersion in the slurry, a mechanical protection during cycling, and excellent ionic conductivity for high-rate tests.

Using the open-source mesa-binary, we follow the evolution of a number of eccentric binary systems with an initial primary stellar mass of $1.6 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. The energy that the waves carry to the envelope leads to envelope expansion at the tip of the RGB. The inflated RGB star engulfs many secondary stars to start a CEE that otherwise would not occur. If the secondary star manages to remove most of the RGB envelope the primary evolves to become an EHB star with a mass of $\\simeq 0.47 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. However, we expect that in most cases the secondary star does not have time to spiral-in to close orbits. It rather ends at a large orbit and leaves a massive enough envelope for the primary star to later evolve along the asymptotic giant branch and to engulf the secondary star, therefore forming a non-spherical planetary nebula.</jats:p>",

In the proposed converter, the main switch is turned ON and OFF under ZVS condition, and the auxiliary switch operates under ZCS condition. Besides, all the diodes are turned OFF under ZCS condition, and their reverse recovery losses are alleviated. Moreover, in the proposed converter, the voltage stress of the auxiliary switch is limited to the input voltage. As a result, the efficiency is improved. Since both converter switches and the input voltage share the same ground, no isolated gate driver is required in the implementation of the introduced converter. Also, due to the almost flat efficiency curve of the proposed converter, it is suitable for applications where the load range is wide. The proposed converter analysis, operating principals and design considerations are discussed in this paper, and the converter performance is justified by the implementation results from a 240 W prototype converter.</jats:p>",

Here we prove the security by a change of tactics, that is, by rewriting decay timings into decay directions, which allows us to ensure the secrecy with the help of the parity invariance deeply rooted in the fundamental law of nature. Our result demonstrates that the foundational properties of particle physics, such as the symmetry of interactions, can be used as a firm basis for the RNGs.</jats:p>"

Thus, notwithstanding the first signs of its genesis being viewed in medical terms in early 70s, it is only in recent years that neuromarketing research has grown exponentially. Yet, academic literature remains silent on the issue of neuromarketing application in the aviation sector. More precisely, the psychological resonance that practices of the kind could exert in prospective airline passengers’ psychology is not represented in current literature, mainly considering that successful promotion and profitability are of paramount importance in the airline business. In this study 874 scientific publications have been reviewed. Neuromarketing is presented in its constituents while the following areas of extant scholarship are highlighted: psychological, emotional, decision-making, advantages, challenges and ethics. The study ends up to a proposed theoretical framework paving the way for further research against the backdrop of the relationship between neuromarketing methods application marketing mix and airline passengers’ decisions.  </jats:p>"

However, occult HBV infection (OBI) (serum or liver HBV DNA-positive but HBsAg-negative) remains unaddressed among replacement blood donors – family members or friends who donate to replace blood transfused to a relative.Objective: This study assessed risk factors for a positive anti-HBc test among donors with OBI and determined the anti-HBc-positive status of replacement donors.Methods: The study was conducted at the University College Hospital Blood Bank, Ibadan, Nigeria, using blood samples collected from blood donors between April 2019 and May 2019. Donors were screened for HBsAg by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and anti-HBc by ELISA, while HBV DNA was detected using a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction.Results: Of the 274 participants, 15 (5.5%) were HBsAg-positive by RDT and 36 (13.1%) by ELISA, while 133 (48.5%) were anti-HBc positive. Out of 232 HBsAg-negative donors, 107 (46.1%) were anti-HBc positive. Of the 107 HBsAg-negative but anti-HBc-positive samples, only one (0.93%) was HBV DNA-positive. The HBV DNA-positive donor was HBsAg-negative by both RDT and ELISA tests.Conclusion: This study establishes a potential risk for HBV transmission from isolated anti-HBc-positive donors to blood recipients. HBc immunoglobulin (antibody) M testing to identify blood units requiring further screening with polymerase chain reaction to detect OBI can prevent HBV transmission through blood transfusion. </jats:p>"

Here, we compare core gene phylogenies to phylogenies constructed using core gene concatenations to estimate the strength of signal for the 16S rRNA gene, its hypervariable regions, and all core genes at the intra- and inter-genus levels.

Concordance for hypervariable regions was lower still, with entropy masking providing little to no benefit. A major factor influencing concordance was SNP count, which showed a positive logarithmic association. Using this relationship, we determined that 690 ± 110 SNPs were required for 80% concordance (average 16S rRNA gene SNP count was 254). We also found a wide range in 16S-23S-5S rRNA operon copy number among genomes (1–27). At the inter-genus level, concordance for the whole 16S rRNA gene was markedly higher (73.8% — 10th out of 49 loci); however, the most concordant hypervariable regions (V4, V3-V4, and V1-V2) ranked in the third quartile (62.5 to 60.0%).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Ramifications of a poor phylogenetic performance for the 16S rRNA gene are far reaching.

Our results highlight the problematic nature of these approaches and their use (along with entropy masking) is discouraged. Lastly, the wide range in 16S rRNA gene copy number among genomes also has a strong potential to confound diversity metrics.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In some of these applications, the advantage is in lower cost, while in others, it lies in superior performance. However, especially for longer analogue photonics links (up to 10 s of km), the performance is strongly limited by the impairments arising from using standard single-mode fibres (SSMF). Firstly, the three key metrics of analogue links (loss, noise figure, and dynamic range) tend to improve with received power, but this is limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering in SSMF. Further degradation is due to the chromatic dispersion of SSMF, which induces radio-frequency (RF) signal fading, increases even-order distortions, and causes phase-to-intensity-noise conversion. Further distortions still, are caused by the Kerr nonlinearity of SSMF. We propose to address all of these shortcomings by replacing SSMFs with hollow-core optical fibres, which have simultaneously six times lower chromatic dispersion and several orders of magnitude lower nonlinearity (Brillouin, Kerr). We demonstrate the advantages in this application using a 7.7 km long hollow-core fibre sample, significantly surpassing the performance of an SSMF link in virtually every metric, including 15 dB higher link gain and 6 dB lower noise figure.</jats:p>"

It may be a risk factor for osteoporotic fracture, cardiovascular, metabolic diseases, etc. Core strength and stability is greatly influenced by body composition and adiposity. The aim of the study was to correlate the core strength assessed with the Body Mass Index (BMI) among postmenopausal women.  The objective of the study is to find the correlation between the core strength assessed with the Body Mass Index using 60° flexion test, Beiring Sorenson test and Unilateral Hip Bridge Endurance test among postmenopausal women with age ranging from 46-70 years. 96 healthy postmenopausal women in Karad city with a natural history of menopause were selected for the study. Based upon BMI values, the subjects were grouped as Underweight (&lt;18.5 kg/m2), Normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), Overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2 and more). The outcome values for strength were correlated with the BMI of postmenopausal women. In the study, the Pearson correlation(r) was -0.361 and the P value was 0.0003 showing extremely significant correlation between the BMI and 60° Flexion test. For the Beiring Sorenson Test, the Pearson correlation value was -0.305 and the P value was 0.0025 showing very significant correlation between the BMI and Beiring Sorenson Test. Correlation of BMI and Unilateral Hip Bridge Endurance Test shows a Pearson Correlation value of -0.322 and the P value 0.0013 claiming very significant correlation between the BMI and Unilateral Hip Bridge Endurance Test. The study concludes that there is a significantly negative correlation between the core strength and stability with the Body Mass Index among postmenopausal women.</jats:p>"

The objective of the study was to find the effect of core strengthening and stretching exercises on pain and quality of life in females with Primary Dysmenorrhea. Method: Twenty-seven unmarried girls with primary dysmenorrhea, aged between 18 to 25 years were divided into two groups by using simple random sampling i,e Group A (n=14) and Group B (n=13). Group A received core strengthening and stretching exercises and group B received stretching exercises alone, three times a week for 4 weeks. Outcomes measures included in the study were the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and HRQOL SF 36 which was collected at baseline and at week 4 after treatment and follow-ups were taken after 8 weeks. Result: The result showed that all outcome measures improved significantly (p&lt;0.05) in both groups. Significantly more improvement was seen in patients with primary dysmenorrhea who received combined strengthening and stretching exercises. Conclusion: Both the stretching and strengthening exercises are effective in lowering pain and improving the quality of life in females with primary dysmenorrhea but the combination of the two is more effective than stretching exercises alone.</jats:p>"

The microbial interactions in the plant holobiont are fundamental to the understanding of plant growth and health. To investigate the microbial dynamics in the holobiont of feral <jats:italic>B. napus</jats:italic>, a total of 215 holobiont samples, comprised of bulk soil, primary root, lateral root, dead leaf, caulosphere, basal leaf, apical leaf, carposphere, and anthosphere, were collected from five different grassland sites in South Korea. The soil properties differed in different sampling sites, but prokaryotic communities were segregated according to plant holobiont components. The structures of the site-specific SparCC networks were similar across the regions.

Arthropod-related microbes, such as <jats:italic>Wolbachia</jats:italic> sp., <jats:italic>Gilliamella</jats:italic> sp., and Corynebacteriales amplicon sequence variants, were found in the anthosphere. PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that microbes also possessed specific functions related to holobiont components, such as functions related to degradation pathways in the dead leaf microbiome. Structural equation modeling analysis showed the organic connections among holobiont components and the essential roles of the core microbes in the holobiont formations in natural ecosystem. Microbes coexisting in a specific plant showed relatively stable community structures, even though the regions and soil characteristics were different. Microbes in each plant component were organically connected to form their own plant holobiont. In addition, plant-related microbes, especially core microbes in each holobiont, showed recurrent interaction patterns that are essential to an understanding of the survival and coexistence of plant microbes in natural ecosystems.</jats:p>"

Critically, this role goes far beyond referential and propositional meaning. The human communication system that we consider to be the explanandum in the evolution of language thus is not spoken language. It is, instead, a deeply multimodal, multilayered, multifunctional system that developed—and survived—owing to the extraordinary flexibility and adaptability that it endows us with. Beyond their undisputed iconic power, visual bodily signals (manual and head gestures, facial expressions, gaze, torso movements) fundamentally contribute to key pragmatic processes in modern human communication. This contribution becomes particularly evident with a focus that includes non-iconic manual signals, non-manual signals and signal combinations. Such a focus also needs to consider meaning encoded not just via iconic mappings, since kinematic modulations and interaction-bound meaning are additional properties equipping the body with striking pragmatic capacities. Some of these capacities, or its precursors, may have already been present in the last common ancestor we share with the great apes and may qualify as early versions of the components constituting the hypothesized interaction engine.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘Revisiting the human ‘interaction engine’: comparative approaches to social action coordination’.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tGold nanoparticles (Au NPs) coated with TiO2 shells exhibit strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks at ~550-600 nm. The Au plasmons decay in femtoseconds through both interband and intraband damping processes to produce hot electron-hole pairs. These hot carriers have excess energy at room temperature which can be utilized to generate electricity or drive a chemical reaction. However, the hot carriers experience ultrafast recombination and thermal relaxation in hundreds of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds due to electron-electron scattering and collisions with phonons. A Schottky barrier heterojunction between Au and a n-type semiconductor such as TiO2 is an ideal method to separate the hot carrier pairs. In Au-TiO2 Schottky junctions, hot electrons are injected into TiO2 through thermionic emission and/or field emission before recombination and thermal equilibration, at timescales of roughly 250 fs. However the harvesting of residual hot holes in Au remains problematic partly because of the difficulty in forming Schottky junctions between Au and p-type semiconductors. The harvesting of hot holes is particularly important considering that hot holes in Au are on average, more energetic than hot electrons.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, we use an innovative photoanode architecture to harvest hot holes. Our photoanode architecture consists of Au NPs coated with a thin layer of amorphous TiO2 and deposited on transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-coated glass substrates. Hot electrons are extracted from the Au into the TCO contact through the TiO2 shell. Hot holes tunnel through the TiO2 to reach the alkaline electrolyte whether they oxidize hydroxyl ions and dissolved oxygen species to generate oxygen. Another novelty is the use of a layer of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) quantum dots to pump the plasmon through exciton-to-plasmon energy transfer and increase the production of hot carriers. g-C3N4 works to enhance the plasmonic light harvesting due to the excellent overlap between the emission of g-C3N4 and the LSPR absorption band of Au. Photocurrent densities as high as 3.7 mA/cm2 were achieved under AM1.5G one sun illumination with concomitant high Faradaic efficiencies. Photoelectrochemical action spectra collected using filtered AM1.5G illumination and monochromatic LEDs revealed the prominent role of visible photons in water-splitting performed using Au-C3N4-TiO2 core-shell ternary heterojunctions. A key goal moving forward is to replace the noble metal (Au) with transition metal nitride plasmonic absorbers while sustaining the high level of photoelectrochemical performance.    </jats:p>",

It represents the set of the most effective and available resources that would treat the most common diseases in an environment. This composition of knowledge would be conservative over space and time. To test these questions, we hypothesized that the composition of the structural core remains constant during temporal changes in a social-ecological context, and that the composition of the infantile structural core (new generation) is similar to that of the adults (older generation). For 2 years, we tracked the structure of important medicinal plants among the same 49 residents of a community located in Vale do Catimbau in Pernambuco, Brazil. We also compared the importance of the medicinal plants among two different generations, children/adolescents and adults, in the same space/time context.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results and Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our results refuted both hypotheses. Regarding the composition of important medicinal plants through temporal variations and for children's learning, our results were not predicted by the model. This suggests that the structural core should not be regarded as a conservative phenomenon, but rather a congenital, dynamic, and plastic occurrence that has adapted to configure itself as a short-term population response to the treatment of local diseases.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Therefore, studying the temperature rise of the reactor plays an important role in the reliability of its operation and the economy of design and production. According to the structural characteristics of the reactor, the three-dimensional thermal field model of the aluminum wire-insulation structure of the reactor is established, and the encapsulation temperature field distribution of the reactor under steady state is obtained. Compare the simulation result with the encapsulation temperature field distribution of the equivalent structure. The results show that the highest temperature of the aluminum wire-insulation structure encapsulation rises to 73.51∘∘C, which is located in the middle of the reactor. Each encapsulation hotspot is located about 20% from the upper edge of the encapsulation. In the temperature rise test, a Fiber Bragg Grating (FGB) temperature sensor is installed about 20% from the upper edge of the encapsulation. The test shows that the most significant value of temperature rise of the reactor is 73∘∘C, which is located in the middle of the reactor. The temperature rise test results verify the accuracy of the simulated calculation value of the temperature field of the aluminum wire-insulated reactor and provide a reference for the temperature rise calculation and temperature rise monitoring of the DAR.</jats:p>"

Fibrocytes express multiple thyroid autoantigens and cytokines implicated in TAO, which are downregulated by Slit2. Inflammation and disordered hyaluronan (HA) accumulation occur in TAO.

The results of this study identified both process-related and structure-related factors that were highly relevant to the implementation of this interview tool. Overall, the findings revealed that the use of this interview tool promoted person-centered care in encounters focused on clinical audiological rehabilitation.

The combination of Brewster angle microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray reflectivity measurements shows that the molecules, once transferred onto a solid substrate, form a bilayer structure with a bottom layer of flat molecules and an upper layer of upright molecules.

This would\nprovide vital data (including a CO2 profile) allowing us to assess\nideas about the cause of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT). The European\nBeyond EPICA project and the Australian Million Year Ice Core project each\nplan to drill such a core in the region known as Little Dome C. Dating the\ncores will be challenging, and one approach will be to match some of the\nrecords obtained with existing marine sediment datasets, informed by\nsimilarities in the existing 800 kyr period. Water isotopes in Antarctica\nhave been shown to closely mirror deepwater temperature, estimated from\nMg/Ca ratios of benthic foraminifera, in a marine core on the Chatham Rise\nnear to New Zealand. The dust record in ice cores resembles very closely a\nSouth Atlantic marine record of iron accumulation rate. By assuming these\nrelationships continue beyond 800 ka, our ice core record could be\nsynchronised to dated marine sediments. This could be supplemented, and\nallow synchronisation at higher resolution, by the identification of rapid\nmillennial-scale events that are observed both in Antarctic methane records\nand in emerging records of planktic oxygen isotopes and alkenone sea surface\ntemperature (SST) from the Portuguese Margin. Although published data remain\nquite sparse, it should also be possible to match 10Be from ice cores\nto records of geomagnetic palaeo-intensity and authigenic 10Be/9Be\nin marine sediments. However, there are a number of issues that have to be\nresolved before the ice core 10Be record can be used. The approach of\nmatching records to a template will be most successful if the new core is in\nstratigraphic order but should also provide constraints on disordered\nrecords if used in combination with absolute radiogenic ages.\n                    </jats:p>"

Chopped fibers of glass, carbon, and kevlar with length 12 mm were introduced between core and face sheets during fabrication in order to improve face‐core bonding. The influence of chopped fibers is investigated by testing flexural, compressive, shear, and fracture toughness properties of prepared specimens according to ASTM standards. Sandwich specimens with chopped glass fibers exhibited, superior interfacial bonding between the face and the core and hence improved the mechanical properties of sandwich composite. The chopped glass fiber embedded sandwich composite has an increased flexural strength of 32.77% and compressive strength of 21.43% when compared with plain sandwich composite. In addition, the shear strength and fracture toughness behavior of specimens with chopped glass fibers are superior when compared to other chopped fibers incorporated in the interfacial region. The interfacial region between skin and core was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Chopped glass fibers in the interfacial region showed better adhesion property along with the epoxy.</jats:p>",

Progression of these exercises can be done in weight-bearing and impact activities specific to patient goals. In addition to these foot intrinsic exercises, calf raises should be incorporated to strengthen the gastroc-soleus complex to both improve plantar foot strength and facilitate extension of the first MTP joint. Manual therapy techniques reduce the rigidity of the first MTP joint and restore appropriate medial-lateral and plantar-dorsal balance. With severe limitations in mobility or pain limitations, ESWT can be incorporated to treat the joint and surrounding soft tissue restrictions. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> Increased first MTP extension is observed. Reduced symptoms of first MTP joint pain with activity allow patients to return to walking and other physical activities with improved comfort. Complications are rare.

In particular, Floquet theory applied to quantum mechanics revealed that we can even control the band topology in semimetallic/insulating systems, while the straightforward application to topological superconductivity fails for typical superconductors because the supercondicting gap function does not couple to the electromagnetic field in a direct manner. Here we show that we can overcome this difficulty by taking account of correlation effects. Namely, we study how a <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>-wave superconductivity is changed when illuminated by circularly-polarised light (CPL) in the repulsive Hubbard model in the strong-coupling regime. We adopt the Floquet formalism for the Gutzwiller-projected effective Hamiltonian with the time-periodic Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We find that CPL induces a topological superconductivity with a <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> + <jats:italic>i</jats:italic><jats:italic>d</jats:italic> pairing, which arises from the chiral spin coupling and the three-site term generated by the CPL. The latter term remains significant even for low frequencies and low intensities of the CPL. This is clearly reflected in the obtained phase diagram against the laser intensity and temperature for various frequencies red-detuned from the Hubbard <jats:italic>U</jats:italic>, with the transient dynamics also examined. The phenomenon revealed here can open a novel, dynamical way to induce a topological superconductivity.</jats:p>"

Here, we examined whether and how literate adults represent a number’s full syntactic structure. In 5 experiments, participants repeated number-word sequences and we systematically varied the order of words within each sequence. Repetition on grammatical sequences (e.g., two hundred ninety-seven) was better than on non-grammatical ones (hundred seven two ninety). We conclude that the participants represented the number’s full syntactic structure and used it to merge number words into chunks in short-term memory. Accuracy monotonously improved for sequences with increasingly longer grammatical segments, up to a limit of ~ 4 words per segment, irrespectively of the number of digits, and worsened thereafter. Namely, short chunks improved memorization, whereas oversized chunks disrupted memorization. This chunk size limit suggests that the chunks are not based on predefined structures, whose size limit is not expected to be so low, but are created ad hoc by a generative process, such as the hierarchical syntactic representation hypothesized in Michael McCloskey’s number-processing model. Chunking occurred even when it disrupted performance, as in the oversized chunks, and even when external cues for chunking were controlled for or were removed. We conclude that the above generative process operates automatically rather than voluntarily. To date, this is the most detailed account of the core representation of the syntactic structure of numbers—a critical aspect of numerical literacy and of the ability to read and write numbers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The repertoire of T cell receptors encodes various types of immunological information. Machine learning is indispensable for decoding such information from repertoire datasets measured by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In particular, the classification of repertoires is the most basic task, which is relevant for a variety of scientific and clinical problems. Supported by the recent appearance of large datasets, efficient but data-expensive methods have been proposed. However, it is unclear whether they can work efficiently when the available sample size is severely restricted as in practical situations. In this study, we demonstrate that their performances can be impaired substantially below critical sample sizes. To complement this drawback, we propose MotifBoost, which exploits the information of short <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer motifs of TCRs. MotifBoost can perform the classification as efficiently as a deep learning method on large datasets while providing more stable and reliable results on small datasets. We tested MotifBoost on the four small datasets which consist of various conditions such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV, <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>-chain, <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>-chain and it consistently preserved the stability. We also clarify that the robustness of MotifBoost can be attributed to the efficiency of <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-mer motifs as representation features of repertoires. Finally, by comparing the predictions of these methods, we show that the whole sequence identity and sequence motifs encode partially different information and that a combination of such complementary information is necessary for further development of repertoire analysis.</jats:p>"

The stable output of the CTEH is enabled by the constant voltage‐time product in its saturable characteristic. The proposed CTEH is implemented with a resistive load representing the load of electronic devices. When the current in the primary side of the CTEH's increases from 1 to 1000 A, the maximum power on the load can reach about 0.5 W, demonstrating the feasibility of using the CTEH with the saturable magnetic core as a quasi‐stable power supply.</jats:p>",

However, the UMR amplitude is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than those of other directional magnetoresistances exhibited in ferromagnetic thin films, hindering sensing applications using the UMR. For a directional magnetic sensor using the UMR, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of the UMR and its enhancement are highly desirable. In this study, the structural dependence of the UMR in Fe–Sn heterostructure devices is investigated. We find a weak dependence of the UMR on interface configuration in the oxide cap/Fe–Sn heterostructures on various oxide substrates. In contrast, the normalized UMR amplitude is enhanced by a factor of 27 with increasing Fe–Sn layer thickness from 4.0 to 100 nm. These results suggest that the magnetothermal effect dominates the large UMR in the Fe–Sn heterostructure devices.</jats:p>",

Architecture on demand (AoD) nodes can meet these requirements but the slow configuration time of optical backplane in AoD nodes makes it difficult to serve latency-sensitive requests. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optical backplane based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) switches to provide fast configuration time for AoD nodes. Moreover, we propose quantitative measures of node switching flexibility in SDM-EONs and of link configuration speed in AoD nodes. Based on the hybrid backplane architecture and the measurement approaches, we propose a flexibility and fragmentation aware routing, spectrum and core allocation algorithm and an AoD synthesis algorithm. Simulation results show that the hybrid AoD nodes with support of spatial lane change can reduce network blocking probability. The AoD based on this hybrid backplane structure can improve the network performance by 32.8% compared to the AoD based on the traditional MEMS. Compared with traditional reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs), the hybrid AoD nodes can control the number of wavelength selective switch (WSS) ports.</jats:p>",

In this new reality, rather than stigma being concealed, it is normalized, and the organization capitalizes on it to enhance success. We focus on <jats:italic>RuPaul's Drag Race</jats:italic> as a stigmatized organization that has built its success through the active spectacularization of its core stigma. In our analyses, we identify three mechanisms (i.e., reiteration of transgressions, awakening of social consciousness, and language modelling) the organization strategically uses to spectacularize the transgressions associated with the social deviance of drag queens. Through these mechanisms, a new reality around the stigma of drag queens is constructed and stigma is normalized. Overall, we contribute to a better understanding of how organizations can capitalize on their core stigma through spectacularization; we also explore the role of audiences in co‐creating organizational realities around stigma.</jats:p>",

In the present study, TFs occurring in the Antarctic coastal region were examined using the ERA5 dataset. First, the climatological distribution of TF frequency in the extratropics of the Southern Hemisphere was examined. Similar to results from previous studies, TFs were found to often occur along the coast of Antarctica, which is located more than 1000 km south of the maximum of the eddy kinetic energy of synoptic-scale disturbances. This result suggests that the climatological pattern of frequency of TFs in the southern high latitudes cannot be explained only by the geographical distribution of storm tracks. Next, a composite analysis of TFs at Syowa Station was performed. When the negative anomaly of the tropopause height was greatest, strong Q-vector divergence and downwelling were observed in the vicinity of the TF locations. The distribution of Q vectors is related to a local westerly jet and strengthening of the frontal structure associated with meridionally contracted synoptic-scale disturbances. The roles of the topography of the Antarctic Plateau and the radiative cooling on the surface of the continent during the contraction of the disturbances are also discussed based on ray-tracing theory.</jats:p>",

Intestinal tissue is a pivotal organ for the regulation of glucose metabolism, mainly via glucose absorption into the circulation; however, the significance of the intestinal circadian clock network for glucose metabolism remains largely unclear. We herein utilized a mouse model in which Bmal1, a core clock gene, was deleted in an intestine-specific manner (Bmal1Int–/– mice) and demonstrated a rhythmic expression of Sglt1 with its peak at zeitgeber time (ZT) 10.7 ± 2.8 in control mice, whereas this was lost in Bmal1Int–/– mice. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed rhythmic binding of CLOCK to the E-box elements in the Sglt1 gene in control mice; however, this was absent in Bmal1Int–/– mice. Accordingly, SGLT1 protein levels were decreased during the dark phase in Bmal1Int–/– mice and this was associated with impaired glucose absorption, leading to a decline in hepatic glycogen levels at ZT4, which was restored by ingestion of high-sucrose water. Additionally, when mice were starved from ZT0, greater expression of the lipolysis-related gene Pnpla2 was observed in adipose tissue of Bmal1Int–/– mice, and this was not noted when glycogen storage was restored by high-sucrose water prior to fasting, suggesting that higher Pnpla2 expression in Bmal1Int–/– mice was likely caused by lower glycogen storage. These results indicate that disruption of the intestinal circadian clock system impairs glucose absorption in the intestine and affects systemic glucose homeostasis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background of Study: Altered patterns of abdominal and low back muscle activity have been reported in people in the sub-acute phase of low back injury. Specifically, higher overall muscle activity and less ability to match activity to task demands have been found. Objective: This study determined if an 8-week group exercise intervention would alter muscle activity, strength, and endurance in people with/without a history of low back pain (LBP). Method: In this randomized controlled trial 46 participants (age 19-55) with a history of LBP were randomized to exercise (LBPEx, n=24) and no-exercise (LBPCon, n=22) groups. 27 participants without a history of LBP (NoLBP) also exercised. 17 LBPEx and 19 NoLBP participants completed the intervention. 19 LBPCon were tested at 8-week follow-up. The exercise intervention was an 8-week, choreographed, 30-minute group exercise intervention (Les Mills CoreTM) focused on building core strength, stability, and endurance. Pre and post-intervention surface electromyograms from abdominal and low back muscles were recorded during a trunk stability task (TST), and analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to extract patterns corresponding to overall amplitude and relative activation during the TST loading phase. Abdominal and back extensor strength and endurance were also measured. Results: It was found that overall abdominal activity decreased for left anterior external oblique (p=0.019 for TST level 3), left lateral external oblique (p=0.012 for TST level 3), and right posterior external oblique (p=0.035 for TST level 3) in LBPEx and for right lateral external oblique (p=0.009 for TST level 2 and p=0.004 for TST level 3) and left posterior external oblique (p=0.014 for TST level 2 and p=0.011 for TST level 3) in NoLBP during the TST. Abdominal strength and endurance, and back extensor endurance increased for LBPEx and NoLBP (p0.05). Back extensor strength increased for NoLBP (p0.05). Relative abdominal activation during the TST level 2 loading phase increased for right upper rectus abdominus (p=0.05), right lateral external oblique (p=0.002), and left posterior external oblique (p=0.006) for NoLBP, and for left anterior external oblique (p=0.042) for LBPEx. Conclusion: Les Mills CoreTM is readily available and may be recommended as a safe, accessible, and effective intervention to increase abdominal strength and endurance, and back extensor endurance, even for people with a history of LBP.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hepadnaviruses use extensively overlapping genes to expand their coding capacity, especially the precore/core genes encode the precore and core proteins with mostly identical sequences but distinct functions. The precore protein of the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is N-glycosylated, in contrast to the precore of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) that lacks N-glycosylation. To explore the roles of the N-linked glycosylation sites in precore and core functions, we substituted T77 and T92 in the WHV precore/core N-glycosylation motifs (<jats:sup>75</jats:sup>NIT<jats:sup>77</jats:sup> and <jats:sup>90</jats:sup>NDT<jats:sup>92</jats:sup>) with the corresponding HBV residues (E77 and N92) to eliminate the sequons. Conversely, these N-glycosylation sequons were introduced into the HBV precore/core gene by E77T and N92T substitutions. We found that N-glycosylation increased the levels of secreted precore gene products from both HBV and WHV. However, the HBV core (HBc) protein carrying the E77T substitution was defective in supporting virion secretion, and during infection, the HBc E77T and N92T substitutions impaired the formation of the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the critical viral DNA molecule responsible for establishing and maintaining infection. In cross-species complementation assays, both HBc and WHV core (WHc) proteins supported all steps of intracellular replication of the heterologous virus while WHc, with or without the N-glycosylation sequons, failed to interact with HBV envelope proteins for virion secretion. Interestingly, WHc supported more efficiently intracellular cccDNA amplification than HBc in the context of either HBV or WHV. These findings reveal novel determinants of precore secretion and core functions and illustrate strong constraints during viral host adaptation resulting from their compact genome and extensive use of overlapping genes.</jats:p>"

It is simple to fabricate and modify its morphology for enhanced electrical conductivity. However, such improvement is still limited to considerably enhancing TE performance. In this case, a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), which has ultrathin diameters and exhibits semi-metallic electrical conductivity, might be a proper candidate to be combined with PPy as a core shell one-dimensional (1D) nanocomposite for higher TE power generation. In this work, core shell nanocomposites based on SWCNT/PPy were fabricated. Various amounts of pyrrole (Py), which are monomer sources for PPy, were coated on SWCNT, along with methyl orange (MO) as a surfactant and ferric chloride as an initiator. The optimum value of Py for maximum TE performance was determined. The results showed that the SWCNT acted as a core template to direct the self-assembly of PPy and also to further enhance TE performance. The TE power factor, PF, and figure of merit, zT, values of the pure PPy were initially recorded as ~1 µW/mK2 and 0.0011, respectively. These values were greatly increased to 360 µW/mK2 and 0.09 for the optimized core shell nanocomposite sample. The TE power generation characteristics of the fabricated single-leg module of the optimized sample were also investigated and confirmed these findings. This enhancement was attributed to the uniform coating and good interaction between PPy polymer chains and walls of the SWCNT through π–π stacking. The significant enhancement in the TE performance of SWCNT/PPy nanocomposite is found to be superior compared to those reported in similar composites, which indicates that this nanocomposite is a suitable and scalable TE material for TE power generation.</jats:p>"

Here we show that the lysosomal cholesterol transport inhibitor U18666A interferes with the replication of pseudorabies virus (PRV), a member of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily. The treatment with U18666A caused a significant reduction in the production of infectious virus particles. The U18666A treatment was shown to suppress the release of PRV particles. Pretreating PRV virions with U18666A did not affect virus production, whereas pretreating target cells with U18666A led to a substantial reduction in virus yield. Our previous study showed that two cyclodextrin derivatives, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HPγCD), can rescue the cholesterol accumulation defect in primary fibroblasts derived from a Niemann–Pick disease type C (NPC) patient. Here, we demonstrate that treatment with HPβCD or HPγCD not only rescues the U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation but also rescues the U18666A-induced inhibition of PRV production. Collectively, our data suggest that U18666A interferes with PRV infection via altering cellular functions that are critical for the viral life cycle and may include lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis.</jats:p>"

Core–sheath fibers with various shell thicknesses based on cellulose acetate (CA) were prepared by the modified triaxial electrospinning for the controlled and sustained release of the water-insoluble Chinese herbal active ingredient curcumin. The superficial morphology and internal structure of core–sheath fibers were optimized by increasing the flow rate of the middle working fluid. Although the prepared fibers were hydrophobic initially, the core–sheath structure endowed fibers with better water retention property than monolithic fibers. Core–sheath fibers had flatter sustained-release profiles than monolithic fibers, especially for thick shell layers, which had almost zero-order release for almost 60 h. The shell thickness and sustained release of drugs brought about a good antibacterial effect to materials. The control of flow rate during fiber preparation is directly related to the shell thickness of core–sheath fibers, and the shell thickness directly affects the controlled release of drugs. The fiber preparation strategy for the precise control of core–sheath structure in this work has remarkable potential for modifying water-insoluble drug release and improving its antibacterial performance.</jats:p>"

However, assessing the impact of homologous recombination on accessory genes which are only present in a subset of strains of a given species remains challenging due to their complex phylogenetic relationships. Quantifying homologous recombination for accessory genes (which are important for niche-specific adaptations) in comparison to core genes (which are present in all strains and have essential functions) is critical to understanding how selection acts on variation to shape species diversity and genome structures of bacteria. Here, we apply a computationally efficient, non-phylogenetic approach to measure homologous recombination rates in the core and accessory genome using &gt;100,000 whole genome sequences from <jats:italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</jats:italic> and several additional species. By analyzing diverse sets of sequence clusters, we show that core genes often have higher recombination rates than accessory genes, and for some bacterial species the associated effect sizes for these differences are pronounced. In a subset of species, we find that gene frequency and homologous recombination rate are positively correlated. For <jats:italic>S. pneumoniae</jats:italic> and several additional species, we find that while the recombination rate is higher for the core genome, the mutational divergence is lower, indicating that divergence-based homologous recombination barriers could contribute to differences in recombination rates between the core and accessory genome. Homologous recombination may therefore play a key role in increasing the efficiency of selection in the most conserved parts of the genome.</jats:p>"

Small-scale GSDM activation and pore formation allow the passive release of cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, and alarmins, but, whenever numerous GSDM pores are assembled, osmotic lysis and cell death occur. Such GSDM-mediated pyroptosis promotes pathogen clearance and can help restore homeostasis, but recent studies have revealed that dysregulated pyroptosis is at the root of many inflammation-mediated disease conditions. Moreover, new homeostatic functions for gasdermins are beginning to be revealed. Here, we review the newly discovered mechanisms of GSDM activation and their prominent roles in host defense and human diseases associated with chronic inflammation. We also highlight the potential of targeting GSDMs as a new therapeutic approach to combat chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer and how we might overcome the current obstacles to realize this potential.</jats:p>"

This study proposed and evaluated an ohmic heating extraction-based valorization platform to obtain value-added bioactive compounds from pineapple core and studied the effects of four important processing parameters. In this sense, a Taguchi design (L16(4)4) was used to assess the effects of temperature (70, 80, 90, and 100 °C), time (15, 30, 45, and 60 min), voltage (110, 160, 210, and 260 V), and frequency (60, 340, 620, and 900 Hz) on heating rate, come-up time, energy consumption, system performance efficiency, total phenolic compounds (TPC), DPPH, and ABTS. Finally, a side-by-side comparison of optimized ohmic heating (OOH) and conventional extraction was performed, and chemical composition was compared by ultra-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detection-mass (UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS-MS). According to the results, increasing temperatures enhanced system performance efficiency but negatively affected TPC and antioxidant values above 90 ℃. Similarly, prolonging the extraction (&gt;30 min) decreased TPC. Further, increasing voltage (from 110 to 260 V) shortened the come-up time (from 35.75 to 5.16 min) and increased the heating rate (from 2.71 to 18.80 °C/min−1). The optimal conditions were 30 min of extraction at 80 °C, 160 V, and 900 Hz. Verification of the optimal conditions revealed that OOH yielded an extract with valuable bioactive compounds and saved 50% of the time and 80% of energy compared to the conventional treatment. The UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS-MS showed that there were similarities between the chemical profiles of the extracts obtained by conventional and OOH methods, while the concentration of major compounds varied depending on the extraction method. This information can help achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) by maximizing the yield and minimizing energy and time consumption.</jats:p>"

The study of ant-plant networks has increased our knowledge of the diversity of interactions and structure of these communities; however, little is known about how land-use change affects ant-plant networks. Here we determine whether the change in land use, from native oak forest to induced grassland, affected the network properties of ant-plant networks in a temperate forest in Mexico. We hypothesize that the disturbed vegetation will be more nested and generalized due to the addition of generalist species to the network. The oak forest network comprises 47 plant species and 11 ant species, while the induced grassland network has 35 and 13, respectively. Floral nectar was the resource used most intensely by the ants in both vegetation types. The ant-plant network of the induced grassland was significantly more nested and generalist than that of the oak forest; however, none of the networks were nested when considering the frequency of interaction. In both vegetation types, the ants were more specialized than the plants, and niche overlap was low. This could be related to the dominant species present in each type of vegetation: <jats:italic>Prenolepis imparis</jats:italic> in the oak forest and <jats:italic>Camponotus rubrithorax</jats:italic> in the grassland. The central core of cold climate ant species in the oak forest was replaced by a central core of subordinate Camponotini and tropical specialists in the induced grassland. These results suggest that the increase in nestedness and generalization in the grassland may be related to the loss of the cold climate specialists from the core of the oak forest network. Our findings provide evidence that land-use change increases the level of generalization in the ant-plant interaction networks of temperate forests.</jats:p>"

Hollow-core tube lattice fibers (HC-TLFs) are proposed as a label-free biosensor for the detection of DNA molecules. The particular light-guiding mechanism makes them a highly sensitive tool. Their transmission spectrum is featured by alternations of high and low transmittance at wavelength regions whose values depend on the thickness of the microstructured web composing the cladding around the hollow core. In order to achieve DNA detection by using these fibers, an internal chemical functionalization process of the fiber has been performed in five steps in order to link specific peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes, then the functionalized fiber was used for a three-step assay. When a solution containing a particular DNA sequence is made to flow through the HC of the TLF in an ‘optofluidic’ format, a bio-layer is formed on the cladding surfaces causing a red-shift of the fiber transmission spectrum. By comparing the fiber transmission spectra before and after the flowing it is possible to identify the eventual formation of the layer and, therefore, the presence or not of a particular DNA sequence in the solution.</jats:p>"

Here, we set out to abolish VP7 self-assembly by targeting candidate amino acid regions on the surface of the VP7 trimer via site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that the substitution of seven amino acids resulted in the complete disruption of AHSV VP7 self-assembly, which abolished the formation of VP7 crystalline particles and converted VP7 to a fully soluble protein still capable of interacting with VP3 to form core-like particles. This work provides further insight into the formation of AHSV VP7 crystalline particles and the successful development of AHSV vaccines.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several applications of nanofiber-based systems are based on their corresponding functionality-related properties, which often cannot be satisfied by a fiber web with a monolithic structure because of the various physicochemical properties and amounts of embedded compounds. Therefore, one of the main directions in the development of fiber systems is creating core–shell type complex fiber structures that can provide application-specific properties to the fiber matrix. The present study aimed to formulate levocetirizine-loaded core–shell type hydrophilic polymer-based fibrous systems. The core phase contained the antihistamine levocetirizine, while the permeation enhancer (Na-taurocholate), the local pH regulator (citric acid), and the cyclodextrin used as a taste masking agent were included in the shell phase of the fibrous formulation. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that a randomly oriented homogeneous fibrous structure was obtained, while the Raman mapping and chemometric analysis confirmed the partially formed core–shell structure. A fast release rate of the antihistamine drug from the complex structural fibrous system was obtained (within 1 min complete dissolution can be observed) due to its increased surface area to volume ratio and its more favorable wettability properties, which consequently allows for more erosion. The masking properties against the unpleasant bitter taste of API of the formulated complex nanostructure were confirmed by the results of the electronic tongue. The formulated complex nanostructure enabled fast and complete release of the API, providing a potential enhancement in the rate and extent of absorption while masking the unpleasant taste of levocetirizine, which has a high impact on the patient adherence. All in all, the results show that the developed orally dissolving fibrous web formulation can be a potential alternative to the commercially available orally disintegrating tablets.</jats:p>"

Understanding tick cement formation is highly sought after as its disruption will prevent tick feeding. This study describes proteins that form the inner core layer of <jats:italic>I. scapularis</jats:italic> tick cement as disrupting these proteins will likely stop formation of the outer cortical layer. The inner core cement layer completes formation by 24 h of tick attachment. Thus, we used laser-capture microdissection to isolate cement from cryosections of 6 h and 24 h tick attachment sites and to distinguish between early and late inner core cement proteins. LC-MS/MS analysis identified 138 tick cement proteins (TCPs) of which 37 and 35 were unique in cement of 6 and 24 h attached ticks respectively. We grouped TCPs in 14 functional categories: cuticular protein (16%), tick specific proteins of unknown function, cytoskeletal proteins, and enzymes (13% each), enzymes (10%), antioxidant, glycine rich, scaffolding, heat shock, histone, histamine binding, proteases and protease inhibitors, and miscellaneous (3–6% each). Gene ontology analysis confirm that TCPs are enriched for bio adhesive properties. Our data offer insights into tick cement bonding patterns and set the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of <jats:italic>I. scapularis</jats:italic> tick cement formation.</jats:p>"

Cores with a traditional cooling layout were made of H13 steel using machining, and the working sections of the conformal cores were made using the selective laser melting method (SLM). Two series of casts were produced in the same mould. For Series A, the mould was fitted with traditional cooling cores, and for Series B, the same mould was fitted with conformal ones. The cast specimens were subjected to two weeks of natural ageing. The strength testing of the casts determined the levels of the destructive forces. The destructive forces in the core-cooling impact zones were approximately 28% higher in the B samples than they were in the A samples. The impact of the alloy’s porosity, density, and microstructure on the strengths of the casts was demonstrated. The alloy densities in the central (broken-off) fragments of the casts from Series A were 2.6646 g/cm3; these were 2.6791 g/cm3 in the cases of casts from Series B. The values of the secondary dendrite arm space (SDAS) ranged from 6 to 13 μm in the analysed cross-section of the set of the A casts, and between 3 and 12 μm in the same zone of the set of the B casts. The results of the experimental determinations of the casts porosity levels and SDAS parameters were compared with the results of numerical simulations that were carried out in ProCAST software.</jats:p>"

Glass fiber/epoxy and PVC foam were used as a facesheet material and a core material, respectively. The impact energy values were selected considering to penetration and perforation cases. The core stitching effect on low velocity impact behavior of sandwich composites were compared to facesheet stitching and it has been determined that the core stitching process can be an alternative to the facesheet stitching process in terms of the absorbed energy value.

Also, no exact solution can be found from the forced vibrations of sandwich beams, and mainly by numerical methods, the dynamic response of sandwich beams has been obtained. Also, there is no coupling solution for this type of structure with an exact solution. Therefore, the present work aims to present a method by which an accurate solution to the dynamic response of sandwich beams can be obtained to eliminate the computational error in numerical methods. Hence, the model is a five-layer sandwich beam with a constant moving load. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used as functionally graded (FG) distributions as reinforcements for the core. Mantari’s higher-order shear deformation theory is also used for displacement fields. The governing equations were derived using the Hamilton principle. The Laplace method is used to obtain the exact solution of the dynamic response of the sandwich beam in both longitudinal and transverse directions. For validation, the natural frequency is compared with previous research. In the following, parameters such as voltage, thickness ratio, the volume fraction of CNTs, and velocity of moving load on the dynamic response of piezoelectric sandwich beams in transverse and axial displacement are investigated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A serious limitation of current adeno-associated viral (AAV) capsids employed for subretinal delivery is achieving adequate lateral spread beyond the injection site, required for the efficient delivery of gene therapy to the outer retina and/or RPE. AAVBR1 is a unique AAV with exceptional tropism for CNS microvasculature following systemic delivery. Here, we used in vivo and ex vivo analysis to show that subretinal delivery of AAVBR1.GFP in mice achieves superior tropism to RPE and outer retina than either AAV2.GFP or AAV8.GFP, two of the most common capsids used for subretinal delivery. At a low (5 × 108 vg) subretinal dose, the AAVBR1.GFP signal was visible by 48 h and significantly surpassed peak fluorescence of other AAVs in retina and RPE. The co-injection of AAVBR1.GFP with the AAVBR1-specific heptapeptide, NRGTEWD, significantly blocked the AAVBR1.GFP signal, but had no effect on AAV2.GFP fluorescence, confirming that AAVBR1’s enhanced tropism for RPE and outer retina derives from this 7AA modification within the capsid-binding motif. Enhanced dispersal and consequent transduction suggest that AAVBR1 can be employed at a lower dosage than the standard AAV2 capsid to achieve equivalent expression for gene therapy, warranting further evaluation of its utility as a therapeutic vehicle for subretinal delivery.</jats:p>"

The open cavity is fabricated through splicing two segments of a single mode fiber (SMF-28) at lateral offsets. The lateral offset is matched to the radius of the microsphere to maximize their coupling and allow for an increased sensing response. Furthermore, the microsphere can be moved along the open-air cavity to allow for tuning of the reflection spectrum. The multiple passes of the FPI enabled by the high refractive index microsphere results in a 40 dB enhancement of finesse and achieves broadband ultrasound sensing from 0.1–45.6 MHz driven via a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) centered at 3.7 MHz. The goal is to achieve frequency detection in the MHz range using a repeatable, cost effective, and easy to fabricate FPI sensor design.</jats:p>"

Conventional custom-made post and core is constructed in the laboratory with very limited material either gold, nickel-chromium or cobalt-chromium. Apart from higher modulus elasticity compared to dentin, the colour of the conventional custom-made post and core was also unaesthetic making it inferior to be used with all ceramic crown. This article describes post and core fabrication technique using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology with acrylic resin pattern build-up and indirect digitalisation method. The same procedure for custom-made metal post and core was adopted in this case to capture the anatomical shape of the root canal before digital technology was incorporated in the fabrication of post and core manufacture using CAD/CAM. With the CAD/CAM approach, an increased in quality, productivity, workflow efficiency and consistency of prosthetic rehabilitation may be obtained. It also enables clinicians to fabricate post and core using tooth colour material with better physical properties and improved mechanical qualities to achieve the best result in restoring endodontically treated teeth.</jats:p>"

This often obscures the true biomass and potential functions of fungi in the community. Therefore, we presented a high-throughput absolute quantification (HAQ) method to quantitatively estimate the fungal abundance in Daqu. In this study, five internal standard plasmids (ISPs) were designed for the fungal ITS2 subregion with high length variations. Five ISPs were then utilised to establish standard curves with a quantitative concentration range of 103–107 cells/g, and this was used to quantify the core fungi, including Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Mucoromycota. Using three types of mature Daqu from different regions, we demonstrated that the HAQ method yielded community profiles substantially different from those derived using relative abundances. Then, the HAQ method was applied to the Daqu during fermentation. The initial formation of the Daqu surface occurred in the fourth stage, which was mainly driven by moisture. The key fungi that caused the initial formation of the Daqu surface included Hyphopichia burtonii, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, and Pichia kudriavzevii. The initial formation of the Daqu core occurred in the fifth stage, which was mainly affected by moisture and reducing the sugar content. The key fungi that cause the initial formation of the Daqu core included S. fibuligera and Paecilomyces verrucosus. We conclude that the HAQ method, when applied to ITS2 gene fungal community profiling, is quantitative and that its use will greatly improve our understanding of the fungal ecosystem in Daqu.</jats:p>"

The estimated prevalence globally of DPN is 13-68%.[3] Around 50% of diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffer from neuropathy. DPN disturbs the sensory and motor control system which eventually generation and control of the gait. Gait mechanics may be affected as a result. Reduce ROM, muscle strength and changes in gait mechanics [gait cycle, reduced cadence and gait speed] can lead to reduce mobility and increase fall of risk. Sensory and motor deficit are affected due to somatosensory changes which lead to continuous falling during activities of daily living.\nAim: To study the effect of balance and core strengthening exercise on fall, activities of daily living and quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\nMethodology: The nature of the study and the intervention were explained to the participants. Their informed written consent were taken. 51 participants were selected based on the selection criteria. Prior and after the treatment the outcome measures that is Fall efficacy scale, Instrumental activities of daily living and Nottingham health profile were taken. Intervention protocol was given for 1 hour, 3 times a week for 4 weeks.\nOutcome measures: Prior and after the treatment both the outcome measures, Fall efficacy scale, Instrumental activities of daily living and Nottingham health profile were taken.\nResults: In reference to the results of the Wilcoxon test analysis at 5% significance level, there is a significant statistical reliable difference between the pre &amp; post treatment values with p-value is less than the 5% significance level (i.e., 0.001 &lt; 0.05) in the study and therefore it justifies the improvements in health outcome post intervention.\nConclusion: The present study concluded that balance exercises and core strengthening exercises proved to be beneficial for fall prevention and improving activities of daily living and quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nKey words: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Core strengthening, Balance, Risk of fall, Activities of daily living, Quality of life.</jats:p>"

As annealed (at a critical temperature 573 K in H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gas), a refined powder (in glycine) grows on <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>-MnBi seeds (crystallites) present in it at Mn/Bi atoms order over topological layers, preferentially along (110) planes, at a self-confined structure at seeds of an anisotropic shape of hexagonal (h) plates (25–85 nm widths). In terms of the HRTEM images, the atoms turn down at edges (at the plates grow up) in a spiral layer, ≤ 2.1 nm thickness, of small core–shells. A spin model is proposed to delineate a way at the spins can pin down at the edges, form single magnetic domains, and raise coercivity (<jats:italic>H</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>c</jats:sub>), with no much loss of net magnetic moment.

All the tested peptides displayed antimicrobial properties. We discovered a number of short AMP-derived peptides with high antimicrobial activity both against human and plant pathogens. For the first time, antimicrobial activity was revealed in the peptides designed from the 4-Cys-containing defensin-like peptides, whose role in plant immunity has remained unknown, as well as the knottin-like peptide and the C-terminal prodomain of the thionin, which points to the direct involvement of these peptides in defense mechanisms. Studies of the mode of action of the eight most active γ-core motif peptides on yeast cells using staining with propidium iodide showed that all of them induced membrane permeabilization leading to cell lysis. In addition to identification of the antimicrobial determinants in plant AMPs, this work provides short candidate peptide molecules for the development of novel drugs effective against opportunistic fungal infections and biopesticides to control plant pathogens.</jats:p>"

The HNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> pre-treatment on Teflon-coated GDLs can slightly increase hydrophilicity (introduces C-O bonds) resulting in enhancement of the ORR/OER activities of Mn@Mn<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/Vulcan carbon GDEs and the polarization curves are identical regardless of Teflon loading.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to improve the catalytic activity and durability of Mn@Mn<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/C GDEs, we explored a set of different carbon additive combinations. Among the different combinations, graphene/Vulcan (1:1) reached the longest lifespan and the ORR/OER overpotentials of Mn@Mn<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/Vulcan/graphene (before degradation) were as low as that of the Pt/C-IrO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-Vulcan-graphene benchmark.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since MnO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> can be irreversibly activated or passivated, it is necessary to exercise caution when polarizing a pristine Mn@Mn<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/Vulcan/graphene GDE in the first few cycles. For the design of activation protocols, different polarization methods were used, i.e., fast/slow cyclic voltammetry (CV) in different potential ranges or cycling under constant currents (CC) or constant potentials (CP). The highest catalytic activity was achieved by a CV-activated GDE that was obtained by cycling between the ORR and OER-related potentials at a slow scan rate of 1 mV s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. This better performance might be due to the potential-driven MnO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> phase transitions that develop R/α/γ type structures. Figure 1 shows the effect of different electrochemical protocols on the GDE. In comparison to the CC and CP-activated GDEs, it has a lower Mn site average oxidation state (AOS) of 3.1 and a larger contact angle, which suggests a higher population of Mn(III) active sites and OER-improved electrode wetting properties.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>By systematically tuning the carbon components and activation protocols, we found the ORR/OER performance of Mn@Mn<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/C GDEs can be much improved when using Vulcan/graphene (1:1) additives, HNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-treated wetproofed GDL, and applying cyclic voltammetry between ORR and OER-related potentials at a slow scan rate. Although this work focuses on improving MnO<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>/C GDEs, the developed approaches can also help establish protocols for reaching the full scope of other transition-metal-based electrodes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"1228fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>",

The reported fiber structure is capable of supporting a large number of modes and influences to be favorable for high capacity, less crosstalk in the area of mode division multiplexing, and Internet of Things (IoT) compatible communications. To ensure the efficiency of the described structure, many characteristics such as V‐parameter, birefringence, sensitivity response, and confinement loss are analyzed. The investigation results are obtained from the offered structure by taking 22 distinct eigenmodes and the wavelength range from 1.54 to 1.7 μm. The evaluation of the numerical analysis shows the confinement loss of less than 2.85 × 10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup> dB/m, the sensitivity response of 80,757.73292 nm/RIU. These are, to the best of our knowledge, the maximum responses received in this trade. IoT‐based technologies allow networked tools to communicate, sense, and interact with each other. Where the wireless networks are harsh to operate on the ecological surroundings, the optical technology as fiber optic cables delivers the best resources of handling data and transferring it from one place to another effectively.</jats:p>",

We identified 1187 upregulated differentially expressed genes (foldchange &gt; 2, false discovery rate &lt; 0.05) in keloids, which were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix organization and bone/cartilage development, with significantly increased expression of bone/cartilage‐associated collagens (COL5A1, COL10A1, and COL11A1) and glycoproteins (ACAN, COMP, and SPARC). Deconvolution analysis also revealed significantly increased composition of osteoblasts in keloid dermis. A total of 92 upregulated transcription factors were screened out from differentially expressed genes and mainly enriched in transcription process and skeleton development. Additional sequencing of six keloid individuals with multiple regions and intersection further narrow the list with 10 transcription factors. Finally, AEBP1, CREB3L1, RUNX2, and ZNF469 have been identified as candidate core regulators in promoting the gaining of bone/cartilage‐like characteristics in keloids. RNA‐sequencing of full‐skin keloids consolidated the existence of these four transcription factors. Immunohistochemistry was employed to verify the expression of AEBP1, CREB3L1, RUNX2, and ZNF469 in keloid fibroblasts. In conclusion, we bioinformatically discovered the increased expression of bone/cartilage‐associated genes and candidate core transcription factors in keloids. Our findings promise to provide molecular clues to develop novel therapeutic modalities against skin fibrosis.</jats:p>",

Here, a microfluidic spinning strategy with special designed coaxial‐like needles is developed to fabricate conductive fibers with multi‐model strain sensing properties. The coaxial‐like needle can regulate the fiber's structure and characteristics by adjusting the meeting point of core and sheath solution. First, a polyaniline (PANI)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)‐based blended composite fiber (PTBF) with unique hollow‐porous morphology is prepared. The PTBF fibrous sensors with 30 wt.% PANI obtain a large strain range (50% strain), while the PTBFs with 50 wt.% PANI possess a high sensitivity (gauge factor of 160). On this basis, a PANI/TPU‐based core–sheath composite fiber (PTCF) is fabricated by changing the core and sheath solutions. PTCFs exhibit satisfactory multi‐model strain sensing capabilities, including tensile, bending, and pressure. The results show that the resistance of PTCF is extremely sensitive to tensile deformation. The PTCF‐based fibrous sensor can also detect 0–180° bending strains and 0.1–2 N pressure strains. The multi‐model strain sensor can be used in motion monitoring, gesture discrimination, finger‐pressure recognition, and flexible circuit switches. This work may provide a foundation for the direct integration of fiber‐based strain sensors into smart clothing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Living organisms constantly need to adapt to their surrounding environment and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to deal with stress. Mitochondria and lysosomes are central organelles in the response to energy and nutrient availability within a cell and act through interconnected mechanisms. However, when such processes become overwhelmed, it can lead to pathologies. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder (NDD) characterized by proteinaceous intracellular inclusions and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, which causes motor and non-motor symptoms. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the disease etiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been recognized as a hallmark of PD pathogenesis, and several aspects of mitochondrial biology are impaired in PD patients and models. In addition, defects of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway have extensively been observed in cell and animal models as well as PD patients’ brains, where constitutive autophagy is indispensable for adaptation to stress and energy deficiency. Genetic and molecular studies have shown that the functions of mitochondria and lysosomal compartments are tightly linked and influence each other. Connections between these organelles are constituted among others by mitophagy, organellar dynamics and cellular signaling cascades, such as calcium (Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling and the activation of transcription factors. Members of the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family (MiT), including MITF, TFE3 and TFEB, play a central role in regulating cellular homeostasis in response to metabolic pressure and are considered master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis. As such, they are part of the interconnection between mitochondria and lysosome functions and therefore represent attractive targets for therapeutic approaches against NDD, including PD. The activation of MiT transcription factors through genetic and pharmacological approaches have shown encouraging results at ameliorating PD-related phenotypes in in vitro and in vivo models. In this review, we summarize the relationship between mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal functions in the context of PD etiology and focus on the role of the MiT pathway and its potential as pharmacological target against PD.</jats:p>",

This study finds a decreasing trend in TC inner‐core rain rate over the western North Pacific (WNP) from 1998 to 2019. This basinwide trend is mainly induced by the decreasing TC inner‐core rain rates over the region west of 150°E, while it is seldom linked to the changes in the distribution of TC occurrence. The maximum decreases in TC inner‐core rain rate are observed over the offshore areas along the coastlines of East Asia. Further analysis reveals that the change in atmospheric stability, referred to as a dominant environmental contributor to basinwide TC inner‐core rain rate decreases shown in previous studies, only has a primary impact over the northern South China Sea. By comparison, there is a positive correlation between the variations of the aerosol optical depth and TC inner‐core rain rate over the mid‐latitude regions extending from the East China Sea to Japan. Our result highlights the linkage of the recent decreasing trends in aerosol optical depth and TC inner‐core rain rate over the WNP.</jats:p>",

Still, its role in protein function is not fully understood. The PAN domain was initially characterized in numerous proteins, including HGF. Dysregulation of HGF-mediated signaling results in multiple deadly cancers. The binding of HGF to its cell surface receptor, c-MET, triggers all biological impacts. Here, we show that mutating four core cysteine residues in the HGF PAN domain reduces c-MET interaction, subsequent c-MET autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of its downstream targets, perinuclear localization, cellular internalization of HGF, and its receptor, c-MET, and c-MET ubiquitination. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of HGF/c-MET signaling-related genes involved in cancer progression, invasion, metastasis, and cell survival were impaired. Thus, targeting the PAN domain of HGF may represent a mechanism for selectively regulating the binding and activation of the c-MET pathway.</jats:p>"

Drawing on a case study of program-wide redesign, we show that promoting coherence requires more than just maximizing unity (instructors’ agreement on means and ends). It also requires addressing conflict and recognizing fragmentation in ways that support what we term “pathway flexibility.” By highlighting the interplay of unity, conflict, and fragmentation, we offer a set of conceptual tools to understand and support the development of program coherence in teacher education. </jats:p>",

Little is known about the physiological correlates of affective stress in teachers. This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between core self-evaluation and adverse psychological and physiological stress outcomes in 42 teachers. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess core self-evaluation, vital exhaustion, and resignation tendency. The concentration of cortisol was assessed using hair samples. One year after the initial measurement, vital exhaustion and hair cortisol were assessed again. Path-analytic mediational models showed that core self-evaluation strongly predicted vital exhaustion, and resignation tendency partially mediated this relationship. However, core self-evaluation did not predict hair cortisol concentration. These findings suggest that core self-evaluation plays a crucial role in preventing vital exhaustion among teachers. A positive core self-evaluation seems beneficial for teachers’ primary and secondary appraisal and an essential resource for the long-term prevention of self-reported vital exhaustion.</jats:p>"

Infauna play crucial roles in shaping sedimentary structures, relocating organic matter, porewater chemistry, and hence biogeochemical cycles. However, the visualization and quantification of infauna in situ inside deep-sea sediment has been challenging, due to their sparse distribution and that deep-sea cameras do not visualize animals living below the sediment surface. Here, we newly developed a 3D acoustic “coring” system and applied it to visualize and detect burrowing bivalves in deep-sea sediments. The in situ acoustic observation was conducted at a dense colony of vesicomyid clams in a hydrocarbon seep in Sagami Bay, Japan, focusing on a patch of juvenile clams with a completely infaunal life style. We clearly observed strong backscatters from the top and lower edges of animals in our 3D acoustic data. At least 17 reflectors were identified in the survey area (625 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), interpreted to correspond to living clams. The estimated depths of the lower edge of clams ranged between 41 and 98 mm. The acoustic system presented here is effective for detecting and monitoring infauna with calcified exoskeletons. This novel tool will help us better assess and understand the distribution of deep-sea infauna, particularly those groups with hard exoskeletons, as well as biogeochemical cycles.</jats:p>"

Some of these bacteria have immunomodulatory effects on the host and are able to improve resistance against different pathogens, including viruses. However, to date, the bacterial genes involved in the immunomodulatory effect are not known. In this work, the complete genomes of L. plantarum MPL16, CRL1506, CRL681 and TL2766 were used to perform comparative genomics with the aim of identifying the genes involved in their differential immunomodulatory effects. L. plantarum WCFS1, a strain with proven probiotic activity, was also used for comparisons. The analysis of the genes involved in the metabolic pathways of the five strains did not reveal differences in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, cofactors and vitamins, nor in the genes associated with energy metabolism or the biosynthesis of lipoproteins and teichoic acids. However, differences were found between the five strains when considering carbohydrate metabolism pathways, particularly in the presence/absence of glycosylhydrolases and glycosyltransferases. In addition, a great variability was detected in the predicted surface proteins of each L. plantarum strain. These results suggest that the surface molecules expressed in the different strains of L. plantarum could be involved in their differential ability to modulate the innate antiviral immune response.</jats:p>"

As our knowledge of mechanical ventilation (MV) improved, so did the need to study patient-ventilator interactions and weaning predictors. Randomized trials have evaluated the use of protocol-based weaning (vs. usual care) to study the duration of MV in ICUs, different techniques to conduct spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and strategies to eventually extubate a patient whose initial SBT failed. Despite considerable milestones in the management of multiple diseases contributing to reversible respiratory failure, in the application of early rehabilitative interventions to preserve muscle integrity, and in ventilator technology that mitigates against ventilator injury and dyssynchrony, major barriers to successful liberation from MV persist. This review provides a broad encompassing view of weaning classification, causes of weaning failure, and evidence behind weaning predictors and weaning modes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The evolutionary conserved ESCRT-III complex is a device for membrane remodelling in various cellular processes, such as the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), cytokinesis, and membrane repair. The common theme of all these processes is the abscission of membrane away from the cytosol. At its heart in Drosophila is Shrub, CHMP4 in humans, which dynamically polymerises into filaments through electrostatic interactions among the protomers. For the full activity, Shrub/CHMP4 requires physical interaction with members of the Lgd protein family. This interaction is mediated by the odd-numbered DM14 domains of Lgd, which bind to the negative interaction surface of Shrub. While only one Lgd and one Shrub exist in the genome of Drosophila, mammals have two Lgd orthologs, LGD1/CC2D1B and LGD2/CC2D1A, as well as three CHMP4s in their genomes, CHMP4A, CHMP4B, and CHMP4C. The rationale for the diversification of the ESCRT components is not understood. We here use Drosophila as a model system to analyse the activity of the human orthologs of Shrub and Lgd at an organismal level. This enabled us to use the plethora of available techniques available for Drosophila. We present evidence that CHMP4B is the true ortholog of Shrub, while CHMP4A and CHMP4C have diverging activities. Nevertheless, CHMP4A and CHMP4C can enhance the activity of CHMP4B, raising the possibility that they can form heteropolymers in vivo. Our structure-function analysis of the LGD1 and LGD2 indicates that the C2 domain of the LGD proteins has a specific function beyond protein stability and subcellular localisation. Moreover, our data specify that CHMP4B interacts more efficiently with LGD1 than with LGD2.</jats:p>"

The protrusion‐like RuNi alloy shells with accessible channels and abundant defects possess a large surface area and can optimize the surface electronic structure through the electron transfer from Ni to Ru. Moreover, the unique 1D hollow structure can effectively stabilize RuNi alloy shell through preventing the aggregation of nanoparticles.

Totally, 13 GBs were formed by directional solidification using multi-seeds with controlled crystal orientations. vGB was evaluated directly from photoluminescence intensity profiles across GBs using a pre-trained machine learning model, which allowed a quantitative and continuous evaluation along GBs. The evaluation results indicated that the impact of θ on vGB would be relatively large among the three macroscopic parameters. In addition, the results for the Σ5 and Σ13 GBs suggested that the minimum vGB would be related to the GB energy. These results were discussed in terms of the complexity of the local reconstruction of GB structures. The deviation would make a more complex reconstructed GB structure with local distortion, resulting in an increase in the electrical activity of GBs. The obtained knowledge will contribute to improving various polycrystalline materials through a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between GB structures and their properties.</jats:p>",

The radio filament spans 200 kpc and aligns with a sloshing cold front seen in the X-rays, staying inside the front in projection. The radio spectral index along the filament appears uniform (within large uncertainties) at <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> ≃ −1.5. We propose that the radio galaxy is located outside the cold front but dips its tail under the front. The tangential wind that blows there may stretch the radio plasma from the radio galaxy into a filamentary structure. Some reacceleration is needed in this scenario to keep the radio spectrum uniform. Alternatively, the cosmic-ray electrons from that spot in the tail can spread along the cluster magnetic field lines, straightened by that same tangential flow, via anomalously fast diffusion. Our radio filament can provide constraints on this process. We also uncover a compact radio source at the brightest cluster galaxy that is 2–3 orders of magnitude less luminous than those in typical cluster central galaxies—probably an example of a brightest cluster galaxy starved of accretion fuel by gas sloshing.</jats:p>",

The structures of composite were confirmed by FTIR, UV–Vis, XRD and XPS. Mott–Schottky analysis was used to study the p-n heterojunction structure.

The results showed that PEDOS films uniformly grew on ZnO NRs surface and core–shell structure was formed. The p-n heterojunction structure was formed with strong built-in electric field between ZnO NRs and PEDOS. Under the irradiation of UV light, the device showed a good rectification behavior.

But, the doping effect on the structural stability across different elements has not been modeled within the scope of a bigger picture. Therefore, in this work, the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S–nanoalloy complexes with different doping metal atoms have been investigated to elucidate the effects of the dopant on the structures. Indicated by simplified model complexes and density functional theory (DFT) simulation results, the zinc group atoms as dopants may be influenced by surrounded gold atoms, and binding to the thiolate units is enhanced by the addition of gold atoms. The reactivity of the zinc group atoms may be activated by a gold nanocluster. The simulated zinc group data when combined with the gold group and platinum group data can be summarized in the perspective of balance between the ligand–core binding and core cohesive energies. Most dopants move the modeled nanoclusters away from the balance, especially when the metal atom replaced the gold atom in gold–sulfur bindings. Besides, when cores of the nanoclusters are dominated by gold atoms, the dopants may achieve “saturation” such that the balance in the doped clusters may be corrected. This work provides a simple profile to understand the internal shift of the structure introduced by the atomically precise method. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present study determined the independent contributions of temperature, strong ion difference ([SID]), total weak acid concentration ([Atot]) and PCO2 to changes in arterial and mixed venous [H+] and total carbon dioxide concentration ([TCO2]) during 37 min of moderate intensity exercise (~50% of heart rate max) and the first 60 min of recovery. Six horses were fitted with indwelling carotid and pulmonary artery (PA) catheters, had PA temperature measured, and had blood samples withdrawn for immediate analysis of plasma ion and gas concentrations. The increase in core temperature during exercise (+4.5 °C; p &lt; 0.001) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased PO2, PCO2, and [H+], but without a significant effect on [TCO2] (p &gt; 0.01). The physicochemical acid-base approach was used to determine contributions of independent variables (except temperature) to the changes in [H+] and [TCO2]. In both arterial and venous blood, there was no acidosis during exercise and recovery despite significant (p &lt; 0.05) increases in [lactate] and in venous PCO2. In arterial blood plasma, a mild alkalosis with exercise was due to primarily to a decrease in PCO2 (p &lt; 0.05) and an increase in [SID] (p &lt; 0.1). In venous blood plasma, a near absence of change in [H+] was due to the acidifying effects of increased PCO2 (p &lt; 0.01) being offset by the alkalizing effects of increased [SID] (p &lt; 0.05). The effect of temperature on PO2 (p &lt; 0.001) resulted in an increased arterio-venous PO2 difference (p &lt; 0.001) that would facilitate O2 transfer to contracting muscle. The simultaneous changes in the PCO2 and the concentrations of the other independent acid-base variables (contributions from individual strong and weak ions as manifest in [SID] and [Atot]) show complex, multilevel control of acid-base states in horses performing even moderate intensity exercise. Correction of acid-base variables to core body temperature presents a markedly different physiological response to exercise than that provided by variables measured and presented at an instrument temperature of 37 °C.</jats:p>"

The guest binding reverses the relative stability between the right‐ and left‐handed NCs upon a steric interaction with the chiral ligand DHLA in the exterior shell in a kinetic manner, leading to unprecedented chirality inversion in the synthesis of NCs. This mechanism is further extended to the self‐regulation or self‐replication of chirality through interNC interactions dependent on the concentration in the synthesis of NCs.</jats:p>",

There is growing evidence that mutations in components of the spliceosome are a major cause for MFD. Genetic variants affecting the function of several core splicing factors, namely SF3B4, SF3B2, EFTUD2, SNRPB and TXNL4A, are responsible for MFD in five related but distinct syndromes known as Nager and Rodriguez syndromes (NRS), craniofacial microsomia (CFM), mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM), cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS) and Burn–McKeown syndrome (BMKS), respectively. Animal models of NRS and MFDM indicate that MFD results from an early depletion of neural crest progenitors through a mechanism that involves apoptosis. Here we characterize the knockdown phenotype of Eftud2, Snrpb and Txnl4a in Xenopus embryos at different stages of neural crest and craniofacial development. Our results point to defects in cranial neural crest cell formation as the likely culprit for MFD associated with EFTUD2, SNRPB and TXNL4A haploinsufficiency, and suggest a commonality in the etiology of these craniofacial spliceosomopathies.</jats:p>"

Results were presented in the form vaccine effectiveness (VE) and 95% confidence interval. A total of 1,460,458 observations were analyzed. Overall, the two-dose heterologous prime-boost, ChAdOx1 + BNT162b2 and CoronaVac + BNT162b2, manifested the largest protection level (79.9% (74.0–84.5%) and 74.7% (62.8–82.8%)) and remained stable over the whole study course. The three-dose schedules (CoronaVac + CoronaVac + ChAdOx1, and CoronaVac + CoronaVac + BNT162b2) expressed very high degree of VE estimate (above 80.0% at any time interval). Concerning severe infection, almost all regimens displayed very high VE estimate. For the two-dose schedules, heterologous prime-boost regimens seemed to have slightly better protection for severe infection relative to homologous regimens. Campaigns to expedite the rollout of third-dose booster shot should be carried out. Heterologous prime-boost regimens should be considered as an option to enhance protection for the entire population.</jats:p>"

Novel types of flexible PMMA/Au/Alq<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/LiF/Al structures were obtained starting from electrospun polymer fibers. Thus, using an electrospinning process poly (methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) nanofibers were fabricated.

The next steps consisted of the thermal evaporation of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) and aluminum deposition as the cathode. The Au covered PMMA nanofiber layer had a similar behavior with an indium tin oxide film i.e. low sheet resistance 10.6 Ω/sq and high transparency.

This then has made the mechanism of their biosilicification interesting to be a research subject. The classical theory states that the silica metabolism has been originated from the absorption of silicate ions, which might not give a suitable explanation for the solid silica silicification. In this study, mono-disperse Si/SiO2 fluorescent submicron-spheres were synthesized in aqueous solution, and applied in monitoring the extracellular solid silica accumulation of Chaetoceros sp. diatom. The Si/SiO2 submicron particles emitted light-blue color with the spectrum centered at 440 nm under the excitation of 365 nm UV light, similar to the typical excitation/emission pair of the DAPI fluorophore (excitation/emission: 358 nm/461 nm).  The fluorescence-microscopic investigation showed that the Si/SiO2 particles delocalized on the diatoms’ surface and increased a silicic-acid-level surrounding the microalgae. As a consequence, the growth rate of the diatoms increased as the concentration of the SiO2 particles was at 120 mg/L, and reached 1.5 times higher than the growth rate calculated from the F2 media. The study not only introduces a new aspect to the extracellular metabolism of microalgae biosilicification corresponding to the global silica cycle, but also presents a new-type of culturing media using SiO2 nanoparticles for diatom cultivation, which increases the growth rate of artificial diatom-culturing for further applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Core switching on different links in optical networks enables network operators to allocate network resources more flexibly, so as to reduce the network request blocking ratio under limited resources. Facing a differentiated network environment and diversified user demands, network operators need to optimize multiple objectives that are independent and diversionary of each other, and to provide multiple resource allocation schemes whose objective values do not dominate each other. For the static routing, spectrum, and core assignment (RSCA) problem in elastic optical networks with multi-core fiber (MCF-EONs), there is no literature that simultaneously considers core switching and multiobjective optimization algorithms. This paper improves the existing models and algorithms to adapt to the RSCA problem. In this paper, the RSCA problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model to minimize both network request blocking and crosstalk ratios simultaneously by considering core switching and inter-core crosstalk. To solve the model efficiently, we, therefore, design a joint routing and core coding scheme supporting core switching and propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with adaptation and multi-strategy fusion (MOEA/D-AMSF), which integrates the new mechanisms of hybrid initial population generation, adaptive crossover, and double-layer and multi-point mutation in different iteration stages. These new mechanisms accelerate algorithm convergence and enhance solution diversity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain more dominated and diverse solutions compared with the existing multiobjective algorithm without considering core switching.</jats:p>"

The attention on Shariah contract requirements which is the parameter in Islamic core banking system and its capability on achieving objectives of Shariah is still lacking. Apart from banking institutions’ reluctancy to try Islamic core banking system which its functionalities are yet to be proven, the studies on the development of core banking system under Malaysia’s Islamic finance legal framework is still limited that lead to Shariah compliance aspect being seen as irrelevant if it involves technology in nowadays digital banking era. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to identify suitable methodology for its development in Malaysia, to examine existing practices on its development, to analyses its capability in achieving objective of Shariah in Islamic banking, and to evaluate the prospect of its integration with Shariah contract requirements, blockchain technology and smart contract. The discussion in this article is fully based on library research and analysed via thematic content analysis. This article found that the previous studies have yet to examine methodology of its development under Islamic Financial Services Act 2013, current practices on its development, its capability as means to achieve objective of Shariah in Islamic banking, and its capability from Shariah compliance aspect aside from sustaining or enhancing its basic capability as one of the Islamic banking technologies in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

However, high-resolution archives are scarce due to associated sampling and analytical difficulty. In this study, a modern long-lived massive coral skeleton (<jats:italic>Porites lobata</jats:italic>) from Lanyu Islet off southeast Taiwan was drilled and used for high-resolution major/trace element analyses, including trace elements B and δ<jats:sup>11</jats:sup>B, as well as oxygen and carbon isotopes, to investigate the associated environmental changes during 1991–1997. To avoid complicated biological influence, the top-most tissue layer was excluded in this study. The coralline records show a clear temporal trend in metal/Ca-based sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on annual and monthly timescales. In particular, the Mg/Ca-SSTs, the most sensitive temperature proxy at the site, show a significant warming trend (+0.2°C year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) during the study period. On the other hand, subtle changes in the annual δ<jats:sup>11</jats:sup>B record were identified, corresponding to ~0.2 pH unit, which is comparable with other coral records in the Pacific, e.g., the South China Sea (SCS), Guam Island, Flinders, and Arlington Reef, as well as the <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> seawater pH measurement at Hawaii station.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The retina, the accessible part of the central nervous system, has served as a model system to study the relationship between energy utilization and metabolite supply. When the metabolite supply cannot match the energy demand, retinal neurons are at risk of death. As the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells, mitochondria play a pivotal role in generating ATP, produce precursors for macromolecules, maintain the redox homeostasis, and function as waste management centers for various types of metabolic intermediates. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathologies of a number of degenerative retinal diseases. It is well known that photoreceptors are particularly vulnerable to mutations affecting mitochondrial function due to their high energy demand and susceptibility to oxidative stress. However, it is unclear how defective mitochondria affect other retinal neurons. Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1) is the major transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and loss of Nrf1 leads to defective mitochondria biogenesis and eventually cell death. Here, we investigated how different retinal neurons respond to the loss of Nrf1. We provide in vivo evidence that the disruption of Nrf1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis results in a slow, progressive degeneration of all retinal cell types examined, although they present different sensitivity to the deletion of Nrf1, which implicates differential energy demand and utilization, as well as tolerance to mitochondria defects in different neuronal cells. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis on rod-specific Nrf1 deletion uncovered a previously unknown role of Nrf1 in maintaining genome stability.</jats:p>"

A particular category of biostimulants are protein hydrolyzates (PH), obtained from microbial cultures grown on a nutrient medium. In the present study, Paecilomyces lilacinus 112, an endophytic fungus isolated from soil, was tested to determine its effect on the growth promotion of tomato seedlings in greenhouse conditions. Additionally, other beneficial features of the P.lilacinus isolate were evaluated via several tests: antagonism against plant pathogenic fungi, production of secondary useful metabolites, and solubilization of vital micronutrients. Out of the tested pathogens, P.lilacinus exhibited the highest antifungal activity against a Cladosporium isolate (inhibition of 66.3%), followed by Rhizoctonia. solani (52.53%), and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (50.23%). Paecilomyceslilacinus 112 was able to secrete hydrolytic enzymes and siderophores, and solubilize zinc and phosphorus. In the tomato treatment, the application of PH obtained from fungal cultivation on a feather medium led to the following increases in plant growth parameters: 3.54-fold in plant biomass; 3.26-fold in plant height, 1.28-fold in plant diameter; 1.5-fold in the number of branches/plant; and 1.43-fold in the number of leaves/plant, as compared to water treatment. The application of this isolate can be of benefit to bioeconomy because keratin wastes are valorized and returned, in agriculture, contributing to renewable natural resources.</jats:p>"

The porous structure makes the sensor flexible and gas permeable, increases the surface area, and leads to high sensitivity. The sensor has a high sensitivity of 640 000% in the relative‐humidity range of over 40–100%, together with a gas permeability similar to that of an open environment. The gas permeability suppresses the skin inflammation, endows natural evaporation of sweat, and brings an identical condition with bare skin.

Data were derived from a large collaborative cohort in Greece. Included individuals were adults who started ART, in or after 2010, while previously ART naïve and achieved virologic response within the first year of ART. Data were analysed using mixed fractional polynomial models. INSTI regimens led to the more pronounced BMI increases, followed by boosted PI and NNRTI based regimens. Individuals with normal initial BMI are expected to gain 6 kg with an INSTI regimen compared to 4 kg with a boosted PI and less than 3 kg with a NNRTI regimen after four years of treatment. Prevalence of obesity was 5.7% at ART initiation and 12.2%, 14.2% and 18.1% after four years of treatment with NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs, respectively. Dolutegravir or Raltegravir were associated with marginally faster BMI increase compared to Elvitegravir. INSTIs are associated with faster weight gain. INSTIs’ increased risk of treatment emergent obesity and, possibly, weight-related co-morbidities should be judged against their improved efficacy and tolerability but increased clinical attention is required.</jats:p>"

One particular compound, 11o, showed high binding activities (hA2A Ki = 13.3 nM; hA1 Ki = 55 nM) and full antagonism (hA2A IC50 = 136 nM; hA1 IC50 = 98.8 nM) toward both receptors. Further tests showed that 11o has low hepatic clearance and good pharmacokinetic properties in mice, along with high bioavailability and a high brain plasma ratio. In addition, 11o was associated with very low cardiovascular risk and mutagenic potential, and was well-tolerated in rats and dogs. When tested in an MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, 11o tended to improve behavior. Moreover, 11o dose-dependently reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy in female rats, with graded ED50 of between 3 and 10 mg/kg. Taken together, these results suggest that this potent dual A2A/A1 receptor antagonist, 11o, is a good candidate for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease with an excellent metabolic and safety profile.</jats:p>"

Prior studies have augmented feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent connections to study their role in visual processing; however, often these recurrent networks are optimized directly on neural data or the comparative metrics used are undefined for standard feedforward networks that lack these connections. In this work, we develop task-optimized convolutional recurrent (ConvRNN) network models that more correctly mimic the timing and gross neuroanatomy of the ventral pathway. Properly chosen intermediate-depth ConvRNN circuit architectures, which incorporate mechanisms of feedforward bypassing and recurrent gating, can achieve high performance on a core recognition task, comparable to that of much deeper feedforward networks. We then develop methods that allow us to compare both CNNs and ConvRNNs to finely grained measurements of primate categorization behavior and neural response trajectories across thousands of stimuli. We find that high-performing ConvRNNs provide a better match to these data than feedforward networks of any depth, predicting the precise timings at which each stimulus is behaviorally decoded from neural activation patterns. Moreover, these ConvRNN circuits consistently produce quantitatively accurate predictions of neural dynamics from V4 and IT across the entire stimulus presentation. In fact, we find that the highest-performing ConvRNNs, which best match neural and behavioral data, also achieve a strong Pareto trade-off between task performance and overall network size. Taken together, our results suggest the functional purpose of recurrence in the ventral pathway is to fit a high-performing network in cortex, attaining computational power through temporal rather than spatial complexity.</jats:p>",

The injection of sulfur into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions is the\ndominant driver of natural climate variability on\ninterannual to multidecadal timescales. Based on a set of continuous sulfate\nand sulfur records from a suite of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica,\nthe HolVol v.1.0 database includes estimates of the magnitudes and\napproximate source latitudes of major volcanic stratospheric sulfur\ninjection (VSSI) events for the Holocene (from 9500 BCE or 11 500 years BP to\n1900 CE), constituting an extension of the previous record by 7000 years.\nThe database incorporates new-generation ice-core aerosol records with a\nsub-annual temporal resolution and a demonstrated sub-decadal dating accuracy\nand precision. By tightly aligning and stacking the ice-core records on the\nWD2014 chronology from Antarctica, we resolve long-standing inconsistencies\nin the dating of ancient volcanic eruptions that arise from biased (i.e.,\ndated too old) ice-core chronologies over the Holocene for Greenland. We\nreconstruct a total of 850 volcanic eruptions with injections in excess of 1 teragram of sulfur (Tg S); of these eruptions, 329 (39 %) are located in the low latitudes with bipolar\nsulfate deposition, 426 (50 %) are located in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics (NHET) and 88 (10 %) are located in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics (SHET). The spatial distribution of the reconstructed eruption locations\nis in agreement with prior reconstructions for the past 2500 years. In\ntotal, these eruptions injected 7410 Tg S into the\nstratosphere: 70 % from tropical eruptions and 25 % from NH\nextratropical eruptions. A long-term latitudinally and monthly resolved\nstratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) time series is reconstructed from\nthe HolVol VSSI estimates, representing the first Holocene-scale\nreconstruction constrained by Greenland and Antarctica ice cores. These new\nlong-term reconstructions of past VSSI and SAOD variability confirm evidence\nfrom regional volcanic eruption chronologies (e.g., from Iceland) in showing\nthat the Early Holocene (9500–7000 BCE) experienced a higher number of\nvolcanic eruptions (+16 %) and cumulative VSSI (+86 %) compared with\nthe past 2500 years. This increase coincides with the rapid retreat of ice\nsheets during deglaciation, providing context for potential future increases\nin volcanic activity in regions under projected glacier melting in the 21st\ncentury. The reconstructed VSSI and SAOD data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.928646 (Sigl et al., 2021).\n                    </jats:p>"

The salient signal is an ultralow field strength, associated with waning thermal energy to power the geodynamo from core-mantle heat flux, followed by a sharp intensity increase as new thermal and compositional sources of buoyancy become available once inner core nucleation (ICN) commences. Ultralow fields have been reported from Ediacaran (~565 Ma) rocks, but the transition to stronger strengths has been unclear. Herein, we present single crystal paleointensity results from early Cambrian (~532 Ma) anorthosites of Oklahoma. These yield a time-averaged dipole moment 5 times greater than that of the Ediacaran Period. This rapid renewal of the field, together with data defining ultralow strengths, constrains ICN to ~550 Ma. Thermal modeling using this onset age suggests the inner core had grown to 50% of its current radius, where seismic anisotropy changes, by ~450 Ma. We propose the seismic anisotropy of the outermost inner core reflects development of a global spherical harmonic degree-2 deep mantle structure at this time that has persisted to the present day. The imprint of an older degree-1 pattern is preserved in the innermost inner core.</jats:p>"

It contains fault structures and steeply sloping stratigraphic reservoirs, both primary features of interest for hydrocarbon exploration that needs to be accurately imaged to improve the interpretation of seismic data and facilitate the accurate identification of features of interest. Although faults are an indicator of possible hydrocarbon traps, they are difficult to identify in seismic images using traditional stack or prestack time migration due to the rather complex behaviors of wave propagation. On the other hand, prestack depth migration (PSDM) can significantly improve the accuracy of seismic images, especially of complex subsurface structures such as faults, folds, overthrusts, and salt domes. Among the various PSDM approaches, reverse time migration (RTM) has been shown to be the most powerful. Here, we show how PSDM-RTM can significantly improve the representation of fault structures and steeply dipping structures in seismic images from field data collected in Rakhine Basin, which is characterized by complex geology including stratigraphic and strati-structural traps as well as complex channel systems. Typically, these structures appear heavily blurred and are difficult to identify using normal stack and prestack time migration. We demonstrate that they become clearer and easier to detect with the PSDM–RTM approach, making this approach particularly suitable for seismic interpretations of geologically complex areas within the context of hydrocarbon prospecting.</jats:p>",

We demonstrated that pulsatile release is governed by a sudden increase in porosity of the polymeric matrix, leading to the formation of a porous path connecting the core to the environment. Moreover, the release kinetics within the range studied remained primarily independent of the particle geometry but highly dependent on its composition.

However, non-consumptive effects may have significant influences on prey and can change different aspects of their life history such as development, reproduction and lifespan. The odour and other cues associated with a predator, without direct contact, could induce stress in prey, leading to phenotypic changes in life history traits. In this study, we investigate how mild and strong predator-induced stress could affect prey life history. The prey (<jats:italic>Tyrophagus putrescentiae</jats:italic>) was exposed, from hatching to death, to three different levels of predation stress from its predator (<jats:italic>Neoseiulus cucumeris</jats:italic>) (1, 3 or 5 predator adults in an adjacent cage separated by a mesh screen). Compared with the control, both males and females under predator-induced stress had longer developmental time and shorter lifespan when the level of predation stress increased, showing significant level-dependence. In addition, females had reduced fecundity under predation stress. Sex-specific response to predation stress was observed under a low level of predation stress: females had greater reduction in lifespan than males. Furthermore, the reduction in female lifespan was due more from the decrease in the post-oviposition period than the decrease in the oviposition period. Future studies applying even milder levels of predation press, such as exposure of prey to predator cues only during part of the prey lifespan, may provide additional insights.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We focus our research on how the core-shell organization controls behavior of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), how the core and shell are synchronized to the environment, what impact they have on the behavior of the SCN under different lighting conditions, and what mechanisms disrupt synchronization. To this end, we use a reduced Kuramoto model, with parameters inferred from experimental observations and calibrated for mice, and perform a detailed comparison between the model and experimental data under light-dark (LD), dark-dark (DD), and light-light (LL) conditions. The operating limits of free-running and entrained SCN activity under symmetric LD cycles are analyzed, with particular focus on the phenomena of anticipation and dissociation. Results reveal that the core-shell organization of the SCN enables anticipation of future events over circadian cycles. The model predicts the emergence of a second (dissociated) rhythm for large and small LD periods. Our results are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental observations of circadian dissociation. We further describe SCN activity under LL conditions and show that our model satisfies Aschoff’s first rule, according to which the endogenous free-running circadian period observed under complete darkness will shorten in diurnal animals and lengthen in nocturnal animals under constant light. Our results strongly suggest that the Kuramoto model captures essential features of synchronization and entrainment in the SCN. Moreover, our approach is easily extendible to an arbitrary number of groups, with dynamics described by explicit equations for the group phase and synchronization index. Viewed together, the reduced Kuramoto model presents itself as a useful tool for exploring open problems in the study of circadian rhythms, one that can account for evolving views of the circadian system’s organization, including peripheral clocks and inter-hemispheric interaction, and can be translated to other nocturnal and diurnal animals, including humans. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Co-curing composites facesheets to produce sandwich structures involves heating a prepreg-core assembly in a vacuum bag and compacting it by an external pressure until the prepreg cures and bonds to the core. During this process, vacuum pressure can cause atmospheric air in the honeycomb core to bubble through uncured prepreg facesheets and impact material quality, such as excess resin bleed and void growth in either the facesheet or the bondline. In this paper, we propose a multiphase flow model to predict core gas pressure throughout the process. Fully impregnated prepreg facesheets only become permeable to gas as liquid resin desaturates pores in the fabric weave. To solve for the core gas pressure, resin and gas transport equations are solved simultaneously. The permeability of each phase is a function of saturation–defined by the Brooks-Corey model to be a power law function of the capillary pressure. Deviating from a single phase (gas only) model, using dimensionless analysis we identify four material properties which control the outcome: (i) an intrinsic permeability, K<jats:sub> i</jats:sub>, which only depends on the fabric architecture and is invariant to all process variables (time, temperature, pressure), (ii) the ratio of fluid viscosities, μ<jats:sub> w</jats:sub>/ μ<jats:sub> g</jats:sub>, where resin viscosity varies strongly with temperature and degree of cure, (iii) a bubbling (capillary) pressure, P<jats:sub> b</jats:sub>, which defines the minimum pressure needed to penetrate the largest pore, and (iv) a pore size distribution parameter, λ, which defines the percentage of pores which may desaturate given the evolving capillary pressure. Changes in observed gas permeability due to time and temperature are explained by the evolving desaturation of facesheet resin and the known relationship to resin viscosity. By applying this model, a reduced set to material characterization is required and complex process cycles can quickly be interrogated. With our experiments we demonstrate that one single value for K<jats:sub> i</jats:sub> and one single value for λ can be used to predict the gas pressure decay (time dependent) at different temperatures, confirming that the intrinsic permeability is constant for the fiber network and changes in the relative permeability to air are due to the decrease in viscosity only. The limitations of this model are presented and discussed. </jats:p>",

In the study presented in this paper, further CAI tests, along with open hole compression testing were used in an attempt to ferret out the cause of the differing CAI strengths in the aforementioned study. The results showed that the lower CAI strength values were not due to the core orientation, but to the change in the quasi-isotropic face sheet ply sequence due to the 90° rotation. </jats:p>",

Inconsistency in reporting of outcome measures prevents meaningful comparisons or syntheses of trial results. The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) international initiative used structured communication techniques to achieve consensus among healthcare users and professionals working in the field of SSD.

Overall, 308 participants from 29 countries were enrolled. Of those, 233 participants completed both rounds of the survey and scored each outcome domain on a 9-point scale. The set of core outcome domains was finalised via a web-based consensus meeting with 12 participants.

This study aimed to identify a complementary set of core clinical outcomes. Clinicians and researchers from the international CRPS community informed the content of a 2-round electronic Delphi study. Participation was invited from members of the International Association for the Study of Pain CRPS Special Interest Group and the International Research Consortium for CRPS. In round 1, participants rated the relevance of 59 clinical outcomes in relation to the question “What is the clinical presentation and course of CRPS, and what factors influence it?” (1 = not relevant and 9 = highly relevant). In round 2, participants rerated each outcome in the light of the round 1 median scores. The criterion for consensus was median score ≥7, agreed by 75% of respondents. The core study team considered the feasibility of data collection of each identified outcome in agreeing final selections. Sixty respondents completed both survey rounds, with responses broadly consistent across professions. Nine outcomes met the consensus criterion. Final outcomes recommended for inclusion in the core clinical set were record of medications, presence of posttraumatic stress disorder, extent of allodynia, and skin temperature difference between limbs. Study findings provide robust recommendations for core clinical outcome data fields in the future CPRS international clinical research registry.

Additionally, we achieved a 0.0614 ± 0.0468 ps/THz/cm near zero flat dispersion over the widest bandwidth of 1.02 THz (0.80 THz to 1.82 THz). Moreover, our proposed structure can also effectively perform as single mode fiber with excellent bending loss performance, hence, can be useful for efficient THz transmission systems.</jats:p>",

Different flow rates and microcapsule shell thicknesses were considered. A sixth‐order rotational symmetric distribution of von Mises stress over the microcapsule shell can be observed on the microcapsule with a thinner shell configuration, especially at higher flow rate conditions. It is also observed that when being carried along in a fully developed pipe flow, the microcapsule with a thinner shell tends to accumulate stress at a higher rate compared to that with a thicker shell. In general, for the same microcapsule configuration, higher flow velocity would induce a higher stress level over the microcapsule shell. The deformation gradient was used to capture the microcapsule's deformation in the present study. The effect of Young's modulus on the microcapsule shell on the microcapsule deformation was investigated as well. Our findings will shed light on the understanding of the stability of core–shell‐structured microcapsule when subjected to flow‐induced shear stress in a microfluidic system, enabling a more exquisite control over the breakup dynamics of drug‐loaded microcapsule for biomedical applications.</jats:p>",

Emerging research suggests that balance training may be advantageous for children with Down syndrome, making it a crucial component of physical activity programmes. Objective: to ascertain the impact of balance training and activities for core stability on postural control in kids with Down syndrome. Methods: single blinded RCT study was conducted, in which assessor was kept blind. While taking into account inclusion and exclusion criteria, children with Down syndrome were randomly divided into two groups with ages ranging from 5 to 17 years. There were 20 patients in the sample. Exercises for core stability were given to Group 2 and balance training to Group 1. The time between treatments was six weeks. The Comprehensive Rehabilitation facility Chakwal is where the data is gathered. The pre- and post-values of postural stability were measured using the paediatric Berg balance scale. Results: The present results are significantly better in the group B than in the group A. Core stability exercises shows better results than balance training. Conclusion: According to the results of the current study from the data of before the treatment and after the treatment, it revealed a positive change. In the duration of six weeks the core stability exercises were more effective than balance training in developing postural control among children with Down syndrome.</jats:p>"

This paper studies the low-velocity impact response of sandwich plates with functionally graded carbon nanotubes reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) face sheets and negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) auxetic honeycomb core. The material properties of FG-CNTRC were obtained by the rule of mixture theory. The auxetic honeycomb core is made of Ti-6Al-4V. The governing equations are derived based on the first-order shear deformation theory and Hamilton’s principle. The nonlinear Hertz contact law is used to calculate the impact parameters. The Ritz method with Newmark’s time integration schemes is used to solve the response of the sandwich plates. The (20/−20/20)s, (45/−45/45)s and (70/−70/70)s stacking sequences of FG-CNTRC are considered. The effects of the gradient forms of FG-CNTRC surfaces, volume fractions of CNTs, impact velocities, temperatures, ratio of plate length, width and thickness of surface layers on the value of the plate center displacement, the recovery time of deformation, contact force and contact time of low-velocity impact were analyzed in detail.</jats:p>"

UGT2B28 was found to be regulated by both full-length androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variant, AR-v7. Genetic knockdown of UGT2B28 across multiple PCa cell lines (LNCaP, LAPC-4, and VCaP), both in androgen-replete and androgen-depleted states resulted in impaired 3D organoid formation and a significant delay in tumor take and growth rate of xenograft tumors, all of which were rescued by re-expression of UGT2B28. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a key role for the UGT2B28 gene in promoting prostate tumor growth.</jats:p>"

RapA, known to remove RNAP from DNA in an ATP-dependent fashion, was identified over 50 years ago as an abundant binding partner of RNAP; however, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we use single-molecule magnetic trapping assays to characterize RapA activity and begin to specify its mechanism of action. We first show that stalled RNAP resides on DNA for times on the order of 106 seconds and that increasing positive torque on the DNA reduces this lifetime. Using stalled RNAP as a substrate we show that the RapA protein stimulates dissociation of stalled RNAP from positively supercoiled DNA but not negatively supercoiled DNA. We observe that RapA-dependent RNAP dissociation is torque-sensitive, is inhibited by GreB and depends on RNA length. We propose that stalled RNAP is dislodged from DNA by RapA via backtracking in a supercoiling- and torque-dependent manner, suggesting that RapA’s activity on transcribing RNAP in vivo is responsible for resolving conflicts between converging polymerase molecular motors.</jats:p>",

This device also serves as an exploration platform for a simple, compact helicon wave plasma source adaptable to engineering applications. A small-diameter (26 mm) high-density (∼10<jats:sup>18</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>) blue core plasma is produced in ∼1 Pa argon by helicon RF (radio-frequency) discharge using a Nagoya III antenna under magnetic field (∼2 kG) of compact ring PMs (length ∼204 mm). Operational parameters, i.e. RF power and neutral gas pressure are scanned and plasma density is measured by an RF compensated probe to explore the operating characteristics of the device. Iconic feature of a helicon discharge, such as blue core plasmas and E-H-W mode transitions are well observed in the device, despite the wavelength calculated using the conventional dispersion relation of a bounded whistler waves (Chen 1991 <jats:italic>Plasma Phys.

Surprisingly, the wavelength calculated by the unbounded whistle wave dispersion formula in turn suggests the occurrence of a half wavelength resonance.</jats:p>",

Although intravitreal agents that reduce the bioactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are used to treat IVNV, concerns exist regarding their effects on intraretinal vascularization. In an experimental ROP model, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) knockdown in retinal endothelial cells reduced IVNV and promoted intraretinal vascularization, whereas knockdown of a downstream effector, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in retinal endothelial cells only reduced IVNV. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the different pathways involved in VEGF-triggered VEGFR2 signaling and VEGF-triggered STAT3 signaling in retinal endothelial cells would allow us to delineate signaling pathways involved in IVNV from those involved in intraretinal vascularization in ROP. To address our hypothesis, we used RNA-sequencing and pathway enrichment analysis to determine changes in the transcriptome of cultured human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Of the enriched pathways, inactivation of oncostatin M signaling was predicted by either KDR or STAT3 knockdown in the presence of VEGF. Activation of kinetochore metaphase signaling was predicted by KDR knockdown, whereas inactivation was predicted by STAT3 knockdown in the presence of VEGF. Inactivation of signaling by the Rho family of GTPases was predicted by KDR knockdown, but activation was predicted by STAT3 knockdown in the presence of VEGF. Taken together, our data identified unique signaling pathway differences between VEGF-triggered VEGFR2 and VEGF-triggered STAT3 in HRMECs that might have implications in ROP.</jats:p>"

Recent evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the possible factors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is a natural active ingredient extracted from the root of the traditional Chinese herb licorice, which has been shown in previous studies to have the effect of alleviating lung injury. In this study, our objective was to investigate whether GA could ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by altering EMT, as well as the therapeutic potential of changing core fucosylation (CF) to target EMT-related pathways. First, we verified that GA partially reverses EMT in a rat model of bleomycin-induced lung interstitial fibrosis, alleviating pulmonary fibrosis, and implying that GA has antifibrotic potential. Next, we discovered that GA attenuated lung interstitial fibrosis by reducing CF modifications to some extent. Interestingly, we found that GA therapy reduced the expression of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) and β-catenin in the EMT pathway and that GA inhibited the modification of TGF-βR and WNT receptor proteins by CF, suggesting that GA may interfere with the EMT process by modulating TGF-βR, WNT core fucosylation modifications to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis. In conclusion, these findings indicate that GA could be a potential therapeutic agent for IPF, and further support the idea that targeting CF alterations could be a novel technique for the treatment of diseases involving EMT.</jats:p>",

We consider the knowledge that has been gained, the factors limiting our ability to achieve a reliable description of the core human microbiome, and the fields most likely to improve that ability. DNA sequencing technologies and the methods for analyzing metagenomics and amplicon data will most likely facilitate higher accuracy and resolution in describing the microbiome. However, more effort should be invested in characterizing the microbiome’s interactions with its human host, including the immune system and nutrition. Other components of this holobiontic system should also be emphasized, such as fungi, protists, lower eukaryotes, viruses, and phages. Most importantly, a collaborative effort of experts in microbiology, nutrition, immunology, medicine, systems biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning is probably required to identify the traits of the core human microbiome.</jats:p>"

Here, we describe a modular safe-harbor transgene insertion (MosTI) for use in Caenorhabditis elegans which improves targeted insertion of single-copy transgenes by homology directed repair and targeted integration of extrachromosomal arrays by nonhomologous end-joining. MosTI allows easy conversion between selection markers at insertion site and a collection of universal targeting vectors with commonly used promoters and fluorophores. Insertions are targeted at three permissive safe-harbor intergenic locations and transgenes are reproducibly expressed in somatic and germ cells. Chromosomal integration is mediated by CRISPR/Cas9, and positive selection is based on a set of split markers (unc-119, hygroR, and gfp) where only animals with chromosomal insertions are rescued, resistant to antibiotics, or fluorescent, respectively. Single-copy insertion is efficient using either constitutive or heat-shock inducible Cas9 expression (25–75%) and insertions can be generated from a multiplexed injection mix. Extrachromosomal array integration is also efficient (7–44%) at modular safe-harbor transgene insertion landing sites or at the endogenous unc-119 locus. We use short-read sequencing to estimate the plasmid copy numbers for 8 integrated arrays (6–37 copies) and long-read Nanopore sequencing to determine the structure and size (5.4 Mb) of 1 array. Using universal targeting vectors, standardized insertion strains, and optimized protocols, it is possible to construct complex transgenic strains which should facilitate the study of increasingly complex biological problems in C. elegans.</jats:p>",

The advantage of using longer pillars is that they can increase the memory areal density while maintaining robust thermal stability. The current-induced magnetization reversal of long pillars is a significant challenge in spintronic applications such as high-density magnetic memories. However, the magnetization of pillars that are more than 100 nm long has never been reversed by spin-orbit torque (SOT) or spin injection from another ferromagnet (FM). Against this background, we propose a novel magnetization reversal method for pillars based on both SOT and spin transfer torque without using a FM for spin injection. Furthermore, this SOT-assisted method significantly reduces the reversal time, as was demonstrated by micromagnetic simulation. Using a spin-polarized current and SOT, the magnetization was reversed in pillars with length ⩾100 nm. The magnetization of pillars with PSA and those with both high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and PSA was successfully reversed. The findings of this study are physically novel and significant for practical applications. Consequently, the proposed new writing scheme paves the way for next-generation spintronic devices.</jats:p>",

Here, we experimentally observe both topological edge states and bulk Chern numbers near the topological phase transition in a tunable electric circuit system. The admittance matrix of the system is accurately engineered by using variable capacitors, leading to the implementation of classical analogue of the quantum Hall phase and the topological transition. The topological numbers of the edge states are determined experimentally, where the locations of the edge states are flipped in the topological transition. The corresponding bulk Chern numbers are determined by the Středa’s formula to the impedance spectrum.

This study aimed to map the distribution ranges of these three <jats:italic>Peronia</jats:italic> species within the Ryukyu Islands using molecular analyses in order to understand the specific distribution of each species. Since <jats:italic>Peronia</jats:italic> species are generally indistinguishable by gross external morphology, a DNA barcoding approach was employed to identify specimens. The molecular data showed that there are four species present in the Ryukyu Islands. <jats:italic>P. verruculata</jats:italic> (unit #1 <jats:italic>sensu</jats:italic> Dayrat et al., 2020) was dominant at almost all locations, while <jats:italic>P. peronii</jats:italic> was present in much lower numbers than <jats:italic>P. verruculata</jats:italic>, but found across a relatively wide range in the Ryukyu Islands. We newly record <jats:italic>P. okinawensis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. setoensis</jats:italic> from Amami Oshima Island and from several places around Okinawajima Island, and also identified high levels of genetic variation within <jats:italic>P. setoensis</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>Peronia okinawensis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. setoensis</jats:italic> have been thought to be endemic to Okinawajima Island and to Honshu, mainland Japan, respectively. However, as both species were observed around Okinawajima and Amami Oshima islands, other islands of the Ryukyus are also likely to harbor these species, and their distribution ranges are wider than previously thought. Based on the results from molecular analyses, we provide general descriptions of each species. Sizes of specimens were consistently smaller for <jats:italic>P. setoensis</jats:italic> and relatively larger for <jats:italic>P. peronii</jats:italic> specimens. On the other hand, <jats:italic>P. verruculata</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. okinawensis</jats:italic> had similar size ranges, but <jats:italic>P. okinawensis</jats:italic> had comparatively much more distinct papillae.

We identified MACC1 (metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1), a known driver for metastasis and an EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition)-related gene, to be significantly differentially expressed in CC manipulated cells and analysed the effect of MACC1 manipulation (knockout or overexpression) in terms of circadian clock phenotype as well as cancer progression. Our data points to a bi-directional MACC1-circadian clock interplay in CRC, via CC genes. In particular, knocking out MACC1 reduced the period of oscillations, while its overexpression increased it. Interestingly, we found the MACC1 protein to be circadian expressed in HCT116 WT cells, which was disrupted after the knockout of CC genes, and identified a MACC1-NR1D1 protein–protein interaction. In addition, MACC1 manipulation and CC knockout altered cell invasion properties of HCT116 cells, pointing to a regulation of clock and cancer progression in CRC, possibly via the interaction of MACC1 with core-clock genes.</jats:p>"

With the aim of\nbetter understanding the deformation regime of ice sheets, the work\npresented here investigates the COF in the upper 80 % of the Dome Fuji\nStation ice core in East Antarctica. Dielectric anisotropy (Δε) data were acquired as a novel indicator of the vertical\nclustering of COF resulting from vertical compressional strain within the\ndome. The Δε values were found to exhibit a general\nincrease with depth, but with fluctuations over distances in the order of\n10–102 m. In addition, significant decreases in Δε\nwere found to be associated with depths corresponding to three major glacial\nto interglacial transitions. These changes in Δε are\nascribed to variations in the deformational history caused by dislocation\nmotion occurring from near-surface depths to deeper layers. Fluctuations in\nΔε over distances of less than 0.5 m exhibited a strong\ninverse correlation with Δε at depths greater than\napproximately 1200 m, indicating that they were enhanced during the\nglacial-interglacial transitions. The Δε data also\nexhibited a positive correlation with the concentration of chloride ions and\nan inverse correlation with the amount of dust particles in the ice core at\ngreater depths corresponding to decreases in the degree of c axis clustering.\nFinally, we found that fluctuations in Δε persisted to\napproximately 80 % of the total depth of the ice sheet. These data suggest\nthat the factors determining the deformation of ice include the\nconcentration of chloride ions and the amount of dust particles, and that\nthe layered contrast associated with the COF is preserved all the way from\nthe near-surface to a depth corresponding to approximately 80 % of the\nthickness of the ice sheet. These findings provide important implications\nregarding further development of the COF under the various stress-strain\nconfigurations that the ice will experience in the deepest region,\napproximately 20 % of the total depth from the ice/bed interface.\n                    </jats:p>"

However, little is known about this family in maize. The upstream regulatory network of Di19 genes remains poorly understood in plant stress response, especially. In this study, seven ZmDi19 genes were identified, and sequence alignment, gene structure, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the ZmDi19-5 promoter was cloned and multiple putative stress-responsive cis-acting elements (CAEs) were found in the promoter region. The transient transformation assay indicated that firefly luciferase (LUC)-expressed activity driven by the ZmDi19-5 promoter can be significantly induced by drought stress. A 450 bp core region of ZmDi19-5 promoter was identified, and 28 upstream regulatory proteins were screened using yeast one-hybird (Y1H) system. According to the functional annotation, some genes were related to photosynthesis, light response, and water transport, which may suggest the important roles of these genes in drought response. Particularly, five members that may be involved in drought response exhibited strong binding activity to the core region of the ZmDi19-5 promoter. This study laid an important foundation for further revealing the molecular mechanisms and regulatory network of Di19 genes in drought stress response.</jats:p>"

Side effects associated with these treatments have made it essential for new modalities, such as tumor targeting nanoparticles that can provide cancer specific therapies. In this research, we have developed novel dual-stimuli nanoparticles (E-DSNPs), comprised of two parts; (1) Core: responsive to glutathione as stimuli and encapsulating Cisplatin (a chemo-drug), and (2) Shell: responsive to irradiation as stimuli and containing NU7441 (a radiation sensitizer). The targeting moieties on these nanoparticles are Ephrin transmembrane receptors A2 (EphA2) that are highly expressed on the surfaces of lung cancer cells. These nanoparticles were then evaluated for their enhanced targeting and therapeutic efficiency against lung cancer cell lines. E-DSNPs displayed very high uptake by lung cancer cells compared to healthy lung epithelial cells. These nanoparticles also demonstrated a triggered release of both drugs against respective stimuli and a subsequent reduction in in vitro cancer cell survival fraction compared to free drugs of equivalent concentration (survival fraction of about 0.019 and 0.19, respectively). Thus, these nanoparticles could potentially pave the path to targeted cancer therapy, while overcoming the side effects of conventional clinical therapies.</jats:p>"

Specifically, previous research in typically developing children has suggested that phonological processing skills may be more closely related to arithmetic problems that are solved through fact retrieval (e.g., remembering the solution from memory) than procedural computation (e.g., counting). However, the relationship between phonological processing and arithmetic in children with learning disabilities (LDs) has not been investigated. Yet, understanding these relationships in children with LDs is especially important because it can help elucidate the cognitive underpinnings of math difficulties, explain why reading and math disabilities frequently co‐occur, and provide information on which cognitive skills to target for interventions. In 63 children with LDs, we examined the relationship between different phonological processing skills (phonemic awareness, phonological memory, and rapid serial naming) and arithmetic. We distinguished between arithmetic problems that tend to be solved with fact retrieval versus procedural computation to determine whether phonological processing skills are differentially related to these two arithmetic processes. We found that phonemic awareness, but not phonological memory or rapid serial naming, was related to arithmetic fact retrieval. We also found no association between any phonological processing skills and procedural computation. These results converge with prior research in typically developing children and suggest that phonemic awareness is also related to arithmetic fact retrieval in children with LD. These results raise the possibility that phonemic awareness training might improve both reading and arithmetic fact retrieval skills.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Research Highlights</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Relationships between phonological processing and various arithmetic skills were investigated in children with learning disabilities (LDs) for the first time.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found phonemic awareness was related to arithmetic involving fact retrieval, but not to arithmetic involving procedural computation in LDs.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The results suggest that phonemic awareness is not only important to skilled reading, but also to some aspects of arithmetic.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>These results raise the question of whether intervention in phonemic awareness might improve arithmetic fact retrieval skills.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

We propose a method for calculating the dust trajectory in a gravitationally collapsing cloud, where the dust grains are treated as Lagrangian particles and are assumed to be neutral. We perform the dust trajectory calculations in combination with non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulation. Our simulation shows that dust particles with a size of $\\le 10\\, {\\rm \\mu m}$ are coupled with gas in a star-forming cloud core. We investigate the time evolution of the dust-to-gas mass ratio and the Stokes number, which is defined as the stopping time normalized by the freefall time-scale, and show that large dust grains ($\\gtrsim 100\\, {\\rm \\mu m}$) have a large Stokes number (close to unity) and tend to concentrate in the central region (i.e. protostar and rotationally supported disc) faster than do small grains ($\\lesssim 10\\, {\\rm \\mu m}$). Thus, large grains significantly increase the dust-to-gas mass ratio around and inside the disc. We also confirm that the dust trajectory calculations, which trace the physical quantities of each dust particle, reproduce previously reported results obtained using the Eulerian approach.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to understand the relationship between serum IL-1β, IL-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels with infarct core and ischemic penumbra volume in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and its influence on prognosis.\nMethods\n The serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and hs-CRP were measured in 65 patients within 24h of AIS onset. The infarcts of the patients were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) and core volume on computed tomography perfusion or perfusion-weighted imaging were used to calculate infarct volume and ischemic penumbra volume. The Tan collateral score was calculated with Neusoft Brain Clinical Assistant Ration Evaluate (NeuBrainCARE).\nResults\n We found a significant correlation between infarct core volume and serum hs-CRP levels (P &lt; 0.05) and between penumbra volume and IL-6 levels (P &lt; 0.05). Serum IL-6 and hs-CRP levels were positively correlated with NIHSS scores at admission, discharge, and 3 months after discharge. IL-1β levels, Tan collateral score, and ASPECTS showed no correlation with the infarct core volume.\nConclusion\n A significant correlation between hs-CRP and IL-6 levels and infarct and ischemic penumbra volume, respectively, and with NIHSS score shows that these two factors might prove helpful in predicting the extent of neurological damage in AIS patients after 3 months of onset, opening new avenues for treatment.</jats:p>"

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained great attention for various applications due to their attractive features of structural tunability, high surface area and high porosity. Herein, a core–shell structured carbon‐based hybrid electrocatalyst (H‐NSC@Co/NSC), which contains high density active sites of MOF‐derived shell (Co/NSC) and COF‐derived hollow core (H‐NSC), is successfully fabricated by direct pyrolysis of covalently‐connected COF@ZIF‐67 hybrid. The core–shell H‐NSC@Co/NSC hybrid manifests excellent catalytic properties toward both OER and ORR with a small potential gap (∆<jats:italic>E</jats:italic> = 0.75 V). The H‐NSC@Co/NSC assembled Zn–air battery exhibits a high power‐density of 204.3 mW cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>and stable rechargeability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>assembled Zn–air battery. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structure of the carbon frameworks on the Co/NSC shell can be effectively modulated by the embedded Co nanoparticles (NPs), facilitating the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and leading to enhanced catalytic activity. This work will provide a strategy to design highly‐efficient electrocatalysts for application in energy conversion and storage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Gas isotope thermometry using the isotopes of molecular nitrogen and argon\nhas been used extensively to reconstruct past surface temperature change\nfrom Greenland ice cores. The gas isotope ratios δ15N and\nδ40Ar in the ice core are each set by the amount of\ngravitational and thermal fractionation in the firn. The gravitational\ncomponent of fractionation is proportional to the firn thickness, and the\nthermal component is proportional to the temperature difference between the\ntop and bottom of the firn column, which can be related to surface\ntemperature change. Compared to Greenland, Antarctic climate change is\ntypically more gradual and smaller in magnitude, which results in smaller\nthermal fractionation signals that are harder to detect. This has hampered\napplication of gas isotope thermometry to Antarctic ice cores. Here, we present an analytical method for measuring δ15N and\nδ40Ar with a precision of 0.002 ‰ per atomic\nmass unit, a two-fold improvement on previous work. This allows us to\nreconstruct changes in firn thickness and temperature difference at the South\nPole between 30 and 5 kyr BP. We find that variability in firn thickness is\ncontrolled in part by changes in snow accumulation rate, which is, in turn,\ninfluenced strongly by the along-flowline topography upstream of the ice\ncore site. Variability in our firn temperature difference record cannot be\nexplained by annual-mean processes. We therefore propose that the ice core\ngas isotopes contain a seasonal bias due to rectification of seasonal\nsignals in the upper firn. The strength of the rectification also appears to\nbe linked to fluctuations in the upstream topography. As further evidence\nfor the existence of rectification, we present new data from the Dome Fuji\nice core that are also consistent with a seasonal bias throughout the\nHolocene. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of ice core\ngas records. For example, we show that the effects of upstream topography on\nice core records can be significant at flank sites like the South Pole – they\nare responsible for some of the largest signals in our record. Presumably\nupstream signals impact other flank-flow ice cores such as EDML, Vostok, and\nEGRIP similarly. Additionally, future work is required to confirm the\nexistence of seasonal rectification in polar firn, to determine how spatially\nand temporally widespread rectifier effects are, and to incorporate the\nrelevant physics into firn air models.\n                    </jats:p>"

In this paper, a recognition model of saturable reactor core loosening based on variational mode decomposition (VMD)‐symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) feature fusion images and scale‐invariant feature transform (SIFT) was proposed. Firstly, the saturable reactor vibration test under high frequency pulse excitation was carried out, and the vibration signals in different core loosening degrees were collected. Secondly, the VMD algorithm was used to decompose the broadband vibration signal into multiple narrowband functions, which were used to reflect the characteristics of each frequency band. Thirdly, each function and the original signal were transformed by SDP, the generated spiral arms were fused into a new image, and the typical templates in different loosening degrees were selected. Finally, the improved SIFT algorithm was used to obtain the matching results between test sets and templates. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed model for core loosening is 97.5%, which is better than traditional algorithms. It can find the core loosening defect early and avoid further failures such as water pipe break and discharge, which can provide an important basis for saturable reactor monitoring.</jats:p>",

While high snow accumulation rates characterise coastal Antarctica, thus enabling recovery of highly resolved climatic records, summertime melting at such low-elevation sites offers challenges in establishing a reliable chronological framework through traditional approaches using the seasonality of stable water isotope and ionic proxy records. Here, we assess visual stratigraphy (VS) obtained from line-scan images as a proxy for annual layer counting in firn section (top 50 m) of the IND-36/B9 ice core (dated 1919–2016 CE) from the Djupranen Ice Rise in central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. We also used these images to obtain melt history for the site and found that traditional thickness-based quantification of melt proportion results in significant overestimations. Since density has dominant control on VS profile over the firn section, we first used circulant single-spectrum analysis to remove the secular trend and then we extracted the seasonal VS signals attributed to dust and sea-salt inclusions. We find that melt layers do not significantly alter the VS records if masked during pre-processing. The age–depth model based on the reconstructed VS profile revealed an excellent match with identified time-markers within an uncertainty of ±2 years.</jats:p>",

To investigate the NLRP1 inflammasome activation in AD, we analyzed the expression of NLRP1, ASC, cleaved gasdermin (cGSDMD), and active caspase-6 (CASP-6) proteins in each hippocampal subdivision (hilar part of CA3, CA2/3, CA1, subiculum) of postmortem tissue of 9 cognitively healthy controls (HC) and 11 AD patients whose disease duration varied from 3 to 7 years after the clinical diagnosis. The total number of neurons, along with the total number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), were estimated in Nissl- and adjacent modified Bielschowsky-stained sections, respectively, using the optical disector method. The same 9 HC and 11 AD cases were additionally semiquantitatively analyzed for expression of IBA1, HLA-DR, and CD68 microglial markers. Our results show that the expression of NLRP1, ASC, and CASP-6 is present in a significantly greater number of hippocampal formation neurons in AD brains compared to controls, suggesting that the NLRP1 inflammasome is more active in the AD brain. None of the investigated inflammasome and microglial markers were found to correlate with the age of the subjects or the duration of AD. However, besides positive correlations with microglial IBA1 expression in the subiculum and with microglial CD68 expression in the CA1 field and subiculum in the AD group, the overall NLRP1 expression in the hippocampal formation was positively correlated with the number of NFTs, thus providing a causal link between neuroinflammation and neurofibrillary degeneration. The accumulation of AT8-immunoreactive phosphorylated tau proteins that we observed at nuclear pores of large pyramidal neurons of the Ammon’s horn further supports their role in the extent of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in AD. This is important because unlike fibrillar amyloid-β deposits that are not related to dementia severity, total NFTs and neuron numbers in the hippocampal formation, especially in the CA1 field, are the best correlates of cognitive deterioration in both human brain aging and AD. Our findings also support the notion that the CA2 field vulnerability is strongly linked to specific susceptibilities to different tauopathies, including primary age-related tauopathy. Altogether, these findings contrast with reports of nonsignificant microglial activation in aged nonhuman primates and indicate that susceptibility to inflammasome activation may render the human brain comparatively more vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes and AD. In conclusion, our results confirm a key role of NLRP1 inflammasome in AD pathogenesis and suggest NLRP1 as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target to slow or prevent AD progression.</jats:p>"

Typical caveolae have invaginated structures with a high-density caveolin assembly. Membrane sculpting proteins, including PACSIN2 and EHD2, are involved in caveolar biogenesis. PACSIN2 is an F-BAR domain-containing protein with a membrane sculpting ability that is essential for caveolar shaping. EHD2 is also localized at caveolae and involved in their stability. However, the spatial relationship between PACSIN2, EHD2, and caveolin has not yet been investigated. We observed the single-molecule localizations of PACSIN2 and EHD2 relative to caveolin-1 in three-dimensional space. The single-molecule localizations were grouped by their proximity localizations into the geometric structures of blobs. In caveolin-1 blobs, PACSIN2, EHD2, and caveolin-1 had overlapped spatial localizations. Interestingly, the mean centroid of the PACSIN2 F-BAR domain at the caveolin-1 blobs was closer to the plasma membrane than those of EHD2 and caveolin-1, suggesting that PACSIN2 is involved in connecting caveolae to the plasma membrane. Most of the blobs with volumes typical of caveolae had PACSIN2 and EHD2, in contrast to those with smaller volumes. Therefore, PACSIN2 and EHD2 are apparently localized at typically sized caveolae.</jats:p>"

Methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), associated with open chromatin and gene transcription, is catalyzed by type 2 lysine methyltransferase complexes that require WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L and DPY30 as core subunits. Ash2l is essential during embryogenesis and for maintaining adult tissues. To expand on the mechanistic understanding of Ash2l, we generated mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with conditional Ash2l alleles. Upon loss of Ash2l, methylation of H3K4 and gene expression were downregulated, which correlated with inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, we observed induction of senescence concomitant with a set of downregulated signature genes but independent of SASP. Many of the signature genes are FoxM1 responsive. Indeed, exogenous FOXM1 was sufficient to delay senescence. Thus, although the loss of Ash2l in MEFs has broad and complex consequences, a distinct set of downregulated genes promotes senescence.</jats:p>",

An assignment of the main observed spectral features is based on the results of multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations for the excitation energies and static exchange (STEX) calculations for energies and intensities. MCSCF results have been analyzed in terms of static and dynamic electron relaxation as well as electron correlation contributions to double-core-hole state ionization potentials. The analysis of applicability of the STEX method, which implements the one-particle picture toward the complete basis set limit, is motivated by the fact that it scales well toward large species.

The first method is due to Desroziers <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> (2005, <jats:italic>Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc.</jats:italic>, 131, 3385–3396; referred to as DBCP hereafter) and relies on residual statistics readily available from DA applications. The second method, the three‐cornered hat (3CH) developed by Gray and Allan (1974, <jats:italic>IEEE 28th Annual Symp. Freq. Control</jats:italic>, 243–246) and only recently applied to atmospheric sciences, uses three data sets and can derive estimates of relevant error uncertainties as well. The usefulness of both methods lies in them not requiring knowledge of the true value of the quantities at play. DBCP derives its results by relying explicitly on the constraints associated with the DA minimization problem; 3CH is general and its estimates hold as long as errors in the three data sets of choice are uncorrelated. Establishing the relationship between the methods requires application of the 3CH approach to the same observation, background, and analysis data sets used by DBCP. In this case, the same assumptions of DBCP regarding residual errors allow for cancellation of error cross‐covariance terms in 3CH, such that two of its corners derive identical estimates for observation‐ and background‐error covariances to those of DBCP. The error cross‐covariance terms associated with the third corner are shown to add up to twice the analysis‐error covariance, so that the 3CH estimate for the third corner recovers the negative of the analysis‐error covariance. Illustrations of these findings are provided by deriving uncertainties for radio occultation bending angles.</jats:p>",

By leveraging the distinctive nature of the one-dimensional geometry and large surface-to-volume ratio of the nanowires, new properties can be attained through monolithic integration of conventional nanowires with other easy-synthesized functional materials. Herein, we combine high-crystal-quality III-nitride nanowires with amorphous molybdenum sulfides (a-MoS<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>) to construct III-nitride/a-MoS<jats:sub>x</jats:sub> core-shell nanostructures.

We further use monochromated valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy to obtain spatially resolved band-gap maps of the heterostructure with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. A decrease in band-gap energy at highly strained core-shell interfacial regions is found, along with a switch from direct to indirect band-gap. These findings represent an advance in the sub-nanometer-scale understanding of the interplay between structure and electronic properties associated with highly mismatched semiconductor heterostructures, especially with those related to the planar growth of heterostructured nanowire networks.</jats:p>"

This MIP was used as the sorbent in dispersive solid-phase microextraction (DSPME) of aniline from textile wastewater prior to high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) measurements. Since aniline is toxic and a probable human carcinogen, its determination in water is of great significance. This is a challenging task because aniline is usually present at trace levels. The effects of different DSPME variables on the preconcentration efficiency have been studied by using the Plackett–Burman screening design of experiments (DoE) followed by response surface methodology optimization using the Box-Behnken design. Thus, DoE enabled the investigation of several variables simultaneously. Under optimized conditions, aniline was effectively and selectively separated by a small amount of the DSPME sorbent and detected in real textile wastewater samples. The method detection limit of 1 ng mL−1 was attained, with good method linearity and acceptable recovery and precision. The results showed that the studied MIP could be a reliable DSPME sorbent for efficiently analyzing trace aniline in real wastewater samples.</jats:p>"

The extensive invasion of American bullfrogs (<jats:italic>Lithobates catesbeiana</jats:italic>) and red swamp crayfish (<jats:italic>Procambarus clarkii</jats:italic>) is seriously harmful to aquatic systems worldwide, including Japan. In recent years, the methods involving environmental DNA (eDNA) have significantly contributed to the detection of invasive alien species. These methods for the above two species had already been developed in previous studies overseas, but could be unsuitable for detection of the species in Japan due to matching of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers with the sequence of the co‐existing species. The present study developed two eDNA detection methods for <jats:italic>L. catesbeiana</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. clarkii</jats:italic> in Japanese habitats. The eDNA of both invasive alien species was detected in all ponds where they had been captured and observed.

The reactor dynamics are influenced by neutronic and thermal-hydraulic aspects of the core. In this study, steady-state and transient analysis under RIA conditions of the RSG-GAS multipurpose reactor was carried out using MTR-DYN and EUREKA-2/RR programs. Neutronic calculations were performed using a few group cross-sections generated by Serpent 2 with the latest cross-section data ENDF/B-VIII.0. Steady-state conditions were carried out with a nominal power of 30 MW, while transient under RIA conditions occurred because the control rod was pulled too quickly while the reactor operated. These transient RIA conditions were performed for two cases, during start-up with an initial power of 1 W, and within power range with an initial power of 1 MW. Thermal-hydraulic parameters considered in this study are reactor power, the temperature of the fuel, cladding, and coolant. The calculated maximum fuel temperature at a steady state is 126.02°C. Meanwhile, the calculated maximum fuel temperature during RIA conditions at the initial power of 1 W and 1 MW are 64.38°C and 137.14°C, respectively. There are no significant differences in thermal-hydraulic parameters between each used program. The thermal-hydraulic parameters such as the maximum temperature of the coolant, cladding, and fuel under this postulated RIA condition are within the acceptable reactor operation safety limits.</jats:p>",

Secondly, the input impedance matrices of a cable under different situations are derived. Based on this, a method is proposed to identify the local defects and fault types. The capacitive defects and inductive defects are identified according to the left or right offset of the amplitude spectrum; the short circuit and break faults of the cable can be identified according to the number of resonant points in the amplitude spectrum and the initial phase angle of the phase spectrum. Finally, to verify the correctness of the proposed method, a 10 kV three‐core cable is taken as an example to carry out PSCAD circuit simulation and practical test.

Here, the deployment of high throughput (HT) techniques to screen CIP conditions for cleaning Capto Core 700 resin exposed to clarified cell culture harvest (CCCH) of a SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine candidate produced in Vero adherent cell culture are described. The best performing conditions, comprised of 30% n‐propanol and ≥0.75 N NaOH, were deployed in cycling experiments, completed with miniature chromatography columns, to demonstrate their effectiveness. The success of the CIP strategy was ultimately verified at the laboratory scale. Here, its impact was assessed across the entire purification process which also included an ultrafiltration/diafiltration step. It is shown that the implementation of the CIP strategy enabled the re‐use of the Capto Core 700 resin for up to 10 cycles without any negative impact on the purified product. Hence, the strategic combination of HT and laboratory‐scale experiments can lead rapidly to robust CIP procedures, even for a challenging to clean resin, and thus help to overcome supply shortages.</jats:p>",

Often being confined to the dark and chemically saturated habitat of wood, many bark- and woodborers have developed stridulatory mechanisms to communicate acoustically. Despite their ecological and economic importance and the unusual medium used for acoustic communication, very little is known about sound production in these insects, or their acoustic interactions inside trees. Here, we use bark beetles (Scolytinae) as a model system to study the effects of wooden tissue on the propagation of insect stridulations and propose algorithms for their automatic identification. We characterize distance dependence of the spectral parameters of stridulatory sounds, propose data-based models for the power decay of the stridulations in both outer and inner bark, provide optimal spectral ranges for stridulation detectability and develop automatic methods for their detection and identification. We also discuss the acoustic discernibility of species cohabitating the same log. The species tested can be acoustically identified with 99% of accuracy at distances up to 20 cm and detected to the greatest extent in the 2–6 kHz frequency band. Phloem was a better medium for sound transmission than bark.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Phenotypic variations in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer are often a predecessor and driver of ocular degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. We previously identified the orphan nuclear receptor-related 1 (NURR1), from a nuclear receptor atlas of human RPE cells, as a candidate transcription factor potentially involved in AMD development and progression. In the present study we characterized the expression of NURR1 as a function of age in RPE cells harvested from human donor eyes and in donor tissue from AMD patients. Mechanistically, we found an age-dependent shift in NURR1 dimerization from NURR1-RXRα heterodimers toward NURR1-NURR1 homodimers in primary human RPE cells. Additionally, overexpression and activation of NURR1 attenuated TNF-α–induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration, and modulated EMT-associated gene and protein expression in human RPE cells independent of age. In vivo, oral administration of IP7e, a potent NURR1 activator, ameliorated EMT in an experimental model of wet AMD and improved retinal function in a mouse model that presents with dry AMD features, impacting AMD phenotype, structure, and function of RPE cells, inhibiting accumulation of immune cells, and diminishing lipid accumulation. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of action of NURR1 in the aging eye, and demonstrate that the relative expression levels and activity of NURR1 is critical for both physiological and pathological functions of human RPE cells through RXRα-dependent regulation, and that targeting NURR1 may have therapeutic potential for AMD by modulating EMT, inflammation, and lipid homeostasis.</jats:p>",

Here, we identify an unusually profound regulatory role of conserved loop sequences in vertebrate pre-mir-144, which are essential for its cleavage by the Dicer RNase III enzyme in human and zebrafish models. Our data indicate that pre-mir-144 dicing is positively regulated via its terminal loop, and involves the ILF3 complex (NF90 and its partner NF45/ILF2). We provide further evidence that this regulatory switch involves reshaping of the pre-mir-144 apical loop into a structure that is appropriate for Dicer cleavage. In light of our recent findings that mir-144 promotes the nuclear biogenesis of its neighbor mir-451, these data extend the complex hierarchy of nuclear and cytoplasmic regulatory events that can control the maturation of clustered miRNAs.</jats:p>",

Additionally, by employing a mobilized demodulation module, the interference signal is analyzed by phase demodulation method. The experimental results show that the temperature sensitivity of the sensor is 30.8 ℃<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and the resolution is up to 1.6 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> ℃ in a range of 20 ℃–50 ℃, which can achieve high resolution temperature measurement. Furthermore, to alleviate the wavelength uncertainty of the demodulation device, a double-cavity self-reference differential phase modulation method is explored in the proposed parallel double-cavity FP. It shows that the stability could be improved to five times when system temperature is unstable, which offers an alternative method to further improve the temperature sensing resolution.</jats:p>",

Here, we tested various deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) mutations and identified a 11 kb sequence, encompassing Putative Repressor Region (PRR) to β-globin Exon-1 (βE1), as the core deletion that ablates HbA and exhibit superior production of HbF compared to HPFH or other well-established targets. The PRR-βE1 edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) retained engraftment potential to repopulate for long-term hematopoiesis in immunocompromised mice generating HbF+ cells in vivo. Importantly, the editing induces therapeutically relevant levels of HbF to reverse the phenotypes of both sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia major. These results indicate that the PRR-βE1 gene editing in patient HSPCs can potentially lead to superior therapeutic outcomes for β-hemoglobinopathies gene therapy.</jats:p>"

When this occurs on endothelial cells, surface-exposed gC1qR activates the classical pathway of complement. It also promotes assembly of a multi-protein complex comprised of coagulation factor XII (FXII), pre-kallikrein (PK), and high-molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) that activates the contact system and the kinin-generating system. Since surface-exposed gC1qR triggers intravascular inflammatory pathways, there is interest in identifying molecules that block gC1qR function. Here we further that objective by reporting the outcome of a structure/function investigation of gC1qR, its interactions with FXII, and the impact of a panel of monoclonal anti-gC1qR antibodies on FXII binding to gC1qR. Although deletion mutants have been used extensively to assess gC1qR function, none of these proteins have been characterized structurally. To that end, we determined a 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of a gC1qR mutant lacking both of its acidic loops, but which retained nanomolar-affinity binding to FXII and FXIIa. This structure revealed that the trimeric gC1qR assembly was maintained despite loss of roughly thirty residues. Characterization of a novel panel of anti-gC1qR monoclonal antibodies identified several with biochemical properties distinct from previously described antibodies, as well as one which bound to the first acidic loop of gC1qR. Intriguingly, we found that each of these antibodies could partly inhibit binding of FXII and FXIIa to gC1qR. Based on these results and previously published studies, we offer new perspectives for developing gC1qR inhibitors.</jats:p>"

The chloride ion (Cl−) has long been known as an essential cofactor for oxygen evolution by PSII, and two Cl− ions (Cl-1 and Cl-2) have been found to specifically bind near the Mn4CaO5 cluster within the oxygen-evolving center (OEC). However, despite intensive studies on these Cl− ions, little is known about the function of Cl-2, the Cl− ion that is associated with the backbone nitrogens of D1-Asn338, D1-Phe339, and CP43-Glu354. In green plant PSII, the membrane extrinsic subunits—PsbP and PsbQ—are responsible for Cl− retention within the OEC. The Loop 4 region of PsbP, consisting of highly conserved residues Thr135–Gly142, is inserted close to Cl-2, but its importance has not been examined to date. Here, we investigated the importance of PsbP-Loop 4 using spinach PSII membranes reconstituted with spinach PsbP proteins harboring mutations in this region. Mutations in PsbP-Loop 4 had remarkable effects on the rate of oxygen evolution by PSII. Moreover, we found that a specific mutation, PsbP-D139N, significantly enhances the oxygen-evolving activity in the absence of PsbQ, but not significantly in its presence. The D139N mutation increased the Cl− retention ability of PsbP and induced a unique structural change in the OEC, as indicated by light-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Our findings provide insight into the functional significance of Cl-2 in the water-oxidizing reaction of PSII.</jats:p>",

Due to the complex mineral components and pore structure of shale oil reservoirs and strong heterogeneity, it is necessary to explore the micro-pore structure characteristics of inter-salt shale. In this study, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the pore structure of inter-salt shale reservoirs, as well as evaluate the mineral composition and its spatial distribution characteristics, three shale samples from the 10th cyclothem of the Eq3 (Eq34–10 cyclothem) inter-salt shale were selected to acquire 2D and 3D grayscale images by modular automated processing system (MAPS) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), respectively. The color map of the inlaid characteristics of mineral aggregates was established by Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy (QEMSCAN), and different mineral types in the grayscale image were determined. After that, the digital core technology was used to reconstruct the core in 3D, and the maximum sphere method was used to extract the pore network model, so as to realize the quantification of micron pore throats and the 3D visualization of inter-shale samples. Meanwhile, in order to compare the fractal characteristics of the pores of the samples, the two-dimensional and three-dimensional fractal dimensions of the three cores were calculated by combining the digital core technique with fractal theory. The study yielded several notable results: the pore structure of inter-salt shale reservoirs is complex and multi-scale, and the CT scanning digital core technology can effectively realize 3D visualization of rock microstructure without damage. The pore types of rock samples are mainly intergranular pores, interparticle pores, and dissolved pores, and the minerals are mainly dolomite, calcite, and glauberite. The micron pore throat radius of the rock sample is 0.5–13.9 μm, the distribution of coordination number is mainly in the range of 1–4, and the shape of the pore throat is mainly triangular and square. The pore space of inter-salt shale has suitable fractal characteristics, and the three-dimensional fractal dimension of the three cores is in the range of 2.41–2.49. In sum, this work used digital core technology to study the microscopic pore structure of inter-salt shale oil, establishing a basis for further understanding of the seepage characteristics and exploration and development of shale oil.</jats:p>"

The effects of particle content, normal load, and reciprocating linear velocity on the friction and wear properties of epoxy‐based composites were investigated. Due to the lubricating and anti‐wear effect of core–shell particles, the 10 wt.% amount can reduce at most the friction coefficient and wear rate of epoxy by 57% and 94%, respectively. The inflatable and burst core–shell particles, transfer film, and corrosion were observed on the worn surface.

We hypothesize that the brain prioritizes the meaning of the word during comprehension with codeswitching costs emerging at a different stage of processing. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while Spanish–English balanced bilinguals (n = 24) read Spanish sentences containing a target noun that could create a semantic violation, codeswitch or both. Self-reported frequency of daily codeswitching was used as a regressor to determine if the cost of reading a switch is modulated by codeswitching experience. A robust N400 to semantic violations was followed by a late positive component (LPC). Codeswitches modulated the left anterior negativity (LAN) and LPC, but not the N400, with codeswitched semantic violations resulting in a sub-additive interaction. Codeswitching experience modulated the LPC, but not the N400. The results suggest that early access to semantic memory during comprehension happens independent of the language in which the words are presented.

Anatomical studies have revealed that the LFCN courses between the sartorius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. When the LFCN branches radially while distributing in the transverse direction from the sartorius muscle to the tensor fasciae latae muscle, it is called the fan type. Studies suggest that damage to the fan type LFCN is unavoidable during conventional fasciotomy.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p>We previously demonstrated that injury to non-fan variation LFCN occurred in 28.6% of patients who underwent THA by fasciotomy performed 2 cm away from the intermuscular space. This suggests that the conventional approach also poses a risk of LFCN injury to non-fan variation LFCN. LFCN injury is rarely reported in the anterolateral approach, which involves incision of fascia further away than the DAA.

Following our success in using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code damocles to measure the dust mass evolution in SN 1987A and other CCSNe, we present the most comprehensive sample of dust mass measurements yet made with damocles, for CCSNe aged between 4 and 60 yr after outburst. Our sample comprises multi-epoch late-time optical spectra taken with the Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-Shooter spectrographs, supplemented by archival spectra. For the 14 CCSNe that we have modelled, we confirm a dust mass growth with time that can be fit by a sigmoid curve that is found to saturate beyond an age of ∼30 yr, at a mass of 0.23$^{+0.17}_{-0.12}$ M⊙. For an expanded sample including dust masses found in the literature for a further 11 CCSNe and six CCSN remnants, the dust mass at saturation is found to be 0.42$^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$ M⊙. Uncertainty limits for our dust masses were determined from a Bayesian analysis using the affine invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo ensemble sampler emcee with damocles. The best-fitting line profile models for our sample all required grain radii between 0.1 and 0.5 $\\mu$m. Our results are consistent with CCSNe forming enough dust in their ejecta to significantly contribute to the dust budget of the Universe.</jats:p>",

In this study, genome sequencing and the annotation of G. boninense T10 were carried out using the Illumina sequencing platform, and comparative genome analysis was performed with previously reported G. boninense strains (NJ3 and G3). The pan-secretome of G. boninense was constructed and comprised 937 core orthogroups, 243 accessory orthogroups, and 84 strain-specific orthogroups. In total, 320 core orthogroups were enriched with candidate effector proteins (CEPs) that could be classified as carbohydrate-active enzymes, hydrolases, and non-catalytic proteins. Differential expression analysis revealed an upregulation of five CEP genes that was linked to the suppression of PTI signaling cascade, while the downregulation of four CEP genes was linked to the inhibition of PTI by preventing host defense elicitation. Genome architecture analysis revealed the one-speed architecture of the G. boninense genome and the lack of preferential association of CEP genes to transposable elements. The findings obtained from this study aid in the characterization of pathogenicity determinants and molecular biomarkers of BSR disease.</jats:p>"

The data consisted of 10191 dental implant images from 13 implant brands that cropped the site, including dental implants as pretreatment, from digital panoramic radiographs of patients who underwent surgery at Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital between 2005 and 2021.

We also performed statistical and effect size evaluations of the 30-time performance metrics of the simple CNNs and the ABN model. ResNet18 with ABN significantly improved the dental implant classification performance for all the performance metrics. Effect sizes were equivalent to “Huge” for all performance metrics. In contrast, the classification performance of ResNet50 and 152 deteriorated by adding the attention mechanism. ResNet18 showed considerably high compatibility with the ABN model in dental implant classification (AUC = 0.9993) despite the small number of parameters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a liquid jet is used to investigate the electronic structure of a solvated protein, yielding insight into charge transfer mechanisms in biological systems in their natural environment. No structural damage was observed in BSA following X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in a liquid jet sample environment. Carbon and nitrogen atoms in different chemical environments were resolved in the X-ray photoelectron spectra of both solid and solvated BSA. The calculations of charge distributions demonstrate the difficulty of assigning chemical contributions in complex systems in an aqueous environment. The high-resolution X-ray core electron spectra recorded are unchanged upon solvation. A comparison of the valence bands of BSA in both phases is also presented. These bands display a higher sensitivity to solvation effects. The ionization energy of the solvated BSA is determined at 5.7 ± 0.3 eV. Experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations to distinguish the contributions of various molecular components to the electronic structure. This comparison points towards the role of water in hole delocalization in proteins.</jats:p>"

It is of significance to investigate and optimize the screening means and selection criteria for reperfusion therapies to identify more appropriate patients with better outcomes. This study aimed to compare the performance of attenuation changes vs. automated Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and using CT angiography (CTA) source images vs. non-contrast CT (NCCT) in distinguishing the infarction extent of ischemic core volumes ≥ 70 ml within different time windows.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>A total of 73 patients with AIS-LVO who received multimodal CT were analyzed. The automated software was used to calculate ASPECTS.

The corresponding weighting factors were the regression coefficients derived from a multivariable linear regression model which was used to correlate regional rHU with ischemic core volumes, because each region in the ASPECTS template is weighted disproportionally in the ASPECTS system.

It has previously been shown that a methyl group on the C30 position of the sterol‐ester plays an important role in gelation. This work explored the effect that having C30 methyl groups on both the sterol and the sterol‐ester had on the gelation process and subsequent gel structure. Lanosterol and saponified γ‐oryzanol (which was synthesized as part of this study) were identified as materials of interest, as both feature a methyl group on the C30 position of their steroidal cores. It was observed that both sterols formed gels when blended with γ‐oryzanol, and also that lanosterol gelled sunflower oil without the addition of γ‐oryzanol. All of these gels were significantly weaker than that formed by β‐sitosterol blended with γ‐oryzanol. To explore why, molecular docking simulations along with AFM and SAXS were used to examine these gels on a broad range of length scales. The results suggest that saponified γ‐oryzanol‐γ‐oryzanol gels have a very similar structure to that of β‐sitosterol‐γ‐oryzanol gels. Lanosterol‐γ‐oryzanol gels and pure lanosterol gel, however, form with a totally different structure facilitated by the head‐to‐tail stacking motif exhibited by lanosterol. These results give further evidence that relatively slight changes to the molecular structure of gelators can result in significant differences in subsequent gel properties.</jats:p>",

However, overactive EPO receptor (EPOR) signaling increased laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and choroidal macrophage number in non-lasered mice, which raised the question of whether EPOR signaling increased CNV through the recruitment of macrophages to the choroid that released pro-angiogenic factors or through direct angiogenic effects on endothelial cells. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that EPOR signaling increased CNV by direct effects on macrophages or endothelial cells. We used tamoxifen-inducible macrophage-specific or endothelial cell-specific EPOR knockout mice in the laser-induced CNV model, and cultured choroidal endothelial cells isolated from adult human donors. We found that macrophage-specific knockout of EPOR influenced laser-induced CNV in females only, whereas endothelial-specific knockout of EPOR reduced laser-induced CNV in male mice only. In cultured human choroidal endothelial cells, knockdown of EPOR reduced EPO-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that EPOR signaling in macrophages or choroidal endothelial cells regulates the development of CNV in a sex-dependent manner. Further studies regarding the role of EPO-induced signaling are required to assess EPO safety and to select or develop appropriate therapeutic approaches.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Core-collapse supernova remnants are the gaseous nebulae of galactic interstellar media (ISM) formed after the explosive death of massive stars. Their morphology and emission properties depend both on the surrounding circumstellar structure shaped by the stellar wind–ISM interaction of the progenitor star and on the local conditions of the ambient medium. In the warm phase of the Galactic plane ($n\\approx 1\\, \\rm cm^{-3}$, $T\\approx 8000\\, \\rm K$), an organized magnetic field of strength $7\\, \\mu \\rm G$ has profound consequences on the morphology of the wind bubble of massive stars at rest. In this paper, we show through 2.5D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, in the context of a Wolf–Rayet-evolving $35\\, \\rm M_{\\odot }$ star, that it affects the development of its supernova remnant. When the supernova remnant reaches its middle age ($15\\!-\\!20\\, \\rm kyr$), it adopts a tubular shape that results from the interaction between the isotropic supernova ejecta and the anisotropic, magnetized, shocked stellar progenitor bubble into which the supernova blast wave expands. Our calculations for non-thermal emission, i.e. radio synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, reveal that such supernova remnants can, due to projection effects, appear as rectangular objects in certain cases. This mechanism for shaping a supernova remnant is similar to the bipolar and elliptical planetary nebula production by wind–wind interaction in the low-mass regime of stellar evolution. If such a rectangular core-collapse supernova remnant is created, the progenitor star must not have been a runaway star. We propose that such a mechanism is at work in the shaping of the asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnant Puppis A.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, ultra-massive white dwarfs are thought to harbour oxygen–neon (ONe) cores. However, recent theoretical studies and new observations suggest that some ultra-massive white dwarfs could harbour carbon–oxygen (CO) cores. Although several studies have attempted to elucidate the core composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs, to date, it has not been possible to distinguish them through their observed properties. Here, we present a new method for revealing the core-chemical composition in ultra-massive white dwarfs that is based on the study of magnetic fields generated by convective mixing induced by the crystallization process. ONe white dwarfs crystallize at higher luminosities than their CO counterparts. Therefore, the study of magnetic ultra-massive white dwarfs in the particular domain where ONe cores have reached the crystallization conditions but CO cores have not, may provide valuable support to their ONe core-chemical composition, since ONe white dwarfs would display signs of magnetic fields and CO would not. We apply our method to eight white dwarfs with magnetic field measurements and we suggest that these stars are candidate ONe white dwarfs.</jats:p>",

Here we report a mass spectrometry-based method that employs sequential treatment of intact glycopeptides with enzymes (STAGE) to analyze site-specific core fucosylation of glycoproteins. The STAGE method utilizes Endo F3 followed by PNGase F treatment to generate mass signatures for glycosites that are formerly modified by core fucosylated N-linked glycans. We benchmark the STAGE method and use it to characterize site specific core fucosylation of glycoproteins from human hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, resulting in the identification of 1130 and 782 core fucosylated glycosites, respectively. These results indicate that our STAGE method enables quantitative characterization of core fucosylation events from complex protein mixtures, which may benefit our understanding of core fucosylation functions in various diseases.</jats:p>"

This, the largest such structure solved, has two unique features. First, the core, rather than being composed of the canonical hydrophobic Ile and Val, is made up primarily of the hydrophilic Thr and Asn, with two different solvent channels. Second, comparing BpaC to all other left‐handed parallel β‐roll structures showed that the position of the head domain in the protein correlates with the number and type of charged residues. In BpaC, only negatively charged residues face the solvent—in stark contrast to the primarily positive surface charge of the left‐handed parallel β‐roll “type” protein, YadA. We propose extending the definitions of these head domains to include the BpaC‐like head domain as a separate subtype, based on its unusual sequence, position, and charge. We speculate that the function of left‐handed parallel β‐roll structures may differ depending on their position in the structure.</jats:p>",

Here, we identified 308 TaSAURs in wheat and divided them into 10 subfamilies. The promoter regions of most TaSAURs contain hormone responsive elements, and their expression levels change under the treatment of different hormones, such as IAA, MeJA, and ABA. Interestingly, overexpression of one of the TaSAUR family members, a nitrogen starvation responsive gene, TaSAUR66-5B, can promote the growth of Arabidopsis and wheat roots. In addition, overexpression of TaSAUR66-5B in Arabidopsis up-regulates the expression levels of auxin biosynthesis related genes, suggesting that overexpression TaSAUR66-5B may promote root growth by increasing the biosynthesis of auxin. Furthermore, overexpression of TaSAUR66-5B in wheat can increase the biomass and grain yields of transgenic plants, as well as the nitrogen concentration and accumulation of both shoots and grains, especially under low nitrogen conditions. This study provides important genomic information of the TaSAUR gene family and lays a foundation for elucidating the functions of TaSAURs in improving nitrogen utilization efficiency in wheat.</jats:p>"

Patients who attended different units were included in the study and patients who were not willing to participate in the study were excluded and the data collected from the hospital were analyzed.  Results:Out of 150 patients, the average number of drugs per patient was 4.56. The percentage of drugs prescribed with the generic name was found to be 19.16%. Among 150 prescriptions 49.78% of the drugs were prescribed from essential drug list.

For 4HH melting of the low-temperature crystal phase and subsequent cold crystallization (from antiferroelectric smectic CA* phase to the high-temperature crystal phase) are reported, crystallization kinetics is examined and a monotropic hexatic SmXA* phase is observed on cooling. For 4FF rich polymorphism in the solid state is investigated mainly by simultaneous X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Influence of fluorosubstitution on structural, electro-optic and dielectric properties of the smectic phases is reported. Unit cell parameters of crystal phases of 4HH and 4FF are determined. The reported results show that the double fluorosubstitution slows down the Goldstone mode and PH phason in the smectic phases and facilitates crystallization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Shell ferromagnetism is a new functional property of certain off-stoichiometric Ni–Mn–In Heusler alloys, with a potential application in non-volatile magnetic memories and recording media. One key challenge in this field remains the determination of the structural and magnetic properties of the nanoprecipitates that are the result of an annealing-induced segregation process. Thanks to its unique mesoscopic length scale sensitivity, magnetic small-angle neutron scattering appears to be a powerful technique to disclose the microstructure of such annealing-induced nanoprecipitates. In this study, the microstructure of a zero-field-annealed off-stoichiometric Ni<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>45</jats:sub>In<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> Heusler alloy is investigated by unpolarized magnetic small-angle neutron scattering. The neutron data analysis reveals a significant spin-misalignment scattering, which is mainly related to the formation of annealing-induced ferromagnetic nanoprecipitates in an antiferromagnetic matrix. These particles represent a source of perturbation which, due to dipolar stray fields, gives rise to canted spin moments in the surroundings of the particle–matrix interface. The presence of anticorrelations in the computed magnetic correlation function reflects the spatial perturbation of the magnetization vector around the nanoprecipitates. The magnetic field dependence of the zero crossing and the minima of the magnetic correlation function are qualitatively explained using the law of approach to ferromagnetic saturation for inhomogeneous spin states. More specifically, at remanence, the nanoprecipitates act magnetically as one superdefect with a correlation length that lies outside the experimental <jats:italic>q</jats:italic> range, whereas near saturation the magnetization distribution follows each individual nanoprecipitate. Analysis of the neutron data yields an estimated size of 30 nm for the spin-canted region and a value of about 75 nm for the magnetic core of the individual nanoprecipitates.</jats:p>",

Although CRC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapitulate key patient tumor characteristics and demonstrate high concordance with clinical outcomes, the use of this <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> model is costly and low-throughput. Here we report the establishment and in-depth characterization of an <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> tissue-engineered CRC model using PDX cells. To form the 3D engineered CRC-PDX (3D-eCRC-PDX) tissues, CRC PDX tumors were expanded <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>, dissociated, and the isolated cells encapsulated within PEG-fibrinogen hydrogels. Following PEG-fibrinogen encapsulation, cells remain viable and proliferate within 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues. Tumor cell subpopulations, including human cancer and mouse stromal cells, are maintained in long-term culture (29 days); cellular subpopulations increase ratiometrically over time. The 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues mimic the mechanical stiffness of originating tumors. Extracellular matrix protein production by cells in the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues resulted in approximately 57% of proteins observed in the CRC-PDX tumors also being present in the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues on day 22. Furthermore, we show congruence in enriched gene ontology molecular functions and Hallmark gene sets in 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues and CRC-PDX tumors compared to normal colon tissue, while prognostic Kaplan–Meier plots for overall and relapse free survival did not reveal significant differences between CRC-PDX tumors and 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues.

Recent years, polymer electrolyte shows great potential for its flexibility and enhanced safety. And novel single-ion conductor gel polymer electrolyte (SIGPE) could effectively suppress the anion polarization by immobilizing anions on the polymer bone. Further enhancing the thermal stability of SIGPE plays a significant role for the safety of the LIBs. Herein, a novel bifunctional core–shell structured composite was prepared, consisting of thermal stable polyimide as core and a composite single-ion conductor polymer. The relations of fiber morphology with spinning parameters and heat-treatment temperature were studied carefully. As a result, the composite core–shell structured membrane shows excellent high dimensional thermal stability up to 190 °C. Moreover, when the charged half battery was stored at 150 °C, the core–shell structured SIGPE cell shows excellent potential stability while ordinary cell quickly short out, greatly enhancing the safety of the LIBs.

The neutral diradical undergoes a σ‐dimerization, generating two types of σ‐dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the σ‐dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close‐shell dimer linked through double‐σ‐bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C−C bond length of 1.66 Å.

These two classes of MEK1 mutations differentially impact on spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK signaling, cellular transcriptional programs, gene expression profiles, and consequent biological outcomes. By making use of such distinct characteristics of the MEK1 mutants, we identified cancer- and RASopathy-signature genes that may serve as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for these diseases. In particular, two AKT-inhibitor molecules, PHLDA1 and 2, are simultaneously upregulated by oncogenic ERK signaling, and mediate cancer-specific ERK-AKT crosstalk. The combined expression of PHLDA1/2 is critical to confer resistance to ERK pathway-targeted therapeutics on cancer cells. Finally, we propose a therapeutic strategy to overcome this drug resistance.

Although <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> BM formation involves self‐assembly processes of large proteins, it remains unclear how stroma‐derived macromolecules are transported and assembled, specifically in the BM region. In this study, we established an <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> co‐culture model of BM formation in which DLD‐1 human colon epithelial cells were cultured on top of collagen I gel containing human embryonic OUMS‐36T‐2 fibroblasts as stromal cells. A distinct feature of our system is represented by OUMS‐36T‐2 cells which are almost exclusively responsible for synthesis of collagen IV, a major BM component. Exploiting this advantage, we found that collagen IV incorporation was significantly impaired in culture conditions where OUMS‐36T‐2 cells were not allowed to directly contact DLD‐1 cells. Soluble collagen IV, once diluted in the culture medium, did not accumulate in the BM region efficiently. Live imaging of fluorescently tagged collagen IV revealed that OUMS‐36T‐2 cells deposited collagen IV aggregates directly onto the basal surface of DLD‐1 cells. Collectively, these results indicate a novel mode of collagen IV deposition in which fibroblasts proximal to epithelial cells exclusively contribute to collagen IV assembly during BM formation.</jats:p>",

After a thick homoepitaxial layer was grown on a {111} high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) substrate using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the Raman spectra of diamond were taken using a confocal setup to obtain the spatial distribution of the peak positions of the diamond Raman line. Dislocations in the CVD layer and HPHT substrate were detected as local stress variation in the peak position images. The line directions of dislocations were, respectively, [112] for the HPHT substrate and [011] for the CVD layer. Local stress variation was in the [1¯1¯2] direction in both the CVD layer and the HPHT substrate. The Burgers vector deduced from the local stress-variation direction indicated the dislocation structures, respectively, as an edge type for [112] dislocations in the HPHT substrate and as a 60° mixed type for [011] dislocations in the CVD layer. Because both dislocations had the same slip plane, the line direction and dislocation type changed on the same slip plane at the CVD layer/HPHT substrate interface, when dislocation in the HPHT substrate reached the CVD layer.</jats:p>",

Here, a method that can modulate chronic pain-like behaviour induced by nerve injury in mice is described. By combining a transient nerve block to inhibit noxious afferent input from injured peripheral nerves, with concurrent activation of astrocytes in the somatosensory cortex (S1) by either low intensity transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or via the chemogenetic DREADD system, we could reverse allodynia-like behaviour previously established by partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL). Such activation of astrocytes initiated spine plasticity to reduce those synapses formed shortly after PSL. This reversal from allodynia-like behaviour persisted well beyond the active treatment period. Thus, our study demonstrates a robust and potentially translational approach for modulating pain, that capitalizes on the interplay between noxious afferents, sensitized central neuronal circuits, and astrocyte-activation induced synaptic plasticity.</jats:p>"

It is the focal area for the delineation of the terrestrial Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary in China. Based on continuous core samples taken from well YD1, detailed lithostratigraphic sequences and zircon uranium–lead (U-Pb) dating WERE used to investigate the Tuchengzi Formation. The zircon U-Pb ages of the tuff samples taken from the First and Third Members of the Tuchengzi Formation ranged from 153.8 to 137.16 Ma, indicating that they were formed in the late Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous. Dating results from the bottom of the Second Member of the Tuchengzi Formation indicate that the sedimentary time of the stratum is no later than 145.7 ± 2.1 Ma. We concluded that the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary of the Jinyang Basin in western Liaoning province may be located at the interface at a depth of 464 m in well YD1. This conclusion is consistent with the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary that has been presumed by other researchers based on paleontological assemblage features found in recent years, and can provide useful geological marker beds for the future study of the terrestrial Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary. In addition, the authors also systematically sorted the potential development areas and layers of the terrestrial Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary line, which may also provide useful geological marker beds for the future study of the terrestrial Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The long time series and consistent “urban core-suburban-rural” (USR) structure in a city region is essential to understanding urban–suburban–rural interaction and urbanization pathways. It is always considered to be a single land use type (e.g., impervious area) in remote sensing research. The long-term (1992–present) nighttime light (NTL) data of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) provide the potential for retrieving time series of USR structure. In this study, we propose an improved approach to mapping the USR structure of the three subcategories based on a heuristic algorithm of Mann–Kendall mutation detection on the NTL quantile curve. First, a minor adjustment of VIIRS NTL is applied for matching the value ranges of DMSP NTL data and keeping the advantage of VIIRS to generate a long-term NTL dataset. Second, the heuristic algorithm of Mann–Kendall mutation detection is processed to find two optimal thresholds in the NTL quantile curve, which is used for USR extraction. Finally, a temporal consistency check is used to post-process the initial USR area for obtaining a more consistent and reliable USR sequence. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we retrieved the USR structures of 19 typical cities in China from 1992 to 2020 based on NTL datasets. The evaluations of spatiotemporal consistency compared with the validation data indicate that the USR retrieval results show good agreement with the land use map derived from Landsat images and the time series product from MODIS. The average overall accuracy (OA) of overall urban extent is higher than 0.95 and the average kappa coefficient (KC) reaches 0.6. Moreover, we investigated the urban dynamics and USR interactions of 19 cities from 1992 to 2020. Overall, this study proposes an improved approach for long-term USR mapping from NTL images at a regional scale and it will provide a valuable method for urbanization dynamics analysis.</jats:p>"

Here, we (i) assessed combinations of 2304 economic weights using four traits (maturity, plant height, grain yield and grain protein content) recorded under four organically (low nitrogen) and five conventionally (high nitrogen) managed environments, (ii) compared single-trait and multi-trait selection indices (LPSI vs. RLPSI by imposing restrictions to the expected genetic gain of either yield or grain protein content), and (iii) selected a subset of about 10% spring wheat cultivars that performed very well under organic and/or conventional management systems. The multi-trait selection indices, with and without imposing restrictions, were superior to single trait selection. However, the selection parameters differed quite a lot depending on the economic weights, which suggests the need for optimizing the weights. Twenty-two of the 196 cultivars that showed superior performance under organic and/or conventional management systems were consistently selected using all five of the selected economic weights, and at least two of the selection scenarios. The selected cultivars belonged to the Canada Western Red Spring (16 cultivars), the Canada Northern Hard Red (3), and the Canada Prairie Spring Red (3), and required 83–93 days to maturity, were 72–100 cm tall, and produced from 4.0 to 6.2 t ha−1 grain yield with 14.6–17.7% GPC. The selected cultivars would be highly useful, not only as potential trait donors for breeding under an organic management system, but also for other studies, including nitrogen use efficiency.</jats:p>"

However, gene transfection into the vascular endothelial cells of the BBB is fraught with difficulties, even in vitro. We report herein on the development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), in which mRNA is encapsulated in a nano-sized capsule composed of a pH-activated and reductive environment-responsive lipid-like material (ssPalm). We evaluated the efficiency of mRNA delivery into non-polarized human brain capillary endothelial cells, hCMEC/D3 cells. The ssPalm LNPs permitted marker genes (GFP) to be transferred into nearly 100% of the cells, with low toxicity in higher concentration. A proteomic analysis indicated that the ssPalm-LNP had less effect on global cell signaling pathways than a Lipofectamine MessengerMAX/GFP-encoding mRNA complex (LFN), a commercially available transfection reagent, even at higher mRNA concentrations.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, MFR and OSNR estimation in all channels can be utilized by using a lightweight neural network via lifelong learning. In addition, the proposed scheme saves the computational resources for real implementation through confrontational knowledge distillation, making it easy to deploy the proposed neural network in the receiving end and intermediate node. Five modulation formats, including BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 8QAM, and 16QAM, were recognized by the proposed scheme within the OSNR of 10–30 dB over 2 km weakly coupled 7-core fiber. Experimental results show that 100% recognition accuracy of all these five modulation formats can be achieved while the RMSE of the estimation is below 0.1 dB. Compared with conventional neural network architectures, the proposed neural network achieves better performance, whose runtime is merely 20.2 ms, saving the computational resource of the optical network.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Well logs provide insight into stratigraphically compartmentalized rock properties and are a cost-effective alternative to core. The identification of reservoir (and nonreservoir) facies in core, and their calibration to well-log response has traditionally relied on expert domain knowledge and is inherently inconsistent. Such analyses are time-consuming, tedious, error prone, and often biased due to a lack of objectivity. Automated lithologic interpretations from wireline logs appear to be a promising solution for identifying and understanding depositional complexity within a reservoir. Using the Duvernay Formation in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin as a case study, the authors evaluate the applicability of decision tree-based machine learning (ML) methods in the prediction of core-calibrated facies and/or facies association distributions within wireline logs. The authors use three independent decision tree-based ML models to predict (1) facies (FACM), (2) facies associations (FAM), and (3) reservoir rock (RESM) from wireline logs. Model accuracies are 60.3%, 88.1%, and 88.1% for FACM, FAM, and RESM, respectively, but individual class F1 scores range from 0 to 0.92. The authors attribute discrepancies in individual class performance to interval thickness, sample proportion of training data, and distinguishability of the output class. Classes thicker than 3 m and encompassing at least 16% of the training data set have F1 scores greater than 0.60. The authors attribute exceptions to these general cutoffs to the ability to recognize diagnostic sedimentologic features observed in core. Results from this study help in understanding stratigraphic complexity in the absence of core aiding in subsurface characterization of reservoirs. </jats:p>",

The ultraviolet adhesive (UVA) dual-curing method was operated to stablish a sandwich-like composite structure, in which a section of NCTOF was compactly sandwiched between two segments of silica fiber to form multimode interference. The temperature sensing characteristics in cryogenic range were experimentally investigated by monitoring the transmission spectral movement, where a high sensitivity of 105.6 pm/°C was achieved in the range of −20-0 °C and 51.6 pm/°C in the range of −20-25 °C. The excellent performance was consistent with the simulation analysis. The maximum repeatability standard deviation and stability wavelength error of the sensor are 0.9799 pm/°C and 0.1676 nm, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on using tellurite optical fibers for cryogenic temperature detection, and the UVA dual-curing method provides a reliable solution for the integration and practical application of tellurite optical fiber. The proposed sensor is simple in structure, easy in fabrication, low in cost and excellent in performance.

The keyspace of the 4D hyperchaotic model reaches 10<jats:sup>120</jats:sup>. The results show that a 1.82 dB gain in receiver sensitivity compared with the conventional uniform 16QAM-OFDM due to the introduction of FPS. When the system is assaulted by an unlawful receiver, the bit error rate (BER) can still remain at 0.49, successfully assuring the system's security. Due to its good transmission and security performance, the scheme has important application prospects in the future optical access network.</jats:p>",

Experimental results show that the sensor responds well to dynamic magnetic fields and is able to ensure a stable operating point in the range of at least 15 °C in an ambient temperature disturbance test.

Solution-processed n-type metal oxides represent a judicious choice for the electron transport layer (ETL); however, they do not always present surface properties and energetics compatible with the perovskite emitter. Moreover, the emitter itself exhibits poor nanomorphology and defect traps that compromise the device performance. Here, we modulate the surface properties and interface energetics between the tin oxide (SnO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) ETL with the perovskite emitter by using an amino functionalized difluoro{2-[1-(3,5-dimethyl-2<jats:italic>H</jats:italic>-pyrrol-2-ylidene-<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>)ethyl]-3,5-dimethyl-1<jats:italic>H</jats:italic>-pyrrolato-<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>}boron compound and passivate the defects present in the perovskite matrix with carbon-polymer core–shell quantum dots inserted into the perovskite precursor.

However, this induction often fails to generate sufficient response to overcome pre-existing tumor microenvironment (TME) immunosuppression. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 ligands, such as R848, can amplify the effect of tumor vaccines, with recent evidence showing its antitumor effect in pancreatic cancer by modulating the immunosuppressive TME.

Due to the lethality of this disease, there is an urgent need to develop improved targeted therapies against HGSOC. Herein, we identified CASC10, a long noncoding RNA upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and ovarian cancer patients. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in total RNA isolated from the HGSOC cell lines OVCAR3 and OV-90 and their cisplatin-resistant counterparts. Thousands of RNA transcripts were differentially abundant in cisplatin-sensitive vs. cisplatin-resistant HGSOC cells. Further data filtering unveiled CASC10 as one of the top RNA transcripts significantly increased in cisplatin-resistant compared with cisplatin-sensitive cells. Thus, we focused our studies on CASC10, a gene not previously studied in ovarian cancer. SiRNA-mediated CASC10 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and invasion; and sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment. SiRNA-mediated CASC10 knockdown also induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and altered the expression of several CASC10 downstream effectors. Multiple injections of liposomal CASC10-siRNA reduced tumor growth and metastasis in an ovarian cancer mouse model. Our results demonstrated that CASC10 levels mediate the susceptibility of HGSOC cells to cisplatin treatment. Thus, combining siRNA-mediated CASC10 knockdown with cisplatin may represent a plausible therapeutic strategy against HGSOC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA replication takes place inside the viral core particle and is dependent on autophagy. Here we show that HBV core particles are associated with autophagosomes and phagophores in cells that productively replicate HBV. These autophagic membrane-associated core particles contain almost entirely the hypophosphorylated core protein and are DNA replication competent. As the hyperphosphorylated core protein can be localized to phagophores and the dephosphorylation of the core protein is associated with the packaging of viral pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), these results are in support of the model that phagophores can serve as the sites for the packaging of pgRNA. In contrast, in cells that replicate HBV, the precore protein derivatives, which are related to the core protein, are associated with autophagosomes but not with phagophores via a pathway that is independent of its signal peptide. Interestingly, when the core protein is expressed by itself, it is associated with phagophores but not with autophagosomes. These observations indicate that autophagic membranes are differentially involved in the trafficking of precore and core proteins. HBV induces the fusion of autophagosomes and multivesicular bodies and the silencing of Rab11, a regulator of this fusion, is associated with the reduction of release of mature HBV particles. Our studies thus indicate that autophagic membranes participate in the assembly of HBV nucleocapsids, the trafficking of HBV precore and core proteins, and likely also the egress of HBV particles.</jats:p>",

Recent studies have suggested that activation of P2-purinergic receptors (P2Rs) may be involved in neuron-satellite glial cell (SGC) interactions in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but the details remain unclear. In DRG, P2X7R is selectively expressed in SGCs, which closely surround neurons, and is highly sensitive to 3’-O-(4-Benzoyl) benzoyl-ATP (BzATP). Using calcium imaging in intact mice to survey a large number of DRG neurons and SGCs, we examined how intra-ganglionic purinergic signaling initiated by BzATP affects neuronal activities in vivo. We developed GFAP-GCaMP6s and Pirt-GCaMP6s mice to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GGCaM6s in SGCs and DRG neurons, respectively. The application of BzATP to the ganglion induced concentration-dependent activation of SGCs in GFAP-GCaMP6s mice. In Pirt-GCaMP6s mice, BzATP initially activated more large-size neurons than small-size ones. Both glial and neuronal responses to BzATP were blocked by A438079, a P2X7R-selective antagonist. Moreover, blockers to pannexin1 channels (probenecid) and P2X3R (A317491) also reduced the actions of BzATP, suggesting that P2X7R stimulation may induce the opening of pannexin1 channels, leading to paracrine ATP release, which could further excite neurons by acting on P2X3Rs. Importantly, BzATP increased the responses of small-size DRG neurons and wide-dynamic range spinal neurons to subsequent peripheral stimuli. Our findings suggest that intra-ganglionic purinergic signaling initiated by P2X7R activation could trigger SGC-neuron interaction in vivo and increase DRG neuron excitability.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to develop a core symptom set using a modified Delphi consensus process that should guide clinicians to carry out investigations to look for suspected recurrent OG cancer in previously asymptomatic patients. Methods: A web-based survey of 42 questions was sent to surgeons performing OG cancer resections at high volume centers. The first section evaluated the structure of follow-up and the second, determinants of follow-up. Two rounds of a modified Delphi consensus process and a further consensus workshop were used to determine symptoms warranting further investigations. Symptoms with a 75% consensus agreement as suggestive of recurrent cancer were included in the core symptom set. Results: 27 surgeons completed the questionnaires. A total of 70.3% of centers reported standardized surveillance protocols, whereas 3.7% of surgeons did not undertake any surveillance in asymptomatic patients after OG cancer resection. In asymptomatic patients, 40.1% and 25.9% of centers performed routine imaging and endoscopy, respectively. The core set that reached consensus, consisted of eight symptoms that warranted further investigations included; dysphagia to solid food, dysphagia to liquids, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, regurgitation of foods, unexpected weight loss and progressive hoarseness of voice. Conclusion: There is global variation in monitoring patients after OG cancer resection. Eight symptoms were identified by the consensus process as important in prompting radiological or endoscopic investigation for suspected recurrent malignancy. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to link surveillance strategies to survival outcomes and evaluate prognostic value.</jats:p>",

Studies have established the pathological role of platelets in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, although the underlying mechanism of action remains largely unclear. In this study, we created an I/R mouse model via middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) and analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of the ipsilateral and contralateral cortices using RNA-seq. We found that cerebral I/R injury induced platelet invasion and accumulation in the cerebral cortex by stimulating TNF-α secretion from activated astrocytes in the ischemic region, while TNF-α expression enhanced platelet reactivity through the RIP1/RIP3/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the inoculation of TNF-α-stimulated platelets aggravated I/R injury in mice, whereas the administration of anti-TNF-α antibodies at the onset of reperfusion alleviated ischemic damage. The RNA-seq results further showed that AP-1 transcriptionally activated TNF-α in the I/R-injured cortex by directly binding to the promoter region. These findings provide novel insights into the pathological role of platelets activated by reactive astrocyte-derived TNF-α in cerebral I/R injury.</jats:p>",

Numerous efforts have been made to mitigate COVID-19 symptoms and reduce the death rate. We conducted literature mining of more than 250 thousand published works and curated the 174 most widely used COVID-19 medications. Overlaid with the human protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, we used Steiner tree analysis to extract a core subnetwork that grew from the pharmacological targets of ten credible drugs ascertained by the CTD database. The resultant core subnetwork consisted of 34 interconnected genes, which were associated with 36 drugs. Immune cell membrane receptors, the downstream cellular signaling cascade, and severe COVID-19 symptom risk were significantly enriched for the core subnetwork genes. The lung mast cell was most enriched for the target genes among 1355 human tissue-cell types. Human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid COVID-19 single-cell RNA-Seq data highlighted the fact that T cells and macrophages have the most overlapping genes from the core subnetwork. Overall, we constructed an actionable human target-protein module that mainly involved anti-inflammatory/antiviral entry functions and highly overlapped with COVID-19-severity-related genes. Our findings could serve as a knowledge base for guiding drug discovery or drug repurposing to confront the fast-evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and other severe infectious diseases.</jats:p>"

Yet so very little is known regarding the evolutionary genetics of speech or its relationship with the broader aspects of evolutionary development in primates. In this study, we describe a large family with evolutionary retrograde development of the larynx and wrist. The family presented with severe speech impairment and incremental retrograde elongations of the pisiform in the wrist that limited wrist rotation from 180° to 90° as in primitive primates. To our surprise, we found that a previously unknown primate-specific gene TOSPEAK had been disrupted in the family. TOSPEAK emerged de novo in an ancestor of extant primates across a 540 kb region of the genome with a pre-existing highly conserved long-range laryngeal enhancer for a neighbouring bone morphogenetic protein gene GDF6. We used transgenic mouse modelling to identify two additional GDF6 long-range enhancers within TOSPEAK that regulate GDF6 expression in the wrist. Disruption of TOSPEAK in the affected family blocked the transcription of TOSPEAK across the 3 GDF6 enhancers in association with a reduction in GDF6 expression and retrograde development of the larynx and wrist. Furthermore, we describe how TOSPEAK developed a human-specific promoter through the expansion of a penta-nucleotide direct repeat that first emerged de novo in the promoter of TOSPEAK in gibbon. This repeat subsequently expanded incrementally in higher hominids to form an overlapping series of Sp1/KLF transcription factor consensus binding sites in human that correlated with incremental increases in the promoter strength of TOSPEAK with human having the strongest promoter. Our research indicates a dual evolutionary role for the incremental increases in TOSPEAK transcriptional interference of GDF6 enhancers in the incremental evolutionary development of the wrist and larynx in hominids and the human capacity to speak and their retrogression with the reduction of TOSPEAK transcription in the affected family.</jats:p>"

Here, it is reported that secretogranin II (SgII), a vesicle matrix protein, contributes to LDCV size regulation through its liquid–liquid phase separation in neuroendocrine cells. First, SgII undergoes pH‐dependent polymerization and the polymerized SgII forms phase droplets with Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> in vitro and in vivo. Further, the Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>‐induced SgII droplets recruit reconstituted bio‐lipids, mimicking the LDCVs biogenesis.

In conclusion, it is shown that SgII is a unique intravesicular matrix protein undergoing liquid–liquid phase separation, and present novel insights into how SgII determines LDCV size and the quantal neurotransmitter release.</jats:p>",

We demonstrate that even very low decoration densities (i.e., 1 mol % cRGD) result in increased engagement and uptake by target cells as compared to peptide-free control CCPM, and that high cRGD decoration densities do not result in a proportional increase in internalization. In this context, it should be kept in mind that a more extensive presence of targeting ligands on the surface of nanomedicines may affect their pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profile. Thus, we suggest a relatively low cRGD decoration density as most suitable for in vivo application.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

The Qatar national COVID-19 testing database, encompassing a total of 2,688,232 RT-PCR tests conducted between February 5, 2020-January 27, 2021, was analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were implemented to derive the COVID-19 risk score, as a tool to identify those at highest risk of having the infection. Score cut-off was determined using the ROC curve based on maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. The score’s performance diagnostics were assessed. Logistic regression analysis identified age, sex, and nationality as significant predictors of infection and were included in the risk score. The ROC curve was generated and the area under the curve was estimated at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.63–0.63). The score had a sensitivity of 59.4% (95% CI: 59.1%-59.7%), specificity of 61.1% (95% CI: 61.1%-61.2%), a positive predictive value of 10.9% (95% CI: 10.8%-10.9%), and a negative predictive value of 94.9% (94.9%-95.0%). The concept and utility of a COVID-19 risk score were demonstrated in Qatar. Such a public health tool can have considerable utility in optimizing testing and suppressing infection transmission, while maximizing efficiency and use of available resources.</jats:p>"

Multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) is a widely used program that nominates candidate risk genes by mapping single-nucleotide polymorphism summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to gene bodies. We augmented MAGMA to create chromatin-MAGMA (chromMAGMA), a method to nominate candidate risk genes based on the presence of risk variants within noncoding regulatory elements (REs). We applied chromMAGMA to a genetic susceptibility dataset for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), a rare gynecologic malignancy characterized by high mortality. This identified 155 unique candidate EOC risk genes across five EOC histotypes; 83% (105/127) of high-grade serous ovarian cancer risk genes had not previously been implicated in this EOC histotype. Risk genes nominated by chromMAGMA converged on mRNA splicing and transcriptional dysregulation pathways. chromMAGMA is a pipeline that nominates candidate risk genes through a gene regulation-focused approach and helps interpret the biological mechanism of noncoding risk variants for complex diseases.</jats:p>",

Within the wavelength range of 1240–1650 nm, the ±2 order OAM modes are identified at each wavelength channel. The proposed E-HIPFG is ∼2.6 mm in length, which is more than one order of magnitude shorter than the conventional device, and thus may be more resistant to external disturbances, such as bending. Furthermore, the device exhibits an ultralow temperature drift of ∼5.84 pm/°C. Therefore, the proposed E-HIPFG can be a good candidate for a multichannel higher-order OAM mode converter.</jats:p>",

Orexin replacement therapy using orexin receptor agonists is expected as a mechanistic treatment for narcolepsy. Orexins act on two receptor subtypes, OX1R and OX2R, the latter being more strongly implicated in sleep/wake regulation. However, it has been unclear whether the activation of only OX2R, or both OX1R and OX2R, is required to replace the endogenous orexin functions in the brain. In the present study, we examined whether the selective activation of OX2R is sufficient to rescue the phenotype of cataplexy and sleep/wake fragmentation in orexin knockout mice.

Genetic mutations alone only explain &lt;10% of PD cases, while environmental factors, including small molecules, may play a significant role in PD. In the present work, 22 plasma (11 PD, 11 control) and 19 feces samples (10 PD, 9 control) were analyzed by non-target high-resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) coupled to two liquid chromatography (LC) methods (reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)). A cheminformatics workflow was optimized using open software (MS-DIAL and patRoon) and open databases (all public MSP-formatted spectral libraries for MS-DIAL, PubChemLite for Exposomics, and the LITMINEDNEURO list for patRoon). Furthermore, five disease-specific databases and three suspect lists (on PD and related disorders) were developed, using PubChem functionality to identifying relevant unknown chemicals. The results showed that non-target screening with the larger databases generally provided better results compared with smaller suspect lists. However, two suspect screening approaches with patRoon were also good options to study specific chemicals in PD. The combination of chromatographic methods (RP and HILIC) as well as two ionization modes (positive and negative) enhanced the coverage of chemicals in the biological samples. While most metabolomics studies in PD have focused on blood and cerebrospinal fluid, we found a higher number of relevant features in feces, such as alanine betaine or nicotinamide, which can be directly metabolized by gut microbiota. This highlights the potential role of gut dysbiosis in PD development.</jats:p>",

We assessed the performance of three classifiers in predicting functional independence for the MR CLEAN-NO IV trial cohort based on: (1) FIV alone, (2) the most important features obtained from a trained convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and (3) radiomics. Furthermore, we investigated feature importance in the radiomic-feature-based model. For outcome prediction, we included 206 patients: 144 scans were included in the training set, 21 in the validation set, and 41 in the test set. The classifiers that included the CAE and the radiomic features showed AUC values of 0.88 and 0.81, respectively, while the model based on FIV had an AUC of 0.79. This difference was not found to be statistically significant. Feature importance results showed that lesion intensity heterogeneity received more weight than lesion volume in outcome prediction.

Although immensely powerful, current implementations of calling cards in bulk experiments on populations of cells are technically cumbersome and require many replicates to identify independent insertions into the same genomic locus. Here, we have drastically reduced the cost and labor requirements of calling card experiments in bulk populations of cells by introducing a DNA barcode into the calling card itself. An additional barcode incorporated during reverse transcription enables simultaneous transcriptome measurement in a facile and affordable protocol. We demonstrate that barcoded self-reporting transposons recover in vitro binding sites for four basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors with important roles in cell fate specification: ASCL1, MYOD1, NEUROD2 and NGN1. Further, simultaneous calling cards and transcriptional profiling during transcription factor overexpression identified both binding sites and gene expression changes for two of these factors. Lastly, we demonstrated barcoded calling cards can record binding in vivo in the mouse brain. In sum, RNA-based identification of transcription factor binding sites and gene expression through barcoded self-reporting transposon calling cards and transcriptomes is an efficient and powerful method to infer gene regulatory networks in a population of cells.</jats:p>",

Suspension training with TRX (total body resistance exercise) has recently become popular among athletes and coaches. The present study aims to compare the effect of common core stability exercises with suspension exercises using TRX in amateur male soccer players with non-specific chronic back pain. Methods: The current research is a clinical trial study. The study population comprised amateur male soccer players with non-specific chronic back pain. Of whom, 30 were selected as a sample using Cochran’s formula and according to the inclusion criteria. Then, they were randomly divided into two equal groups of suspension exercises on the unstable level (15 people) and core stability on the stable level (15 people). The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to obtain the pain intensity, and the surface electromyography device and force plate were used to check the activity start time. first, the pre-test evaluations were done in the Mofaghian Neurorehabilitation Laboratory, and then the subjects performed the study exercises for 8 weeks. Moreover, after 8 weeks of training, the post-test was performed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze anthropometric characteristics, the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality of data, covariance, and the Mann-Whitney tests to compare the results between two groups at a significance level of 0.05. Results: The results of the covariance analysis test showed a significant difference in the start time of the electromyography of the muscles between the two groups of suspension exercises and common core stability exercises after 8 weeks of exercises (rectus abdominis, P=0.01; multifidus, P=0.001; transverse abdominis, P=0.001, and external oblique, P=0.001). Also, the results of the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing the pain intensity between the two groups showed a significant difference (P=0.02). Conclusion: Considering the greater effectiveness of suspension exercises compared to common core stability exercises and the existing reports that suspension exercises have a low risk of injury in connection with unnecessary high loads, the use of these exercises in people with low back pain is recommended than using a stable surface.</jats:p>"

This review summarized recent progress in noble metal-based core–shell catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The novel testing methods, performance evaluation parameters and research methods of ORR were briefly introduced. The effects of the preparation method, temperature, kinds of doping elements and the number of shell layers on the ORR performances of noble metal-based core–shell catalysts were highlighted. The difficulties of mass production and the high cost of noble metal-based core–shell nanostructured ORR catalysts were also summarized. Thus, in order to promote the commercialization of noble metal-based core–shell catalysts, research directions and prospects on the further development of high performance ORR catalysts with simple synthesis and low cost are presented.</jats:p>"

Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying gene repression in the erythroid lineage, in which SPI1 exerts an oncogenic function by blocking differentiation. We show that SPI1 represses genes by binding active enhancers that are located in intergenic or gene body regions. HDAC1 acts as a cooperative mediator of SPI1-induced transcriptional repression by deacetylating SPI1-bound enhancers in a subset of genes, including those involved in erythroid differentiation. Enhancer deacetylation impacts on promoter acetylation, chromatin accessibility and RNA pol II occupancy. In addition to the activities of HDAC1, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) reinforces gene repression by depositing H3K27me3 at promoter sequences when SPI1 is located at enhancer sequences. Moreover, our study identified a synergistic relationship between PRC2 and HDAC1 complexes in mediating the transcriptional repression activity of SPI1, ultimately inducing synergistic adverse effects on leukaemic cell survival. Our results highlight the importance of the mechanism underlying transcriptional repression in leukemic cells, involving complex functional connections between SPI1 and the epigenetic regulators PRC2 and HDAC1.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is clinically diagnosed when patients develop dementia less than a year after parkinsonism onset. Age is the primary risk factor for DLB and mitochondrial health influences ageing through effective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Patterns of stable polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) alter OXPHOS efficiency and define individuals to specific mtDNA haplogroups. This study investigates if mtDNA haplogroup background affects clinical DLB risk and neuropathological disease severity. 360 clinical DLB cases, 446 neuropathologically confirmed Lewy body disease (LBD) cases with a high likelihood of having DLB (LBD-hDLB), and 910 neurologically normal controls had European mtDNA haplogroups defined using Agena Biosciences MassARRAY iPlex technology. 39 unique mtDNA variants were genotyped and mtDNA haplogroups were assigned to mitochondrial phylogeny. Striatal dopaminergic degeneration, neuronal loss, and Lewy body counts were also assessed in different brain regions in LBD-hDLB cases. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to assess associations between mtDNA haplogroups and risk of DLB or LBD-hDLB versus controls in a case-control analysis. Additional appropriate regression models, adjusted for age at death and sex, assessed associations of haplogroups with each different neuropathological outcome measure. No mtDNA haplogroups were significantly associated with DLB or LBD-hDLB risk after Bonferroni correction.Haplogroup H suggests a nominally significant reduced risk of DLB (OR=0.61, P=0.006) but no association of LBD-hDLB (OR=0.87, P=0.34). The haplogroup H observation in DLB was consistent after additionally adjusting for the number of <jats:italic>APOE</jats:italic> ε4 alleles (OR=0.59, P=0.004). Haplogroup H also showed a suggestive association with reduced ventrolateral substantia nigra neuronal loss (OR=0.44, P=0.033). Mitochondrial haplogroup H may be protective against DLB risk and neuronal loss in substantia nigra regions in LBD-hDLB cases but further validation is warranted.</jats:p>",
