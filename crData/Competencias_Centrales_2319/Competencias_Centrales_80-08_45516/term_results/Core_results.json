Accurate determination of oil in place was influenced by several characteristics common to relatively shallow California sands:water salinity is low and varies with depth,clays contribute significantly to electrical conductivity,sands are loosely consolidated so that restoration of overburden pressure significantly changes core-measured properties, andthe thick formation is made up of distinct thin strata.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>These factors complicate interpretation of each measurement method used: core measurements of saturations, irreducible water saturations, and porosities, plus log measurements of porosities and saturations using density, neutron, resistivity, pulsed neutron capture, electromagnetic propagation time, and nuclear magnetism logs. Confidence in the accuracy of measured porosity and fluid saturations is enhanced by the approximate agreement between measurements using different and independent physical properties.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Coring and Core Handling</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Cores were obtained using a 5.2-in.

From 563 ft (172 m) cored, 465 ft (142 m) of core was recovered. Cores were forced from the core barrel into 3-ft (0.9-m) lengths of plastic tubing and sealed with plastic caps. They then were frozen quickly to the temperature of dry ice and stored in a cold storage locker until analyzed. A slab approximately 1 in.

The group-velocity criterion based upon Kelvin's corresponding dispersion relation predicts whether a certain asymptotic wave pattern appears upstream or downstream of the obstacle. The analysis leads to amplitude singularities for the standing waves at certain critical radii of the core. The particularly interesting case of a counter-helix for which the wave energy is propagating upstream appears for a first-mode angular disturbance. For this situation it seems to be possible that the helix ends in a hydraulic jump and is continued by a counter-helix downstream, as the core size gradually diminishes due to the deceleration of the flow caused by viscous effects (not included in the analysis). The capillary-wave pattern produced by surface tension is also considered. A brief outline for the analogous wave problem is given for the case where the fluid rotates like a rigid body.</jats:p><jats:p>Photographic observations of hollow-core vortices in water flow are presented which confirm the qualitative predictions of the analysis, both for the response to an axisymmetric area contraction and also to a 90Â° bend at the downstream end of the vortex tube.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Structurally, the murine leukemia virus consists of a core, which forms\n                        at the cell surface membrane, and an envelope, composed principally of host\n                        lipid and virus-specified glycoprotein, which is acquired as the core\n                        emerges through the cell membrane during budding. The core is composed of\n                        four proteins (p30, p15, p12, and p10), initially translated as part of\n                        larger precursor polypeptides, whereas the major virus surface glycoprotein,\n                        gp70, is initially part of a separate precursor, also containing a 15000 MW\n                        moiety (pl5E) which is highly hydrophobic and thought to be embedded within\n                        the membrane. Our present work is directed toward determining some of the\n                        associations which exist between these molecules just prior to, and at the\n                        onset of budding.</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>We have previously demonstrated that the onset of the budding process is\n                        marked on the cell surface by the aggregation of 10nm particles (knobs) into\n                        small clusters (1). These knobs have been shown to consist of approximately\n                        three gp70 molecules, and to be dispersed on the generalized cell surface\n                        prior to budding (2, 3). As the budding process continues, the virus surface\n                        becomes increasingly covered with knobs, while the core components\n                        simultaneously aggregate at the subjacent cytoplasmic surface. We have\n                        verified the transmembrane associations of these viral components prior to\n                        budding by antibody-mediated ferritin labelings of the cell surface as well\n                        as of the cell interior. Employing NIH/3T3 cells infected with a\n                        temperature-sensitive mutant (ts25) of Rauscher murine leukemia virus and\n                        producing no virus at 39Â° although all necessary protein components are\n                        present, we have demonstrated that areas of the cell surface, which are\n                        heavily labeled using anti-gp70 serum, protrude slightly and overlie dense\n                        areas of the cytoplasm which, in turn, are labeled using anti-p30\n                        serum.</jats:p>",
