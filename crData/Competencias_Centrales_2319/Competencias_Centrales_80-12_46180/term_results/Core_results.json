Asymptotic series are derived and then employed to compute profiles of stresses within the wound material for several cases of practical interest. A parametric analysis of the influence of core elasticity on structural integrity of the roll underscores the indispensable support provided by the core at the inner boundary of the roll. Results show that the circumferential stress in the vicinity of the core strongly depends on core stiffness. A relation that is derived between interlayer pressure and circumferential stress at the core boundary may be useful as a guide in core design and in preventing roll collapse.</jats:p>",

To facilitate SCF calculations on NiO clusters, we have derived effective core potentials to represent the Ni++ ion core. Different potentials were obtained for a valence electron with spin parallel and for one with spin antiparallel to the core spin. The potentials were tested in calculations for Ni ions and for a NiO molecule embedded in a matrix of point charges. Comparison is made where possible with previous all-electron calculations and with experiment. The present pseudopotentials afford some prospects for realistic calculations of anion–anion interionic forces in NiO.</jats:p>",

Option 3 seems to be precluded by terrestrial lead isotope data, and the alternatives each raise substantial questions concerning the mechanics, chemistry, and petrology of the earth's early history.

Within the centromeric regions, the cores frequently appeared more intensely stained than elsewhere in the chromosome. The nucleolus organizers also stained darkly and appeared to be attached to the core-like structures.

The Hugoniot data demonstrate a transformation at 13±1 GPa to a phase with an apparent zero‐pressure density of 3.7±0.2 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. A comparison of the inferred isentrope of KFeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (high‐pressure phase) with those of Fe, FeS<jats:sub>0.9</jats:sub>, and FeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> indicates that the atomic volume of potassium in KFeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is approximately twice that of iron at 75 GPa. In the temperature and pressure range of the experiments, potassium fails to meet the empirical Hume‐Rothery and Raynor (HRR) criterion for solubility of an element in iron, namely, that the molar volume of the element should not exceed that of iron by a factor greater than ∼1.4. However, both the applicability of the HRR solubility criterion and the inferred isentrope of KFeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at high pressure are uncertain. Thermochemical calculations of the partitioning of K between a sulfide and silicate phase (e.g., KFeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and KAlSiO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> or KAlSi<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> (hollandite)) indicate that pressure does not have a pronounced effect on the relative stability of solid KFeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and potassium aluminosilicate high‐pressure phases. The calculations suggest that the high‐pressure phase of KFeS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> would not be stable in relation to KAlSiO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> (kalsilite) in the upper mantle, or in relation to KAlSi<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> (hollandite) in the lower mantle. However, the calculations do not bear directly on the question of partitioning of K into an iron sulfide melt from lower mantle aluminosilicate phases. Although the present results cannot absolutely rule out the hypothesis that a large fraction of the terrestrial potassium budget has dissolved into a molten iron sulfide‐bearing core, the present analysis of the pressure‐volume relation for potassium, iron, iron sulfides, potassium aluminosilicate, and potassium iron sulfide yields no evidence in support of this hypothesis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The surface of the iron core of ferritin was investigated by 1H NMR using small probe molecules which have different sizes and charges. It was shown that the parameter k, which is the linewidth for each NMR probe normalized by the total concentration of iron in ferritin, is dependent on the content of phosphorus in ferritin. At pH 7.4, the k values are 1–10 for positively charged probes, 2×10−2–8×10−2 for negatively charged probes and 0.1–0.2 for neutral probes. Above pH 7, the k values for positively charged probes increase with an increase in pH, whereas those for negatively charged probes decrease. By contrast, the k values for neutral probes remain constant over the entire pH range. It was concluded that the k values reflect the mode of interactions of small molecules with the phosphate which exists on the surface on the iron core of ferritin, and that these interactions are determined primarily by the electrostatic force between the small molecules and the negative charge of the phosphate of ferritin. Furthermore, it was shown by using t-butylamine as a probe that K+ ion binds strongly to ferritin and that chelating agents interact with ferritin in a wide concentration range.</jats:p>",

However, incubation of HTG2 virus with avian myoblastosis virus was found to yield specific cleavage products of p65.</jats:p>",
