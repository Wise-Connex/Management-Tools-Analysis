      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investment decisions on land imaging data buys, partnering opportunities, technologies, and system acquisition are becoming increasingly complex as the number of Earth-observing satellites increases rapidly, aircraft sensors and unmanned aerial system platforms improve, the community of data providers and users grows, and the pace of technology development, computing, and data storage expansion accelerates. Building on a growing foundation of user needs, the USGS is developing an architecture scorecard system comparing capabilities to user needs to meet the following objectives:&amp;amp;#160; (1) help identify gaps in meeting needs, (2) evaluate proposed and notional land imaging architectures, and (3) study the evolution of enterprise-wide land imaging capability as existing systems reach end of life and new systems become available over timescales of years to a decade. This flexible evaluation system can adapt to changing land imaging needs and capabilities and will evolve from an early, basic capacity to support near-term decisions to increasingly higher fidelity to enable more comprehensive and precise assessments under conditions of increasing complexity. The system will support the evaluation of land imaging systems as standalone capabilities or as suites of capabilities, beginning with a core architecture and expanding to supporting and proposed capabilities. It will be easily adaptable to different evaluative frameworks such as societal benefit areas, organizations, departmental strategic goals and objectives, and technologies (e.g., lidar, radar, optical, satellite, or aircraft).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Measurement of Financial Perspective performance using profit margins and return on invetment, measurement of customer perspective performance using customer acquisition aspects, customer retention, and pelagic profitability. Measurement of internal business process perspective performance using water-meter replacement aspect. Measurement of growth and learning perspective performance using employee training aspects. The results showed that the financial perspective is poor, because the company has not increased the sales volume of water well, causing the water sales turnover could not cover the cost-operational costs. The performance of the customer's perspective is poor, due to the average every year the number of new customers is not comparable to the number of subscribers as a result of the unoptimized service provided. Performance of internal business perspective is less good, this is due to management less attention to the change of meter whose economic age is over, causing a lot of water meter that is not functioning properly.  The performance of the growth and learning erspective is lacking, this is because management pays attention to the development of employee-specific employee skills through technical training training. In general, the performance of the PDAM management Tirta Benari Bajawa is said to be less good, so that the management of the company should improve the service to customers through the distribution of water continuously every day so as to increase the volume Water sales and cover operational costs.</jats:p>"

The main goal of this paper is researching the applicability of the balanced scorecard model in small- and medium-sized companies as the basis for a model for assessing innovative activities in the Republic of Slovakia and the Republic of Serbia. First, a hypothetical model was created based on theoretical data from world scientific articles.

One of the concerns relates to the corporatization of public sector entities, which can lead to the erosion of the public interest. Sensitivities are especially high with higher education. However, increasing budget deficits and a focus on financial stewardship is driving more public entities toward the adoption of these techniques. One tool that has become widely adopted in this regard is the balanced scorecard (BSC). We attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the BSC model to publicly funded post-secondary institutions by developing a strategy map based upon stakeholder expectations. Multi-dimensional relationships between key success factors (KSFs) are explored with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. Our paper contributes to the public policy debate on the purported role of higher education while identifying causal relationships between KSFs for the purpose of strategy implementation.</jats:p>",

Afterwards, it features an inductive research that involved semi-structured interview sessions with academic members of staff. The interpretative study relied on the balanced scorecard’s (BSC) approach as it appraised the participants’ opinions and perceptions on their higher education institution’s (HEI) customer, internal, organizational capacity and financial perspectives. The findings have revealed the strengths and weaknesses of using the BSC’s financial and non-financial measures to assess the institutional performance and the productivity of individual employees. In sum, this research reported that ongoing performance conversations with academic employees will help HEI leaders to identify their institutions’ value-creating activities. This contribution implies that HEI leaders can utilize the BSC’s comprehensive framework as a plausible, performance management tool to regularly evaluate whether their institution is (i) delivering inclusive, student-centred, quality education; (ii) publishing high-impact research; (iii) engaging with internal and external stakeholders; and (iv) improving its financial results, among other positive outcomes. </jats:p>",

This research used a quantitative survey to identify the current state of IT governance for five higher education institutions in East Java, Indonesia. The questionnaires were distributed to post-graduate student as IT executives in their higher education institution. A total of 34 out of 40 post academic staffs completed the questionnaire, representing a response rate of 85 percent. This study found that attributes for deliver value (V2), attainment and retain people with key competencies (V6), capture knowledge to improve performance (V10), stakeholder satisfaction (V11), reach economies of scale (V17) , deliver successul IT project (V19), understand business unit strategies (V20), and understand emerging technologies (V22) show no significant difference (p 0.05) between mean interests and performance. In addition to these, other 15 attributes show significant differences in the t-test in the negative direction. This points to the fact that actual control of IT governance in colleges is monitored less than expected. Therefore, five higher education institutions in East Java should pay more attention to the identified attributes important to balance the gap between the importance and performance of these attributes. </jats:p>"

Penulis akan mengukur tingkat kematangan pada bagian penerapan pengaturan dan perencanaannya. Penulis menggunakan 10 domain yaitu PO1, PO2, P03, PO4, PO5, PO6, PO7, PO8, PO9 dan PO10. Untuk BSC modelnya, penulis menggunakan perspektif internal perusahaan. Untuk tingkat kematangan didapat pada domain PO1 dan PO6 dengan nilai 3, sedangkan terendah terdapat pada domain PO7 dengan nilai 1,5. Rekomendasi untuk domain PO adalah mematangkan lagi rencana penerapan TI pada perusahaan, terutama dalam menetapkan hubungan proses TI dengan organisasi, memaksimalkan investasi TI yang ada, serta lebih memperhatikan lagi resiko resiko yang ada dari kehadiran TI. Berdasarkan hasil yang didapatkan penulis, penulis memberikan saran kepada perusahaan untuk memperhitungkan resiko TI pada masa mendatang agar perencanaan perusahaan kedepannya lebih baik. Penulis juga menggunakan Balanced Scorecard untuk melihat perspektif dari proses bisnis internal dan perspektif pembelajaran, dan pertumbuhan. Dari perspektif proses bisnis internal, perusahaan sudah cukup baik dalam menjalankan proses bisnis, sedangkan dari perspektif pembelajaran dan pertumbuhan, perusahaan juga sudah cukup baik.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As supply chain management involves several criteria, its performance evaluation is a challenge for industrial managers. Researchers have proposed several approaches for such evaluations, among them, Balanced Scorecard (BSC) highlights. Academic papers on BSC applications for evaluating supply chain performance has an expressively increased in recent years. Considering that examining published papers on a topic is a way of monitoring the emergence of a new field, this study aims to explore, through bibliometry, papers published in indexed journals (SCOPUS and Web of Science databases). This paper weaves an overview of academic production and study trends on BSC for performance evaluation of supply chains. Findings help researchers and managers to understand the state of the art, to identify gaps and to identify future trends. The results also showed the maturation of studies over the years. The predominance of publications in journals with impact factor (Thomson Reuters) also has been noticed. The development of the theme in emerging countries can be useful for increasing the competitiveness of their companies. In summary, this study is helpful for influencing future studies and publications of researchers interested in performance evaluation of supply chains based on BSC and may orient new researchers so that they directly know which journals to consult and which technical procedures to explore.</jats:p>"

As one promising performance management tools, BSC was originally designed for the private sector institution, but later gaining its popularity among the public institutions. How well BSC implementation is possibly determined by some Critical Success Factors (CSFs). This study examined some CSFs in the BSC implementation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) Indonesia using a qualitative study with an interactive model by Miles at al., (2014). This study found that BSC implementation brought changes in the MoFA’s performance, despite the absence of organizational changes for BSC adaptation. Top and middle management attention for the implementation and training and education are the most determining factors in the BSC implementation in MoFA. This study support the importance of the four CSFs examined in this study in implementing BSC in public sector.</jats:p>",

The relevance of the issue is due, on the one hand, to global trends in innovative development, and on the other hand, to the incompliance of performance of the post-socialist industrial enterprises with the characteristics of innovative development. The creation of mechanisms for improving the enterprise’s competitiveness and its appropriate assessment based on the use of advanced management practices and technologies is becoming increasingly relevant.&#x0D;\nThe purpose of study is to improve methodological approach to the BSC-based assessment of competitiveness of a value-oriented enterprise, and to substantiate the prospects of effective integration of the BSC into the existing enterprise management system. This research paper justifies the possibility of using various methodological forms, including the simplest ones, of the Balanced Scorecard, which features a transformational nature, in the process of forming a balanced strategic management of enterprise. Methodical approach has been proposed for identification of the enterprise strategy directed at increase of its market value and strategic competitiveness. Matrix analysis was applied to assess the enterprise performance indicators; it revealed a relationship between the enterprise's competitive position and class of its innovation BSC-based strategies. To assess the enterprise’s competitiveness, an integral index of its investment attractiveness has been proposed, and to assess the class of the enterprise innovative strategies, an integral index of the enterprise innovations was calculated. The proposed methodological approach was used to perform expert sampling within the frame of indicators for determining the investment attractiveness and innovativeness of a metallurgical enterprise by the criteria of strategic orientation, efficiency and functionality. The study has analyzed the experience gained by the leading enterprises of Ukraine’s metallurgical complex in using BSC in a limited methodological format as a tool for identifying the strategy of an enterprise, assessing its competitiveness, innovativeness and investment attractiveness. The result of the study was the conclusion about the possibility of applying the simplest Balanced Scorecard forms as a catalyst for innovative transformations and developing balanced enterprise management in transition economies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recognizing the state of the universities and disrupting their functions by performance evaluation helps them adopt more appropriate educational, research and institutional policies to conduct a university system. In this paper, the importance of the services provided and the activities of the university are determined by means of the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach, and the performance assessment structure is implemented based on an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. For this purpose, interdependencies between BSC aspects and effective indicators weight are determined by Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL) and Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) methods, respectively. Accordingly, the final weight of the effective indexes on the performance evaluation of university is presented and the educational income is recognized as one of the most important indicators. Finally, the priorities of universities are specified in order to improve the performance and policy making by the importance-performance analysis (IPA). Therefore, the growth of the number of students should be considered as one of the most important stages in improving university performance in the future in order to achieve educational income. Moreover, the guidelines for universities and higher education institutions are presented to identify key factors in implementing and improving performance.</jats:p>",

Para tanto, utilizou-se de pesquisa-ação realizada numa organização de pequeno porte, onde os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas. Os gestores da organização foram questionados acerca de 145 indicadores apontados como os mais abordados na literatura nacional. Assim, os indicadores identificados como utilizados na organização estudada foram distribuídos em uma tabela conforme relação com cada uma das perspectivas do BSC. Identificou-se que a maior parte dos indicadores utilizados concentram-se na perspectiva financeira, não apresentando o equilíbrio entre as perspectivas proposto por Kaplan e Norton, criadores do BSC. Os resultados deste estudo convergem com os resultados de pesquisas similares, apontando a preferência das organizações por métricas financeiras em relação às métricas não financeiras</jats:p>"

In this study, we focus on the automated teller machine (ATM) site selection problem for a public bank in İstanbul. Twenty-five districts, which are located at the European side of İstanbul, are designated as ATM candidate districts. The balanced scorecard (BSC) model is modified to determine the criteria according to the literature review and experts’ judgments for this problem. Internal, Customer, and Financial perspectives of the traditional BSC model are used as the main criteria and an external perspective is considered as the fourth criterion for modified balanced scorecard. The experts’ criteria evaluations are gained and consolidated by the Modified Delphi Method. The criteria weights are determined by the Pythagorean Fuzzy-AHP method using the final pairwise comparison results obtained from the Modified Delphi Method. Subsequently, the Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to determine the best alternative site among alternatives to locate the ATM according to these criteria. Finally, the results are presented and discussed by sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>",
