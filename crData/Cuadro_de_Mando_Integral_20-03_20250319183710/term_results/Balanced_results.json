      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Geophysical flows such as the atmosphere and the ocean are characterized by rotation and stratification, which together give rise to two dominant motions: the slow balanced and the fast unbalanced motions. The interaction between the balanced and unbalanced motions and the energy transfers between them impact the energy and momentum cycle of the flow, and is therefore crucial to understand the underlying energetics of the atmosphere and the ocean. Balanced motions, for instance mesoscale eddies, can transfer their energy to unbalanced motions, such as internal gravity waves, by spontaneous loss of balance amongst other processes. The exact mechanism of wave generation, however, remain less understood and is hindered to an extent by the challenge of separating the flow field into balanced and unbalanced motions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This separation is achieved using two different balancing procedures in an identical model setup and assess the differences in the obtained balanced state and the resultant energy transfer to unbalanced motions. The first procedure we implement is a non-linear initialisation procedure based on Machenhauer (1977) but extended to higher orders in Rossby number. The second procedure implemented is the optimal potential vorticity balance to achieve the balanced state. The results show that the numerics of the model affect the obtained balanced state from the two procedures, and thus the residual signal which we interpret as the unbalanced motions, i.e. internal gravity waves.&amp;amp;#160; A further complication is the presence of slaved modes, which appear along the unbalanced motions but are tied to the balanced motions, for which we need to extend the separation to higher orders in Rossby number. Further, we assess the energy transfers between balanced and unbalanced motions in experiments with different Rossby numbers and for different orders in Rossby number. We find that it is crucial to consider the effect of the numerics in models and make a suitable choice of the balancing procedure, as well as diagnose the unbalanced motions at higher orders to precisely detect the unbalanced wave signal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated. Dynamic excitatory– inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How does the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a general theory of plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly, but significantly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.</jats:p>"

In a recent work, Fernandez et al (2019) collected 196 different future climate change projections over Spain, considering data from ENSEMBLES, ESCENA, EURO- and Med-CORDEX, along with their driving global climate projections from CMIP3 and CMIP5. This ensemble mixed different multi-model initiatives in an ensemble of opportunity, in the sense that it does not respond to any scientific design beyond the exploration of multi-model uncertainty. This ensemble of opportunity is not only the result of the mixture of different initiatives, but also responds to the lack of a balanced experimental design within most of the initiatives. Many of the initiatives -especially those unfunded, such as CORDEX- are carried out on a voluntary basis, with no strong constraint in the global climate models (GCMs) used as boundary conditions or in the number of contributing members per regional climate model (RCM).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fernandez et al (2019) found in this ensemble a strong influence of the driving GCM on the regional climate change signal, along with favored GCMs, selected by many regional climate modelling groups to the detriment of GCMs publishing their output later or not at all. In this work, we quantitatively assess the impact of unbalanced GCM-RCM ensembles. For this purpose, we subsampled the ensemble of opportunity to obtain balanced sets of members according to different &amp;amp;#8220;what-if&amp;amp;#8221; situations: What if all RCMs had contributed a single member to the ensemble? What if each GCM had been dynamically downscaled only once? What if a given GCM/RCM had not contributed to the ensemble?

A differential-mode (DM) passband with a steep filtering performance is realized by applying microstrip stub-loaded resonators (SLRs). Meanwhile, six varactors are loaded to the SLRs to achieve the center frequency (CF) and bandwidth adjustment, respectively. U-type microstrip lines integrated with stepped impedance slotline resonators are utilized as the differential feedlines, which suppress the common-mode (CM) intrinsically, making the DM responses independent of the CM ones. A tuning center frequency from 3.2 to 3.75 GHz and a fractional bandwidth (12.1–17.6%) with more than 10 dB return loss and less than 2.3 dB insertion loss can be achieved by changing the voltage across the varactors. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results is observed. To the best of authors' knowledge, the proposed balanced-to-balanced tunable FPD is first ever reported.</jats:p>",

In focusing on a set of four poems that he had written in May and June of that year—“Vergissmeinnicht,” “Aristocrats,” “How to Kill,” and “Enfidaville”—I propose that the cynic and lyric met for Douglas as two forms of special knowing, the “combat gnosticism” of war poetry, and a parallel gnosticism in love lyric. Each proposes that a special experience can utterly transform a subject: the soldier’s kind of knowing transformed by battle experience, and the lover’s by the experience of a beloved’s body. Douglas’s poetry arrives at the balancing of cynic and lyric, then, by confusing and conflating these special gnostic conditions, and its resonant image is the battlefield corpse conflated with the lover in repose.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the possible climate change and increased pace of urbanization in the century, urban flooding has caused more and more attentions nowadays. Shallow water equations are widely used to reproduce the flow hydrodynamics of flooding around the urban areas, which have been proved a powerful tool for flood risk assessment and evacuation management, like river flow or flowing at drainage networks with irregular cross-sections at 1D scale. Over the last two decades, Godunov-type schemes have became popular for its robustness treating complex flow phenomenons. When tacking complex topography in the framework of Godunov-type scheme, sourer term needs to be treated property to preserve steady state, that flux gradient and sourer term are balanced. Capart et al. (2003) reconstructed the momentum flux by considering the balance of hydrostatic pressure with the approximated water surface level, which has the ability to tackle the irregular and non-prismatic channel flow with complex topography. This approximation is exact for two cases: 1) rectangular and prismatic channel; 2) water surface is horizontal. However, for other cases, approximation is employed to achieve the hydrostatic equilibrium, which has reduced the accuracy of the numerical solution and increased the complexity for the model implementation.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this work, we present a new well-balanced numerical scheme for simulating 1D frictional shallow water flow with irregular cross-sections over complex topography involving wetting and drying. The proposed scheme solves, in a finite volume Godunov-type framework, a set of pre-balanced shallow water equations derived by considering pressure balancing (Liang and Marche, 2009). HLL approximated Riemann solver is adopted for the flux calculation at the cell interface. Non-negative reconstruction of Riemann state (Audusse et al., 2004) and local bed modification (Liang, 2010) produce stable and well-balanced solutions to shallow water flow hydrodynamics. Bed slope source term can be approximated using central difference and no special treatment is needed for wet and dry bed. The friction source term is discretized using a splitting implicit scheme and limiting value of friction force is used to ensure stability for the dry bottom (Liang and Marche, 2009). The new numerical scheme is validated against two theoretical benchmark tests and then compared with the validated shallow water model with circular and trapezoid cross-sections over complex topography involving wetting and drying. This method is also possible to reproduce the mixed flow in the conduit or for the flow with non-prismatic channel like river flow in the near future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Audusse, E., Bouchut, F., Bristeau, M.

This paper depends on an exhaustive writing audit from BSC and Six Sigma. The writing survey gives the premise to another joining system dependent on the PDCA cycle. The discoveries of this paper show how coordinated frameworks can add further esteem contrasted with the autonomous execution of either BSC or Six Sigma. This investigation gives a structure that can fill in as a reason for the reconciliation of Six Sigma with BSC. This paper adopts another strategy to joining structures by recognizing purposes of incorporation influence through the qualities and shortcomings of BSC and Six Sigma. The fundamental commitment of this paper is that it gives new experiences into seeing how BSC can be coordinated with Six Sigma. In addition, this paper gives guidance for future research that will defeat shortcomings in the manner associations are coordinating BSC with Six Sigma today.</jats:p>"

An original strategy for problem solving was developed to optimize the imbalance phenomenon. The phenomenon was studied both by simulation and experimentation using several different runner systems at various thermo-rheological material parameters and process operating conditions. Three optimization procedures were applied, Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Taguchi method, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Operating process parameters: the injection rate, melt temperature, and mold temperature, as well as the geometry of the runner system were optimized. The imbalance of mold filling as well as the process parameters: the injection pressure, injection time, and molding temperature were optimization criteria. It was concluded that all the optimization procedures improved filling imbalance. However, the Artificial Neural Networks approach seems to be the most efficient optimization procedure, and the Brain Construction Algorithm (BSM) is proposed for problem solving of the imbalance phenomenon.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the relationship between the perception of time and immigrants’ psychological adaptation (i.e. affective aspects of migration) based on a sample of 238 Ukrainians residing in Poland. To assess time perception we drew primarily from time perspective theory which defines time perspective as a measure of the degree to which individuals non-consciously construe the past, the present and the future. Psychological adaptation was assessed with focus on participants’ basic psychological needs satisfaction, satisfaction with life and psychological condition. We observed relatively strong negative relationship between negative past and fatalistic present time perspectives and psychological adaptation. Additionally, it was found that more balanced and less negative temporal profile, was related to significantly better psychological adaptation of immigrants. We discuss the results in light of cultural validity of time perspective theory, destructive impact of negative time perspective on migrants’ psychological wellbeing and potential application of time perspective-based therapy in integration interventions for immigrants.</p>"

Therefore, a power-stealing detection model is proposed, which is based on Improved Conditional Generation Adversarial Network (CWGAN), Stacked Convolution Noise Reduction Autoencoder (SCDAE) and Lightweight Gradient Boosting Decision Machine (LightGBM). The model performs Generation- Adversarial operations on the original unbalanced power consumption data to achieve the balance of electricity data, and avoids the interference of the imbalanced data set on classifier training. In addition, the convolution method is used to stack the noise reduction auto-encoder to achieve dimension reduction of power consumption data, extract data features and reduce the impact of random noise. Finally, LightGBM is used for power theft detection. The experiments show that CWGAN can effectively balance the distribution of power consumption data. Comparing the detection indicators of the power-stealing model with various advanced power-stealing models on the same data set, it is finally proved that the proposed model is superior to other models in the detection of power stealing.</jats:p>"

Focus is first given to Gough’s and LaBerge and Samuels’ information processing models (bottom-up models) followed by the psycholinguistic, schema, and transactional reader response top-down theories. Discussion of both the bottom-up and top-down theoretical approaches includes background information on notable theorists and explanations of specific theories that are instrumental in enriching the teaching of reading in a variety of classroom settings to a variety of students. Literature relevant to these theories is reviewed, and practical classroom implications of implementing these theories are explored to provide educators with hands-on tools and suggestions they can use to improve and enrich literacy instruction for all their students. Finally, a case is made for why educators should call upon multiple theories when making instructional decisions. </jats:p>"

We hypothesized that adults aged 40–77 years with cataracts would show an association with metabolic syndrome and its components and have different dietary patterns and lifestyles.\nMethods\n\nThe study was performed using the Korean genome and epidemiology study (KoGES; a large-scale hospital-based cohort study) data collected during 2004–2013. Subjects were classified as cases(945 cataract patients) and controls(27,454 healthy controls) based on responses to the question \"have you ever been diagnosed to have a cataract?”.\nResults\n\nThe presence of metabolic syndrome had a significant positive association with cataract risk after adjusting for age, sex, resistance area, BMI and energy intake(model 1; by 1.23-fold) and socioeconomic parameters(model 2; 1.15-fold). Plasma glucose and HbA1c concentrations also exhibited a higher cataract risk by 1.92- and 2.07-fold, respectively. For the analysis we used four dietary patterns to represent Korean food intake, that is, a traditional balanced diet, a meat and fish diet, a bread and cookie diet, and a grain-based diet. High traditional balanced diet consumption had a negative association with cataract risk(OR = 0.84), but high grain-based diet consumption exhibited a positive association with cataract risk(OR = 1.41). Systolic blood pressure and high carbohydrate intake(OR = 1.42) were also associated with cataract risk in model 1, but high fat and protein intake showed negative associations(OR = 0.74 and 0.74, respectively).\nConclusions\n\nThe risk of cataract development was found to be positively associated with metabolic syndrome, high systolic blood pressure, and hyperglycemia and negatively associated with a traditional balanced diet.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>BACKGROUND: Apparently balanced chromosome rearrangements (ABCRs) in non-affected individuals are well-known to possess high reproductive risks such as infertility, abnormal offspring, and pregnancy loss. However, caution should be exercised in genetic counseling and reproductive intervention because cryptic unbalanced defects and genome structural variations beyond the resolution of routine cytogenetics may not be detected. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we studied two familial cases of ABCRs were recruited in this study. In family 1, the couple suffered two abortions  pregnancies and underwent labor induction. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of the aborted sample from the second pregnancy revealed a 10.8 Mb heterozygous deletion at 10q26.13q26.3 and a 5.5 Mb duplication at 19q13.41-q13.43. The non-affected father was identified as a carrier of three-way complex chromosomal rearrangement [t(6;10;19)(p22;q26;q13)] by karyotyping. Whole-genome mate-pair sequencing revealed a cryptic breakpoint on the derivative chromosome 19 (der19), indicating that the karyotype was a more complex structural rearrangement comprising four breakpoints. Three genes, <jats:italic>FAM24B, CACNG8, </jats:italic>and <jats:italic>KIAA0556,</jats:italic> were disrupted without causing any abnormal phenotype in the carrier. In family 2, the couple suffered from a spontaneous miscarriage. This family had an affected child with multiple congenital deformities and an unbalanced karyotype, 46,XY,der(11)t(6;11)(q13;p11.2). The female partner was identified as a balanced translocation carrier with the karyotype 46,XX,t(6;11)(q13;p11.2)dn. Further SNP array and fluorescent <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> hybridization (FISH) indicated a cryptic insertion between chromosome 6 and chromosome 11. Finally, whole-genome mate-pair sequencing revealed an extremely complex genomic structural variation, including a cryptic deletion and 12 breakpoints on chromosome 11, and 1 breakpoint on chromosome 6 .CONCLUSIONS: Our study investigated two rare cases of ABCRs and demonstrated the efficacy of whole-genome mate-pair sequencing in analyzing the genome complex structural variation. In case of ABCRs detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques, whole genome sequencing (WGS) based approaches should be considered for accurate diagnosis, effective genetic counseling, and correct reproductive intervention to avoid recurrence risks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background : N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T are released during myocardial wall stress and/or ischemia and are strong predictors for postoperative cardiovascular complications. However, the effect of goal-directed crystalloid versus colloid administration on NT-proBNP and troponin T, especially in relatively healthy patients undergoing moderate- to high risk abdominal surgery, still remains unclear. Thus, we evaluated in this subanalysis the effect of a goal-directed crystalloid versus a goal-directed colloid fluid regimen on postoperative cardiac outcome. Methods: 30 patients were randomly assigned to receive additional fluid boluses of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and 30 patients to receive lactated Ringer´s solution. Intraoperative fluid management was guided by oesophageal Doppler according to a previously published algorithm. The primary outcome were differences of maximum NT-proBNP (maxNT-proBNP) and maximum troponin T (maxTnT)  concentrations during the first two postoperative days between both study groups. We defined maxNT-proBNP and maxTnT as maximum values measured 2 hours after surgery and on the first and second postoperative day. Results: In total 56 patients were analysed. There was no significant difference in postoperative maximum NT-proBNP between the colloid group (258.7 ng/L (IQR 199.4 to 782.1)) and the crystalloid group (440.3 ng/L (IQR 177.9 to 691.2)) during the first 2 postoperative days ( P = 0.29). 5 patients in the colloid group and 7 patients in the crystalloid group developed MINS ( P = 0.75). Conclusions: Postoperative cardiac outcome as defined by cardiac biomarkers was not significantly affected by goal-directed colloid administration; however, there was a tendency of lower maximum NT-proBNP concentrations in patients receiving colloids.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The New Guinea Orogen evolved by the accretion of volcanic arcs onto the northern Australian margin during the Cenozoic arc-continent collision. Since that time, the northern Australian margin has undergone oblique convergence with Pacific plate involving volcanic arcs and intra-oceanic basin in between. The resulting FTBs are the Papuan FTB, the Mobile Belt and the Aure-Moresby FTB belonging to the curved shape New Guinea Highlands.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Previous regional structural studies were focus to the Central Papuan FTB. Concerning the Aure-Moresby FTB, few studies based mainly on field work describe a highly deformed Neogene underfilled foreland basin with mixed carbonate-siliciclastic deposits. One regional cross-section through the onshore Aure-Moresby FTB is proposed by Kugler during his PhD in 1967. In this regard, some lack of consistency about the regional structural style can be highlighted such as the different timing and amount of shortening between the Papuan and Aure-Moresby FTBs and the large N-S positive flower structure to explain the uplift of the Aure FTB.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main goals of this study on the Aure-Moresby Foreland FTB are: (i) to discuss the impact of the mechanical stratigraphy on structural style, (ii) to estimate the significance of basement involvement and its morphology, (iii) to determine the shortening by comparing the regional balanced and restored cross sections, (iv) to estimate the relative ages of tectonic deformation and to propose a 2D kinematic model illustrating the evolution of the orogenic system since the Late Cretaceous.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For this purpose, 2D seismic profiles, chronostratigraphic synthesis, remote sensing mapping, wells and gravimetric data have been integrated in order to construct a consistent structural evolutionary model of the Aure FTB. This study is mainly focused on the interpretation of NE-SW trending 2D seismic lines in Move software to build a balanced cross-section from the hinterland to the foreland Aure foredeep.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study shows that the Aure-Moresby FTB structure is the result of thin-skinned deformation along Late Cretaceous, Miocene and Pliocene detachment levels affected by recent thick-skinned deformation. The section is characterized by multiple fault-propagation folds detached at various level within the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. In the central Aure FTB, two main structural steps show major uplifts that correspond to the wide Dude Anticlinorium and the Kapau Margin interpreted as crustal scale thrusting rooted at the brittle/ductile transition and connected with the Cretaceous d&amp;amp;#233;collement level. Crustal scale deformation seems to be transmitted into Mesozoic and Cenozoic decollements and disharmonic levels forming the frontal folded zone. In the frontal Aure FTB, Miocene carbonate may be involved in the deformation forming potentially Pleistocene structural traps. Based on flexural slip restoration technique, 28 km of shortening have been calculated within the sedimentary cover along 250 km that correspond to a ratio of 11,2 %.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Visual Dialog task requires a model to exploit both image and conversational context information to generate the next response to the dialogue. However, via manual analysis, we find that a large number of conversational questions can be answered by only looking at the image without any access to the context history, while others still need the conversation context to predict the correct answers. We demonstrate that due to this reason, previous joint-modality (history and image) models over-rely on and are more prone to memorizing the dialogue history (e.g., by extracting certain keywords or patterns in the context information), whereas image-only models are more generalizable (because they cannot memorize or extract keywords from history) and perform substantially better at the primary normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) task metric which allows multiple correct answers. Hence, this observation encourages us to explicitly maintain two models, i.e., an image-only model and an image-history joint model, and combine their complementary abilities for a more balanced multimodal model. We present multiple methods for this integration of the two models, via ensemble and consensus dropout fusion with shared parameters. Empirically, our models achieve strong results on the Visual Dialog challenge 2019 (rank 3 on NDCG and high balance across metrics), and substantially outperform the winner of the Visual Dialog challenge 2018 on most metrics.</jats:p>"

The drinks were cow's milk, bananas, spinach and pumpkin were used as plant material and chia seeds were used as a source of unsaturated fatty acids. Using mathematical planning, the criterion equations for beverages characterizing the maximum content of basic nutrients have been formed. Computer simulation of beverage recipes was performed in Excel Solver in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which formalized qualitative and quantitative indicators of balanced nutrients. In computer-aided design, optimization for each selected indicator was used by paired with the recommended nutrient content of FAO / WHO. Formulations of pumpkin, spinach and banana beverages were obtained in which the content of basic nutrients was 18,889 g, 17,664 g and 21,329 g per 100 g, respectively. Analysis of the chemical composition showed that the ratio of proteins: fats: carbohydrates is 1: 1.45: 3.03 for the drink \"Pumpkin\", 1: 1.34: 2.57 for the drink \"Spinach\" and 1: 1.5: 4 , 27 for the Banana drink. The ALST method determines the storage conditions of developed beverages, taking into account changes in sensory and microbiological parameters. Determination of optimal storage conditions by estimation of changes in organoleptic parameters makes it possible to state that the developed beverages will be competitive in the establishments of the restaurant industry of Ukraine. A study of changes in the microbiota of finished beverages within 4 hours at (4 ± 2) ° C in a closed glass container showed that, in the presence of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, the beverages meet the current regulatory requirements.

Common requirements are for: buyers trading with multiple sellers of different or identical items, buyers trading with sellers through transporters and mediators, and sellers trading with multiple buyers. We attempt to address these settings.We generalize Segal-Halevi et al.

Our generalization refines the notion of competition in multi-sided auctions by introducing the concepts of external competition and trade reduction.

The current EBAF Ed4.1 data product combines observations from Terra and Aqua after July 2002. However, the Terra satellite will start to drift in Mean Local Time (MLT) in early 2021, and Aqua’s MLT will start to drift in 2022. To ensure the EBAF record remains temporally stable, we explore the feasibility of using only CERES instruments from afternoon satellite orbits with a tight 1330 MLT after July 2002. We test this approach by directly comparing SW TOA fluxes generated after applying diurnal corrections to Aqua-only and to Terra + Aqua for 07/2002–06/2019. We find that global climatological mean SW TOA fluxes for these two cases are within 0.01 Wm−2 and the trend of the difference is &lt; is 0.03 Wm−2 per decade.</jats:p>"

Due to their low cost and prospective use, WSNs have drawn interest in various applications over the last years. Since sensor nodes are equipped with limited battery, it is vital energy consumption be carefully monitored. Therefore, minimizing the node energy consumption is clearly essential to extend the network lifetime. In this paper, a fuzzy‐based unequal clustering protocol is proposed. Not only does the proposed protocol prolong the network lifetime, but it also balances the load among nodes. Former protocols do not consider load balancing. Fuzzy logic is employed considering four inputs: residual energy, distance to a base station, node degree and centrality. To validate its efficiency, the novel protocol is compared with other relevant protocols. The obtained results prove that the protocol here proposed outperforms other state‐of‐the‐art protocols.</jats:p>",

Afterwards, it features an inductive research that involved semi-structured interview sessions with academic members of staff. The interpretative study relied on the balanced scorecard’s (BSC) approach as it appraised the participants’ opinions and perceptions on their higher education institution’s (HEI) customer, internal, organizational capacity and financial perspectives. The findings have revealed the strengths and weaknesses of using the BSC’s financial and non-financial measures to assess the institutional performance and the productivity of individual employees. In sum, this research reported that ongoing performance conversations with academic employees will help HEI leaders to identify their institutions’ value-creating activities. This contribution implies that HEI leaders can utilize the BSC’s comprehensive framework as a plausible, performance management tool to regularly evaluate whether their institution is (i) delivering inclusive, student-centred, quality education; (ii) publishing high-impact research; (iii) engaging with internal and external stakeholders; and (iv) improving its financial results, among other positive outcomes. </jats:p>",

In general, we can expect that some quantitative parameters of tectonic events will be associated with such processes, so they can be used to solve the inverse problem of recognizing quantity and nature of geodynamic processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Greater Caucasus is a well-studied Alpine structure, within which the sedimentary cover (total thickness of 10-15 km) has a thin layering, deformed in small and moderate-sized folds. The folded structure was described in 24 detailed profiles with a total length about 500 km. Using a special method of sections balancing, models of the sedimentary cover were compiled, based on the balance of the sediments volume and the shortening values. By the method, profiles were divided into 505 &amp;quot;folded domains&amp;quot;, for which their pre-folded states were restored. Then, the pre-folded domains were combined into 78 &amp;quot;structural cells&amp;quot;, for which their shortening values were estimated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For calculations, a three-stage&amp;amp;#8217;s conditional model of the development of the Greater Caucasus was adopted: 1) sedimentation (Jurassic-Eocene), 2) shortening and folding formation (Oligocene), 3) uplift and erosion (post-Oligocene). Six parameters were digitized in the structural cells: the depth of the basement top for development stages (1, 3, 4), the shortening value (2), the amplitude of uplift and erosion (5), the difference between the depths of the basement top in stages 3 and 1 (6). Obviously, these parameters are directly related to geodynamic processes of the Greater Caucasus formation. The calculation of the correlation matrix showed the presence of such strong correlations between a numbers of parameters, which may have a genetic sense. Factor analysis was used to clarify all these relationships. It showed the presence of two well-defined factors that explain the main dispersion of the six parameters. Factor (process) F1 (named ISOSTASY) has a weight of 46.6%, the loads on parameters 1-6 were 0.790, -0.195, 0.665, 0.982, 0.005 and 0.853. Process F1 showed the dependence of the actual depth of the basement top (4) on its first value (1), which is clearly associated with isostasy and necessarily indicates an increase of the density of the crust rocks up to mantle values. The F2 factor (named SHORTENING) has a weight of 40.2%, the loads amounted to 0.022, 0.938, -0.736, -0.158, 0.957, -0.219. Factor (process) F2 indicated the dependence of the uplift amplitude (5) on the shortening value (2), which can also be associated with isostasy and changes in the density of the crust and mantle rocks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The calculation of the crust layer thicknesses for a part of the structure during the development, in which it has an isostatic equilibrium, showed its gradual degradation from 40 km (before a sedimentation) to 14 km after sedimentation and to present 19 km after folding and uplift (9.5 km without shortening influence).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yakovlev F.L., Gorbatov E.S., 2018.

One of the concerns relates to the corporatization of public sector entities, which can lead to the erosion of the public interest. Sensitivities are especially high with higher education. However, increasing budget deficits and a focus on financial stewardship is driving more public entities toward the adoption of these techniques. One tool that has become widely adopted in this regard is the balanced scorecard (BSC). We attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the BSC model to publicly funded post-secondary institutions by developing a strategy map based upon stakeholder expectations. Multi-dimensional relationships between key success factors (KSFs) are explored with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. Our paper contributes to the public policy debate on the purported role of higher education while identifying causal relationships between KSFs for the purpose of strategy implementation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research aims to formulate a conceptual model of balanced scorecard for public sector organization, especially for the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, based on international best practices. Key success factors for implementating the model and the challenges are the other objectices of this research. It employed explanatory case study research as methodology to achieve the research objectives. 2 main protocols for collecting empirical evidences, namely document analysis and archival records study, were carried out for later scrutiny using explanation building techniques and analytic generalization as method of analysis. The results of this research not only display, but also define what a balanced scorecard model for public sector organization should be looked like as the model aligns with organizational characteristics and strategic plan. In order to achieving a successful implementation, continuous improvement should be applied to the model. No less important is to obtain top management support to boost the full implementation of the model so that it will improve LIPI’s performance as well as its goals achievement.Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk merumuskan model konseptual balanced scorecard bagi organisasi sektor publik, dalam hal ini Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, berdasarkan praktik terbaik di dunia internasional, serta apa saja faktor yang menjadi kunci sukses implementasi model tersebut dan apa saja tantangan implementasinya. Metodologi riset studi kasus eksplanatori digunakan untuk untuk mencapai tujuan penelitian tersebut. 2 protokol utama untuk pengumpulan bukti empiris, analisis artikel seminal dan studi dokumen internal, dijalankan untuk kemudian dielaborasi dengan menggunakan teknik explanation building dan analytic generalization. Hasil penelitian ini tidak hanya menyuguhkan, bahkan juga mendefinisikan seperti apa bentuk model konseptual balanced scorecard yang selaras dengan karakteristik organisasi dan sasaran strategis yang hendak dicapai dalam 5 tahun terakhir.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We investigate the drift wave–zonal flow interaction formulated on a channel domain geometry approximating an isolated plasma edge region with zero net radial transport across the boundary. The recent two-field flux-balanced Hasegawa–Wakatani (BHW) model with improved treatment for a parallel electron response is adapted to the channel geometry configuration, which allows for generalized non-uniform zonal density profiles and is valid for the simulation of turbulent fields near the tokamak or stellarator edge regions. New conserved quantities are constructed based on the channel geometry to help the analysis for the competition between zonal states and non-zonal fluctuations. Effective bounds can be found constraining the maximum growth of total fluctuations and the amplitude of the dominant zonal state based on the conserved quantities. Total statistical variance among all the modes can also be estimated depending on the zonal state strength. The theoretical discoveries are confirmed by detailed numerical experiments from simulations in the channel domain. In addition, the channel geometry provides further support for the important advantage of adopting the balanced flux correction in the BHW model by showing a physically consistent growth rate from a stability analysis for the small-amplitude fluctuation interaction with a prescribed zonal mean profile, in comparison with the persistent instability and strong outward transport found in the modified Hasegawa–Wakatani model even with the increasing zonal density profile. This is again confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the two models. The channel domain BHW model framework with attractive features implies many potential applications in the study of the complex phenomena in plasma edge turbulence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cross-modal retrieval aims to retrieve the relevant samples across different modalities, of which the key problem is how to model the correlations among different modalities while narrowing the large heterogeneous gap. In this paper, we propose a Semi-supervised Multimodal Learning Network method (SMLN) which correlates different modalities by capturing the intrinsic structure and discriminative correlation of the multimedia data. To be specific, the labeled and unlabeled data are used to construct a similarity matrix which integrates the cross-modal correlation, discrimination, and intra-modal graph information existing in the multimedia data. What is more important is that we propose a novel optimization approach to optimize our loss within a neural network which involves a spectral decomposition problem derived from a ratio trace criterion. Our optimization enjoys two advantages given below. On the one hand, the proposed approach is not limited to our loss, which could be applied to any case that is a neural network with the ratio trace criterion. On the other hand, the proposed optimization is different from existing ones which alternatively maximize the minor eigenvalues, thus overemphasizing the minor eigenvalues and ignore the dominant ones. In contrast, our method will exactly balance all eigenvalues, thus being more competitive to existing methods. Thanks to our loss and optimization strategy, our method could well preserve the discriminative and instinct information into the common space and embrace the scalability in handling large-scale multimedia data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are carried out on three widely-used multimodal datasets comparing with 13 state-of-the-art approaches.</jats:p>"

The transportation system is the most important strategic link of social and economic development of the country, one of the most dynamic, multiplicative and promising segments of the market, which makes 12.5 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Russian Federation. An analysis of transport activity has demonstrated a smoldering recession over the last years which is accompanied by reduction of values for the most important resulting indicators. Strategic benchmarks of developing transportation activity are objectified by the consumers’ demands not only in safe, but in comfortable life medium with high environmental characteristics and aesthetic requirements. The satisfaction of such requirements is possible under condition of large-scale modernization of transportation sphere with the use of breakthrough scientific and technical solutions in all segments of human activity. All this can afford ground that it is necessary to change fundamentally an approach to investigating properties, peculiarities and factors of the transportation system development that provokes modernization of the control system for providing a balanced innovative trend and high standards of population life quality. The results of the investigations have shown that important factors of transportation system development are the following: fair competition, freedom of economic activity, development of market mechanisms, corporate culture and moral values. Study of functioning and scientific approaches to balancing innovative development of the transportation system of the Russian Federation has made it possible to create a conceptual vision and methodological basis with due account of main principles of systems theory, self-organization and synergetics and present it in brief in the given paper.</jats:p>"

This research used a quantitative survey to identify the current state of IT governance for five higher education institutions in East Java, Indonesia. The questionnaires were distributed to post-graduate student as IT executives in their higher education institution. A total of 34 out of 40 post academic staffs completed the questionnaire, representing a response rate of 85 percent. This study found that attributes for deliver value (V2), attainment and retain people with key competencies (V6), capture knowledge to improve performance (V10), stakeholder satisfaction (V11), reach economies of scale (V17) , deliver successul IT project (V19), understand business unit strategies (V20), and understand emerging technologies (V22) show no significant difference (p 0.05) between mean interests and performance. In addition to these, other 15 attributes show significant differences in the t-test in the negative direction. This points to the fact that actual control of IT governance in colleges is monitored less than expected. Therefore, five higher education institutions in East Java should pay more attention to the identified attributes important to balance the gap between the importance and performance of these attributes. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>This paper deals with the lifetime problem in the Internet of Things. We first propose an efficient cluster‐based scheme named “Cuckoo‐search Clustering with Two‐hop Routing Tree (CC‐TRT)” to develop a two‐hop load‐balanced data aggregation routing tree in the network. CC‐TRT uses a modified energy‐aware cuckoo‐search algorithm to fairly select the best cluster head (CH) for each cluster. The applied cuckoo‐search algorithm makes the CH role to rotate between different sensors round by round. Subsequently, we extend the CC‐TRT scheme to present two methods for constructing multi‐hop data aggregation routing trees, named “Cuckoo‐search Clustering with Multi‐Hop Routing Tree (CC‐MRT)” and “Cuckoo‐search Clustering with Weighted Multi‐hop Routing Tree (CC‐WMRT).” Both CC‐MRT and CC‐WMRT rely on a two‐level structure; they not only use an energy‐aware cuckoo‐search algorithm to fairly select the best CHs but also adopt a load‐balanced high‐level routing tree to route the aggregated data of CHs to the sink node. However, CC‐WMRT slightly has a better performance thanks to its low‐level routing strategy. As an advantage, the proposed schemes balance the energy consumption among different sensors. Numerical results show the efficiency of the CC‐TRT, CC‐MRT, and CC‐WMRT algorithms in terms of the number of transmissions, remaining energy, energy consumption variance, and network lifetime.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the adequate effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil to prevent pain due to propofol injection. Methods: A total of 160 adults scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving normal saline (group S) or remifentanil at a Ce of 2 (group R2), 3 (group R3), or 4 (group R4), administered via target-controlled infusion, followed by the injection of 2 mg/kg of propofol (delivered with 1% lipid propofol). The severity and incidence of injection pain were assessed on a four-point scale. Results: The incidence of propofol injection pain was significantly lower in group R2, R3, or R4 than in group S (30%, 5%, or 2.5% vs. 70%, respectively). Moreover, the intensity of the pain was lesser in group R2, R3, or R4 than in group S. However, the incidence or severity of injection was not different between groups R3 and R4. Conclusions: During the induction of balanced anesthesia using propofol injection, pretreatment with remifentanil at a target Ce of 3 ng/ml effectively reduced propofol injection pain in adults. </jats:p>",

Interaction parameter χ and surfactant concentration φsb complement the model definition. The phase diagram in χ–φsb coordinates is known to feature two lines of critical points, the Scott and Leibler lines. Only upon imposing a finite distance between the interfaces, we observe that the Scott line meets the Leibler line. We refer to this as a Lifshitz point (LP) for real systems. We add regions that are relevant for microemulsions to this phase diagram by considering the saturation line, which connects (χ, φsb)-points for which the interface becomes tensionless. Crossing this line implies a first-order phase transition as internal interfaces develop, characteristic for one-phase microemulsions. The saturation line ends at the so-called microemulsion point (MP). The MP is shown to connect with the LP by a line of MP-like critical points, found by searching for a “MP” while the distance between interfaces is fixed. A pair of binodal lines that envelop the three-phase (Winsor III) microemulsion region is shown to connect to the MP. The cohesiveness of the middle phase in Winsor III is related to non-monotonic, inverse DLVO-type interaction curves between the surfactant-loaded tensionless interfaces. The mean and Gaussian bending modulus, relevant for the shape fluctuations and the topology of interfaces, respectively, are evaluated along the saturation line. Near the MP, both rigidities are positive and vanish in a power-law fashion with coefficient unity at the MP. Overseeing these results proves that the MP has a pivoting role in the physics of microemulsions.</jats:p>",

Theoretical analysis expresses that the frequency ratio can be controlled by suitable selecting of the element values and the number of designing cells of the CRLH TLs. Furthermore, desired impedances and electrical lengths of DGSs are obtained at the frequency of common‐mode rejection by using even‐ and odd‐mode analyses. To validate the proposed structure, a dual‐band BS crossover operating at 1.8 and 4.2 GHz is fabricated. Measurement results show that the fabricated proposed structure has good performance at the designed frequency bands.</jats:p>",

In particular, we propose to use the readily available information of clauses and word length distribution to model similar languages. The modeling and classification are based on the hypothesis that languages are self-adaptive complex systems and hence can be classified by dynamic features describing the system, especially in terms of distributional relations of constituents of a system. For similar languages whose grammatical differences are often subtle, classification based on dynamic system features should be more effective. To test this hypothesis, we considered both regional and genre varieties of Mandarin Chinese for classification. The data are extracted from two comparable balanced corpora to minimize possible confounding factors. The two corpora are the Sinica Corpus from Taiwan and the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese from Mainland China, and the two genres are reportage and review. Our text classification and correspondence analysis results show that the linguistically felicitous two-level constituency model combining power functions between word and clauses effectively classifies the two varieties of Chinese for both genres. In addition, we found that genres do have compounding effect on classification of regional varieties. In particular, reportage in two varieties is more likely to be classified than review, corroborating the complex system view of language variations. That is, language variations and changes typically do not take place evenly across the board for the complete language system. This further enhances our hypothesis that dynamic complex system features, such as the power functions captured by the Menzerath–Altmann law, provide effective models in classifications of similar languages.</jats:p>",

The water-air regime of the drained lands and the parameters influencing it (a drainage drain, a level of ground waters) is considered as an ecological indicator, and economic – increase of productivity of lands. The studies were carried out at the experimental experimental field, drained by closed drainage with backfilling of the drainage trench of the sand-gravel mixture to the arable horizon (control), two-tier drainage and a combination of with deep loosening. The analysis of the results of the study showed that the experimental combined drainage system was set aside 88% more runoff compared with control; in the excessively wet growing season (25% probability of precipitation), the system of two-tier drainage there was the lowest level of groundwater and soil moisture; the effect of deep loosening began to decrease by 3 year of operation of combined drainage, so it is recommended to carry out deep loosening on loamy soils every 3 years; from the ecological and economic point of view the most balanced option is the combined two-tier drainage.</jats:p>",

Mathematical models that maximize this balanced growth rate while accounting for mass conservation, reaction kinetics, and limits on dry mass per volume are inevitably non-linear. Here, we develop a general theory for such models, termed Growth Balance Analysis (GBA), which provides explicit expressions for protein concentrations, fluxes, and growth rates. These variables are functions of the concentrations of cellular components, for which we calculate marginal fitness costs and benefits that are related to metabolic control coefficients. At maximal growth rate, the net benefits of all concentrations are equal. Based solely on physicochemical constraints, GBA unveils fundamental quantitative principles of cellular resource allocation and growth; it accurately predicts the relationship between growth rates and ribosome concentrations in<jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>and yeast and between growth rate and dry mass density in<jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

Technological schemes for chamber excavation of floors in ascending order have been developed, which make it possible to abandon the formation of ore pillars, thereby increasing the extraction of ore from the bowels, and using the worked out space for waste storage in the form of a dry backfill. Based on economic and mathematical modeling and a comprehensive assessment according to the environmental and economic criterion for the conditions of mining in a new step of one of the largest iron ore deposits in Russia the most effective option of geotechnical strategy has been established. Use of an ascending-descending order of floor mining with an optimal ratio of mining systems with laying out the worked out space and systems with collapse depending on the content of the useful component in the ore mined, the amount of space mined current tab and the volume of tailings used as backfill material, allows to utilize the entire volume of mining and processing waste in the mined out space and effectively to develop of reserves in a new step.</jats:p>",

This process, also called school redistricting, is non-trivial due to (1) the presence of multiple design criteria such as capacity utilization, proximity and travel time which are hard for planners to consider simultaneously, (2) the fixed locations of schools with widely differing capacities that need to be balanced, (3) the spatial nature of the data and the need to preserve contiguity in school zones, and (4) the difficulty in quantifying local factors that may arise. Motivated by these challenges and the intricacy of the process, we propose a geospatial clustering algorithm called GeoKmeans for assisting planners in designing school boundaries such that students are assigned to proximal schools while ensuring effective utilization of school capacities. The algorithm operates on polygonal geometries and connects them into geographically contiguous school boundaries while balancing problem-specific constraints. We evaluate our approach on real-world data of two rapidly growing school districts in the US. Results indicate the efficacy of our approach in designing boundaries. Additionally, a case study is included to demonstrate the potential of GeoKmeans to assist planners in drawing boundaries.</jats:p>"

Considering that examining published papers on a topic is a way of monitoring the emergence of a new field, this study aims to explore, through bibliometry, papers published in indexed journals (SCOPUS and Web of Science databases). This paper weaves an overview of academic production and study trends on BSC for performance evaluation of supply chains. Findings help researchers and managers to understand the state of the art, to identify gaps and to identify future trends. The results also showed the maturation of studies over the years. The predominance of publications in journals with impact factor (Thomson Reuters) also has been noticed. The development of the theme in emerging countries can be useful for increasing the competitiveness of their companies. In summary, this study is helpful for influencing future studies and publications of researchers interested in performance evaluation of supply chains based on BSC and may orient new researchers so that they directly know which journals to consult and which technical procedures to explore.</jats:p>"

Como objetivos específicos: a) analisar a realidade estratégica da instituição; b) identificar quais os pontos de melhorias do batalhão na visão dos policiais militares que fazem parte de seu efetivo; c) analisar o plano estratégico atual do batalhão, enfocando a formulação dos objetivos nas quatro perspectivas estabelecidas no BSC e relações de causa e efeito. Utilizou-se uma abordagem qualitativa por ter sido realizada uma entrevista semiestruturada com o analista criminal da Secretaria de Estado da Segurança e da Defesa Social da Paraíba (SESDS), para entender a realidade estratégica da instituição e quantitativa por ter sido aplicado questionários com amostragem de 146 policiais que respondem ao 1° batalhão na intenção de identificar o ponto de vista dos policiais militares frente a instituição. Assim, foi possível propor o BSC e suas relações de causa e efeito, traçando estratégias e métricas para todas as perspectivas, mas com ênfase na perspectiva sociedade, pois se trata da principal razão de criação de valor. Espera-se que os resultados apresentados contribuam tanto para o meio acadêmico como para a PMPB, uma vez que a aplicabilidade do BSC pode influenciar na melhoria de gestão.</jats:p>"

In the case of the scattering states, we obtain expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients. In the case of the resonance states we obtain the characteristic equation that defines their complex energies. We show that finding approximate complex energies of the resonance states reduces to calculating polynomial roots from certain characteristic polynomial. Some cases of interest are numerically implemented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study is performed to characterize composite material of hybrid carbon glass reinforced polymer (C/GFRP) of two (2) types; namely balanced cross ply and quasi isotropic subjected to tensile and flexural loading. The mechanical testing performed on the hybrid composite as per ASTM standard and aimed to extract the mechanical properties related to tensile and flexural. The failure modes associated with the rupture of the composites/hybrid composites samples under tensile and three-point bending were assessed via JEOL 6010 Plus Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) instrument. The combination of GFRP lay-up at 0° at tensile side, GFRP lay-up 90° at compression side and ±45° lay-up of CFRP at shear/compression region enable the hybrid composite cross ply 8 to record the highest flexural strength. The substitution of 0° GFRP with 0° layup CFRP together with layup of 90° GFRP in hybrid composite cross ply 4, matrix/resin dominated layup acts as stress reliever in compression region during flexural loading taking place. This has induced to the increase of flexural strength, which observed to improve its original constituent of cross ply 2 (balanced cross ply GFRP). The factor of layup GFRP at transverse direction has enabled hybrid composite to possess a higher tensile modulus and to record considerably high tensile strength. The role of GFRP layup in enhancing the strain to failure in tensile and its role as a reliever in improving flexural strength during flexural loading has been tested and justified in this experiment.</jats:p>"

Finally, the priorities of universities are specified in order to improve the performance and policy making by the importance-performance analysis (IPA). Therefore, the growth of the number of students should be considered as one of the most important stages in improving university performance in the future in order to achieve educational income. Moreover, the guidelines for universities and higher education institutions are presented to identify key factors in implementing and improving performance.</jats:p>",

The relevance of the issue is due, on the one hand, to global trends in innovative development, and on the other hand, to the incompliance of performance of the post-socialist industrial enterprises with the characteristics of innovative development. The creation of mechanisms for improving the enterprise’s competitiveness and its appropriate assessment based on the use of advanced management practices and technologies is becoming increasingly relevant.&#x0D;\nThe purpose of study is to improve methodological approach to the BSC-based assessment of competitiveness of a value-oriented enterprise, and to substantiate the prospects of effective integration of the BSC into the existing enterprise management system. This research paper justifies the possibility of using various methodological forms, including the simplest ones, of the Balanced Scorecard, which features a transformational nature, in the process of forming a balanced strategic management of enterprise. Methodical approach has been proposed for identification of the enterprise strategy directed at increase of its market value and strategic competitiveness. Matrix analysis was applied to assess the enterprise performance indicators; it revealed a relationship between the enterprise's competitive position and class of its innovation BSC-based strategies. To assess the enterprise’s competitiveness, an integral index of its investment attractiveness has been proposed, and to assess the class of the enterprise innovative strategies, an integral index of the enterprise innovations was calculated. The proposed methodological approach was used to perform expert sampling within the frame of indicators for determining the investment attractiveness and innovativeness of a metallurgical enterprise by the criteria of strategic orientation, efficiency and functionality. The study has analyzed the experience gained by the leading enterprises of Ukraine’s metallurgical complex in using BSC in a limited methodological format as a tool for identifying the strategy of an enterprise, assessing its competitiveness, innovativeness and investment attractiveness. The result of the study was the conclusion about the possibility of applying the simplest Balanced Scorecard forms as a catalyst for innovative transformations and developing balanced enterprise management in transition economies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mechanical assist devices in refractory cardiac arrest are increasingly employed. We compared the hemodynamics and organ perfusion during cardiac arrest with either veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or biventricular assisted circulation combining left- and right-sided impeller devices (BiPella) in an acute experimental setting. Twenty pigs were randomized in two equal groups receiving circulatory support either by ECMO or by BiPella during 40 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) followed by three attempts of cardioversion, and if successful, 60 minute observation with spontaneous, unsupported circulation. Hemodynamic variables were continuously recorded. Tissue perfusion was evaluated by fluorescent microsphere injections. Cardiac function was visualized by intracardiac echocardiography. During VF device output, carotid flow, kidney perfusion, mean aortic pressure (AOP<jats:sub>mean</jats:sub>), and mean left ventricular pressure (LVP<jats:sub>mean</jats:sub>) were all significantly higher in the ECMO group, and serum-lactate values were lower compared with the BiPella group. No difference in myocardial or cerebral perfusion was observed between groups. In 15 animals with sustained cardiac function for 60 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation, left ventricular subendocardial blood flow rate averaged 0.59 ± 0.05 ml/min/gm during VF compared with 0.31 ± 0.07 ml/min/gm in five animals with circulatory collapse (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> = 0.005). Corresponding values for the midmyocardium was 0.91 ± 0.06 <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">vs.</jats:italic> 0.65 ± 0.15 ml/min/gm (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> = 0.085). Both BiPella and ECMO could sustain vital organ function. ECMO provided a more optimal systemic circulatory support related to near physiologic output. Myocardial tissue perfusion and sustained cardiac function were related to coronary perfusion pressure during VF, irrespective of mode of circulatory support.</jats:p>",

Para tanto, utilizou-se de pesquisa-ação realizada numa organização de pequeno porte, onde os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas. Os gestores da organização foram questionados acerca de 145 indicadores apontados como os mais abordados na literatura nacional. Assim, os indicadores identificados como utilizados na organização estudada foram distribuídos em uma tabela conforme relação com cada uma das perspectivas do BSC. Identificou-se que a maior parte dos indicadores utilizados concentram-se na perspectiva financeira, não apresentando o equilíbrio entre as perspectivas proposto por Kaplan e Norton, criadores do BSC. Os resultados deste estudo convergem com os resultados de pesquisas similares, apontando a preferência das organizações por métricas financeiras em relação às métricas não financeiras</jats:p>"

The balanced scorecard (BSC) model is modified to determine the criteria according to the literature review and experts’ judgments for this problem. Internal, Customer, and Financial perspectives of the traditional BSC model are used as the main criteria and an external perspective is considered as the fourth criterion for modified balanced scorecard. The experts’ criteria evaluations are gained and consolidated by the Modified Delphi Method. The criteria weights are determined by the Pythagorean Fuzzy-AHP method using the final pairwise comparison results obtained from the Modified Delphi Method. Subsequently, the Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to determine the best alternative site among alternatives to locate the ATM according to these criteria.

Under the differential‐mode (DM) operation, the cascaded trisection coupling topology with source‐load coupling is constructed. Thus, 3 adaptive TZs are generated for the DM responses, which improves the passband selectivity and stopband suppression. Under the common‐mode (CM) operation, the short stubs and lumped elements are added at the symmetric plane which effectively improves the CM suppression. Using the advanced matrix synthesis, a demonstrative BAL‐FA‐BPF is designed with stable CABW and controlled by single‐DC‐bias. The measured frequency tuning range of the DM passband is 2.0 to 3.0 GHz (40%) and 3 dB‐bandwidth is kept at 174 ± 3 MHz (±1.7%). The CM suppression is better than 25 dB.</jats:p>",

The high mortality rate induces the need for making the effort to reduce the number of people with diabetes by conducting studies that lead to making a diagnosis so that can detect a person with diabetes accurately. This study tries to compare the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm without Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique in diagnosing diabetes on imbalanced datasets. The parameters tested are the k value of the K-Nearest Neighbors and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. The testing is carried out using the K-Fold Cross Validation strategy. The data used in this study were 3876 data from Pertamina Central Hospital. Based on the results of tests conducted, it shows that the value of accuracy produced in diagnosing diabetes by using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique is better than the accuracy produced without using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with the highest accuracy increase of 8.25%. The highest average accuracy is obtained when the value of k = 3 in the K-Nearest Neighbors, k = 5 in the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, and fold = 10, which reaches 78.06%.</jats:p>",

In particular, Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are very well suited for the resolution of the shallow water equations (SWE) and related models, being a competitive alternative to the traditional finite volume schemes. In this work, a novel framework for the construction of DG schemes using augmented Riemann solvers is proposed. Such solvers incorporate the source term at cell interfaces in the definition of the Riemann problem, allowing definition of two different inner states in the so-called star region. The benefits of this family of solvers lie in the exact preservation of the Rankine–Hugoniot condition at cell interfaces at the discrete level, ensuring the preservation of equilibrium solutions (i.e. the well-balanced property) without requiring extra corrections of the numerical fluxes. The semi-discrete DG operator becomes nil automatically under equilibrium conditions, provided the use of suitable quadrature rules. The proposed scheme is applied to the Burgers' equation with geometric source term and to the SWE. The numerical results evidence that the proposed scheme achieves the prescribed convergence rates and preserves the equilibrium states of relevance with machine precision.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Post-tensioned balanced cantilever reinforced concrete (RC) bridges allow the economic spanning of wide spans using fewer columns than in more traditional bridges. More and more post-tensioned balanced cantilever bridges are constructed every year all round the world. The aim of this study was to investigate numerically the effects of near-fault vertical ground motions (VGMs) on the seismic behaviour of segmentally constructed, balanced cantilever RC bridges. Two long bridges constructed in Artvin, Turkey – the three-span Budan Bridge and the two-span Sengan Bridge – were selected for the application. Three-dimensional finite-element models (FEMs) of the bridges were created to obtain their dynamic characteristics such as natural frequencies and mode shapes numerically. The frequencies calculated from the FEMs of the bridges were then verified using experimental frequencies measured from ambient vibration tests. Acceleration records of near-fault earthquakes (1992 Erzincan (M = 6·69), 1999 Kocaeli (M = 7·51), 1999 Düzce (M = 7·14) and 1989 Loma Prieta (M = 6·93)) were selected for the seismic analyses. The seismic behaviours of the verified FEMs of the bridges with two and three spans were determined by considering horizontal, vertical and combined horizontal and vertical components of the earthquakes. It was found that near-fault VGM significantly affects the seismic response of segmentally constructed, balanced cantilever bridges. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with holes, designing efficient routing protocols, which prolong the network lifetime, is one of the most critical issues. To this end, this paper proposes a new geographic routing protocol for WSNs named the load Balanced and constant Stretch protocol for bypassing Multiple Holes (i.e., BSMH). In contrast to the existing works in the literature, the design of BSMH simultaneously takes into account the three factors that impacted the network lifetime, including routing path length, control packet overhead, and load balance among the nodes. Moreover, BSMH aims at minimizing the routing path length and the control overhead, while maximizing the load balance. We theoretically prove the efficiency of BSMH and extensively evaluate BSMH against the state-of-the-art protocols. The evaluation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms the others in various investigated metrics, not only network lifetime, but also routing path stretch, load balance, and control overhead. Specifically, BSMH prolongs the network lifetime by     30 %     compared to the existing protocols while guaranteeing that the routing path stretch is under     1.3    .</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background Rates of opioid prescribing tripled in the United States between 1999 and 2015 and were associated with significant increases in opioid misuse and overdose death. Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of: (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics.Methods/Design The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The study’s primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study’s primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics.Discussion Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive. The results of this study promise to help us understand how to cost effectively improve the implementation of evidence-based practices.Trial registration NCT 04044521 (ClinicalTrial.gov).

An effective vaccine to prevent TB is considered the most cost-effective measure for controlling this disease. Many different vaccine antigen (Ag) candidates, including well-known and newly identified Ags, have been evaluated in clinical and preclinical studies. In this study, we took advantage of a plant system of protein expression using Nicotiana benthamiana to produce N-glycosylated antigen 85A (G-Ag85A), which is one of the most well-characterized vaccine Ag candidates in the field of TB vaccines, and compared its immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy with those of nonglycosylated Ag85A (NG-Ag85A) produced with an Escherichia coli system. Notably, G-Ag85A induced a more robust IFN-γ response than NG-Ag85A, which indicated that G-Ag85A is well recognized by the host immune system during Mtb infection. We subsequently compared the vaccine potential of G-Ag85A and NG-Ag85A by evaluating their immunological features and substantial protection efficacies. Interestingly, G-Ag85A yielded moderately enhanced long-term protective efficacy, as measured in terms of bacterial burden and lung inflammation. Strikingly, G-Ag85A-immunized mice showed a more balanced proportion of multifunctional Th1-biased immune responses with sustained IFN-γ response than did NG-Ag85A-immunized mice. Collectively, plant-derived G-Ag85A could induce protective and balanced Th1 responses and confer long-term protection against a hypervirulent Mtb Beijing strain infection, which indicated that plant-produced G-Ag85A might provide an excellent example for the production of an Mtb subunit vaccine Ag and could be an effective platform for the development of anti-TB vaccines.</jats:p>"

Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods/design</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The study’s primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study’s primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive. The results of this study promise to help us understand how to cost effectively improve the implementation of evidence-based practices.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Trial registration</jats:title>\n<jats:p><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/\">NCT 04044521</jats:ext-link> (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Delineation of the exact structure of BCAs may provide a precise diagnosis and/or point to new disease loci. We report on six patients with de novo balanced chromosomal translocations (BCTs) and one patient with a de novo inversion, in whom we mapped breakpoints to a resolution of 1 bp, using shallow whole-genome mate pair sequencing. In all seven cases, a disruption of at least one gene was found. In two patients, the phenotypic impact of the disrupted genes is well known (NFIA, ATP7A). In five patients, the aberration damaged genes: PARD3, EPHA6, KLF13, STK24, UBR3, MLLT10 and TLE3, whose influence on the human phenotype is poorly understood. In particular, our results suggest novel candidate genes for retinal degeneration with anophthalmia (EPHA6), developmental delay with speech impairment (KLF13), and developmental delay with brain dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (UBR3). In conclusion, identification of the exact structure of symptomatic BCTs using next generation sequencing is a viable method for both diagnosis and finding novel disease candidate genes in humans.</jats:p>"

In this work, a multi‐echo balanced steady‐state free precession (me‐bSSFP) sequence with Iterative Decomposition with Echo Asymmetry and Least squares estimation (IDEAL) reconstruction was implemented on a clinical 3 T positron‐emission tomography/MRI system for fast 2D and 3D metabolic imaging. Simulations were conducted to obtain signal‐efficient sequence protocols for the metabolic imaging of hyperpolarized biomolecules. The sequence was applied in vitro and in vivo for probing the enzymatic exchange of hyperpolarized [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]pyruvate and [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]lactate. Chemical shift resolution was achieved using a least‐square, iterative chemical species separation algorithm in the reconstruction. In vitro, metabolic conversion rate measurements from me‐bSSFP were compared with NMR spectroscopy and free induction decay‐chemical shift imaging (FID‐CSI). In vivo, a rat MAT‐B‐III tumor model was imaged with me‐bSSFP and FID‐CSI. 2D metabolite maps of [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]pyruvate and [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]lactate acquired with me‐bSSFP showed the same spatial distributions as FID‐CSI. The pyruvate‐lactate conversion kinetics measured with me‐bSSFP and NMR corresponded well. Dynamic 2D metabolite mapping with me‐bSSFP enabled the acquisition of up to 420 time frames (scan time: 180‐350 ms/frame) before the hyperpolarized [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]pyruvate was relaxed below noise level. 3D metabolite mapping with a large field of view (180 × 180 × 48 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) and high spatial resolution (5.6 × 5.6 × 2 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) was conducted with me‐bSSFP in a scan time of 8.2 seconds. It was concluded that Me‐bSSFP improves the spatial and temporal resolution for metabolic imaging of hyperpolarized [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]pyruvate and [1–<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]lactate compared with either of the FID‐CSI or EPSI methods reported at 3 T, providing new possibilities for clinical and preclinical applications.</jats:p>",
