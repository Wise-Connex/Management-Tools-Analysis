Meningkatkan sebuah kualitas pada pelayanan perlu memahami kekurangan selama ini. Kejaksaan Negeri Batu adalah sebuah instansi di Provinsi Jawa Timur yang pelayanan masih berjalan secara manual. Hal ini menimbulkan permasalahan dari segi pelayanan, kecepatan dan biaya kepada masyarakat. Berdasarkan masalah ini perlu dilakukan perubahan proses bisnis pada Kejaksasaan Negeri Batu dengan penerapan BPR (Business Process Reengineering). Business Process Reengineering adalah konsep untuk mengubah ulang proses bisnis yang memiliki kelemahan pada proses. Tujuanya untuk memperbaiki sebuah kinerja proses agar lebih efisien. Penelitian dimulai dengan mengumpulkan beberapa referensi yang berkaitan dengan Business Process Reengineering. Metode pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan cara observasi ke studi kasus, wawancara dengan pihak Kejaksaan Negeri Batu dan studi literatur sejenis. Memahami suatu proses bisnis digunakan peta proses standar ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). Berdasarkan peta proses standar ASME dapat dihitung kinerja proses bisnis dengan menghitung efisiensi throughput. Langkah peningkatan dan penyempurnaan desain ulang proses dilakukan agar proses bisnis lebih efektif. Hasil akhir penelitian adalah sebuah rancangan ulang model bisnis proses rekomendasi yang meningkatkan efisiensi throughput dari 50,36% pada proses sebelumnya menjadi 85,77% dan menghasilkan sebuah aplikasi sebagai pendukung rancangan ulang model bisnis proses rekomendasi.   Abstract               Every agency that provides a service to the public wants a quality service. Improving a quality of service needs to understand the shortcomings. State Attorney Batu is an agency in East Java Province that service is still running manually. This creates problems in terms of service, speed and cost to the community. Based on this problem, it is necessary to change the business process at State of the Earth Stone with the application of BPR (Business Process Reengineering). Business Process Reengineering is a concept to re-alter a business process that has a weakness in the process. The goal is to improve a process performance to be more efficient. Research begins by collecting some references related to Business Process Reengineering. Data collection method was done by observation to case study, interview with State Prosecutor of Batu and study of similar literature. Understanding a business process is used ASME standard process maps (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). Based on ASME standard process maps can be calculated business process performance by calculating throughput efficiency. Steps to improve and refine the process redesign are done to make business processes more effective. The final results are a redesign of business models that improve the efficiency of the process on the throughput of 50.36% in the previous process becomes 85.77% and produce an application to support the redesign of the business model of the recommendation process.</jats:p>"

Increasingly important for the efficiency of the enterprise is the use of innovation, knowledge embodied in the intellectual product. The reasons for the need for new approaches to management are related to changes in the business itself. Increased competition leads to an increase in the search for new management methods, especially in the area of personnel management, which in the long run requires appropriate management mechanisms based on a process approach in order to respond promptly and promptly to changing market conditions, improve the management system of partnerships and relationships with suppliers, achieving rapid response to consumer demands and improving product quality. The essence of reengineering of business process of personnel management as a modern concept of increase of efficiency of activity of the enterprise is investigated in the article. Business process reengineering is designed to create competitive advantages by systematically assessing processes, addressing the changing needs of potential and existing customers and requiring additional research to find new ways to improve reengineering in accordance with the specifics of domestic enterprises, especially in the field of personnel management. It was revealed that the innovative practice of enterprise management requires fundamental changes, which is due to the socialization of the world economy, aimed at improving the well-being of people with disabilities, reducing poverty and increasing the chances of finding decent work with adequate wages. The directions of including people with disabilities to innovative activities in the context of reengineering the personnel management process as one of the most important business processes of the enterprise are proposed.\n\nKey words: reengineering, personnel management, business process, inclusive innovation, persons with disabilities, innovative activity, enterprise.</jats:p>"

Various approaches to the interpretation of this concept have been considered from a historical viewpoint. It has been found out that modern scientists consider this concept from different positions, e.g. as a conceptual and methodological approach, as philosophy of activity, as skills, as a method of business management, as a concept of change, as a method of restructuring, as a tool for business efficiency, as a process, as a type and sphere of professional activity, etc. At the same time, taking into account the instruments of morphological analysis; identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches to understand the meaning of \"reengineering\"; as well as studying practical experience; and finally, drawing general conclusions from scientific research on this issue have allowed the author to substantiate the expediency of interpreting reengineering as a direction of management activities aimed at restructuring business processes at an enterprise radically to achieve the established efficiency criteria. The main business components have been identified and characterized, in relation to and in the context of which the need to use reengineering instruments can be considered. The prevailing components of reengineering in the activity of enterprises have been analyzed. To specify the essence of the \"reengineering\" concept, its characteristic features are highlighted, namely: the individual nature of work and services performed (provided) within it; dependence of the content and nature of reengineering on the features of business entity; significant influence of the competence of business entities responsible for reengineering on its effectiveness; coverage by reengineering of both traditional and innovative business processes; an opportunity for business entities to solve a wide range of problems through using reengineering; the difficulty of establishing clear and unambiguous criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of reengineering in the initial stages of its implementation; the temporary nature of the relationship between the parties involved in the reengineering project implementation; relative separation of reengineering from the current production and economic activities of a company; the possibility of applying reengineering to various business processes at an enterprise; the necessity to make initial investments in the performance of work (services) within an reengineering project.</jats:p>"

The basic research methods were statistical methods, modeling of economic and production processes. The study was based on the results of the authors’ study of the indicators of the accounting (financial) statements of common service centers (CSC) in Russia, for these purposes a sample of organizations was formed according to the criteria corresponding to the CSC of large holdings. As a result, the authors revealed that the specifics of the CSC activities is that they perform secondary, servicing functions and are one of the company's cost centers. The effect of the СSC activities is to optimize the model of business processes and save technological, time and financial resources. The complexity of evaluating the centers’ activities lies in the indirect effect, which is carried out on the basis of the scientific substantiation of managerial decisions and rationalization of the powers of managerial personnel and decision-makers at each stage of the business model.</jats:p>",

Для анализа бизнес-процесса использовалась нотация BPMN и метод дискретно-событийного имитационного моделирования. Анализ разработанной модели \"AS-IS\" позволил выявить «узкие места» бизнес-процесса. Использование таких принципов как вертикальное сжатие процессов, снижение доли согласований, снижение работ по проверкам, позволило оптимизировать выполняемые сотрудниками работы. Использование датчиков, контролирующих работу производственного оборудования, и разработанный программный модуль на базе программного продукта 1С: Предприятие 8.3 позволили оптимизировать бизнес-процесс. Разработанная модель процесса \"ТOBE\" позволила оценить перепроектированный бизнес-процесс. Финансовые затраты на реализацию бизнес-процесса документирования технического обслуживания оборудования сократились в 7,3 раза. Кроме того, результаты реинжиниринга - это минимизация затрат на ведение документов по техническому обслуживанию оборудования; более оперативное реагирование на технические сбои оборудования; строгое выполнение план-графиков ремонта оборудования; минимизация ресурсов на ремонт оборудования.</jats:p>"

This study was an action research using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach. The subject of research was people living in Jebres, Solo City. Data were collected through interview, focus group discussion, participatory observation, and documentation. Education of People Consciousness and Skill for rubbish management was conducted using reduce, reuse, recycle and replant (4R) principles. The activity stage involved socialization on rubbish bank revitalization, reinforcement of institution capacity, and stakeholder network expansion. The expansion of customers involved people surrounding the rubbish bank (general society and those living in the boarding house) and campus of Sebelas Maret University. Institution network involved kresek community, Solo City Government (Kelurahan Jebres, Living Environment Office), <jats:italic>Perusahaan Umum Pegadaian</jats:italic> (General Pawnshop Company), and mass media. The result of action research showed that people’s consciousness of utilizing rubbish improved thereby the effect of environmental pollution was reduced.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The actual value of the topic lies in the fact that nowadays the development of the world economic system is accompanied by innovative processes. Innovative development of enterprises is the only possible way to steer a country’s economy out of crisis. For most domestic industrial enterprises it is necessary to completely abandon the traditional enterprise management system or, at least, to transform it. Thus, it is becoming more and more actual to use methods and tools, which can foster innovative development in various activity areas at an enterprise, and the importance of reengineering as an innovative basis for the reconstruction of the enterprise management system is growing. The article aims at designing a conceptual foundation for reengineering as an innovative basis for the reconstruction of the enterprise management system. The authors reveal the content of reengineering and demonstrate its importance as the innovative basis for reconstructing the enterprise management system. The advantages of using reengineering are highlighted, the essence of reengineering as an economic process is identified. It is stated that reengineering allows providing a systematic and comprehensive approach to the innovative refocusing and restructuring of the enterprise management system as a whole, or of its individual functional components. The authors’ own definition of \"reengineering\" is offered. It is substantiated that reengineering allows reconstructing the enterprise management system in an innovative way. The need for the reengineering of the enterprise management system is shown. The conceptual basis of reengineering as an innovative basis for reconstructing the enterprise management system is proposed. The basis contains the principles, on which reengineering is grounded as an innovative basis for reconstructing the enterprise management system; and the main stages of reengineering. Reengineering as an innovative basis for reconstructing the enterprise management system involves holistic and systematic modeling and fundamentally changes the enterprise information flow; as a result, the organization structure is simplified, resources are redistributed, individual resources consumption is minimized, product life is reduced, the service quality and image are improved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A hybrid technology of reengineering of the existing hot-pressing production process of long-length products from high-strength aluminium alloys is suggested. At the first stage of design functional and structural models of the existing process are constructed, through the analysis of which functional and structural models of the designed production process are formed. The construction of models involves IDEF-design methods which are a further development of SADT methodology of structured analysis and design of complex systems. The structural model of the designed process is presented in graphical language IDEF3. Further, by means of methods of functional and structural, functional and constructive, structural and constructive integration search and optimization of the technological devices realizing the required production functions is carried out. Such technologies have been used in the development of complex aerospace systems. In the process of reengineering the existing production process of pressing products from high-strength aluminium alloys, a design of an energy and material-saving automated production process has been developed, in which, unlike the existing process on one unit in a continuous process flow, the main technological operations of plastic deformation, additional heating, heat hardening and straightening of the pressed products are carried out directly on the output bed of the press. A part of the technical solutions of the project passed industrial testing on a the press complex with a force of 50 MN. The suggested production process is universal and can be applied both in production of long-length products from high-strength and low easily deformable aluminium alloys.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a Business Process Reengineering in a Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity, and Disruptive (VUCAD) context in a telecommunication company in the Philippines. Telecommunication companies thrive to counter human resources related problems such as high attrition rates, expensive talent acquisition and management program in the telecom sector, access management and connectivity, and human resources productivity turn-over. In this age of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) which heavily relies on the technology-driven operations, Business process re-engineering (BPR) has been seen to purport quantum leap and improvements in the organizational performance by looking and focusing the business process improvements in the technology roadmap design, analysis and design of process workflows, and business process within the confine of the organization. The researchers utilized a descriptive-evaluative research design using analytical tools SWOT and PEST. Based on the study, the telecom company should invest in integrating the emerging technologies in the operation, and that a Technology Roadmap was recommended. Further studies could be done using empirical analysis and other engineering techniques to solve recurring problems in telecommunication and other companies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article presents methodology of business processes reengineering (BPR) in the modern construction organizations adapted to dynamically changing conditions of the internal and external environment. The study developed a formulation of the task of reengineering business processes on the basis of component methodology of the enterprise's structure. It is advisable to apply a systematic approach to determining the functions and patterns of interaction of business processes. The concept of a methodology for reengineering business processes is theoretically substantiated based on the adequate construction of a conceptual system model from the components displayed in the modern enterprise management system. The formalization of the business process reengineering task at five stages on the basis of a systematic approach and component technology is described. Formalization of the BPR methodology ensures the combination of reverse and direct reengineering stages. The results of the study allow solving urgent problems of increasing the competitiveness of construction organizations through reengineering design. The scientific significance of the study lies in the development of a component methodology for modeling reengineering of business processes. The practical significance of the use lies in the application of the study in the real sector of the economy during the restructuring and reform of construction organizations. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the development of a methodology and conceptual provisions for systemic management of business process reengineering of building organizations based on the use of the process approach.</jats:p>"
