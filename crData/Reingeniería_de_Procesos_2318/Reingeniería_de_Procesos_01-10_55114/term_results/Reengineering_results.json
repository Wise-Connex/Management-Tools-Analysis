      "abstract": "<jats:p>Centers on motivation in work organizations, yesterday, today and tomorrow. To retain qualified employees in an organization and to maintain a satisfactory type of role performance, people’s experiences in the system must be rewarding, particularly if they have freedom to move in and out of organizations. Motivating people to work in the twenty‐first century with theories conceived in the 1800s and early 1900s is likely to be infeasible. After reviewing the major events in the management history of the last 100 years, the authors try to distill the knowledge that will help illuminate the motivation path for present and future managers. The core message is that managers should reconsider the outdated motivational patterns utilized to maintain role performance in organizations. The authors propose a fresh motivation formula for the twenty‐first century, based on “friendship, work and respect”.</jats:p>",
