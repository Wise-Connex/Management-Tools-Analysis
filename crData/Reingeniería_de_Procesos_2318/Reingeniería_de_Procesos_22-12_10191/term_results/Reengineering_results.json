A systematic review was conducted, considering scientific articles in occupational safety and health. Several factors contributed to a challenge to be resolved for those responsible for the well-being of workers in the industry. The use of technology, its dependence, its needs, and other aspects related to the dependence on the use of technology contribute to occupational safety and health risks that are psychosocial and have a direct impact on the performance of the company, so that workplace risk plans must be restructured taking into account these new challenges.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In management, there are many management approaches that make it possible to increase the performance indicators of the enterprise. At the same time, the priority direction of the development of enterprises is the implementation of innovative activities. To achieve success in this area, companies are changing management approaches, organizational structures and business models. However, in the conditions of constant aggravation of the competitive struggle, the achievement of high indicators of the enterprise's activity is best ensured by the reengineering of business processes. The innovativeness of reengineering lies in the fact that it combines the use of the prerogatives of computer technologies, human resource management technologies and changes in business processes. In the current economic conditions, the speed of reaction of all subsystems of the enterprise and the efficiency of operations are of particular importance and are a necessary condition for its effective functioning in the conditions of constantly intensifying competition. In this situation, reengineering is the most effective, because it contributes to increasing the efficiency of the enterprise by changing the business model it uses. Therefore, the study of reengineering procedures, its principles and tasks is relevant in today's conditions. The purpose of the study is to generalize theoretical approaches to the main principles, types and tasks of business process reengineering as a tool for effective enterprise management. The methodological basis of the study was the work of domestic and foreign scientists on the problems of reengineering and change management of enterprises. Business process reengineering is a thorough rethinking and radical redesign of business processes of enterprises that want to significantly improve their performance. . It is used when it is necessary to make a reasoned decision about the reorganization of activities: radical transformations, business restructuring, replacement of existing management structures with new ones, etc. Thanks to the effective use of business process reengineering tools, it is possible to make the enterprise more flexible to changes in the external environment and more stable in competitive conditions. Thus, the reengineering of business processes involves a decisive, fundamental restructuring of business processes and the foundations of the management organization in order to significantly increase the competitiveness of the enterprise on the market and significantly increase the efficiency of the enterprise as a whole system.</jats:p>",

The conclusions of the article can be used in agricultural and IT enterprises, institutions of higher education, research institutions, consulting organizations. Conclusions. The activity of agricultural enterprises is accompanied by certain difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of their functioning and management. This is due to the presence of business and production processes with risks and/or potentially uncertain side effects. Understanding and analysis of these risks and uncertainties is particularly important in effective management activities, substantiating strategies for their further prospective development. This will be facilitated by means of automation and software for managing strategies for the development of agrarian enterprises using a process approach (controlling), restructuring and reengineering; use of software descriptions based on their modeling, templates, routing of business operations, their optimization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current competitive environment demands that enterprises adopt changes that lead to market share and profitability expansion. One effective method businesses adopt is Business Process Reengineering (BPR). This entails redesigning business processes radically to realize significant progress on performance metrics. Information Technology (IT) is essential in enabling the successful implementation of BPR, although not exclusively singly accountable. It provides vital levers for simplifying tasks, institutional structural modification, work adaptations, and phenomenal achievements. IT remains pivotal alongside other factors that enable successful enterprise-wide change through strategically implemented BPR. Among other things, BTP promotes transformational capability through process optimization, task automation, and overall efficiency increment and catalyzes change within organizations. Utilizing IT in BPR initiatives unlocks fresh possibilities leading to phenomenal benefits such as superior productivity, streamlining of workflows, increased collaboration, and a remarkable improvement in performance. This piece exemplifies the importance of IT as a strategic tool when executing BP. It showcases its potential as a positive outcome driver in the dynamic business landscape.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media is now regarded as the most valuable source of data for trend analysis and innovative business process reengineering preferences. Data made accessible through social media can be utilized for a variety of purposes, such as by an entrepreneur who wants to learn more about the market they intend to enter and uncover their consumers’ requirements before launching their new products or services. Sentiment analysis and text mining of telecommunication businesses via social media posts and comments are the subject of this study. A proposed framework will be utilized as a guideline, and it will be tested for sentiment analysis. Lexicon-based sentiment categorization is used as a model training dataset for a supervised machine learning support vector machine. The result is very promising. The accuracy and the quantity of the true sentiments it can detect are compared. This result signifies the usefulness of text mining and sentiment analysis on social media data, while the use of machine learning classifiers for predicting sentiment orientation provides a useful tool for operations and marketing departments. The availability of large amounts of data in this digitally active society is advantageous for sectors such as the telecommunication industry. These companies can be two steps ahead with their strategy and develop a more cohesive company that can make customers happier and mitigate problems easily with the use of text mining and sentiment analysis for further adopting innovative business process reengineering for service improvements within the telecommunications industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Ti-6Al-4V alloy is one of the key materials in the aerospace and chemical industries. Additive manufacturing (AM), e.g., electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), is increasingly applied to manufacture the titanium part due to its low cost, high flexibility, high efficiency, etc. At the same time, the wear resistance and hardness of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy synthesized by AM can deteriorate during fabrication. In this paper, electron beam surface remelting (EBSR) is used to improve the wear resistance and hardness of the titanium alloy made by EBF<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The phase, microstructure, element composition, and wear track profile of layers remelted at three EBSR-beam currents were analyzed. According to the results, the synthesized alloy consists of a homogeneous <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>′ martensitic structure with numerous embedded nano-scale particles rather than a dual <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> + <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> lamellar structure when a rapid cooling rate is applied during EBSR. Simultaneously, the coarser prior-<jats:italic>β</jats:italic> grain boundary was eliminated in the process. The wear rate of the as-obtained remelted layers at the EBSR-beam currents of 0 (as-deposited), 3, 6, and 9 mA was determined as 7.7 × 10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup>, 5.7 × 10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup>, 7.9 × 10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup>, and 8.9 × 10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/Nm, respectively. The evolution of the structure accounts for the high hardness and superior wear resistance. EBSR successfully modified the as-deposited microstructure to achieve favorable wear properties, which widens the application potential and extends service life.</jats:p>",
