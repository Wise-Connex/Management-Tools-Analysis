      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Software product lines (SPLs) are a well‐known solution to systematically create reusable software products. Among the approaches to create an SPL, the extractive approach is usually used when the organization already has a set of similar systems. These systems are analyzed to extract, categorize, and group their common and variant features throughout the SPL reengineering process. As there are different scenario variables, such as available artifacts and team experience, the activities and techniques used to perform these tasks may change. This may increase the effort and decrease the quality of retrieved features when users with low experience in SPL reengineering perform such tasks. However, there is a lack of a process supporting these tasks considering different scenarios. Therefore, we specify the <jats:bold>P</jats:bold>repare, <jats:bold>A</jats:bold>ssemble, and E<jats:bold>x</jats:bold>ecute Process for SPL Reengineering (PAxSPL), a process that provides support to prepare, assemble, and execute feature retrieval throughout the analysis of documentation and team experience. To initially evaluate PAxSPL, we conducted and reported an exploratory case study in a real development environment. The results indicated that our proposal helps in the assembly of a feature retrieval process according to user needs. Results were important to identify points for improvement in PAxSPL. We also could use the information gathered to improve the guidelines and provide this information to be used as basis of comparison for future users.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>he purpose of the article is to reengineer of the economic transformation management as a basic prerequisite for implementation of the strategic goals of the country’s development. Methodology. The scientific works of scientists in the field of economic transformation management are the theoretical and methodological basis of the study. To achieve the purpose of the article, the following research methods were used: theoretical generalization of the directions of the public administration reform; methods of positive and normative analysis – to develop recommendations for reengineering of economic transformation management as a basic prerequisite for implementation of the strategic goals of the country’s development. Results. The main development trends and the impact of transformational drivers on the state of the national economy are studied. It is proved that despite the rather high potential for the development of innovation, investment, digital technologies and small business in Ukraine, their role in ensuring effective economic transformations remains insufficiently active. The transformation of these processes into powerful drivers of economic development and transformations of the economic system in a given vector requires a consistent public policy and the creation of appropriate economic, legal and institutional conditions. The conceptual matrix model of economic transformation management is substantiated. The model involves that implementation of the projects of national (regional) importance is a process which is carried out in parallel and in relation to the other processes of the socio-economic system functioning. The purpose of identifying priority areas for the transformation of the economy into individual projects is to ensure faster and more effective implementation of reforms, their transparency and controllability. The model will eliminate the problems of establishing effective communications and synchronization of actions between levels of government; allow us to use of resources (including human resources) more efficiently, to increase the level of responsibility and control at each stage of the transformation process. Practical meaning. The directions of the public administration reform that can be used by the executive branch are given. Prospects for further research. The choice of the optimal model of the economic transformation management is one of the basic conditions for ensuring the accelerated development of the economy at all levels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ecofriendly, ecoefficient and sustainable civil engineering work has been research with emphasis on adapting the byproducts of solid waste recycling and reuse to achieving infrastructural activities with low or zero carbon emission. The direction combustion model, the solid waste incinerator caustic soda oxides of carbon entrapment model (SWI-NaOH-OCEM) developed by this research has achieved a zero carbon release. This research adopted the literature search method to put together research results of previous works relevant to the aim of this present work. It has been shown that CO and CO2 emissions can be contained during the derivation of alternative or supplementary cementing materials used in the replacement of ordinary Portland cement in civil engineering works. In the overall assessment of the present review work has left the environment free of the hazards of CO and CO2 emissions. It was shown that these supplementary cementing materials derived from solid wastes improve the engineering properties of treated soft clay and expansive soils, concrete, and asphalt. Bio-peels, another form solid waste has been established as a good detoxificant used in treating wastewater. It has been shown that solid waste recycling and reuse is a hub to achieving ecofriendly, ecoefficient and sustainable infrastructural development on the global scale.</jats:p>",
