The innovation of business processes is required to improve financial performance. Scientific works have not yet offered an effective solution to the monitoring of the impact made by process reengineering on corporate financial results. This work presents the case of a business process reengineering in a particular company to improve its performance. The results of implemented reengineering are analysed from the point of view of the impact made on the financial situation of the company. The paper aims to demonstrate the implementation of reengineering and evaluate its impact on the financial standing of a company and its performance. The practical application of reengineering was made according to Hammer and Champy methodology, which is based on the analysis of production processes in the company, the implementation of selected reengineered production processes and the evaluation of the reengineering impact on the corporate financial situation and performance. During the evaluation, the selected indicators of financial performance, activity indicators, the indebtedness indicator, business performance indicators as a cash flow to measure financial flows and the economic value-added (indicator EVA) were calculated and analysed. Subsequent to financial analyses and based on the selected indicators, the authors concluded that the implemented reengineering of the production process increased the performance and value of the company, which had a positive impact on the companyâ€™s financial situation. The funds spent on the proper implementation of the reengineering steps were effectively used, and the reengineering process was also timed. This contribution to the body of theoretic knowledge links the implementation of reengineering and the part of the financial analysis, which is related to the preparation, implementation and reengineering results.</jats:p>",

Despite the reengineering efforts, as many as 70 per cent of the libraries do not achieve the expected results. Certain critical success factors need to be in place for successful implementation.

Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 30 librarians. The qualitative data collected were analyzed through content analysis.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The following key success factors were found to have been considered during reengineering: top management commitment, planning, provision of required resources, appropriate IT infrastructure, presence of skilled and competent staff, value of the library to the university and teamwork. Despite the central role of training, change management program and having a clear vision and objectives, university libraries in Kenya did not pay any attention to them as deserved. The authors conclude that university libraries in Kenya have not optimally achieved the desired reengineering results as a result of overlooking training and change management as critical success factors. The paper recommends that the identified critical success factors should be considered wholly not in isolation.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study was carried out among the top-ranked universities according to the January 2017 Webometric ranking; and therefore the findings may give a general indication of the critical success factors considered by university libraries in Kenya. However, this pre-condition may have locked out other libraries that may have made some recommendable strides in re-engineering their services.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study has practical implications in identifying the critical success factors for library service reengineering to provide insights on the factors to consider as librarians reengineer library services.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

In phase 3 clinical trials, changes introduced during the bioengineering of VA resulted in the development of undesired anti-drug antibodies in some patients, leading to the termination of a potentially promising therapeutic protein product. Here, we use preclinical biomarkers associated with clinical immunogenicity to validate our deimmunization strategy applied to this bioengineered rFVIIa analog. The reengineered rFVIIa analog variants retained increased intrinsic thrombin generation activity but did not elicit T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 50 HLA typed subjects representing the human population. Our algorithm, rational immunogenicity determination, offers a broadly applicable deimmunizing strategy for bioengineered proteins.</jats:p>",

Re-organizing the work process is considered as Re-engineering. The organizations are these days looking for new administration approaches so as to expand their opposition identified with quick changes and mechanical advancements. In response to associate more and more competitive setting the ability to adapt to dynamical market desires and develop innovative processes is important for organizations. The important key behind this evolution is the improvement in the globalization of business, technologies and the expectations of the client. BPR changes the strategies of method organizations, the roles of the practitioners, the structure and order of method levels. One of the current innovations in engineering is BPR (Business Process Reengineering). To optimize the process and the productivity of a corporation BPR represents the quick and radical arrange of strategic, policies and structure. BPR is often pursued to enhance processes, increase productivity, improves service and supply a competitive advantage. To achieve the business objectives business process reengineering supports organizations to elevate their internal functions. Organizational processes can be known, analyzed and improved by developing the different methodologies and applied to the reengineering process.</jats:p>"
