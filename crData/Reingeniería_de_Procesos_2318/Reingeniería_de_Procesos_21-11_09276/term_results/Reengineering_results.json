The aim of the article is to define new concepts of transformation and reengineering of business processes, their types, properties and research of significance in the development of territories. Methodology. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study are the scientific works of scientists in the study of business process management in the system of competitive development of territories. To achieve this goal, the following research methods were used: theoretical generalization – providing the basic characteristics of models of economic development in the conditions of transformational changes in national economies; methods of positive and normative analysis – to determine the strategy and priorities for the transformation of regional development. Results. It is proved that transformation is a permanent form of life, a movement in which old and new coexist, in certain conditions innovative spheres survive and develop, such as material and technical and social base of scientific and technological progress, reforms, social consequences and sometimes negative for society neoplasms and deformities. Reforms do not stop historical, evolutionary transformations, they give them new impulses, directions, limit or expand the scale of their impact on all aspects of society. It is substantiated that the strategy of “catching up” and the strategy of “advanced technologies” should be implemented simultaneously, not in turn, as their common goal is to achieve a new technological level of the Ukrainian economy. It is determined that the strategy of “catching up” can be used in the manufacture of household appliances, engines and in the automotive and chemical industries. It is proved that Ukraine can and should pursue a strategy of “advanced technologies” in the production of certain weapons, aerospace and shipbuilding industry, chemical, heavy and energy engineering, transport, information technology, participate in global cooperation in nanotechnology and biotechnology. Prospects for the transformation of territories are identified, including: transition from extensive to intensive management methods, implementation of programs to increase regional production of goods, priority of small farms, development of social reforms, priority of small farms, restructuring of the regional economy. Practical meaning. Models of economic development for transformational changes in national economies can be used by regional public authorities. Prospects for further research. Study of strategy and priorities for regional development transformation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Engineering solutions of construction facilities are becoming obsolete due to the impact of scientific and technological progress, changes in consumer needs and production capabilities of the construction industry. A gap between consumer needs and characteristics of construction products is bridged by updating, modernizing, retrofitting and transforming design solutions. Materials and methods. The subject of the study is capital construction facilities that have various functional purposes: they structure built-up urban areas (space planning), whose urban planning solutions need reengineering in the course of operation. The article considers the list of capital construction entities that include industrial facilities (manufacturing, agricultural, and communication facilities), non-industrial facilities (public buildings, residential housing) and linear objects (overpasses, pipelines, power grids). Functional, planning, structural, organizational and technological features of capital construction facilities, features of vital processes, production and technological procedures, that are underway inside them, determine the characteristic differences in the composition and structure of construction reengineering. Structural and functional analysis is the research method of the study. Results. The composition of actions and methods used to reengineer residential and industrial buildings, areas occupied by the engineering and transport infrastructure is described. The article presents changes introduced by reengineering actions with regard for the features of facilities that structure urban development. The co-authors acknowledge that the structure and composition of construction reengineering are highly variable, and their variability is determined by the types of built-up areas and their transformation methods. This dependence impacts a combination of reengineering actions, including those that determine the nature of transformation and supplement the principal change. The research results allow to develop reengineering process organization charts and outline the resource provision process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the extensive use of cut-to-length mechanized systems, harvester data remains largely underutilized by most stakeholders in Germany. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine how business processes should be restructured to allow for a continuous use of forest machine data, with the main focus on harvester production data, along the German wood supply chain. We also wanted to identify possible benefits and challenges of the restructuring through a qualitative analysis of the newly designed business process. The Bavarian State Forest Enterprise was chosen for a case study approach. Based on expert interviews, the current and to-be processes were modeled. Results obtained from the qualitative data indicated that an integration of harvester data is achievable in Germany. Harvester data from forest operations can be provided to all subsequent activities along the supply chain. Core changes were the addition of a digital work order, the data exchange between harvester and forwarder, the pile order and the exchange of production data. Benefits for every stakeholder were determined. Through the reengineered process, harvesting and timber information are available and known at an earlier stage of the process, throughput information stations could be eliminated and working comfort could be improved. Ecological benefits could also be achieved through an anticipated reduction of CO2 emissions and protection of sensitive nature areas. Negative consequences of harvester data integration could appear in the social sphere and were in line with the reduction of personal contact. Challenges for the implementation in reality, besides the legal situation, could be the availability of on-board computers in forwarders, cost for new IT applications, willingness of stakeholders to cooperate and availability of internet access. Further research should be focused on the combination of harvester data with other data types and the practical implementation of the TB process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It was to explore the application of nursing defect management evaluation and deep learning in nursing process reengineering optimization. This study first selects the root cause analysis method to analyse the nursing defect management, then realizes the classification of data features according to the convolution neural network (CNN) in deep learning (DL) and uses the constructed training set and verification set to obtain the required plates and feature extraction. Based on statistical analysis and data mining, this study makes statistical analysis of nursing data from a macroperspective, improves Apriori algorithm through simulation, and analyses nursing data mining from a microperspective. The constructed deep learning model is used, CNN network training is conducted on the selected SVHN dataset, the required data types are classified, the data are analysed by using the improved Apriori algorithm, and nurses’ knowledge of nursing process rules is investigated and analysed. The cognition of nursing staff on process optimization and their participation in training were analyzed, the defects in the nursing process were summarized, and the nursing process reengineering was analyzed. The results show that compared with Apriori algorithm, the running time difference of the improved Apriori algorithm is relatively small. With the increase of data recording times, the line trend of the improved algorithm gradually eases, the advantages gradually appear, and the efficiency of data processing is more obvious. The results showed that after the optimization of nursing process, the effect of long-term specialized nursing was significantly higher than that of long-term nursing. Health education was improved by 7.57%, clinical nursing was improved by 6.55%, ward management was improved by 9.85%, and service humanization was improved by 8.97%. In summary, the reoptimization of nursing process is conducive to reduce the defects in nursing. In the data analysis and rule generation based on deep learning network, the reoptimization of nursing process can provide reference for decision-making departments to improve long-term nursing, improve the quality and work efficiency of clinical nurses, and is worthy of clinical promotion.</jats:p>",
