      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the age of globalization, seaports play a vital role in connecting national supply chains to the global marketplace. Improving port operations has become a priority for many countries. One of the ways to achieve this objective is process reengineering. This paper reviews the IT‐enabled reengineering process at Pusan Port, South Korea. The paper examines the issues and problems leading to process reengineering, the steps involved in the reengineering process, and major performance improvements. Lessons learned from the case have been highlighted for the benefit of port planners in developing countries. The case can thus form the baseline on which further adaptation can be made to suit their specific needs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Organisations, the world over are increasingly focussing their efforts on radical measures to enhance their competitive edge. One such area of interest focuses on reduction in the time taken in classical process of managerial group decision-making. The rapid strides made in the field of Information Technology have opened new opportunities to qualitatively enhance productivity of collaborative work. Group Decision Support System (GDSS) focuses on the aspect of introducing technology, in a graded manner, into the process of group decisionmaking. It seeks to fundamentally alter the angularities of such interaction and present a technology driven platform for the purpose. However, the basic process of group interaction needs to be more clearly understood before any wide-scale implementation of GDSS can prove beneficial. A model of the evolving GDSS process is presented which affords a framework for further research into the contemporary technology-driven collaborative process. It is proposed that the advent of IT offers a unique opportunity to re-engineer the group decision making processes so as to significantly benefit from the GDSS paradigm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> DR. RODNEY McADAM IS A SENIOR LECTURER in the School of Management, University of Ulster, Northern Ireland. The aim of this paper is to determine the critical success factors for the implementation of reengineering in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Reengineering has developed from a background in large enterprises. Existing methodologies mainly assume a large organisation setting with large-scale resources dedicated to bringing about the large-scale reengineering changes. The literature contains many studies on reengineering theory, applications and critical success factors: however, they are almost all based on large enterprises in either the public or private sectors. The paucity of research involving rieengineering and SMEs comes from two factors. First, reengineering is still a relatively new management approach and has yet to reach SMEs fully from the initial large organisation starting point. Second, there is some remaining doubt as to whether large-scale reengineering is applicable to SMEs owing to resource constraints. The research involves a literature review and an inductive grounded theory approach using multiple case studies. In total, 23 SMEs case studies involving research-based workshops were examined and analysed to determine critical success factors f'oi reengineering implementationi. The imain findings were that the kev categories of success factorS in reeingineering in SMEs are resctues, miiarket envir-onnment, customerls and(: strategy, leadership, flexibilitv andl change orientationi, structutre, methodology an-d measureinermt. Tiw componen-t factors within these categories were found to diffeir significantly from those of large organisations in a uumbhe of cascs. </jats:p>",
