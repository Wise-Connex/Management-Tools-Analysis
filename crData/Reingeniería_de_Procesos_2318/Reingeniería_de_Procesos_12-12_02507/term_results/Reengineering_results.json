      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current condition of the world and with regards to the world competition, organizational existence has become the most important problem of the managers. The success secret of current organizations depends on setting their ultimate goals and objectives outside of the organization. In another word, in a safe organization, goal is to serve its customers. In this regard, the meaning of agility is to reach customer’s wants and desires by wastages elimination in all sections of the organization. Therefore, sometimes an organizations in order to reach such objectives need to implement fundamental changes.Agility enterprise architecture is an architectural framework for organizational reengineering in designing, developing, integrating and performing a agility organization in applying systems engineering methods. With regards to the discussion of information technology and systems engineering in today’s organizations which is considered important. In this article, it is tried to study processes reengineering with the use of agility enterprise architectural reengineering framework with focusing on competitive intelligence and its practical phases. Eventually, reasons for importance of agility enterprise architecture, summary and results along with propositions will be explained. The research results indicated that the proposed framework has some benefits which among the most important ones are: Improvement quality in organization, delivering just in time of goods, enhancing customer satisfaction, wastages elimination and as a results decreasing costs. Overall, the benefits gained from this model can create stability in the world competition.Key words: Processes reengineering, enterprise architecture, agility production, competitive intelligence, AHP</jats:p>"

The enzymatic generation of chemical oxidants is often limited by enzyme stability. The subtilisin Carlsberg variant T58A/L216W/<jats:italic>M221</jats:italic> is a promiscuous protease that was improved in producing peroxycarboxylic acids. In the current article, we identified two amino acid positions (Trp216 and Met221) that are important for the oxidative resistance of subtilisin Carlsberg T58A/L216W/<jats:italic>M221</jats:italic>. Site-saturation mutagenesis at positions Trp216 and Met221, which are located close to the active site, resulted in variants M4 (T58/W216M/<jats:italic>M221</jats:italic>) and M6 (T58A/W216L/M221C). Variants M4 (T58/W216M/<jats:italic>M221</jats:italic>) and M6 (T58A/W216L/M221C) have a 2.6-fold (M4) and 1.5-fold (M6) increased oxidative resistance and 1.4-fold increased <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>cat</jats:sub> values for peroxycarboxylic acid formation, compared with wild-type subtilisin Carlsberg.</jats:p>",
