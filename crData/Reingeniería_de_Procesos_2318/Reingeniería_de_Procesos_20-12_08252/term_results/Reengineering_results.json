      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current study aims at examining the role of transformational leadership in paving the way for well-built reengineering of marketing strategies within the healthcare sector in Jordan. Depending on a quantitative approach, 312 questionnaires were distributed to individuals within hospitals: 105 questionnaires – healthcare centers, 75 questionnaires – outpatient clinics, and 33 questionnaires – general medicine clinics in Jordan. The study results indicated as a start better employment of transformational leadership within hospitals compared to clinics and healthcare centers, which can be attributed to the size and capacity of the healthcare institution. The study also indicated an influence of transformational leadership in paving the way for reengineering of marketing strategies within the healthcare sector in Jordan attributed to all transformational leadership characteristics. Among these characteristics, it appeared that the most influential transformational leadership characteristic was “individualized consideration”, scoring a Beta value of 0.421. This meant that the individualized consideration that transformational leadership has can nurture creativity and innovation among individuals to use their talents, experiences, and skills to present new and novel approaches to managing the business. This individualized consideration helps manage the change approach that may appear within the reengineering process and cooperate with employees to embrace such change. The study recommended following transformational leadership as an approach within the organization to manage change and arm employees with a suitable leadership style that can prepare the environment for a well-prepared reengineering of marketing strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As part of the domestic policy pursued in our country, state support for business contributes to the penetration of innovative activities into industrial enterprises. But, as practice shows, for an enterprise this is not a guarantee of increasing efficiency in the economic and social environment, despite the fact that the innovative projects being implemented have high potential. Often this is due to the fact that reengineering of business processes is not carried out or is not carried out effectively when introducing innovations. Innovations are superimposed on an unadopted and unprepared system of business processes, as a result of which a negative result is obtained.\r\nThe reasons for the development of such events at the enterprise are the following aspects:\r\nan ambiguous understanding of the theoretical foundations of business process reengineering, innovation and innovation, and their features;\r\nthe lack of an algorithm that allows efficient and effective reengineering of business processes when introducing innovations.\r\nIn most organizations, as a rule, leaders use an intuitive approach when reengineering business processes and, as a result, this does not always end with success.\r\nThus, there is a certain discrepancy between the need of economic agents for effective methods of reengineering business processes when introducing innovative technologies and an insufficient level of theoretical study of this issue. Also, issues of reengineering of business processes and issues of innovation, innovation in an unrelated context, separately relative to each other, are considered and studied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study was carried out to identify strategic approaches for reengineering guidance and counselling services in public secondary schools in Anambra State, Nigeria. A descriptive survey research design was adopted in carrying out the study. The sample for the study was 255 respondents made up of guidance counsellors and secondary school managers in the area of the study. The instrument for data collection was a structured close-ended questionnaire titled: “Strategic Approaches for Reengineering Guidance and Counselling Services Questionnaire (SARGCSQ)”. The instrument was validated by three experts while the reliability was ascertained using the Cronbach Alpha reliability method which yielded a coefficient of 0.88. Two hundred and fifty-five (255) copies of the questionnaire were administered to the respondents out of which 243 copies were completely filled and retrieved. Data collected were analysed using mean and standard deviation to answer the research questions and t-test statistics were used to test the null hypotheses at a 0.05 level of significance. The researcher in the study identified 10 capacity building approaches, 8 fund-related approaches and 10 programme review approaches for reengineering guidance and counselling services in public secondary schools in Anambra State. Findings indicated that there are no significant (p&lt;0.05) differences in the mean ratings of the responses of guidance counsellors and school management on fund-related approaches and programme review approaches for reengineering guidance and counselling services in public secondary schools in Anambra State, Nigeria. Although, there was a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference in the mean ratings of the responses of guidance counsellors and school management on capacity building approaches for reengineering guidance and counselling services in public secondary schools in Anambra State, Nigeria. Based on the findings, the study among others recommended that there should be constant capacity building of guidance counsellors through in-service training and retraining, relevant conferences, and workshops for improved efficiency in service delivery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research had two aims. First, it presented an overview and progress in understanding the current business process in the international program of Udayana University, which had a long queue for processing student admission documents. Second, it described how Business Process Reengineering (BPR) helped to improve the educational management services. Multiple interviews and a Forum Group Discussion (FGD) with the stakeholders were conducted. The reviews of the available documents, the current business process, and related complaint records were also carefully performed. The results show that the currently running batch processing system is a major challenge. The proposed solution reengineers the current business process and implements an information technology tool as a driver by digitizing the proposed solutions. The new business process leads to an improvement in processing the international student application from more than 60 days to only 29 days. Moreover, the proposed business process can minimize the opportunity loss of more than Rp3,8 billion annually.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the changing dynamics of the business environment, organizations need to redesign or reengineer their business processes in order to provide services with the lowest cost and shortest response time while increasing quality. Thence, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) provides a roadmap to achieve operational goals that leads to enhance flexibility and productivity, cost reduction, and quality of service/product. In this paper, we propose a literature review for the different proposed models for Business Process Reengineering. The models specify where the breakdowns occur in BPR implementation, justifies why such breakdowns occur, and propose techniques to prevent their occurrence again. The discussed models have been built based on different perspectives which are discussed, and consequently, different research gaps and issues have arisen which are also highlighted in this research</jats:p>"
