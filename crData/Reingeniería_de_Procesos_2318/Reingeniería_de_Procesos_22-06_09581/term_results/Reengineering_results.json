      "abstract": "<jats:p>The subject of research in the article is the process of supporting decision-making in the tasks of optimizing closed logistics networks at the stage of reengineering. The goal of the work is to improve the efficiency of technologies for the automated design of closed logistics networks due to the improvement of mathematical models of multi-criteria problems of reengineering their topological structures. The following tasks are solved in the article: review and analysis of the current state of the problem of supporting decision-making in the tasks of optimizing logistics networks at the stage of their reengineering; decomposition of the problem of optimization of logistics networks at the main stages of their life cycles; selection of a logical scheme of the reengineering process of the logistics network as a territorially distributed object; development of a mathematical model of the general problem of multi-criteria optimization of logistics networks according to indicators of economy, efficiency, reliability and survivability; selection of models for scalar multi-criteria evaluation of reengineering options, taking into account factors that are difficult to formalize, knowledge and experience of the decision-maker. The following methods are used: system approach, theories of systems, theories of usefulness, theories of decision-making, system design, optimization and operations research. Results. Decomposition of the reengineering problem was carried out on the following tasks: determination of the purpose of reengineering and the principles of network reconstruction; network structure optimization; optimization of the topology of network elements; selection of functioning technology; determination of parameters of elements and vehicles; assessment and selection of the best network construction option. The general mathematical model of the multi-criteria task of reengineering the topological structures of centralized three-level logistics networks based on the indicators of costs, cargo delivery time, reliability and survivability has been improved. Universal functions of general utility and utility of local criteria are proposed to obtain scalar estimates for multiple indicators. Exclusion of part of local criteria and restrictions from the general model allows obtaining models of practically all interesting problems of optimization of logistics networks. Conclusions. The developed complex of mathematical models expands the methodological principles of automating the processes of designing logistics networks, allows for the correct reduction of a set of effective options for their construction for the final choice, taking into account factors that are difficult to formalize, the knowledge and experience of designers. The practical use of the proposed complex of mathematical models will reduce the time and capacity complexity of project decision-making support technologies, and due to the use of the proposed options selection procedures, increase their quality based on a number of functional and cost indicators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is well known that accounting business process reengineering is constantly improving, and this change is usually closely related to incentive mechanisms. The establishment of this incentive mechanism requires performance appraisal of accounting business process reengineering. Although there are many evaluation indicators for the success of business process reengineering, there is a lack of a simple and easy standard. In order to reduce the complexity of business process reengineering (BPR) performance evaluation, the paper regards BPR as a closed input and output system from a systematic point of view, and a corresponding input-output evaluation index system is established for BPR performance based on the resource input support system. By using super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) and utilizing the advantages of adversarial cross-evaluation and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a performance evaluation DEA model for accounting business process reengineering is proposed. The model is used to evaluate the performance of QCFF company after business process reengineering. The research results can focus on the supervision and improvement of the departments with poor performance by completely ranking the performance of each process unit. The proposed method for assessing the performance of BPR thus serves a practical purpose and can be used to support the subsequent development of BPR.</jats:p>",

After understanding the current situation of procurement management of the enterprise, there are a series of problems in the enterprise, such as complex process, and no correlation between procurement management process and overall strategic planning. Finally, through the analysis of the early warning indicators of the enterprise by the deep learning algorithm, the procurement management process has caused certain risks to the financial management level of the enterprise, and the procurement management process of the enterprise needs to be adjusted. The material record and consumption scheme of the enterprise is optimized by using the SIPOC organizational system model.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The object of this study is the technical preparation of manufacturing (TPM) of aviation technology (AT) using reengineering technology. The task to reduce the terms of TPM AT was tackled while solving direct and inverse problems of shape formation involving reengineering. The study is based on the equation for calculating the labor intensity of creating an assembly unit (AU) as a mathematical model for the formation and accumulation of components of the total labor intensity at all stages. The following results are reported: a scheme has been proposed for linking homogeneous components of an article obtained using the loft-template method (LTM) with digital mock-up (DMU) when applying the reengineering method. The scheme summarizes and structures the reengineering technology to solve direct and inverse shape-formation problems and could be used to solve the tasks of prototyping, manufacturing, and refurbishment of tooling, as well as article control at all stages of production. An example of the helicopter stabilizer shows that when solving the direct shape-formation problem, the labor intensity is from 294.94 to 315.06 man-hours, and when solving the inverse problem ‒ from 194.78 to 213.22 man-hours. A comparative analysis of the labor intensity of TPM revealed a difference of 1.5 times in favor of the labor intensity of solving the inverse problem. Comparing the labor intensity of creating DMU for the stabilizer of a helicopter has made it possible to establish that the labor intensity of solving the inverse problem is 3.7 times less than the labor intensity of solving a direct problem. Recommendations for reducing the terms of TPM AT with the use of reengineering are given. The results could be used to assess the labor intensity and timing of TPM AT and mechanical engineering objects in general when using reengineering technology</jats:p>"

However, the life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity of many TKIs present major concerns. Ponatinib is the most effective treatment for patients harboring the common T315I mutation of BCR-ABL that drives Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) yet is one of the most cardiotoxic of TKIs. Ponatinib-induced events include myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and venous thrombosis. The aim of this study is to reengineer the chemical structure of ponatinib to minimize its adverse cardiovascular effects by using in vitro and in vivo models of cardiovascular toxicity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experimental Procedures: We developed in vitro cardiovascular toxicity assays using human iPSC-cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), and assessed anti-tumor efficacy in T315I mutated K562 CML cells. The cardiotoxicity was determined by impairment of cardiomyocyte contractility function, the vascular toxicity was defined by inability to form capillary-like networks in vasculogenesis assays. In vitro screening of ponatinib analogues probed chemical moieties responsible for its cardiovascular toxicity that were confirmed using mice xenograft mice models with human T315I mutant K562 cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Summary of Unpublished Data: Compared to ponatinib, refined analogues showed markedly decreased adverse effects on HMVECs vasculogenesis and hiPSC-CMs contractility in vitro. The therapeutic window was increased in vivo, leading to regression of human T315I mutant CML xenografts comparable to ponatinib but without increasing serum levels of cardiac troponin. The kinase inhibition profiles of the “safe” analogues compared to ponatinib identified candidate mediators of ponatinib-induced toxicity. Validation by selective knockdown revealed likely mediators of cardiotoxicity, including FGFR.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: We succeeded in engineering a cardiovascular safe TKI that retained effective therapeutic properties against BCR-ABL T351 mutated form of CML, but with substantially decreased cardiovascular toxicity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Anna Pavlovna Hnatiuk, Arne A.

Reengineering the substrate specificity of BoNT/A’s protease domain (LC/A) could expand its therapeutic applications; however, LC/A’s extended substrate recognition (≈ 60 residues) challenges conventional approaches. We report a directed evolution method for retargeting LC/A and retaining its exquisite specificity. The resultant eight-mutation LC/A (omLC/A) has improved cleavage specificity and catalytic efficiency (1300- and 120-fold, respectively) for SNAP23 versus SNAP25 compared to a previously reported LC/A variant. Importantly, the BoNT/A holotoxin equipped with omLC/A retains its ability to form full-length holotoxin, infiltrate neurons, and cleave SNAP23. The identification of substrate control loops outside BoNT/A’s active site could guide the design of improved BoNT proteases and inhibitors.</jats:p>"
