      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article deals with the theoretical aspects of the problem of reengineering the topological structures of terrestrial ecological monitoring networks. As a result of the analysis of the current state of the problem, it was revealed the need to changethe network of monitoring  points, to  increaserequirements  for  the  efficiency  and  accuracy  of  observations, as  well  as  to  do  the  more  advanced technologies  for  collecting,processing,  storing  and  transmitting  information.  All  this  is  possible  due  to  reengineering  of  existing monitoring  networks.  This  requires  the  improvement  of  network  system  optimization  technologies  and  their  software  in  terms  oftaking  into  account  the  features  of  the  reengineering  problem,  as  well  as  the  mathematical  models  and  methods  used  for  this.  To solve  the  problem  of  reengineering  of  terrestrial  monitoring  networks,  an  aggregative-decomposition  approach  is  proposed.  The approach is divided into a set of tasks considering their interconnections in terms of input and output data. This made it possible to define a set of tasks that form the basis of reengineering procedures. To increase the efficiency of  technologies for computer-aided design and reengineering of networks, a set of mathematical models is proposed that covers the main stages of their life cycles. The article discusses: a systemological model of iterative technology for obtaining design solutions; analytical models for evaluating the properties of network reengineering options in terms of efficiency, reliability, survivability and costs; models for identifyingeffective options for network reengineering based on Karlin and Germeier theorems; a model for evaluating the local properties of options in the  form  of  a  utility  function  of  local  criteria;  model  of  scalar  multicriteria  estimation  of  network  reengineering  options  based  on utility  theory.  The  utility  function  makes  it  possible  to  implement  both  linear  and  non-linear  (including  Z-andS-shaped) dependencies  on  their  values.  For  the  practical  implementation  of  modelsof  multicriteria  problems  of  reengineering  of  topological structures of networks, it is proposed to use the method of generation of effective design solutions in parallel with the generation and the method of comparator parametric synthesis of the scalar multicriteria estimation function. The performance and efficiencyof the proposed  mathematical  models  and  methods  are  demonstrated  by  examples  of  solving  the  problems  of  subset  selection  of  Pareto-optimal  options  for  building  networks  and  parametric  synthesis  of  the  scalar  multicriteria  estimation  function.  The  application  in practice  of  the  proposed  set  of  models  and  methods  will  increase  the  degree  of  automation  of  network reengineering  processes, reduce  the  time  for  solving  the  problem  of  multi-criteria  choice  due  to  the  reduction  in  the  time  complexity  of  the  analysis procedures, and increase the stability of the decisions made by compromising their choice only from a subset of effective ones.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Consultations with specialists are essential for safe and high-quality care for all patients. Cardiology consultations, due to a progressive increase in cardiology comorbidities, are becoming more common in hospitals prior to any type of treatment. The appropriateness and correctness of the request, the waiting time for delivery and the duration of the visit are just a few of the elements that can affect the quality of the process. Methods: In this work, a Lean approach and Telemedicine are used to optimize the cardiology consultancy process provided by the Cardiology Unit of “Antonio Cardarelli” Hospital of Naples (Italy), the largest hospital in the southern Italy. Results: The application of corrective actions, with the introduction of portable devices and telemedicine, led to a reduction in the percentage of waiting for counseling from 29.6% to 18.3% and an increase in the number of patients treated. Conclusions: The peculiarity of the study is to apply an innovative methodology such as Lean Thinking in optimizing the cardiology consultancy process, currently little studied in literature, with benefits for both patients and medical staff.</jats:p>"
