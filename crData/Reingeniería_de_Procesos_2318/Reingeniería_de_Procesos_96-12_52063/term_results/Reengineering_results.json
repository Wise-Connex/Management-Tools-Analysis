      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reengineering a whole organization, rather than only a function or subelement, is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. The human and organizational complexities exceed those arising from technological innovations. The top-level strategic redesign is made first and the subsequent redesign of lower-level processes must support that new top-level design. The reality of time-based competition necessitates a simultaneous reengineering of the various elements of the organization. That simultaneity further increases the complexity of the reengineering. Control by enumeration becomes impossible and if attempted may defeat the reengineering effort. This paper presents methods for coping with the complexity and maintaining strategic control while empowering those change agents unleashed by the reengineering effort. A case study of an application is presented. A basis for strategic control and communication of strategies and authorized constraints to those redesigning the lower-level processes is established.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Advances in new Information Technologies (IT) and changes in the business environment such as globalization and competitive pressure have prompted organizations to embark on reengineering projects involving significant investments in IT and business process redesign. However, the evidence of payoff from such investments can be classified as mixed as best, a problem we partly attribute to the absence of a strong theoretical foundation to assess and analyze reengineering projects. We seek to apply complementarity theory and a business value modeling approach to address some questions involving what, when, and how much to reengineer. Complementarity theory is based on the notion that the value of having more of one factor increases by having more of another complementary factor. Further, related developments in the optimization of “supermodular” functions provide a useful way to maximize net benefits by exploiting complementary relationships between variables of interest. Combining this theory with a multi-level business value model showing relationships between key performance measures and their drivers, we argue that organizational payoff is maximized when several factors relating to IT, decision authority, business processes and incentives are changed in a coordinated manner in the right directions by the right magnitude to move toward an ideal design configuration. Our analysis further shows that when a complementary reengineering variable is left unchanged either due to myopic vision or self-interest, the organization will not be able to obtain the full benefits of reengineering due to smaller optimal changes in the other variables. We also show that by increasing the cost of changing the levels of design variables, unfavorable pre-existing conditions (e.g., too much heterogeneity in the computing environment) can lead to reengineering changes of smaller magnitude than in a setting with favorable conditions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We propose a reengineering of the educational system that focuses on mastery and on more substantial learning activities and eliminates the constraints on learning that arise from the current insistence on grouping children by age. Our basic argument is that eliminating the age-based approach to education has striking advantages that outweigh any social disadvantage. Age-based grouping is, in historical terms, a recent reaction, driven initially by social trends that grew partly out of the realization that children pass through developmental stages and even more out of a wave of superficial approaches to efficiency that attended the beginning of mass production in industry. Through most of history, age grouping has been minimal. We think there are good reasons for this, which we discuss below. The most powerful reason is the extremely large variance found in any index of learning achievement, even in relatively homogeneous populations. We further argue that modern information systems allow richer educational activities, research-based methods, and multiage schooling to proceed efficiently and effectively. This creates a moral imperative to provide real learning opportunities to the whole of the student population. </jats:p>",

A murine anti-human CD11a mAb, MHM24, has been humanized and shown to prevent adhesion of human T cells to human keratinocytes and the proliferation of T cells in response to nonautologous leukocytes in the mixed lymphocyte response assay. However, of the nonhuman primate CD11a that we tested, the murine and humanized mAbs cross-reacted only with chimpanzee CD11a. To have a mAb available for preclinical studies in rhesus monkeys, the humanized mAb was reengineered to bind to rhesus CD11a by changing four residues in one of the complementarity-determining regions, CDR-H2, in the variable heavy domain. Cloning and molecular modeling of rhesus CD11a I-domain suggested that the changes from Lys197 and/or Arg189 in human CD11a I-domain to Glu197 and Gln189 in rhesus CD11a I-domain may be the reason that rhesus CD11a does not bind to the murine and humanized mAbs.</jats:p>",
