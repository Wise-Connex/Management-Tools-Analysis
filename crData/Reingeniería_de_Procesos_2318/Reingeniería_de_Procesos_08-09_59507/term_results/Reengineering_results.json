Ninety‐nine employees were also surveyed on their perceived empowerment and work‐monitoring pre‐ and post‐BPR.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings revealed intense work monitoring in the post‐BPR environment. For the redesign of routine processes, tighter work monitoring is coupled with continuous efforts to formalize behaviors, leaving little need or scope for real empowerment. Greater empowerment is evident only in the redesign of non‐routine processes, through a Panopticon‐like combination of greater empowerment and higher work monitoring.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research suggests the applicability of Panopticon as a conceptual lens in understanding and reconciling the apparent contradictions greater empowerment and heightened work monitoring in reengineered workplace. It suggests the need for future research to begin bridging the disparate empowerment and control literature.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study shows practitioners how they can leverage the discipline of visibility to orchestrate control creatively in a reengineered environment. The glimpses of post‐BPR workplace also help managers to better anticipate change management issues.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper addresses an important issue of BPR work impacts. Its suggestion of Panopticon as a conceptual lens also provides a refreshing look at the traditional issues in BPR.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The blood glucose distribution in clinical practice (Clinical-eProtocol-insulin) was similar to the research use distribution (Research-eProtocol-insulin); however, the mean values (119 mg/dl vs 113 mg/dl) were statistically different ( P = 0.0001). Hypoglycemia rates in the research and practice settings did not differ: the percentage of measurements ≤40 mg/dl (0.11% vs 0.1%, P = 0.65) and the percentage of patients with at least one blood glucose ≤40 mg/dl (4.2% vs 3%, P = 0.23) were not statistically significantly different. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title><jats:p> Our electronic blood glucose protocol enabled translation of a research decision-support tool (Research-eProtocol-insulin) to usual clinical practice (Clinical-eProtocol-insulin). </jats:p></jats:sec>",
