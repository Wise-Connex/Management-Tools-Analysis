      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current sharing economy suffers from system-wide deficiencies even as it produces distinctive benefits and advantages for some participants. The first generation of sharing markets has left us to question: Will there be any workers in the sharing economy? Can we know enough about these technologies to regulate them? Is there any way to avoid the monopolization of assets, information, and wealth? Using convergent, transdisciplinary perspectives, this volume examines the challenge of reengineering a sharing economy that is more equitable, democratic, sustainable, and just. The volume enhances the reader's capacity for integrating applicable findings and theories in business, law and social science into ethical engineering design and practice. At the same time, the book helps explain how technological innovations in the sharing economy create value for different stakeholders and how they impact society at large. Reengineering the Sharing Economy is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.</jats:p>",

For this reason, we are particularly interested in the role of mental health in strengthening the immune system in times of COVID-19. What protective factors help maintain and support the good mental health and well-being of any person who faces extreme pandemic-like situations? The Pandemic has had significant and variable impacts on people’s mental health and immunity system. Every family who faces the Pandemic directly or indirectly experiences partial or no control over their thinking, emotions, actions, and coping related to COVID-19 and deaths. To achieve good mental health and a strong immunity system, maintaining the homeostasis of mind and body, engagement in close connections, and social support, using low-stressor techniques, nearness to the environment, practicing Yoga and meditation, infusing positivity, and following healthy lifestyles are necessary for people. In addition, there is an emphasis placed on various approaches to the 4 M’s, which include mental health, mental immunity, mindset, and stressor, to jettison all mental health tangles and minimize the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Thus, mental health and immunity can be restored by controlling the overwhelming thoughts, emotions, and actions of COVID-19 through the inculcation of life-savior techniques and the 4 M’s as a part of daily life.</jats:p>"

Documentary methods are the techniques used to categorize, investigate, interpret and identify the limitations of physical sources, most commonly written documents, whether in the private or public domain (personal papers, commercial records, state archives, communications, or legislation). The data that will be examined is the data for the period 2021-2022. The data was obtained through observations and documentation. The study revealed that family businesses in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia need to be restructured to keep pace with the Kingdom’s vision 2030 and the requirements of the local and international capital markets for achieving tangible success in the business sector in Saudi Arabia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study examines the reengineering of small-scale business enterprises as predictors of youth employment and poverty alleviation. Four objectives and four research questions were posed. The population of the study was two hundred and sixty (260) registered businesses. The study was carried out using a survey research design. A research-created questionnaire titled \"Reengineering of Small-Scale Business Enterprises as Predictors of Youth Employment and Poverty Alleviation\" was used to collect data (RSCBEPYEPA scale). The instrument was validated by one test and measurement expert and two vocational education experts. A trial/pilot test was conducted on 40 registered businessmen and women in Akwa Ibom State who were not part of the main study population, and the study received an overall reliability coefficient of 0.92 using Cronbach's alpha data analysis. The survey was given to 260 registered businesses. The entire study population was used. To answer the research questions, the data was analyzed using means and standard deviation, and the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) statistic was used to test the hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance. The result showed that the government provided small-scale businesses in Cross River State with financial support, capacity-building programs, legislative support, and the provision of facilities for youth employment and poverty alleviation. It was recommended, among other things, that small-scale business entrepreneurs should take advantage of the financial support provided by the government to boost their businesses.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nReceived: 10 January 2023 / Accepted: 26 February 2023 / Published: 6 March 2023</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agricultural sector in Indonesia is a superior sector compared to other sectors. The red onion commodity in Indonesia has the highest household consumption rate. Nowadays, technological developments are widely used to support existing agriculture to get maximum results. One of the technologies that can be used in agriculture is blockchain. The application of blockchain has gained importance in information systems and information technology research in the agricultural sector. However, in Indonesia, precisely in Central Java, there is no red onion supply chain management that uses blockchain technology for data storage, data security and data transparency. The author has a goal to re-engineer to overcome these problems by implementing blockchain technology using the Hyperledger Fabric and modeling business processes with Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). This research uses the Business Process Re-Engineering Life Cycle method in which this research produces red onion supply chain management with a new business process that is described by Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and produces blockchain applications with various features and testing has been carried out using the Black box testing method with the result that existing features can run well without problems and the web application is running according to user needs to support supply chain management deficiencies so that they become more optimal and transparent in data storage.</jats:p>"

The proposed strategy can predict the performance of the neighboring nodes as the next hop. For more precise prediction and less computational complexity, the states of the UAV swarm motion and the network are considered as the prior information, and the PIO-based NN framework is established. Based on the system model, PIO is applied to find the optimal weight matrices of the NN-based routing prediction model. The matrix of the hop count index function is calculated using this prediction model. The proposed strategy can directly determine the next hop based on the prediction results or can be combined with other routing methods to maintain a balance between the stability and the shortest path. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrolysis of 2-Chlorobenzal chloride is the primary production method of 2-chlobrobenzaldehyde in industry, but the reactor technologies and reaction processes of this method are traditional and underdeveloped, in which the dichotomous leaf hydrolysis agitator is commonly used, resulting in low efficiency during the hydrolysis process. In this article, ANSYS software was utilized to enhance the hydrolytic reactors used in industrial production by simulating and analyzing the dispersion characteristics of droplets in the reactor. The particle size distribution of dispersed phase droplets and the Sauter mean diameter (D32) were used to characterize the dispersion effect, and the dispersion characteristics of the dichotomous leaf agitator and the three-bladed back-curved impeller, three-bladed propeller impeller, open turbine impeller, and crescent impeller were compared and studied. The results showed that there was a log-linear relationship between the D32 of the dispersed phase and the stirring speed in different systems; the number of tiny droplets in the three-bladed back-curved impeller system increased remarkably, and the droplets size distribution width decreased significantly, achieving mass transfer enhancement in the hydrolysis reaction system. The reliability of the simulation results was verified by the measurement experiment using the Sauter mean diameter (D32) of dispersed phase droplets. The results showed that the Sauter mean diameter (D32) variation trend is consistent with that of the simulation, and the error between them is less than 10%. A lab-scale hydrolytic reactor was designed and produced based on the scheme of an industrial hydrolytic reactor equipped with a three-bladed back-curved impeller, the effect of the hydrolytic reaction was verified, and the process conditions were strengthened under the same conditions. The results showed that, compared with the case in the reactor using a dichotomous leaf hydrolysis agitator at the same reaction temperature and catalyst conditions, the reaction time of hydrolysis completion reduced to 58.33% at the lab-scale, and to 63.89% at the industrial-scale at the stirring rate of 446 r/min, using a three-bladed back-curved impeller. These results provide a technical scheme and a basis for process strengthening for improving the production efficiency of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde production equipment in industry.</jats:p>"
