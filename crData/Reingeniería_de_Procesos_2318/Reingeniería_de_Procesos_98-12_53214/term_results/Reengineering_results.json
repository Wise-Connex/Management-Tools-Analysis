      "abstract": "<jats:p>Successful school reform requires a paradigm shift which begins with unlocking the school’s existing culture before attempts are made to integrate reform variables. Reengineering, and rethinking and radical redesign of internal processes calls for discarding current practices and reinventing better ways to supply products and services. Holistic thinking, cross‐sectional configurations, proactive behaviour patterns, reward for innovation and creativity, and the demise of traditional infrastructures are essential for facilitating fluid social, economic and political trends into the 21st century. Educators must think differently about the purpose of schools and their delivery and redesign infrastructures which are built on shared values and beliefs, multiple interacting linkages and teamwork. School leaders are the catalysts for change and, working with the school’s power agents and modeling expected behaviours, motivate teachers to replace the old culture with new processes of schooling. Shared ownership of case values, realistic and achievable goals and collaboration places the responsibility for creating a reengineered delivery system on teachers themselves.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a comprehensive account of how the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) successfully managed organizational transformation to achieve significantly increased customer satisfaction, enhanced organizational agility, and dramatic reduction in tax arrears. The case study reaffirms that the soft issues are the hard issues in reengineering. Indeed, the recognition by IRAS that people resource issues are at the heart of change is the major factor for its success. In addition to tackling people issues, the transformation experience of IRAS also reveals the need to integrate the traditional change models more tightly in managing large‐scale change. The inability of IRAS in anticipating all major consequences of their change actions suggests an improvisational model of change management. Organizations embarking on large‐scale transformation should consciously build their internal capabilities to tackle emergent changes (e.g. establishing the information systems for change, nurturing people resources, and providing slack resources).</jats:p>",
