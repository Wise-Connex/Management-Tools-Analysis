      "abstract": "<jats:p>Complex systems are not of static nature. Most are governed by a particular set of laws and behave accordingly to a certain range of expected inputs and variables, but they can also evolve in response to unforeseen stimulus. The same principle can be applied to industrial information systems. Larger systems such as an entire company or a network of companies may be divided into further subsystems, including information systems, each behaving autonomously but is still under influence of the others, interacting with them in a holistic manner. This paper explores this relationship and proposes a conceptual solution to the strain of sustaining interoperability in complex service-based networks from the domain of manufacturing. To such effect, and in order to tackle the complex relationships and dependencies implicit in web-service environments, information modeling is used, allowing for the optimization of several service engineering activities and enterprise business processes while maximizing the efficiency of system’s interactions. Hence, service modeling and orchestration is here suggested as a baseline to network monitoring, and as a possible approach to automatically handle and recover from erratic behavior, providing systems with adaptive web services and self-organizing capabilities.</jats:p>",

Indeed, after the identification and classification of process and illustration of the organizational objectives and criteria, the effect of each process on each objective and criterion is calculated to select the most appropriate processes for reengineering purposes.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed methodology uses fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) technique to convert the qualitative data (DM’s opinion) to quantitative ones and then calculates the effects of each process on the organizational objectives and criteria. Then, by using the result of fuzzy QFD, the amount of satisfaction of each process according to each criterion is calculated. By combining this data with other effective variables in BPR projects such as “cost” and “time,” a multi-objective goal programming (GP) model is formulated and solved to identify the most appropriate business processes.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In fact, a quantitative model is presented in which fuzzy QFD and GP methods are combined to help DMs to adopt an appropriate strategy for implementing BPR projects successfully by selecting proper processes for reengineering purposes. In addition, the presented model uses both qualitative and quantitative data and turns them into quantitative ones. An example is also provided to show how the model works.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Following this investigation, other researchers could able to complete the model with more dynamic and local variables to enhance the accuracy of the model.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The introduced model will support organizations and managers to select appropriate processes for BPR; so in practice, the mentioned projects will be more efficient and successful.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The paper study is essential for organizations, because the presented decision-making model is based on fuzzy QFD and GP methods that enable the enterprises to select the business processes during the BPR projects easily. In this paper, a GP model is presented to create a balance between organizational satisfaction level and cost and time of implementing BPR projects considering organizational constraints. The proposed model was applied to a real case and the authors showed that it is an easy-to-use, valid, and powerful tool for implementing BPR projects.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The implementation of these measures allows: to improve the separation degree of light and heavy gas components (improves the quality and yield of commercial gas and increases the yield of stable gas condensate), to ensure the recovery of the cold reduced condensate (reduces the temperature at the stage of the low-temperature separation), to reduce the pressure loss during preliminary raw gas treatment (which increases feasible pressure drop at the low-temperature separation stage) and decrease the amount of gas flared (increases yield of commercial gas).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It's shown that providing the high quality of commercial products at inlet pressure decrease to 2-2,5 MPa, commercial gas output increase up to 1,5-2% and stable gas condensate up to 12-15% are the results of developed solutions implementation that prolongs the terms of highly profitable field operation for 10-15 years and increases integral profitability of business by 30-40%. Thus, reengineering is an effective margin increase instrument of gas-condensate fields development.</jats:p>",

Its efficiency in treating multiple drug‐resistant bacterial infections, particularly methicillin‐resistant <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> (MRSA), has had a profound effect on the treatment of life‐threatening infections. However, the emergence of resistance to vancomycin is a cause for significant worldwide concern, prompting the urgent development of new effective treatments for antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Harnessing the benefits of multivalency and cooperativity against vancomycin‐resistant strains, we report a Click Chemistry approach towards reengineered vancomycin derivatives and the synthesis of a number of dimers with increased potency against MRSA and vancomycin resistant <jats:italic>Enterococci</jats:italic> (VRE; VanB). These semi‐synthetic dimeric ligands were linked together with great efficiency using the powerful CuAAC reaction, demonstrating high levels of selectivity and purity.</jats:p>",
