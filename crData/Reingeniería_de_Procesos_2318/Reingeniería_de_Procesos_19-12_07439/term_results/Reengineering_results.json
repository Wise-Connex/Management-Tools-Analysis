The last couple of decades have seen significant updates to national standards of practice and librarian core competencies. This book presents a well-rounded view of the current state of electronic resources management in academic libraries, with chapters covering a wide variety of topics, including discovery, analytics, vendor relations, and departmental reorganization. Even if managing electronic resources is not one of your primary job duties, this book can provide valuable insight into an ever-growing field of librarianship that impacts library service at all levels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, most companies can select a number of methodologies to improve their business processes, including Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Kaizen and Business Process Reengineering (BPR). Obviously, the choice of an appropriate methodology should be guided by the goals of the organization. In this regard, BPR is one of the best methodologies that can help companies ensure the continuity of their business so that they remain relevant for a long time. More importantly, BPR can help members rethink their existing practices and make significant improvements to the existing business process. The authors conducted a study of the theory of BPR. The main definitions are considered in detail, the essence of reengineering is revealed, five stages of implementation are named, possible positive and negative points in the process of BPR implementation are noted, examples are given. Based on the foregoing, it was concluded that companies that need to make changes in their business processes can adopt BPR as the most suitable methodology that will help to make improvements in their workplace.</jats:p>"

In general, this information system manages customer data, water usage transactions, reports needed on web-based systems. This system has been running for 3 years. The purpose of this research is to produce the requirements for accounting information system software needed. This study uses the Reengineering Software Framework method, namely Business process Reengineering (BPR) which focuses on the reengineering framework of accounting information systems. The results of this study in addition to implementing the framework, also produce standard document content produced at each stage in the BPR. The implications of this study are expected to be used as a reference for future similar studies.</jats:p>",

BPR inherits, explores and implements the building of process change, to incorporate enhancements to the essential considerations and protocols of (SEM) Software Engineering Management. Machine Learning (ML) can be the key aspect for BPR in software development organization. The goal of this research study is raising the conceptual vision about integration of automation technology like ML and its life cycle development within Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of the software product and highlights benefits and drawbacks ML techniques in SPM (Software Project Management), and how to implement ML in standard SEM practices. We have attempted the introduction of machine learning in SEM to determine specific performance and tasks reuse using empirical analysis and discussion on implementation of ML algorithms. The empirical study of software technologies includes control structure of an autonomous software application. In current era, ML imparts consistently promising accuracy in some SEM fields. The goal of this paper is an empirical and analytical study and literature review to propose desired level of quality software, through the comparative evaluation of existing processes and their respective support for Software Quality Engineering (SQE).</jats:p>"

Software Project Management (SPM) is a scientific art for planning, controlling execution and monitoring. SPM approaches are more focusing towards the essential requirement for the success of software project development. It has been very challenging to manage software development using existing project management procedures driven by software development organizations and this is one of the areas of problem statement for this research. This paper discusses an analytical study for the requirements and consideration of BPR in SPM, explores to spot and emphasizes the important success factors for the execution of a BPR using benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in software development organization. BPR is organizational mechanism that improves ability to respond to challenges of qualitative result by change and improvement in software engineering processes, productivity, product quality and competitive advantages. AI will be the best approach and scope of automation SEM processes for software development organizations. This paper also represents a conceptual view of software engineering model shift for improvements in capability of project managers to handle agile thinking and problem solving for betterment of SPM using Artificial Intelligence.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article defines the concept of \"variable costs\", describes the value of variable costs in the formation of marginal income of the enterprise and proposes a model of costing products with allowance for variable costs investigated in terms of re-engineering internal business processes. It is established that when classifying costs by product types or cost carriers, cost grouping is carried out according to production volume. The American and French models of variable and fixed income financial statements are presented. There are some controversial issues when using margin calculations. The article deals with Bernoulli differential equation, which describes the economic process of formation of sales. Functional dependence of sales on variable sales costs is considered. The dependence of the marginal income of the enterprise on variable costs is also mathematically substantiated. The maximum value of the marginal income of the enterprise is found with the optimal value of the level of sales, which depends on the variable costs. It is shown that the rate of change in marginal revenue is inversely proportional to the difference between the average price of the nomenclature of products produced and its average cost. A differential equation system is considered, the solution of which is the optimal value of the sales function, which is related to the maximum value of the marginal revenue, depending on the variable costs of the sales function. The formula of profitability of the sales function from variable costs is deduced. It is shown that the optimal value of the sales function, which is achieved with the maximum value of the marginal revenue of the enterprise, can be obtained through a statistical study of the level of consumer demand, which determines the level of sales that the company could obtain in the case of approaching at additional variable costs, calculating the value of the maximum possible level sales of the enterprise, which depends on the market share in the field of market relations, as well as on the volume of production.</jats:p>"
