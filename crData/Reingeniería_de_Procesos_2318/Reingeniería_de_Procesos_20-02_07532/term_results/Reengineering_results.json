      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inclusive development is a newly emerging notion that is gaining substantial attention, especially in international civil societies. The aim of this study, therefore, is to discuss the drivers of inclusive development in Africa, paying special attention to the political economy and structural change variables. Ordinary Least Squares regression is run in STATA 14 to test if there are statistically significant correlations between the five-year average scores of inclusive development index (IDI) as an endogenous variable and (proxies of) the five-year trend in economic growth, technology, structural change, trade, and political economy as exogenous variables. The panel data are pooled from 21 African countries among which 9 countries are landlocked. The regression is run in two scenarios. As an alternative scenario, IDI is pooled from the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2017 report and used as a dependent variable. In the other scenario, IDI is computed by incorporating variables relevant to the African context then used as a dependent variable. In the IRID customized version, the five-year trends of GDP, health facility, the institutional and structural change variables viz. democracy and employment opportunity in the industry sector are statistically significant determinants of inclusive development. Accordingly, an inference is drawn claiming that inter alia a nation is as prosperous, inclusive and resilient as the quality of its governance institutions and enforcement capability. This is in line with the conventional thought in African studies which claim that a natural resource endowment per se is not the sole determinant of development. Finally, to anchor IDI with a pragmatic paradigm, a three-stage institutional reengineering model is proposed which could be applied in different development governance endeavors.</jats:p>"

Recognizing the advantages behind BPR, a leading organization in Indonesia which is engaged in property sector, seeks to improve itself in order to face competition from its competitors. This study aims to evaluate the success of the organization in implementing BPR in terms of cost, time, quality and flexibility by comparing the observations of conditions before the implementation of BPR and afterwards. The results of this study indicate that the success of an organization in implementing BPR cannot be separated from the support and communication established by Management to its subordinates. Likewise, the strategic role of Information Technology (IT) is also a key success factor achieved in the implementation of this BPR. The existence of IT has enabled changes to the design of the business process because IT is more than just a tool to automate the process but is also the fundamental that shapes how the business itself is done</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is an organizational strategy seeking identification of critical factors affecting software development practices in Software Engineering Management (SEM). The agile approaches opened the door of BPR in software development organizations. Dynamically changing technological environment has invited software development organizations, towards adoption of reengineering of strategies and practices. Nowadays, Scrum has been trending as an agile framework for Software Engineering Management (SEM) in software development organizations but considerable research work has not been done with Scrum and its successful implementation yet. The goal of this research is to highlight weaknesses and limitations of Scrum like project level documentation, planning, estimation, progress tracker, CICD etc.; and identification of challenges and issues with implementation of Scrum in software project development like large scaled project in distributed work environment with multiple Scrum teams, organizational structure, lack of knowledge ad awareness about Scrum; using empirical analysis and literature studies. The result of this research will open the door for the next stage of research to overcome the limitation and issues with implementation of Scrum and raise a request of BPR towards focus on improvement in SEM practices in software development organizations by proposing proper training about the empiricism control theory of Scrum that helps organizations in understanding the successful implementation of Scrum and its benefits. This research also raises a question in the form of suggestion that it is good time for a hybrid form of Scrum with other standard agile based frameworks or traditional SDLC methodologies.</jats:p>"
