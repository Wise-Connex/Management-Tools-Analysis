      "abstract": "<jats:p>In management, there are many management approaches that can improve the efficiency of the enterprise. At the same time, the priority of enterprise development is the implementation of innovative activities. To succeed in this area, companies are changing management approaches, organizational structures and business models. However, in the conditions of constant aggravation of competition, achievement of high indicators of activity of the enterprise is best provided at the expense of reengineering of business processes. The innovation of reengineering is that it combines the use of the prerogatives of computer technology, human resource management technology and business process change. In the current economic conditions, the speed of reaction of all subsystems of the enterprise and the efficiency of operations are of particular importance and are a necessary condition for its effective operation in conditions of constant competition. In this situation, reengineering is the most effective, because it helps to increase the efficiency of the enterprise by changing the business model it uses. Thus, the study of reengineering procedures, its principles and objectives is relevant today. The purpose of the study was to generalize theoretical approaches to the basic principles, types and objectives of business process reengineering as a tool for effective enterprise management. The methodological basis of the study was the work of domestic and foreign scientists on the problems of reengineering and change management. Business process reengineering is a thorough rethinking and radical redesign of business processes of companies that want to significantly improve their performance. It is used in cases when it is necessary to make an informed decision on the reorganization of activities: radical transformations, business restructuring, replacement of existing management structures with new ones, etc. Through the effective use of business process reengineering tools can make the company more flexible to changes in the environment and more resilient in a competitive environment. Thus, business process reengineering involves a decisive, radical restructuring of business processes and the foundations of management to significantly increase the competitiveness of the enterprise in the market and significantly increase the efficiency of the enterprise as a whole system.</jats:p>"

The predefined accuracy of the keel of a light aircraft and molding surfaces of technological equipment for its manufacture has been ensured by using reengineering technology and CAD systems. A portrait of the actual physically existing keel of a light aircraft was built in the *.stl file format using the software Artec Studio (USA). The control and comparison of the geometry of the shapes of the analytical standard with the actual physically existing keel of a light aircraft based on its portrait have been implemented. The methods used are the analysis and synthesis of the experimental geometry of shapes, the method of expert evaluations. The following results were obtained: based on the analysis and synthesis, the presence of significant errors in the accuracy of the manufacture of the keel for a light aircraft in the range from −5.26 mm to +5.39 mm was detected. It has been shown that the key factor is the keel's relative plane indicator, which is outside the tolerance margin and is 85 %. It was decided to fabricate new technological equipment from another material – organic plastics. Control of the technological equipment made from organic plastics for the keel of a light aircraft showed that the shape-forming surfaces of the equipment have appropriate shapes and sizes corresponding to the existing analytical standard and are devoid of inaccuracies that occurred in the previous version. The range of keel margins that was made using the new technological equipment from organic plastics is from –0.51 mm to +0.34 mm while the relative plane of the keel outside the tolerance margin does not exceed 15 %. The study results showed the adequacy of the decisions taken, ensuring the predefined accuracy for the keel of a light aircraft and molding surfaces of technological equipment for its manufacture.</jats:p>"

One of the most problematic places is the possibility of conducting marketing research to ensure the competitiveness of enterprises. The paper used the hypothetical method in substantiating the theoretical and methodological principles of organization and functioning of bio-alliances as the basis of bio-economy for rural areas. The study used the economic-statistical method, ranking of economic zoning, correlation and regression and cluster analysis. These methods were used in the elaboration of directions, sources and strategies of development, components of system and process management, state support for the implementation of traditional and new socio-economic and environmental functions. Also in the course of the work, methods of ideal modelling, mathematical modelling and programming, abstract-logical and structural-logical, extrapolation, expert evaluations, surveys, observations, qualitative and quantitative, imaginary and social experiments were used. The results of the market analyses of agricultural companies showed the inexpediency of agricultural companies. Based on the research, modelling and re-engineering of business processes through the implementation of organisational, corporate, business and functional strategies was proposed. The new form of agrarian enterprises, proposed in the work, is «bioalliance», based on the principles of integration of tourism sphere, sphere of organic production and production of eco-commodities, as well as using bio-resources as the main source. Compared to similar known methodologies of strategic management, the proposed methodology provides enterprises with a high level of importance in the regions, increasing the efficiency of the use of the resources available in their ownership.

Scientific and technological progress, changes in consumer demand and production capabilities of the construction industry, nature and climate change, sanitary, environmental and geological changes make implemented area development (planning) solutions obsolete. Renewal, qualitative reconstruction and transformation of territories resolve contradictions between consumer needs and characteristics of urban planning solutions. The reengineering of areas (sites) is an effective response to the community demand for a comfortable and safe environment (territory) for living activities. Processes of transformation and reorganization of territories encompass various reengineering methods.  Materials and methods. The subject of this research is the reengineering of areas. The authors present its organizational pattern, encompassing renovation and reclamation. They have identified and described the reengineering events, that may result in a number of land site transformations. The criteria that characterize the organization of actions towards the reengineering of areas are described. Research methods include structural and functional analysis.  Results. The authors have found that the reengineering of areas deals with the choice of a management pattern (for exa­mple, a general contractor agreement, an engineering services provision agreement, or a consolidated solution). It is observed that the action/workflow management methods and patterns determine the breakdown of participants by the stages and types of reengineering works. An assessment of business and production processes is provided subject to the management patterns applied to the reengineering of areas.  Conclusions. A limited choice of organizational patterns is applicable to the reengineering of areas due to the limited choice of activities. It is emphasized that the number of organizational patterns designated for the reengineering of built-up areas will be larger due to their modifications associated with a particular set of participants acting within the framework of event/workflow management methods (a general contractor or an engineering services provider). The conclusion is that in the future organizational patterns, applicable to reengineering, will determine the distribution of functions and provision of resources.</jats:p>"

For any software developer, maintaining software for a longer period is the primary objective. This objective can be accomplished if good quality software is developed. Maintainability is one of the vital characteristics of software maintenance. Maintainability enables developers to keep the system alive for a longer period of time at a limited cost. Software Maintainability can be enhanced using reengineering. The proposed research validates improvement in the quality of the reengineered software system. The quality of the software is analyzed using a coupling, cohesion, inheritance, and other essential design metrics. The observed improvement in the software design is 62.1%. The execution time of the software is also reduced by 6.5%. Reduction in the cost of maintenance is also another important outcome of this research. The observed reduction in the maintenance cost is 36.8%. Thus, the main objective of the proposed research is to analyze and validate the quality improvement in the reengineered software. Agile Scrum methodology has been used to perform software reengineering. Design Metrics are measured using the Chidamber and Kemerer Java metric (CKJM) version-9.0 tool.
