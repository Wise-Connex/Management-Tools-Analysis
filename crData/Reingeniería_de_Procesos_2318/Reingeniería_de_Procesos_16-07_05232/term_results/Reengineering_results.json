Furthermore, new models that support transportation processing are required. One possible model would be a fourth party logistics service provider (4PL) approach in order to increase the efficient use of resources. The purpose of this paper is to describe a method for reengineering a transportation handling process using the 4PL approach. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Based upon a case study approach existing processes for transportation handling are modelled. Specifications of and definitions for the 4PL approach are compiled and analysed through a literature review. With the help of expert interviews essential functions are identified and the target model is validated. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The results of the effort demonstrate that the application of a 4PL approach facilitates an improved transportation process. This may be due to the modification of the IT and communication technology (ICT) that have been applied. Based upon expanded planning horizons an improved planning of orders, a strengthening of the competencies of the involved actors were observed. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Transportation handling in the agricultural sector is of increasing importance in light of the need to feed a growing global population under the condition of limited productive land for agriculture. This paper describes the alterations in the ICT infrastructure as well as the resulting organisational and technical implications, if a 4PL is used. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The 4PL approach is an issue that is increasingly discussed in scientific publications. Furthermore, this approach has experienced new opportunities for implementation due to recent developments in ICT.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Inspired by the clinical success of using chimeric antigen receptor T cells to treat certain types of cancers, Ellebrecht\n            <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>\n            asked whether a similar approach might also work against antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. They engineered T cells to express chimeric receptors consisting of the disease-causing autoantigen desmoglein 3 fused to signaling domains that activate T cells. When given to diseased mice, the engineered T cells targeted and killed B cells that express antibodies targeting desmoglein 3, hinting that such a strategy may be an effective way to treat antibody-driven autoimmune diseases.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:italic>Science</jats:italic>\n            , this issue p.\n            <jats:related-article xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"doi\" issue=\"6295\" page=\"179\" related-article-type=\"in-this-issue\" vol=\"353\" xlink:href=\"10.1126/science.aaf6756\">179</jats:related-article>\n          </jats:p>",
