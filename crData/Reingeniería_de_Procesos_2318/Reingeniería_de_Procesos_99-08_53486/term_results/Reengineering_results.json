      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores organizational culture by examining the relationship between total quality management (TQM) and culture, and specifically three elements of a culture related to quality improvement: customer focus, employee involvement, and continuous improvement. Process reengineering is used as an alternative management initiative. A survey of 220 mid‐level professionals in 123 organizations was conducted to determine the extent to which there is a relation between the presence of these cultural elements, and the presence of TQM reengineering. The success of process improvement through either TQM or reengineering is used as a vehicle for examining the importance of these cultural elements. The importance of organizational culture and the implications for managers are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managerial and cost accounting textbook discussions of the “process view” of activity-based costing (ABC) often fail to communicate how companies use activity-based accounting, benchmarking, continuous improvement and reengineering techniques to improve their business processes. Such knowledge is valuable to students who will enter globally competitive markets. ITT Automotive North America is a business case that gives the reader the benchmark figures, cost and other process-performance data, and activity descriptions necessary to complete a project to improve a company's process to acquire and pay for small-dollar goods and services. Because of the cross-functional nature of the issues involved in process improvement, the case would also fit well in either an auditing or information systems course.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In contrast to hen egg-white lysozyme, which retains the β-configuration of the substrate in the product, T4 lysozyme (T4L) is an inverting glycosidase. The substitution Thr-26 → His, however, converts T4L from an inverting to a retaining enzyme. It is shown here that the Thr-26 → His mutant is also a transglycosidase. Indeed, the transglycosylation reaction can be more effective than hydrolysis. In contrast, wild-type T4L has no detectable transglycosidase activity. The results support the prior hypothesis that catalysis by the Thr-26 → His mutant proceeds via a covalent intermediate. Further mutations (Glu-11 → His, Asp-20 → Cys) of the T26H mutant lysozyme indicate that the catalytic mechanism of this mutant requires Glu-11 as a general acid but Asp-20 is not essential. The results help provide an overall rationalization for the activity of glycosidases, in which a highly conserved acid group (Glu-11 in T4L, Glu-35 in hen egg-white lysozyme) on the β-side of the substrate acts as a proton donor, whereas alterations in the placement and chemical identity of residues on the α-side of the substrate can lead to catalysis with or without retention of the configuration, to transglycosidase activity, or to the formation of a stable enzyme-substrate adduct.</jats:p>",
