      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study introduces an integrated method for managing process risks in a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) project, using Robust Data Envelopment Analysis (RDEA) and machine learning (ML). The goal is to prioritize risks based on three standard factors of PFMEA: Severity, Occurrence, and Detection (S-O-D), and incorporating two additional factors (Breakdown Cost and Breakdown Duration) seen as undesirable outputs. The model also accounts for the effect of uncertainty on expert-estimated values by applying disturbance percentages in the linear PFMEA-RDEA model. A machine learning model is proposed to predict new values if partial or total modifications have been made to the processes. The approach was implemented in an au-tomotive sector company, and the results showed the impact of uncertainty on values by com-paring different approaches such as RPN, PFMEA-DEA, and PFMEA-RDEA. A new reduced risk categorization was achieved, who allowed for decision-makers to focus on necessary actions for reengineering.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article examines what imperatives and trends affect the marketing activity of construction participants and require its radical restructuring. A survey was conducted of thirty enterprises that are participants in investment construction projects (five enterprises are development companies, twelve are contractors, nine are design enterprises, and four are suppliers of construction materials), with the aim of identifying the main imperatives of their development and the introduction of innovative methods in operational and marketing activities. It was revealed that the main imperatives for the development of construction enterprises are the digitization of all business processes, orientation to environmental trends and the introduction of a flexible, adaptive system of interaction with consumers, as this provides an opportunity to promptly take into account their requirements and needs. It was found that all surveyed project stakeholders can and do use digital tools, social media platforms, and data analytics to refine their target audience, interact with diverse consumers, and increase awareness of environmental activities in the market. This underscores the need for investment and construction project participants to embrace global imperatives to transform marketing activities to remain competitive and relevant in a changing digital business environment. Consumers of construction products are the main stakeholders of investment and construction projects, who are really interested in obtaining housing of high quality, compliance with ecological standards and for the optimal price. Therefore, customer relationship management (CRM), implementing CRM systems to manage customer interactions, track leads, and improve communication throughout the project lifecycle is a must for building a successful developer marketing strategy. All surveyed businesses responded that, given the growing need for sustainability, they align their marketing activities with sustainability principles to meet consumer expectations. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Results-Based Financing (RBF) in pediatrics, in regions with scarce resources like Northern Uganda, provides an innovative approach to enhancing healthcare delivery. RBF aligns financial incentives with desired health outcomes, boosting service quality, efficiency, and effectiveness by tying compensation to achieving specific, measurable health targets.\nLacor and Kalongo hospitals, before the introduction of RBF, faced numerous challenges, including limited resources, staffing shortages, and inconsistent quality of care. RBF adoption requires critical health outcomes to target, such as lowering child mortality rates, enhancing vaccination coverage, and increasing the frequency of timely prenatal care visits.\nThe empirical application of RBF in pediatric services at Lacor and Kalongo Hospital from 2018 to 2024 shows improved healthcare quality and outcomes. Healthcare systems can identify ways to implement RBF models better, ensuring that financial incentives effectively contribute to attaining superior health outcomes.</jats:p>"

The timeline of the research started in August 2023 and was summarised in the beginning of January 2024. The main methods were expert interview, monitoring of international and Ukrainian internet platforms, and document analysis. The study showed that the main aspects of business processes reengineering in publishing houses, based on the use of AI, are: (1) development of business strategies and plans; (2) development of digital spaces in publishing houses; (3) emerging of new professions; (4) discussions and their summaries; (5) received manuscripts check; (6) finding plagiarism; (7) preparation of creative, advertising, and presentation materials; (8) working with numbers and databases. The recommendations on the use of AI in business processes are extracted from the policies of the organisations connected with the book publishing industry. They are presented in the convenient table for further use.\r\nOne of the study results showed that Ukrainian publishing houses discuss the capabilities of AI for generating different types and formats of content, and based on that, AI capabilities for reengineering are considered. One of the biggest challenges, created by AI, is that the technology develops faster than people can perceive so they struggle to describe the technology itself and its impact. It means that we should adjust to the changes, caused by exponential development of AI, finding resources to overcome unequal access to AI capabilities in the process of specialists’ preparation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve their market position and competitiveness, organizations aim to shorten production times, cut costs, and boost the quality and variety of their products. While Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is a good method to achieve these goals, implementing it can be risky: any change to a task in the initial process directly affects the final process's performance in terms of time, cost, and quality. This article, drawing on design science, a literature review, and a field study with responses from executives and managers of two companies in the aerospace and automotive sectors in Morocco to measure their satisfaction and identify their risk management needs, provides an overview of the BPR method, its implementation frameworks and methodologies, and explains the importance of risk management in such projects. It suggests an improved continuous risk management process for BPR projects that enhances the gathering and use of risk management data through machine learning. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2024-08-03-019 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

Exosomes contain significant bioactive components, including lipids, proteins, mRNA, and miRNA. Exosomes play an important role in regulating cellular signaling and trafficking under both normal physiological and pathological circumstances. A multitude of factors, including thermal stress, ribosomal stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative stress influence the concentrations of exosomal mRNA, miRNA, proteins, and lipids. It has been stated that exosomes derived from stem cells (SCs) modulate a range of stresses by preventing or fostering cell balance. Exosomes derived from SCs facilitate recovery by facilitating cross-cellular communication via the transmission of information in the form of proteins, lipids, and other components. For this reason, exosomes are used as biomarkers to diagnose a wide variety of diseases. The focus of this review is the bioengineering of artificial exosomal cargoes. This process encompasses the control and transportation of particular exosomal cargoes, including but not limited to small molecules, recombinant proteins, immune modulators, and therapeutic medications. Therapeutic approaches of this nature have the potential to deliver therapeutic medications precisely to the intended site for the cure of a variety of disorders. Notably, our attention has been directed towards the therapeutic implementations of exosomes derived from SCs in the cure of cardiovascular ailments, including but not limited to ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, sepsis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac fibrosis. In general, researchers employ two methodologies when it comes to exosomal bioengineering. This review aims to explain the function of exosomes derived from SCs in the regulation of stress and present a novel therapeutic approach for cardiovascular disorders.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article investigates the impact of environmental factors on the business process reengineering of transportation companies. The focus is specifically on the activities and business processes of Ukrainian transportation enterprises. Following a review of scientific and practical sources, a scientific task was set: to determine the impact of factors on the reengineering process through a proposed methodological approach to economic-mathematical modelling. The article utilizes correlation regression analysis and analysis-synthesis methods to evaluate the dynamics of key financial indicators of transportation enterprises. It emphasizes that reengineering should be based on the influence of various factors, not necessarily related exclusively to either the external or internal environment. The approach proposed in the work involves using regression models to analyze the impact of factors on the reengineering process. The study notes that innovation is revealed through the proposed model, which considers a range of key factors and indicators of the activity of Ukrainian transportation enterprises. Meanwhile, the authors stress that using this approach allows for identifying key factors in developing an effective reengineering strategy for transportation companies to optimize their operations. The research examines how different analysis methods can be used to detect changes in the impact of various types of factors, both external and internal, on the decision-making process regarding reengineering. The scientific novelty lies in a comprehensive approach to regression modelling of factor impacts on a relevant variable to identify the most significant factors for decision-making regarding reengineering. Alongside this, the research has limitations due to the focus on the specifics of the activity of only Ukrainian transportation enterprises. The goal is set for further research to conduct a similar study for other types of enterprises, particularly the food industry, which requires changes under wartime conditions.</jats:p>"
