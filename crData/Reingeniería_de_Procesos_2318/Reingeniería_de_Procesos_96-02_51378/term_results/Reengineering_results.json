The tool transforms VMS/Rdb applications written in C and embedded SQL into a portable, database-independent application interface which can be directly installed on a target platform and database management system with a separate customization tool. The converter is based on standard techniques developed for compiling programming languages. The original task of the converter was to port a large administrative system from VMS/Rdb into Oracle, but the tool can be used for other reengineering applications as well.</jats:p>",
