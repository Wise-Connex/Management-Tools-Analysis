      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, organizations conduct change projects based on reengineering processes because business processes reengineering (BPR) methodologies implement process-oriented approach. By this view governmental organizational also utilizes such methodology. One of the main practical issues of such implementation is about using BPR methodology in relief organization. On the other hand, Iran has been faced with an increase of accidents in various forms. Thus having more efficiency in relief agencies to deal with these accidents and maintain readiness in the face of threats is essential. Relief agencies should be covered by the Unexpected Disasters Center in order to carry out their missions and duties perfectly. Therefore, familiarity with the tasks of each group is inevitable. Given the foregoing, the main objective of this study is to investigate how we can develop a reengineering project based on BPR approaches in Iran relief agencies. By this we propose a new model for reengineering which has the main capabilities of general models in BPR methodology. In addition, we show the prerequisites of implementing new model in Iran Unexpected Disasters Center.</jats:p>"
