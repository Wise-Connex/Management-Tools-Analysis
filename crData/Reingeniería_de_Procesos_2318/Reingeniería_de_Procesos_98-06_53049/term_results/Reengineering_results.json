      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business process reengineering (BPR) is following a typical maturity cycle as a business fad. Some of the more radical and flashy elements are omitted as the basic principles integrate into common sense and business and engineering school curricula. The ways of evaluating benefits become more precise. This is illustrated by three case studies, in which the benefits are classified into customer perceived value, cost savings and business option value. The latter is not a direct consequence of an implemented reengineering project, but a set of new abilities that an organization must exercise separately as a part of a strategy process. This provides a conceptual link between reengineering and some of its critics arguing for a more proactive approach to value creation. The lasting contribution of the reengineering movement is the insistence on using both technology and organizational change together.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>BPR can be deconstructed into four different identities. In the first place it is a product of the management fad industry. In the second place it is part of a neo‐Taylorist movement because of the following characteristics: a top‐down streamlining of operations, unproblematic acceptance of typical Taylorist solutions and the prevalence of assertions that the outcome for workers is an upgraded work content. In the third place BPR is a euphemism for downsizing. Downsizing is much more at the core of BPR than some of its proponents would have it. Finally, BPR functions as a non‐normative, descriptive label for process oriented change. The paper seeks to show how the different identities of BPR interact and get into one another’s way.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Maintenance is undergoing a major revolution. The management of maintenance is being impacted by business-driven changes that are forcing fundamental improvements to the maintenance function. Maintenance planning and execution are now considered as a strategic component of asset life cycle management. The link between maintenance and design is being furthered by placing emphasis on considering reliability and maintainability during the design phase. The application of Reliability-Centered Maintenance is becoming an important method for determining the optimum maintenance program for facility assets, while at the same time providing a solid foundation for triggering selective system improvements and design changes and managing life cycle cost and risk associated with assets. The concept of dependability provides the focus for integrating design, operations and maintenance into a coherent and complete life cycle approach to facilities. Dependability is strongly linked to quality standards since, for many companies, dependability is the major component of quality that has to be satisfied to meet customer needs. This paper describes the practical application of a quality approach to a gas transmission company which has recently undergone a reengineering of its design, operations and maintenance processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we explore the genesis and operation of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) within a medium-sized U.K. bank from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. We dismiss the claims of those evangelical gurus who assume that BPR can be decontextualized and decoupled from organizational politics and posit that BPR can be managed instantaneously and unproblematically. Instead we argue that BPR is likely to be constituted by and through political relations, and that BPR in turn will reconstitute organizational forms and norms, in a highly political fashion. We endeavor to build upon current approaches toward organizational politics. We illustrate that politics is not simply about resistance to some putative organizational norm of stability or uniformity as BPR's gurus imply. Nor does it derive \"exclusively\" from diverse interest groups pursuing separate or conflicting ends that can be juggled and managed as processual or pluralistic accounts of organizational change tend to assume. Neither, in this instance, can one interpret politics as being entirely axiomatic with labor's resistance to management (capital) which is characteristic of a traditional labor process analysis, although expressions of this were apparent in our case study. We suggest that politics \"also\" needs to be understood in terms of power and identity relations or how individuals seek, through political maneuverings, to further or secure their individual careers and identities in an uncertain world. In view of this, we argue that politics are essential to the very fabric of organizational life, which renders the outcomes of BPR uncertain and contested. </jats:p>",

Bottom‐up oriented Continuous Improvement projects on the other hand experience typically a lack of strategic orientation and do not necessarily improve the enterprise process system as a whole. The MOTION (MOdel for Transforming, Identifying and OptimiziNg core processes) approach developed in a European Union project provides a method to combine the strengths of the top‐down approach of business process reengineering with the advantages of the bottom‐up oriented continuous improvement process to create well balanced processes to meet customer requirements. The MOTION guidelines were developed by a consortium of European industrial companies and universities.</jats:p>",

As an example of the reengineering of prototype part procurement in Porsche AG’s development centre, a specially developed 3x3 reengineering procedure is represented which not only implements methods and tools but also the reengineering project structure and experiences gained from it. The main aim of re‐engineering was to reduce the running time of the part procurement from 30 days to just one. This means a simultaneous reduction of the prototype construction time to about 20 hours. From results it can be established that after 20 weeks the success of the reengineering stabilised and the targeted running time of one day became apparent. The accompanying project evaluation crystallised various success factors. In particular the establishment of a competent and motivated team leader, as well as on‐line process controlling supported by IT implementation, have proved to be a successfully decisive measure and tool respectively.</jats:p>",
