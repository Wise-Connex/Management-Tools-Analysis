This paper puts Quality of Service (QoS) of the protocols and reliability assessment of software system together, with aims at research on very large complex software system in reliability assessment, which is consisted of individual components in distribution of the perception layer, network layer and application layer of IOT and subsystems. At the same time, this paper adopts reengineering technology to realize the reliability evolution of software system in IOT application conditions, and improve the reliability index of software assessment further.</jats:p>"
