      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most small- and medium-size businesses, including hotels, are usually organized by function. In functional organization, people who perform similar tasks or have similar skills are grouped together into one department. The authors propose that hotels currently organized by departments should group tasks into coherent business processes, such as customer communication, product development, and problem resolution. The advantages of reengineering by processes include: performance is measured by customer-based criteria; job preparation shifts from training to education; executives are able to be leaders and facilitators rather than checkers and arbitrators; and employees and departments become less protective of their turf and more productive. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Los Alamos National Laboratory is a large science- and technology-based organization that has recently undertaken a major reengineering effort in an attempt to maintain its competitiveness in a rapidly changing world. Although the initial thrust was toward altering processes, management systems, and culture, it was decided that a major reorganization was needed as well. Along with the reorganization came a flattening of the management hierarchy and an almost complete change in the composition of the senior management group. This restructuring has had profound effects on the organization, requiring a new approach to management by the senior executives, and, at least initially, has swamped process and systems changes that will ultimately determine the success or failure of the effort. This paper documents the journey – how the structure and behaviors of the senior management group had to change to work in the new environment, trickle-down effects of reorganization, levels of decision-making, integrating processes and systems, and communicating with employees – and identifies some lessons learned that might be useful to other large technical organizations contemplating such changes. </jats:p>",
