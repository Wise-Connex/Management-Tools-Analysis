In this paper, firstly, a review of the main digital enablers of Industry 4.0 and the current state of cognitive manufacturing is carried out. Secondly, Cyber-Physical Systems are conceived from the holonic paradigm, as an organizational enabler for the whole of enablers. Thirdly, the bijective relationship between holonic paradigm and container-based technology is analyzed. This technology allows mapping the physical and virtual holon as an intelligent agent embodied at the edge, fog and cloud level, with physical and virtual part. Finally, the proposed holonic system based on the cyber-physical holon is developed through multi-agent systems based on container technology. The proposed system allows to model the metabolism of manufacturing systems, from a cell manufacturing to whole value chain, in order to develop, evolve and improve the sustainable value chain.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the work is to create a mathematical model and methods for solving problems of optimization of topological structures of centralized logistics networks in the process of reengineering, taking into account many topological and functional constraints. The article solves the following tasks: analysis of the current state of the problem of system optimization of logistics networks and methods of its solution; formalization of the problem of system optimization of logistics networks as territorially distributed objects; development of a mathematical model of the problem of optimization of centralized three-level topological structures of logistics networks at the stage of reengineering; development of a method for solving the problem of optimization of centralized three-level topological structures of logistics networks at the reengineering stage; estimation of time complexity of the method of optimization of centralized three-level topological structures of logistics networks. The following methods are used: methods of systems theory, methods of utility theory, optimization and operations research. The following results were obtained: analysis of the current state of the problem of system optimization of logistics networks and methods of its solution; the problem of system optimization of logistics networks as territorially distributed objects has been formalized; developed a mathematical model of the problem of reengineering three-level topological structures of logistics networks in terms of cost and efficiency for the case of combined production and processing points; methods of directed search of variants of construction of a logistic network which use procedures of coordinate optimization and modeling of evolution on the basis of genetic algorithm are developed; estimates of the accuracy and time complexity of optimization methods of centralized three-level topological structures of logistics networks are obtained. Conclusions: Based on the results of the study of methods for solving the problem, an approximation of their accuracy and time complexity was performed. In practice, this will allow you to choose a more efficient method for solving large-scale practical problems, based on the required accuracy, available computing and time resources. The method based on the coordinate optimization procedure has a significantly higher accuracy, but it is more complex from a computational point of view. The accuracy of the evolutionary method based on a genetic algorithm can be increased by increasing the number of iterations. The practical use of the proposed mathematical model and methods of reengineering the topological structures of centralized closed logistics systems by jointly solving problems for direct and reverse flows will reduce the cost of transport activities of companies.&#x0D;\nKeywords: closed logistics; logistics network; optimization; reengineering; structure; topology.</jats:p>"

Companies are required to provide better products/services than their competitors. PT XYZ is a company engaged in food manufacturing. The products produced are snacks which are grouped into 4 parts, namely crackers, biscuit noodles and wafers. The business process in the sales department is still very manual and outdated because ordering goods is still over the phone which is considered inefficient. Therefore, improvement is needed by accelerating the time cycle of each activity and simplifying a series of activities as well as the use of technology that cuts business activity activities that have no added value and is repeated. One concept that can be applied is to reengineer business processes (BPR), namely the use of android technology with ESIA method which is able to facilitate marketing from anywhere using an android-based communication device.</jats:p>",

Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan business proses reengineering yang memperbaiki proses bisnis dengan menerapkan teknologi informasi, sehingga rancang ulang proses bisnis tersebut dapat memperbaikan bisnis dari yang manual menjadi terkomputerisasi melalui sistem. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan penulis, dapat disimpulkan jika hasil dari perbaikan proses business process reengineering dapat di implementasikan di TLS Cargo dengan input database di dalam sistem Login. Dengan adanya sistem Login ini, admin ataupun user dapat menginput proses pengiriman dan dapat mengirimkan progress data secara realtime. Hasil efisiensi yang diperoleh dari adanya rancang ulang proses bisnis TLS Cargo adalah 86,99% yang menunjukkan peningkatan efisiensi sebesar 30,52% jika dibandingkan dengan sebelum rancang ulang.</jats:p>"

The features of operation methods of ground facilities objects of oil and gas fields in relation to the nature of the allocation of costs and the transparency of investment are given. The differences between infrastructure maintenance and optimization measures, as well as between the concepts of optimization and development/adaptation, are established. The differences are that the main goal of optimization is to reduce costs or minimize risks, the development/ adaptation of existing production capacities is most often carried out for technological reasons, and the maintenance of the existing infrastructure and its operating modes is carried out exclusively in accordance with the design characteristics. The analysis of the methods of operation of the ground infrastructure facilities of the fields showed that when implementing reengineering programs, a comprehensive approach to their assessment is implemented, which allows the most efficient use of financial resources.</jats:p>",
