The utility transformed the way it runs its business by instituting a changed culture of empowered and responsible employees, self‐directed work teams, employee‐developed work practices, enhanced technology, and a new model for cooperation among employees, union, and management. As a result of the reengineering process, the utility was able to reduce staff without any layoffs (and despite continued growth) and achieve first‐year savings of $3 million.</jats:p>",
