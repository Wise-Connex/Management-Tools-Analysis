      "abstract": "<jats:p>Issues of relevance and necessity of reengineering business processes of HoReCa enterprises are investigated. Significant advantages of business process reengineering are emphasized. After all, this method of redesigning activities is an effective means of significantly improving the activities of hospitality enterprises.\nThe purpose of the work is to substantiate the content, stages and format of the organization of business process reengineering for HoReCa enterprises.\nThe work substantiates the thesis that hospitality and catering services have always been characterized by high profitability. However, the global crisis has become a difficult test for the entire HoReCa industry.\nThe emphasis of the work is on the fact that the reengineering of business processes is an effective measure to ensure the further effective development of HoReCa enterprises. Reengineering is the basis of a radical change in the development of enterprises, ensuring significant competitive advantages and achieving an improvement in the financial condition.\nThe work presents the author's interpretation of the concept of «organizational support for the reengineering of business processes of a HoReCa enterprise» - this is a complex system of processes and procedures for carrying out reengineering in accordance with the set goal of radical transformations of the enterprise, which, based on the interaction of this enterprise with other business entities, as well as with the structures and divisions of the enterprise itself, contributes to the introduction of significant changes in the enterprise's management system.\nThe article emphasizes that the reengineering of business processes is the embodiment of a complex program of transformations and fundamental restructuring of the functioning of enterprises. Its important components are: replacement of the existing management system with new effective concepts; development and implementation of improved business processes and their management methods; preliminary assessment of the acceptability of the riskiness of radical change projects.\nThe authors emphasize that the reengineering of business processes of HoReCa enterprises is a rather complex transformation mechanism. But it is thanks to him that every enterprise in the field of hospitality is able to carry out qualitative improvement of its business processes.\nKeywords: HoReCa, hospitality industry, reengineering, business processes, organizational support, strategy, information technologies, organizational structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interest in the reengineering process of human resources and entrepreneurial learning contributes to enhancing the success of organizational revitalization, especially concerning corporate sustainability. This study builds a conceptual research framework and adopts the descriptive analytical approach based on the data of 239 samples from the employees working in travel and tourism companies in Malaysia. The findings indicate the existence of a statistically significant effect of human resources reengineering on various dimensions of organizational revitalization. Amongst them, pioneering/entrepreneurial learning as a moderating variable also has a significant and positive influence on organizational revitalization. The implications of this study mostly emphasize the necessity for travel and tourism companies to maintain their sustainability through reengineering human resources. In accomplishing strategic tasks for human resource development and achieving the strategic goals, these essential issues such as encouraging workers to innovate and continuously raising their awareness of entrepreneurship need to be acknowledged.</jats:p>"

This research was conducted through interview, observation, and documentation. Informant as the data source of research is internal informant (service provider) and external informant (service user). The method used in deciding the data source was purposive sampling method. The result of research showed that based on the result of fishbone/cause-effect and value added analyses on administrative service held, some classical problems were still found. The administrative service procedure analyzed had Value Added Ratio of 86.36% and thereby needed improvement. The problems existing need business process reengineering on administrative service in order to support the achievement of objective, an effective and efficient administrative service. The analysis of the business process reengineering result using Business Impact Analysis showed 21 positive and 8 negative values, and thereby this result is feasible to be implemented further.</jats:p>"
