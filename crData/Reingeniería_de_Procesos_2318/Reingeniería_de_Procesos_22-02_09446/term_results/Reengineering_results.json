      "abstract": "<jats:p>:The article examines the possibility of using various approaches to reengineering at furniture enterprises. Constantly changing competitive conditions dictate new rules for the sale and production of commercial furniture products. First of all, the situation on the furniture market has undergone changes caused by restrictive measures. Most furniture businesses have been forced to switch to online sales. The quality of the information provided on the sites, the speed of processing an online order, as well as delivery and service began to depend on the volume of revenue and business reputation of the enterprise, a decrease in the level of which may be caused by the presence of problematic and bottlenecks in current business processes.</jats:p>",

This creates conditions for making automatic management decisions and makes it possible to more effectively manage the financial and economic activities of an agricultural enterprise. The use of information technologies makes it possible to reduce the costs of producing services and goods, establishes closer relationships between consumers and producers of agricultural products. Digital technologies make it possible to train, train and retrain employees and organize their joint work activities. The reengineering of state support for the agricultural sector should primarily be aimed at the introduction of digital information technologies in agriculture. This will create conditions for improving the efficiency of the agricultural sector, increase its competitiveness and reduce the need for state support.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The innovative content of the components, stages, and results of the construction and implementation of the toolset, which provides a formalized assessment and choice of a rational scenario for reengineering implementation at a modern enterprise in the form of a target project, was displayed. The need for research is caused by the fact that the existing approaches to reengineering business processes in an application for construction enterprises require significant adjustments. The reengineering of a construction enterprise as a target project should be coordinated with the projects and works executed by a construction enterprise.\nThe proposed analytical support makes it possible to determine for each of the construction enterprises an alternative to reengineering adapted for its needs. Modules as part of the proposed analytical support implement a single algorithm of unambiguously formalized substantiation of the construction enterprise renovation project – through a developer reengineering project. This toolset allows rationalizing and adjusting decisions on the coordination of determinative characteristics of the above project – the essence of changes, their duration, estimated cost, investment stages.\nThe presented study provides a clearly formalized management technology for evaluating and selecting reengineering options, determining in advance the future benefits of reengineering transformations, namely, functional-technological, technological, technical, managerial, and economic changes. The created analytical support makes it possible to perform successful administrative support of a reengineering project. Its implementation will ensure an irreversible qualitative \"jump\" in the trajectory of the life cycle of an enterprise and expected strategic priorities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a representation learning framework HE-LSTM model for heterogeneous temporal events, which can automatically adapt to the multiscale sampling frequency of multisource heterogeneous data. The proposed model also demonstrates its superiority over other typical approaches on real data sets. A controlled study is performed according to computerized randomization, with 38 patients in each of the two groups. The study group has a higher resuscitation success rate and patient satisfaction than the conventional group (P &lt; 0.05), and the time from the first consultation to the completion of the first ECG, the time from the completion of the ECG to the activation of the path lab, and the time from the emergency admission to the balloon dilation were significantly shorter in the study group than in the conventional group (P &lt; 0.05). The emergency care process reengineering intervention helps patients with acute myocardial infarction to be treated quickly and effectively, thus improving their resuscitation success rate and satisfaction rate, and is worthy to be caused in the clinic and widely applied.</jats:p>",

However, several factors specific to high energy density materials entailing electrode reactions inhibit their application. Fluorination has shown a promising ability to combat the detrimental electrochemical performances of cathode materials, however, it remains difficult to achieve the desired functionality. Herein, a novel electrochemical fluorination (ECF) that demonstrates a promising electrochemical performance enhancement via stabilization of the cathode–electrolyte‐interphase (CEI) by forming conformal LiF is proposed. Besides LiF surface layer formation, ECF reduces the degree of fluorination‐induced Ni/Li disordering and enhances the layered structural stability as probed by X‐ray diffraction. Because of the robust CEI, ECF‐NMC811 cathodes deliver 203.0 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> first discharge capacity at the current rate of <jats:italic>C</jats:italic>/10, with ≈98% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. Similarly, it delivers ≈180 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> capacity at a 1 C rate with 86.4% capacity retention up to 200 cycles with average coulombic efficiency of &gt; 99.5%. Comprehensive characterization with a multitude of probes reveals that ECF enhances the cycling stability of the electrode without altering bulk structure and morphology.</jats:p>",
