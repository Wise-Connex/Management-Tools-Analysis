      "abstract": "<jats:p>Extractive Software Product Line (SPL) is a well-known approach that organizations can use to transform their legacy applications into an SPL. In this sense, the SPL reengineering process emerges as a possible strategy for applying the extractive SPL. Available artifacts used to perform the SPL reengineering may change, requiring software engineers to adapt their approaches as a means to satisfying the companies&amp;apos; scenarios. However, there is a lack of an approach supporting this adaptation considering different scenarios. To address these limitations we propose the Prepare, Assemble, and Execute Framework SPL reengineering (PAxSPL). PAxSPL is composed of three different aspects: a process, guidelines, and a supporting tool. For evaluating PAxSPL, we extracted eight different scenarios from the literature. Results evidenced that PAxSPL is customizable to a variety of scenarios with different reengineering artifacts, techniques, and activities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The business process of the J20 production department is currently experiencing obstacles in terms of information delivery, production report, maintenance report, and problem information that causes decision making is often irrelevant. This is due to the use of paper media with a long bureaucratic flow so that the cycle time becomes inefficient. This study used business process reengineering, modeling business process in business process modeling notation (BPMN), and supporting research problem analysis used fishbone diagram. The result showed changes in a process flow, job desk, unit elimination, and proposed design of information systems in the form of application software as a solution to the problems studied, so that it is expected to obtain process time efficiency of 65.1% and cycle time of 99.2% of the previous total time. Proses bisnis departemen produksi J20 saat ini mengalami hambatan dalam hal penyampaian informasi, laporan hasil produksi, laporan maintenance, serta informasi problem, yang menyebabkan pengambilan keputusan sering kali terjadi bias. Hal ini di sebabkan oleh penggunaan media kertas dengan alur birokrasi yang panjang sehingga waktu siklus menjadi tidak efisien. Pada penelitian ini digunakan metode Business Process Reengineering, dengan memodelkan bisnis proses dalam Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN), serta pendukung analisa masalah penelitian digunakan diagram tulang ikan. Hasil penelitian menunjukan adanya perubahan alur proses, jobdesk, eliminasi unit, serta usulan perancangan sistem informasi berupa software aplikasi sebagai solusi dari permasalahan yang diteliti, sehingga diharapkan dapat diperoleh efisiensi waktu proses sebesar 65,1% dan waktu siklus sebesar 99,2% dari total waktu sebelumnya.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to the processes of marketing communications in the context of informatization and digitalization of society. The problem of oversaturation of information platforms with content is considered. As a solution, it was proposed to use influencer marketing tools with integrated manifestations of the pop culture. The informational prerequisites for the use of this approach are revealed. The transformation of the marketing-mix components is described, as well as examples and cases of using the proposed method for solving the existing problem for each of the components are presented. The principles of integrating pop-cultural influencer marketing tools for each of the marketing mix components are formulated. The relevance of the reengineering of brand communications with the consumer by integrating pop-cultural influencer marketing tools into the components of traditional marketing is determined.</jats:p>",
