The main barriers to successful implementation were reported as tactical short‐term solution driven approaches, which inadequately considered the people issues, and an over reliance on IT‐based technology. It is proposed that the factors for success include adopting a strategic approach, which prioritises business processes for BPR projects. This should include the establishment of appropriate company‐wide targets and measures that emphasise continuous improvement for the long term. Finally, management needs to motivate and involve employees as a key enabler by removing their fears that BPR is really a “downsizing” exercise, and emphasising improved co‐ordination of people and technology.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research has limitations in that the respondent companies are UK‐based and therefore the internationalisation of the findings requires further validity.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The discussion and conclusions from this work are made in a practical manner.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Some useful primary data from the UK industry which makes the work original and of value to both academics and practising managers.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
