The organisation is portrayed as a process linking the key competitive capabilities of cost, quality, time and flexibility. Empirical data are used to calibrate the model and predict improvements stemming from business process reengineering (BPR). The model is evaluated and suggestions made for future developments. The study highlights the need for more data on the outcomes of BPR and the need for more knowledge on how competitive capabilities are linked.</jats:p>",

The data for the study were gathered through a postal questionnaire survey which was mailed to 535 of Australia’s top businesses. The findings of the survey are compared with earlier studies on BPR conducted in the USA and the UK/Europe. The hypothesis that “expectant business process change is not significantly related to business improvements along dimensions of benefits and corporate impact” is tested. Finally the paper provides recommendations for managers which are seen as important for successful implementation of BPR projects.</jats:p>",

Drawing on the literature on organizational justice and business process reengineering, the article outlines a theoretical framework integrating these two concepts.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Reengineering has attained tremendous popularity for what it promises, but experience shows that its real returns are far lower than expected. This article explores the process of reengineering and suggests that one reason for this lack of results is the traditional technocratic assumptions and practices that underlie the actual practice of reengineering. Based on a field study of a dozen large reengineering engagements, the article suggests that several flawed assumptions about reengineering practice get in the way of producing the desired results. For example, lack of leadership engagement, limited participation, and low commitment to learning all sow the seeds for ultimate lack of results. The article proposes a broader set of assumptions about the process of large-scale change and offers a road map of key processes to guide redesign efforts that engage leadership and employee commitment, motivate employees to change, and set the climate for learning and renewal. </jats:p>",
