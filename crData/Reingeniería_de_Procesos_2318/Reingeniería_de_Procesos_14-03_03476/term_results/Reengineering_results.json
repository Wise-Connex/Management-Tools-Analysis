      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impulse to start the current research is represented by the ascertainment that in the universe of communication there is a persistence of uncertainties regarding the place and the functions of communicational relationship in the processes of communication. This study takes into account the fact that in the nuclear center of communication there is a communicational relationship. The investigation focuses on revealing the conceptual articulations for understanding the idea of communicational relationship. We emphasize the fact that, on the first level, communication is a voluntary social involvement, an intentional existential manifestation. The so-called involuntary aspects of communication are moments of loss of control on generating meanings. There cannot be communication without a will for communication. The meanings are the first level of human will and desire for communication. The second level is the message. Communication itself appears as an integrative third level of human will for communication. We help the emergence to be seen and delineate the criteria for the comprehension of communicational relationships: existential manifestation, the classes of communicators (actors, agents, actants, interactants, transactants), transactivity (transactional criterion), and repetition (iteration). The conclusion is that the communicational relationship is an interpersonal-iterative, transactional and life-existential meaningful manifestation.</jats:p>"
