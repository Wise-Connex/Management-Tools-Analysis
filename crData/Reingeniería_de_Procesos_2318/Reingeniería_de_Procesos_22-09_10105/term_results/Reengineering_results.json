Business processes are a series of activities carried out by organizations to achieve organizational goals, in manufacturing companies the procurement business process is one of the main business processes of the organization. Therefore, in this study, an analysis of the procurement business process was carried out and then designed a more optimal targeting business process engineering for the organization. Business process engineering is carried out by analyzing business processes using the valued added analysis, flow analysis and simulation methods. The results of business process engineering show that targeting business processes that are prepared are better in terms of time and costs compared to existing business processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article describes the methods of organizing industrial relations and the system of managing the economic processes of innovative transformations. Based on the generalization of the provisions of the organization theory and management theory, the methods of organizational and reengineering are ordered into an integral system with clearly defined characteristics, a logical structure and a process for their implementation. The features of the transformation of the control system of such a complex functional and technological formation as a production system are considered. It is noted that it is a synthetic multidimensional phenomenon, which is characterized by three attributive dimensions of the production system: process dimension, object and subject dimensions. It is substantiated that the integration of dimensions provides an opportunity to analyze, study and design a more efficient production management system based on organizational reengineering methods, as well as the opportunity to obtain functioning models focused on an object, formation or practical implementation. It is shown that industrial relations can be of a diverse nature, therefore, when conducting organizational reengineering of the management system, it is necessary to consider managerial, social and economic relations. The most significant factor in these relationships is the level of the management hierarchy, that is, the management environment. It can be divided into what directly controls (influences) and what controls indirectly or regulates. It is substantiated that the control system must ultimately be constantly improved and adapted to the changing conditions of the enterprise's production base. The requirements that the system of managing the economic processes of innovative transformations must meet in the framework of the ongoing technological rehabilitation are formulated. Key words: methodology, organizational reengineering, industrial relations, economic processes, innovations, management system, flexible production systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The need for the development and transformation of urban areas is determined by the growing demand for a high-quality urban environment among the population. The principles and focuses of development of unoccupied and built-up areas are the essential key factors for the formation of a comfortable urban space. The tool for implementing such updates, upgrades and transformations represents a set of appropriate high-quality and well-balanced design solutions, which, if implemented, must most comprehensively suit the purpose of reengineering and be characterized by minimal costs and maximal efficiency in conditions of multifactority. The article addresses the application of parametric modeling to the relevant problem of management and arrangement of reengineering of territories and built-up areas. Materials and methods. The subject of the study encompasses design solutions developed for territories and built-up areas. They are to take into account the features of current urban planning. Parametric modeling and mathematical support facilitate the choice of development options for territories and built-up areas, the management and arrangement of reengineering activities. The algorithm for developing a parametric model entails the regulation of elements and their parameters, taking into account the features of current urban planning solutions (territories and built-up areas). The study presents a classification and description of parameters for the reengineering of territories and built-up areas broken down by the elements, including a built-up area as a set of capital construction projects, a land site, landscaping (including greening), as well as engineering protection. The research method includes structural and functional analysis. Results. Parameters of the consolidated parametric model designed for the arrangement of reengineering of territories and built-up areas are presented (systematized) according to their functions (with an option for their further decomposition), taking into account features of elements of urban planning solutions. It is noteworthy that the consolidated parametric model, developed for the arrangement of the reengineering of territories and built-up areas, takes into account the consolidation of a group of aggregate indicators. The significance of this consolidated parametric model for creating a comfortable and safe living environment is expressed in practical solutions on the implementation of actions consisting in the operation or reengineering of territories and built-up areas based on the data from the information management system, that includes the arrangement of monitoring and collection of information about the condition of territories and built-up areas. Conclusions. The proposed criteria for the qualitative evaluation and identification of the level of importance of reengineering parameters, applied to territories and built-up areas, developed using the mathematical method of structural analytical evaluation (examination), allow for the management of project solution scenarios, implemented in reengineering events, since they convey the compliance between reengineering events and their purpose in the most comprehensive way.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Delphi method is also called an expert consultation method, scientifically measuring the objectivity, practicality, and authority of the metric. This study aims to build a standard plan for chronic disease management care services in hospitals and guide the development of chronic disease management care services. This article proposes a chronic disease management nursing experiment, further revises the current hospital chronic disease management nursing service, redesigns the program, compiles the chronic disease management hospital nursing standard list according to the new program, and uses expert suggestions to modify the standard program items. It adopts a preliminary expert inquiry table, submits Delphi expert inquiry, and constructs a chronic patient prevention strategy for clinical nursing practice to learn from the reference for guiding the actual specific situation of nursing, providing evidence basis and practice guidance. More than 40 initial standards were listed, which were reduced to 30 after revision. The importance of the indicators to different experts was 3.56 to 4.85 points. The coordination coefficient is 0.180~0.356. Finally, after discussion by all parties, more than 40 specific indicators including the size of the new standard have been determined, which provides a great theoretical basis for the establishment of a new type of hospital chronic disease management and nursing service standard in my country. Based on process reconstruction and the Delphi method determined by the hospital chronic disease management nursing service standards, clear normative and operability can provide basis for the development of chronic disease management nursing services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of information technology has opened a new chapter in the world of education. To meet the learning needs of the 21st century, the use of technology in the field of education has been widely used at all levels of education. Advances in information technology have also created e-learning. E-learning applies information technology to manage the teaching and learning process between teachers and students. The implementation of e-learning in conjunction with traditional learning methods has created a new concept in education which is a blended learning mode. Blended learning is the integration between face-to-face learning and online learning that can make teaching and learning more competitive. This learning method is also referred to as e-learning. Through e-learning, learning can take place anywhere and at any time without limiting physical location.</jats:p>",
