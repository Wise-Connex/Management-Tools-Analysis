When vital business processes are reengineered, new ways of managing and controlling the processes are required. A reengineered accounts payable system and the controls that should be included in the system are described. Through training and support of those who will perform the new processes and the appropriate use of internal controls, companies will maximize their benefits from business reengineering.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"
