There emerged in early nineties many commercial network backbones to link with the NSFnet to provide market information to the business firms. The Internet today is a combination of NSFnet and commercially available backbone services disseminating information on the decentralized networks all over the world. It is estimated that there are over 30,000 computer networks connecting over 2 million computers with each other on the Web. In view of the increasing use of electronic information sources through the networks the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) has been designed and made essential for each user networks to abide with the protocol standards which enables the data transfer and retrieval at source.</jats:p>"

Because of the huge scope of legacy systems in the business world (it is estimated that there are 100 billion lines of COBOL code alone for legacy business systems; Bianchi, 2000), data reengineering, along with its related step of program reengineering, of legacy systems and their data constitute a significant part of the software reengineering market. Data reengineering of legacy systems focuses on two parts. The first step involves recognizing the data structures and semantics followed by the second step where the data are converted to the new or converted system. Usually, the second step involves substantial changes not only to the data structures but to the data values of the legacy data themselves (Aebi &amp; Largo, 1994).</jats:p>"

Thus finding satisfying methods to measure the profitability of mobile applications seems to be of great importance. Prior research had its focus mainly on general value dimensions concerning the medical sector or the usability and design aspects of hospital information systems. Conterminous to that, the authors chose a strictly process-oriented approach. They modeled the requirements of future mobile systems as an output of a profitability analysis based on activity-based costing. The cost savings defined as the difference between former and future business processes were used as an incoming payment for an ROI analysis. In a nutshell, the authors present a case study that highlights the value of their analyzing method as well as the enormous benefit of mobile applications in the area of food and medical supply processes in German hospitals. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most public services are overly complex, and separate where citizens have no choice in the service that they receive. All too often, Information and Communication Technologies are overlaid onto existing organisational structures without any consideration to how these structures can be improved. In this context, the UK government is striving towards a vision for government-wide transformation, in which local authorities and central government departments are endeavouring to work with each other to deliver better services to citizens, via a one-stop-shop environment for all services under the guise of electronic government (e-government). Having successfully e-enabled customer facing processes, the UK government is now working towards reengineering and e-enabling back office processes and information systems to facilitate more joined-up and citizen-centric e-government services. These efforts are referred to as the transformational stage of e-government or t-Government. This chapter seeks to explore what t-Government means to local authorities in the UK and what process related challenges have to be overcome to successfully implement transformational change in local government. A number of broader issues of strategic, organisational, socio-cultural, and technical origin are identified in the literature as presenting a considerable challenge for this goal. However, using a case study of a key local government service, this chapter shows that more obviously, but often ignored, process and information systems related issues pose an even more significant challenge in practice.</jats:p>"
