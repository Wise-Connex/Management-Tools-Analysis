      "abstract": "<jats:p>Presents and supports a process‐centered model of undergraduate business education for the core business curriculum and business school management, consistent with the trend toward process‐managed organizations. This model conforms to calls from the public, academic community, and business leaders for improved performance of business faculties and educational institutions and increased capabilities in business school graduates. Outlines five business process courses for the business core curriculum. Benefits of this approach include providing a framework for formulating and implementing a strategy for developing the business curriculum and elimination of redundancy in the coverage of topical material. In addition, the process approach provides a vehicle for the development of interdisciplinary faculty, encourages attention to the need to change, and provides a basis for aligning faculty and institutional reward systems.</jats:p>",
