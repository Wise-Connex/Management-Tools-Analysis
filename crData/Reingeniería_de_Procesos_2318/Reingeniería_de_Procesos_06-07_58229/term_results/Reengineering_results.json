Four cases are analyzed from those two dimensions: high competence/low strategic contribution; low competence/high strategic contribution; low competence/low strategic value; and relational and internal capabilities, where relational capabilities strengthen internal capabilities. Finally, it is established what actions are necessary for the activities analyzed from those dimensions to be a source of competitive advantage by means of relational capabilities created through process integration and outsourcing to highly competent firms.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The development of a short self‐evaluation questionnaire that helps firms implement the methodology and creates the basis for its empirical application by researchers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper studies relational capabilities, an aspect omitted from the internal perspective of the resource and capability theory.

      "abstract": "<p>Due to the rapid changes in information technology (IT), the life cycle to develop an information system has become significantly shorter. Furthermore, companies worldwide have invested much time and effort in developing their existing enterprise application systems in order to maintain their own competitive advantages. Specifically, they are facing a similar problem of preserving the investment. Information system reengineering technology (ISRT) is one way to solve this problem. However, most of the systems reengineered by using traditional ISRT may lack flexibility and reusability and also have some quality concerns. The component-based software engineering can provide some remedy by providing a flexible and reusable enterprise application system. Many companies could benefit from thinking more in terms of building their own business components for their information system areas. This article considers a reengineering approach in order to migrate legacy systems to component-based information systems with a quality control mechanism. Companies can build their own business component libraries in the reengineering process. One additional benefit is to build information systems from business components rather than reinventing the wheel in the future. This study proposed a system architecture and also implemented the prototype system to validate that our mechanism is technically practical. Additionally, we used an example to evaluate that our approach is effective and practicable in the real world.</p>",
