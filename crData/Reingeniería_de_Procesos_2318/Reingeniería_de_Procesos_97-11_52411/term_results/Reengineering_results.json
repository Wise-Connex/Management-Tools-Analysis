The library department head’s job has undergone a dramatic shift from what was, until relatively recently, the typical middle manager’s line command position in the bureaucratic hierarchy. Literature analyzing these changes has been reviewed and is discussed in the context of a specific effort to reengineer library technical service operations.</jats:p>"
