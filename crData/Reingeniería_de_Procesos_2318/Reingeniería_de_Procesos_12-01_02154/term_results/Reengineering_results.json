      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter describes a debacle that occurred when a large assembler of fast moving consumer electronics commissioned the set up of a new supply chain. Four key players undertaking five processes were involved. These companies planned to operate sell-buy relationships. Upon starting to ramp-up of the first product component sets, it became clear that companies did not trust their successors to pay for all goods delivered. Similarly, suppliers were not trusted to deliver perfect goods. Companies receiving component sets refused liability for damage or defects introduced by companies further up the supply chain. A remedial quick-fix using centralised inspection at the principal supplier soon was adopted to facilitate supply of complete sets of mechanical parts to the assembler. Significant similarities exist between the case study supply chain and the concepts used in business process reengineering. The chapter identifies stages undertaken to improve an inbound supply chain for complex plastic mouldings assemblies. The principal research methods used were participant-observer and action orientation. All company names have been disguised to comply with confidentiality agreements. The author was a Logistics Project Leader during the period of this research. He acted as an internal consultant for Alpha Co, with responsibilities for encouraging new product development teams to modify the products to take into consideration ‘design for logistics’ concepts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An Information System can be envisioned as a set of interdependent components that provide the intended services. The component based modeling serves as a tool for collecting requirements of an Information System in user perspective and business perspective at various stages of software development. The chapter presents a methodology for component based modeling and development of an Information System, starting from the requirements definition phase, arriving at candidate components and creation of final components and their interfaces. The methodology aims at clarifying the intricate details and usage of an Information System via business type models and use-case models. The chapter presents the interaction diagrams in order to describe interactions among objects in systems perspective, and context diagrams for reflecting upon the business domain. Finally, the chapter proposes component replacement as a methodology for system reengineering, and model-view-control framework for component refinement and evolution in order to achieve a reengineered information system that reflects upon current requirements in business domain. The reengineering techniques proposed in this chapter can be applied to legacy systems to turn them into a component-oriented reengineered system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The need for reengineering of software systems has dramatically increased as legacy systems are migrated to new platforms and rewritten in modern object-oriented languages. Although the de facto standard for describing object-oriented systems is the Unified Modeling Language (UML), many legacy systems have been documented using non-object-oriented structured analysis and design methods. Problems arise in the migration because non-object-oriented documentation is inherently not conducive to the development of object-oriented systems. This chapter presents a set of rules to automate the conversion of systems which were originally modeled using structured techniques to UML. The newly created UML documentation can then be used in developing an object-oriented equivalent system. The UML model may also be used by computer aided software engineering tools to implement a new system. The reengineering rules are tested on an example structured system to demonstrate their viability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>By using a case study example and focusing on the implementation phase, this chapter presents and emphasises the validity of specific risk management model. Briefly, an overview of another two ERP projects risk management’s models will be provided; the first model deals with ERP as technology where risks are managed in accordance to Information Technology and Information System (IT &amp; IS) projects governance. The second model considers the integrated and interdisciplinary nature of ERP systems and introduces the term “ERP Governance” as a model that demands balance between IT and business governance. The third model, while similar to the second, relies heavily on best-practises and assessment frameworks from the industry. Throughout this chapter, the author explores this model, its importance, and application in contexts similar in nature to those found in the hierarchically structured intergovernmental organizations. Finally, the author concludes that embedding risk management best practices into the organization culture and business processes can positively influence the success of ERP system implementation. In other words, earlier adoption of risk management best practices for ERP system implementation will help both business &amp; projects to meet their intended objectives and thus positively influence the success of ERP projects by ensuring that prescribed goals are met.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the conventional legacy POS payment transaction method, vendors are bound to a payment institute in their region and can only use relatively expensive dedicated or slow dial-up lines to their financial institute. This chapter covers the work to produce an architecture that shows how to reengineer traditional point of sales terminal payments in order to adapt these for payment over the Internet through Web services. With the use of Web services for payment transactions, vendors will get more freedom to choose their provider and the services they take without having to throw away their legacy applications. Given the globalization of the economy, vendors can negotiate services and fees with payment providers all over the world. Literature research and prototype tests and evaluation in this project show that transactions fees and performance of POS terminal payments transactions trough Web services can be competitive to conventional payment transactions methods and create flexibility for vendors POS terminal application. Vendor’s available Internet connections and the Web services standards in the market can be used for payment transactions. With Web services, the system can be created and changed relatively quickly and simply if the right skills are available.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reengineering is a concept that is applicable to all industries, particularly information and communication technology (ICT) projects regardless of organizational type, size, culture, or location. The enterprise resource planning (ERP) system frequently requires organizations to change their existing business processes to harmonize them its functional activities. 72% of the ERP implementation failures reported worldwide (Eric, 2010) because of the various critical success factors (CSFs). A Critical Success Factor (CSF) is defined as a factor needed to implement ERP system successfully. Assessing the importance of CSFs of Enterprise Resource Planning systems has always remained an important concern for academicians and researchers. This study explores and assesses the CSFs affecting the ERP implementation success. Long term Top management Support (LTS), Perceived ERP benefits (PEB), ERP in-house Training (EIT), Project Tracking (PTG), Visible Project Phases (VPP), Project Phase Update (PPU), Interdepartmental Cooperation (IDP), Strategic IT planning (STP), ERP vendor Support (EVS), and Data Analysis and Conversion (DAC) were found dominant critical factors for the success of the ERP implementation in the manufacturing sector. This study investigates how many CSFs are strongly correlated with each other for the success of ERP projects in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, this study also tests empirically using the Statistical Package for Social Science Analysis of Moment on Structures (SPSS AMOS 18.0) to justify the level of CSFs among the local and joint-venture companies using a t-test analysis.</jats:p>"

Through analysis of the gathered data and information, this study aimed to present these risk factors, their impact, and a possible way to measure them. The critical factors identified and the result of this research project can be a trigger to conduct further in-depth analysis of project risks based on categories of projects (maintenance &amp; support projects, development projects, data conversion projects, etc.), or rather, analysis of projects based on the business area/function.

Those problems take a different form in centralized and decentralized inter-organizational process-integration scenarios. This chapter identifies eight process issues to be taken into account when evaluating inter-organizational integration configurations: difficulties to identify when a task should be executed, understanding what a task does exactly, agreeing how to trigger tasks, distributing investments among parties, delivering appropriate service levels, preserving value of the inter-organizational process, process ownership clarity, and managing in the frame of changing relationships. Examples are given of how problems arise in a completely centralized and in a completely decentralized inter-organizational process integration scenarios.</jats:p>"

In this context, Web services are emerging and evolving as solutions for software systems for business applications in terms of facilitating interactions between business to business and business to customers. Web services are gaining significance due to inherent features like interoperability, simple implementation, and exploiting the boom in Internet infrastructure. Thus, this work proposes a framework based strategy using .net for effortless migration from legacy software systems to Web services. Further, this work also proposes that software metrics observed during the process of reverse engineering facilitate design of Web services from legacy systems.</jats:p>"

The rapid change in engineering software, especially for the Aerospace industry, highlights the importance of software management. Negligence of any maintenance component can put the organization into risk. Therefore, standardizing processes are necessary to avoid not only these risks, but also minimize costs and ensure employee productivity. Currently, an Aerospace company upgrades most of their engineering software on an ad-hoc basis. This means that an upgrade is only done when an end-user requests it. The study will therefore examine the current operations and offer a strategic reengineered process. The objective of such changes is to ultimately streamline the distribution of engineering software upgrades proactively throughout the organization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter proposes a context modeling process to help tutors adapt their tutorship actions based on students’ profiles and performance on Technology Enhanced Learning environments (TEL). It attempts also to involve teachers as designers in the engineering process of a TEL system development and to support their activity of auto-regulation regarding the students’ guidance and assistance. This aim leads to improve teaching strategies as well as to enhance the quality of the learning objects and the learning scenario itself. In fact, if the TEL system is already adaptive, by means of this approach, its improvement is fostered. If not, the process will support its iterative transformation from predefined to adaptive. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology is used since it gives educational designers (teachers for this proposal) and software designers the ability to define, communicate, and test a solution while creating artifacts that become part of the overall solution. The Usage Tracking Language (UTL) has been developed to provide the actors of a TEL system (designers, tutors, learners, and analysts) with a dutiful tool to describe the observed uses of the descriptive pedagogical scenario and their semantics, including the definition of the observation needs and the means required for data acquisition. The structure of tracks and their transformations from raw data allows the calculation of indicators which supports the building of users’ models that will influence users’ decision making. Finally, a case study using the Hop3X environment for learning Java programming to apply this process is presented.</jats:p>"
