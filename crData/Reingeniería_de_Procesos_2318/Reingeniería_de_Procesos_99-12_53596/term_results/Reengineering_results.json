But process redesign is not always successful and almost always accompanied by pain or at least unpleasant side effects. Many companies have undertaken reengineering efforts only to abandon them with little or no positive results. How can you increase the odds for success? Here are a few lessons from the front.</jats:p>",

Central to the success of reengineering is the coordination of information technology (IT) throughout the organization. Essentially, IT represents the core mechanism of information flow. When companies improve core IT processes, such as gathering data only once, integrating cross‐functional systems or increasing information speed to customers, radical business process change is possible. However, for IT to be an enabler of reengineering or organizational change, it is imperative that managers are conversant with the various methods by which IT can help advance process change. At the same time, management needs to be aware of the numerous pitfalls that may doom any change effort using IT.</jats:p>",

The objective of construction process reengineering is to progressively develop an integrated project delivery process focusing on optimising process predictability and enhancing the value of the final product. This philosophy requires a holistic approach to reengineering, integrating the concepts of concurrent engineering, lean production and process redesign into the construction process. The objective of this paper provides an overview of construction process reengineering (CPR) through the examination of its origin, definition, concepts and application. A hospital project was used as a pilot case study to examine the application of the CPR concepts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Examines the relationship between business process re‐engineering (BPR) and human resource management. A number of propositions relating to aspects of human resource management are derived from the literature, and examined by interviewing senior managers in UK organisations where business process re‐engineering projects had either been completed or were still in progress. The propositions are analysed under four major headings: structure and culture, the role of managers, team working, and reward system. The conclusion is that BPR principles on the management of human resources as stated in the literature seem to find a full application in most of the organisations investigated. However, there were two exceptions to the expectations in the literature. The first was that there would be a change to a process‐based structure; a change is seen in the majority of cases, but to a matrix style of organisation. The second was the implication that team‐based reward systems would appear; this has only happened in a minority of cases. Overall, for the organisations studied which have undergone BPR, a very clear pattern emerges with respect to human resource management practices.</jats:p>",

Others contend that the appraisal is too hard to implement. This article shows, however, that there are important reasons for retaining the appraisal as a key instrument in managing employee performance. Rather than dismantling their performance assessment systems, most organizations would do well to revamp them to ensure accuracy and fairness. © 1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work employs a phenomenological approach to investigate how people experience the radical transformation of their work lives caused by reengineering (BPR) processes. The common essences of the experiences of three co‐researchers are synthesized into a composite textural‐structural description of the reengineering phenomenon. The analysis of the rich, multidimensional information offered by participants reveals that reengineering projects elicit complex experiences involving a multitude of horizons. In particular, the analysis suggests that, by taking the discourse of efficiency to extremes, reeengineering ends up by unveiling the conflicts inherent in the arrangements that generally characterize workplace. This proposition goes beyond the traditional belief that the basic reason for resistance in BPR projects is the fear of layoffs or the modification of power arrangements. Indeed, such factors seem to be part of the problem. It is also necessary to understand the important role of the crisis that reeengineering may generate in individuals’ ongoing process of sense making.</jats:p>",
