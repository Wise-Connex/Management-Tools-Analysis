An important feature is that the proposed specifications and architecture are based on the experience gained in an e-learning company and result from a reengineering process. To guide the reengineering process, we used two reference models, which are the e-learning global process and the e-learning global cycle. The functional specifications are described according to the e-learning global cycle phases and they are used to propose a software component based architecture. The proposed kernel of components was completed with services to allow interoperability and standard compliance between several e-learning platforms. We hope that this case-study exemplifies e-learning platform suppliers’ needs and available pragmatic solutions. We conclude on foreseeable evolutions of e-learning actors needs and practices and on new platform features for fulfilling such needs.</jats:p>"

A shortage of IT personnel combined with intense demand for new technology skills has made recruiting and retaining staff harried pursuits; additionally, the demand for technical workers in corporate America keeps rising (Pawlowski, Datta, &amp; Houston, 2005). This demand for workers with leading-edge IT skills is exacerbated by the looming retirement of seasoned government workers, estimated at a 30% reduction in public-sector workforce across state governments by 2006 (Council of State Government [CSG], 2002). Despite the mounting demands on IT to be leveraged in state governments as a cost-reducing and efficiency-increasing tool (Levinson, 2003), even with economic recovery (Information Technology Association of America [ITAA], 2004) many scholars and industry analysts fear a widening shortage in available IT professionals (Pawlowski et al.).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The automotive industry is facing economic and technical challenges. The economic situation calls for more efficient processes, not only production processes but also renewals in the development process. Accelerating design work and simultaneously securing safe process outcome leads to products in good correspondence with market demands and institutional goals on safe traffic environments. The technique challenge is going from almost pure mechanical constructions to mechatronic systems, where computer-based solutions may affect core vehicle functionality. Since subcontractors often develop this new technology, system integration is increasingly important for the car manufacturers. To meet these challenges we suggest the simulator-based design approach. This chapter focuses on human-in-the- loop simulation, which ought to be used for design and integration of all car functionality affecting the driver. This approach has been proved successful by the aerospace industry, which in the late 1960s recognized a corresponding technology shift.</jats:p>"

There are two distinct methods of reengineering, technology-enabled and clean-slate, with most global companies choosing somewhere in between. There are also a number of principles any reengineering project team should understand before embarking on a reengineering effort, and these are discussed from a global perspective. The chapter concludes with how to select processes to reengineer, lessons learned from global reengineering, benefits of global reengineering, and future implications.</jats:p>"

Thus finding satisfying methods to measure the profitability of mobile applications seems to be of great importance. Prior research had its focus mainly on general value dimensions concerning the medical sector or the usability and design aspects of hospital information systems. Conterminous to that, the authors chose a strictly process oriented approach. They modelled the requirements of future mobile system as an output of a profitability analysis based on activity based costing. The cost savings defined as the difference between former and future business processes were used as an incoming payment for a ROI analysis. In a nutshell, the authors present a case study that highlights the value of their analyzing method as well as the enormous benefit of mobile applications in the area of food- and medical supply processes in German hospitals.</jats:p>"
