A case is presented here, of the implementation of a “maintenance reengineering framework”, developed with the aid of certain maintenance components.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The maintenance reengineering framework, when implemented, proved successful with a more than 90 per cent rise in production rate.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The paper contributes some guidelines which can be helpful in making decision about the selection of maintenance policy and for the achievement of world‐class effectiveness.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Maintenance reengineering (MR) framework includes the core concepts of preventive maintenance practices, total maintenance management and system perspectives of maintenance. Its implementation goes through three phases from identification of key performance area, via suitable maintenance policy selection to generating the capability for world‐class effectiveness. The experience of this pilot implementation in a cement company in India suggested the feasibility of this framework in elevating the performance of maintenance management.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This article offers a framework that addresses research on maintenance reengineering. It attempts to establish a relationship among the components of maintenance, which can bring potential benefits to the corporations of similar operations and nature.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
