Comprehensive research integrating BPR tools is needed to understand their benefits for manufacturing firms. This research presents an integrated BPR-simulation framework tailored to the manufacturing sector to maximize process improvements and operational excellence.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The BPR design methodology adopts a systematic, multi-stage approach. The first phase involves identifying a specific improvement process aligned with BPR's core objectives. This phase analyses and redesigns workflows to optimize task sequences, roles, and stakeholder interactions while eliminating redundancies and inefficiencies via Workflow Process Reengineering. Visual process mapping tools, including VSM and simulation, pinpoint areas of waste, delay, and potential enhancement. The second phase follows the workflow analysis and aims to improve efficiency and effectiveness by redefining roles, rearranging tasks, and integrating automation and technology solutions. The redesigned process undergoes evaluation against key performance indicators to ensure measurable improvements are achieved. The final phase validates the proposed changes through simulation models, assesses the impact on key performance metrics, and establishes the necessary infrastructure for successful implementation. The proposed model is empirically validated through a case study of a leading apparel company in Vietnam, confirming its effectiveness.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings reveal that NVA activities are being eliminated, and ENVA activities in key departments are significantly reduced. This yielded a substantial improvement, reducing 25 out of 186 combined ENVA and NVA operations in the sewing facility, involving a decrease of 15 ENVA operations and the removal of 10 NVA operations. Consequently, this led to an 8.5% reduction in the proportion of ENVA operations, accompanied by a complete 100% elimination of NVA activities.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The single case study limits generalizability; thus, expanded implementation across diverse manufacturing sub-sectors is required to establish validity and broader applicability of the integrated framework.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The experimental results highlight the proposed model's effectiveness in optimizing resource utilization and its practical implementation potential.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dynamics of the labor market have changed considerably and are currently experiencing a major shift. The skill levels that used to be enough in the workplace have become inadequate for the current workplace requirements. At least in the case of the United States, the kind of jobs that allowed work from home during the pandemic typically required college education; this may be a silver lining for colleges. Coupled with this, the admission test optional policies opened the doors of colleges for many otherwise disadvantaged students. The life cycle duration of technical skills has become shorter than ever before. Issues in innovation, demographic shifts, socio-cultural issues, aging population and technological advances are driving educators, employers, and policy makers to re-examine higher education to address the skill gaps currently existing in the workplace. This paper brainstorms some of these topics and propose solutions for policy makers.</jats:p>"

The study examines the economic impact of the pandemic on companies, emphasizing the need to rethink the business or redesign it to ensure its response to the challenges that the quarantine represented, as proposed by reengineering in the second half of the 90s of the 20th century. The main objective of this article is to establish a connection between the principles of reengineering and the resilience of startups during the pandemic, reactivating the use of a tool that was used more than 20 years ago. Therefore, the study explores, from a qualitative methodology —with emphasis on documentary research— the relationship between the appearance of the pandemic and the use of some elements of reengineering that can be observed in emerging companies, finding several connections between them. The results highlight how, through reinvention and resurgence, emerging businesses met the challenges of the new normal by maintaining their operations and providing business continuity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study introduces an integrated method for managing process risks in a business process reengineering (BPR) project using robust data envelopment analysis (RDEA) and machine learning (ML). The goal is to prioritize risks based on three standard factors of PFMEA (severity, occurrence and detection (S-O-D)) and incorporating two additional factors (breakdown cost and breakdown duration) seen as undesirable outputs. The model also accounts for the effect of uncertainty on expert-estimated values by applying disturbance percentages in the linear PFMEA-RDEA model. A machine-learning model is proposed to predict new values if partial or total modifications have been made to the processes. The approach was implemented in an automotive sector company, and the results showed the impact of uncertainty on values by comparing different approaches, such as RPN, PFMEA-DEA and PFMEA-RDEA. A new reduced risk categorization was achieved, which allowed for decision makers to focus on the necessary actions for reengineering.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to analyze the effect of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and service quality with the use of technology on the performance of educational institutions at the National University, with stakeholder satisfaction as an intervening variable. The research methodology uses a quantitative approach with data collection through surveys to various stakeholders of the National University, including leaders, lecturers, education personnel, students, and parents, with a total sample of 200 people. The results showed that Business Process Reengineering (BPR) significantly improves educational institutions' performance, reflecting increased operational efficiency, reduced costs, and improved quality of educational services. In addition, the utilization of appropriate and integrated information technology in educational services also shows a significant influence on the performance of educational institutions, as seen in increased student and staff satisfaction and reduced operational time and costs. Implementing BPR also increases stakeholder satisfaction as more efficient processes and better services meet their expectations and needs. Similarly, service quality with effective utilization of information technology increases stakeholder satisfaction through faster service, easy access to information, and simpler administrative processes. This stakeholder satisfaction, in turn, affects the performance of educational institutions as satisfied stakeholders tend to provide more significant support, thus improving the institution's overall performance. Finally, stakeholder satisfaction mediates the relationship between BPR and service quality and technology utilization in educational institutions' performance, indicating that combining BPR and information technology significantly improves institutional performance through increased stakeholder satisfaction.</jats:p>"

The article reveals the theoretical aspects of business processes, providing a definition of the term “business process” and highlighting their main types. It also presents the definition of “business process reengineering” from the perspective of both foreign and domestic authors. An attempt is made to provide a new definition of “business process reengineering.” The main types of reengineering are described as well. Special attention is given to the main directions that enterprises can utilize for reengineering business processes under the conditions of import substitution of dual-use goods and technologies. The primary stages of the business process reengineering under these conditions are also highlighted. Possible methods (mechanisms) for business process reengineering are disclosed. The article also provides a specific example of the reengineering of the technical maintenance and repair department’s business process in the event of equipment failure under sanctions conditions. As an illustration, two BPMN models are presented: AS-IS, reflecting the current process, and TO-BE, demonstrating the process after reengineering under import substitution conditions. These models serve as a clear representation of the changes that enterprises will need to make to adapt to the new conditions. At the end of the article, a number of problematic issues that may arise for Russian enterprises when conducting reengineering under the current conditions are listed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Long outpatient waiting times pose a significant global challenge in healthcare, impacting children and families with implications for health outcomes. This paper presents the eHealth system called eADVICE (electronic Advice and Diagnosis Via the Internet following Computerised Evaluation) that is designed to address waiting list challenges for paediatricians. Initially designed for children’s incontinence, the system’s success in terms of health goals and user experience led to its adaptation for paediatric sleep problems. This paper focuses on user experiences and the development of a working alliance with the virtual doctor, alongside health outcomes based on a randomised controlled trial (N = 239) for incontinence. When reengineering eADVICE to sleep disorders, the promising results regarding the reciprocal relationship between user experience and building a working alliance encouraged a focus on the further development of the embodied conversational agent (ECA) component. This involved tailoring the ECA discussion to patient cognition (i.e., beliefs and goals) to further improve engagement and outcomes. The proposed eADVICE framework facilitates adaptation across paediatric conditions, offering a scalable model to enhance access and self-efficacy during care delays.</jats:p>"
