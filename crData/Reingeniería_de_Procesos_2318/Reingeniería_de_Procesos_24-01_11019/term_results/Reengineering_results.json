      "abstract": "<jats:p>Setiap Instansi yang menyediakan sebuah pelayanan kepada masyarakat menginginkan sebuah layanan yang berkualitas. Meningkatkan sebuah kualitas pada pelayanan perlu memahami kekurangan selama ini. Kejaksaan Negeri Batu adalah sebuah instansi di Provinsi Jawa Timur yang pelayanan masih berjalan secara manual. Hal ini menimbulkan permasalahan dari segi pelayanan, kecepatan dan biaya kepada masyarakat. Berdasarkan masalah ini perlu dilakukan perubahan proses bisnis pada Kejaksasaan Negeri Batu dengan penerapan BPR (Business Process Reengineering). Business Process Reengineering adalah konsep untuk mengubah ulang proses bisnis yang memiliki kelemahan pada proses. Tujuanya untuk memperbaiki sebuah kinerja proses agar lebih efisien. Penelitian dimulai dengan mengumpulkan beberapa referensi yang berkaitan dengan Business Process Reengineering. Metode pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan cara observasi ke studi kasus, wawancara dengan pihak Kejaksaan Negeri Batu dan studi literatur sejenis. Memahami suatu proses bisnis digunakan peta proses standar ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). Berdasarkan peta proses standar ASME dapat dihitung kinerja proses bisnis dengan menghitung efisiensi throughput. Langkah peningkatan dan penyempurnaan desain ulang proses dilakukan agar proses bisnis lebih efektif. Hasil akhir penelitian adalah sebuah rancangan ulang model bisnis proses rekomendasi yang meningkatkan efisiensi throughput dari 50,36% pada proses sebelumnya menjadi 85,77% dan menghasilkan sebuah aplikasi sebagai pendukung rancangan ulang model bisnis proses rekomendasi. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Semakin berkembangnya dunia bisnis dan semakin kompleksnya transaksi serta semakin luasnya jangkauan usaha sebuah perusahaan, maka kebutuhan perusahaan untuk mengoptimalkan setiap proses bisnis harus lebih efektif dan efisien di areanya [6]. Maka dari itu perubahan proses bisnis terkadang perlu dilakukan untuk mengganti sistem yang lama dengan sistem yang baru. Perubahan proses bisnis yang signifikan ini disebut Business Process Reenginering. Konsep BPR (Business Process Reengineering) sendiri adalah merupakan sebuah konsep rekontruksi ulang dengan melakukan tindakan secara dramatis dan radikal sehingga dapat menghasilkan perbaikan proses, penghematan biaya, serta peningkatan kecepatan [1]. Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM) Kabupaten Mojokerto merupakan salah satu perusahaan yang bekerja dibidang jasa penyedia air untuk kebutuhan sehari-hari. Struktur organisasi secara umum terdiri dari Pimpinan/Direktur, Bagian Hubungan Langganan dan Pemasaran, Bagian Perencanaan, Bagian Produksi dan Distribusi, Bagian Umum dan Kepegawaian, dan Bagian Akuntansi dan Keuangan. Masalah yang terjadi adalah terlalu banyak proses yang tidak optimal, waktu yang terlalu lama untuk penanganan konsumen, pencatatan yang masih manual, dan terlalu banyak mengeluarkan biaya untuk sebagian proses. Berdasarkan masalah diatas, Bisnis proses PDAM Kab. Mojokerto yang perlu dirubah atau direengineering adalah proses bisnis pemasangan baru. Dengan Business Process Reenginering mampu merubah proses yang lama ke proses yang baru yaitu pada tahapan rekomendasi sehingga mendapatkan proses yang lebih efisien dalam hal pelayanan waktu. </jats:p>"

This paper focuses on the realization of enterprise management process reengineering within the innovation ecosystem. The study starts with the construction of an embedded innovation ecosystem model, and it is then analyzed for threshold effects. The hexadecimal structure of fuzzy Petri nets is used to establish a diagnostic model of enterprise management processes, and problems in enterprise management processes are supervised through fault tree analysis so as to improve and optimize the management processes and process reengineering of the enterprise. The research on enterprise management process reengineering in this paper employs F-cluster analysis and fuzzy C-mean cluster analysis to fully demonstrate the relationship between the activities of every management process in the enterprise. Through the study, it is concluded that the open innovation and shared cognitive capital variables designed in this paper in constructing the embedded innovation ecosystem model have successfully passed the reliability and validity test and play an important role in enterprise innovation. In the case study of enterprise management process reengineering, the management process of enterprise A that implemented process reengineering realized intelligent transformation. The resulting total share of production cost of enterprise A decreased to 91.2%, and the overall cost of energy saving was about 10% or so.</jats:p>",

The study is dedicated to some important concepts for both the reengineering of busi­ness processes and the fundamental changes in the digital transformation of enterprises. In its nature, business process reengineering represents the creation of fundamentally new processes that dramatically increase the efficiency of an enterprise. It is based on the general methodology of pro­cess management and has similar features to some of the methods of pro­cess improvement and quality improvement. But unlike improvement, re­engineering implies a radical change of processes, not their gradual im­provement. The main goal of the research is to propose a universal meth­odology for the effective reengineering of business processes, based on world experience and good practices, applicable in Bulgarian business or­ganizations. It provides a basic framework for future more detailed and extensive research in the field of modeling, measurement, management and reengineering of business processes in the organization and analysis of the practical results achieved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The activity of every enterprise is constantly accompanied by challenges and threats from both the internal and external environment of its functioning. That is why effectively established processes are often a guarantee of its success and sustainability. The reengineering of business processes itself is the tool that allows you to significantly improve your work, due to a radical reassessment and transformation of the main business processes. This tool aims to achieve improvements in key indicators such as costs, quality, service and speed. The article establishes the relevance of transformations in business processes using reengineering. A retrospective of the evolution of approaches to reengineering was conducted. The experience of using it to improve the performance of the business giant Ford is presented. It has been determined what advantages enterprises receive from the reengineering of business processes. The main stages of reengineering are grouped: mapping the current state of business processes, analyzing them and identifying gaps, finding opportunities to improve business processes and their verification, developing a process map of the future state and implementing future changes. It was determined that these stages may vary depending on the specifics of the enterprise's activities. The principles of effective reengineering are presented, according to Hammer M. and Champy J. Modern business process reengineering tools are specified: IT, change management, value chains, benchmarking, model change, monitoring, active accounting, GAP analysis, Lean and Six Sigma, Business Process Management, design thinking and modeling and stimulation. Systematized recommendations for increasing the efficiency of the reorganization process, in particular, using only proven methodology, documenting the reasons for introducing changes, analyzing business needs, taking any actions taking into account the priority of customers, as well as effective change management. Further prospects of research in the chosen direction are outlined, taking into account the achievements of artificial intelligence.</jats:p>"

Through \na retrospective analysis, the study traces the theoretical evolution of BPR \nfrom its initial conceptualization by Hammer and Champy in the 1990s to its current applications, showing its paradigmatic shift from incremental \nimprovement methodologies toward radical organizational restructuring.\nThe methodology highlights the empirical value of integrating \nquantitative methods (statistical analysis, simulation modelling) with \nqualitative approaches (structured interviews, focus groups) in BPR \nimplementation. The research presents a systematic analysis of BPR \nmethodologies applicable in the Ukrainian business context: process \nanalysis and modelling, value chain analysis, activity-based costing (ABC), \n5S methodology, Six Sigma, total quality management (TQM), rapid \napplication development (RAD) and Lean approach. Each methodology is \ncritically evaluated on the basis of its objectives and implementation tools.\nThe study identifies significant barriers to the implementation of BPR \nin Ukrainian companies, including resource constraints, technical barriers, \norganizational resistance and insufficient theoretical understanding. \nParticular emphasis is placed on the emerging importance of \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) paradigms in business \nreengineering, highlighting the imperative for Ukrainian companies to align \ntheir transformation initiatives with sustainable development principles.\nThe research concludes that while BPR is not new in economic theory, \nit remains the most viable tool for organizational adaptation to contemporary \nchallenges. The findings emphasize that effective implementation of BPR \nrequires a paradigm shift from incremental to revolutionary operational \nrestructuring, underpinned by systematic analysis and comprehensive \nreallocation of resources, while adhering to sustainable development \nprinciples.</jats:p>"
