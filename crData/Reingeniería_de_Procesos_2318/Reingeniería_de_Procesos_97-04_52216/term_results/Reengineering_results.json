While BPR has received considerable attention from practitioners and consultants, there has been little empirical research published on BPR. This study explores why and how organizations are using business process re‐engineering and identifies problems that effect re‐engineering success.The results showed that organizations generally considered themselves successful at re‐engineering.  However,while they achieved significant improvement in process operation, they were not achieving the order of magnitude improvements ascribed to re‐engineering.</jats:p>",
