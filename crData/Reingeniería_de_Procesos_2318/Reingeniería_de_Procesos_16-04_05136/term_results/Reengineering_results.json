Mitarbeiter führen Prozesse strategisch mit intelligenten IT-Systemen, anstatt wie bisher operativ tätig zu sein. Mit Predictive Analytics-Methoden vorausschauend Planen und Optimieren im Unternehmensprozess vermeidet Engpässe und Störsituationen im Unternehmen und in der Produktion. Die Führungskultur wandelt sich zur freiheitlichen Selbstbestimmung der Mitarbeiter mit mehr Eigenverantwortung.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Web-based technologies allow teachers to introduce new kinds of learning content and new tools, to diversify the educational options and increase the flexibility. This blending leads to a change in the learning process itself, which makes a major difference from the students' and the teachers' perspectives. Apart from the traditional guidelines, one currently uses web-based tools for generating wiki pages, lessons and reports, for presenting application domain concepts, integrating acquired data and executing queries on various results shared by colleagues. We analysed the practical work of engineering students and discovered that the learning process is reengineered if one adopts new technologies for managing educational materials and experiment results. Model-driven and semantic-based tools are also expected to introduce adaptation of teaching to individual requirements and styles. This paper presents the learning scenarios involved by two kinds of tools based on web technologies, dedicated to the management of laboratory guidelines and of practical work results. A part of the study was based on an integrated environment developed in-house, for offering computer support to educational experiments based on measuring instruments, including various devices, sensor networks and complex equipment; one presents its architectural modules driven by object-oriented models, and scenarios associated to its use cases. Furthermore, we also analysed the changes introduced by a new semantic wiki that presents concepts of nuclear hazard management, conceived not only for students' education, but also for public awareness. The Business Process Modeling Language was used to represent the traditional and the reengineered learning scenarios, and to make a comparison between them.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The spending in healthcare is constantly increasing according to available data, and the resource consumption does not actually reflect expected improvement in the healthcare services. As a result there is urgent need for healthcare to reengineer their business process in order to achieve improvements in critical area such as cost and quality. To address this issue, this study proposed a method based on design science approach by integrating knowledge map, enterprise ontology and lean in order to find the non-value added transactions and subsequently reengineer them to enhance healthcare efficiency. Enterprise ontology provides a details and better understanding of dynamic nature of an organization as such was chosen for as basis for this study. The method was demonstrated in radiology department making it possible to find and addresses non-value added transactions and subsequently reengineer the department. Evaluation was carried out by means of descriptive method using Moody and Shank framework and interview with healthcare practitioners. The finding shows that the method has enhanced healthcare efficiency by eliminating non-value added transactions.</p>",
