Instead of crisp probability degrees or interval probability degrees, fuzzy sets are applied to represent imprecise probability degrees in relational databases and XML. A probabilistic XML model with fuzzy probability measures is introduced, which incorporates fuzzy probability measures to handle imprecision and uncertainty. In particular, the formal approach to reengineering the relational database model with fuzzy probability measures into the DTD (document type definition) model with fuzzy probability measures is developed in the paper.</jats:p>",
