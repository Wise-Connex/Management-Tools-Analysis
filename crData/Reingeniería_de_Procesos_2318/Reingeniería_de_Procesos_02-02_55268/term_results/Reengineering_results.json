      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this article is to conduct an exploratory study into how SMEs apply Reengineering. In particular, the approach of SMEs to Reengineering definition and methodology are examined. Reengineering has developed from a background in large enterprises. Existing methodologies mainly assume a large organization setting with large-scale resources dedicated to bringing about the large-scale reengineering changes. The paucity of studies in SMEs is surprising given the current and anticipated future market challenges in the SME environment that increase pressure for organizational realignment and responsiveness and market agility. The research involved a literature review and an exploratory multiple case study analysis. In total eight case studies on SMEs, where reengineering had been applied, were analysed using an inductive research methodology, which analysed positivistic reengineering approaches and less structured, more phenomenologically based approaches, which emerged within the case analysis. The analysis indicates that the taxonomy and nomenclature of reengineering, as defined by large organization-based studies, has not translated into SMEs, who use much more general terminology. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Modernizing heavily evolved and poorly documented information systems is a central software engineering problem in our current IT industry. It is often necessary to reverse engineer the design documentation of such legacy systems. Several interactive CASE tools have been developed to support this human-intensive process. However, practical experience indicates that their applicability is limited because they do not adequately handle imperfect knowledge about legacy systems. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of several major theories of imperfect knowledge management in the area of soft computing and approximate reasoning. The theories are evaluated with respect to how well they meet requirements for generating effective human-centred reverse engineering environments. The requirements were elicited with help from practical case studies in the area of database reverse engineering. A particular theory called \"possibilistic logic\" was found to best meet these requirements most comprehensively. This evaluation highlights important challenges to the designers of knowledge management techniques, and should help reverse engineering tool implementers select appropriate technologies. </jats:p>",
