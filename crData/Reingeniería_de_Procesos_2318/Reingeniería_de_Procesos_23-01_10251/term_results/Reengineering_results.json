      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the deepening of economic globalization, the global market has gradually changed from the situation dominated by sellers to the era dominated by buyers. This change makes the competitive environment in which enterprises are in become increasingly complex and the market competition becomes increasingly fierce. Due to the change of market environment, the field of management theory is also quietly changing, such as learning organization, virtual management, flexible organization and other new management models. Learning organizations strive to adapt to the changing market environment by constantly updating and improving their own skills; With the help of information technology, virtual management transfers part of the management functions inside the enterprise to the virtual space, realizes the cross-region, cross-time and space management, and improves the management efficiency. Flexible organization emphasizes that enterprises should be as adaptive as organisms, and constantly adjust their organizational structure with changes in the external environment to better adapt to market competition. These new management models provide new ideas and methods for enterprises to win the opportunity in the fierce market competition. In the early 1990s, the business process reengineering (BPR) theory proposed by American management scientists Michael Hammer and James Champy set off a process revolution in the world. The BPR project is a large and comprehensive issue. It involves the process setting and organizational structure of the enterprise, and is also linked to human resource management, IT system application and other links. It is a systematic project. This paper analyzes the background and significance of BPR appearing in the modern economic environment. The concept of BPR is introduced, and the three key principles of BPR (target process, customer research, and technical conditions) are analyzed. By studying the development process of enterprise BPR, the article discusses the BPR scheme of real estate enterprises according to the development status of China's real estate. The article is based on the \"6 stages\" (strategic conception stage, project initiation stage, analysis and diagnosis stage, process optimization design stage, process organization reengineering stage, and process evaluation and improvement stage) reengineering and optimization ideas. Starting from the business characteristics of the real estate market development department, cost management department, engineering management department, technical management department, and procurement management department, provide standardized and effective real estate enterprise business process management methods and practices to promote the successful implementation and operation of real estate projects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the ways to improve the efficiency of enterprises is the reengineering of processes. Reengineering is based on management theory and is actively used by foreign enterprises. Reengineering involves the adoption of process thinking and the use of advanced information technologies in combination with an attempt to carry out organizational transformations. Reengineering allows you to change the key elements of the company's activities, such as: the speed of customer service, the cost of production, the quality of finished products. Therefore, it is relevant for many large and medium-sized enterprises in various industries. The article discusses one of the approaches to optimizing enterprise processes – digital reengineering. It is proved that the reengineering strategy can be very effective for enterprises that face difficulties in managing processes and achieving goals. Digital reengineering can lead to a significant improvement in business processes, increase productivity and increase the competitiveness of the enterprise. The practice of reengineering at enterprises can be different and depends on the specific conditions and goals of the company. It is revealed that the organization of reengineering at the enterprise requires significant resources and efforts. However, with the right approach, reengineering can lead to a significant improvement in the productivity of the company.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Digital and technological transformations of the national economy and the investment and construction sector as its integral part determine the need for the qualitative transformation of technical solutions in respect of both managerial and technological processes, referred to as reengineering in the present-day theory and practice. In turn, not only the main production activity is subject to such transformations, but also supplementary activities, including logistic support. In this regard, there is a contradiction between the transformed research and technology fundamentals of construction processes and traditional forms, as well as practical implementation patterns. In the field of logistics, this problem can be solved by logistics centres that are closely related to production and engineering structures. The purpose of the study is to establish a scientific rationale for the logistics efficiency intensification and improvement using logistics centres amid digital and technological transformation of the construction industry. This mission determines the following research tasks: establishing the nature of changes in flow management patterns applied to material and technical resources in the construction industry; proposing new configurations of these flows using logistics centres, determine the their position in the overall corporate structure. It is for the first time that this problem is formulated this way, which indicates its originality. The study is focused on logistics processes and their reengineering. Logistics centres are chosen as the subject of the study. Its practical value is a combination of the reengineering theory and new corporate structures such as production, engineering and logistics centres focused on intensifying processes of construction and enhancing the quality of the output.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. The theory of logistics of regulatory impacts is used as the main methodological approach. Structural and functional analysis is used to confirm certain assumptions. Earlier research, as well as publications of local and foreign researchers, was used by the authors as the source data.&#x0D;\nResults. An organizational chart is proposed for the establishment and operation of a logistics centre in the construction industry; principal diagrams are developed for the flows of materials and resources; they are used to demonstrate interaction between a construction facility and a logistics centre.&#x0D;\nConclusions. A logistics centre is a promising tool for modernizing and intensifying the logistic support of construction processes; it unlocks a high potential for the economic efficiency and competitiveness, cuts hidden losses and is primarily determined by lower downtime and a smaller amount of in-house and external defective construction products.</jats:p>",

Onion buying and selling activities carried out in traditional markets are still conventional in this case, such as payment processing activities that still use cash, then in traditional markets the price of shallots is still not fixed, aka buyers can still haggle, so these two things are quite time-consuming and personnel in business process activities of shallot sales transactions. For this reason, here the author has the goal of doing business process reengineering to make the business process of buying and selling shallots in traditional markets more effective and efficient. By using the business process reengineering method, shallot transaction activities can be carried out using an e-commerce system, where the aim of this e-commerce system is to produce faster times for shallot transaction activities, process trimming, and reduce human resources in previous business process activities. as well as reducing costs. Thus, it is hoped that e-commerce can make the business process of buying and selling shallots between consumers and shallot traders more effective and efficient.</jats:p>"

The authors present the consequences of a violation of the integrated performance of work on the activities of the enterprise. The development of the engineering market has a positive impact on the performance of the firm and the introduction of new digital technologies. Attention is paid to companies in the oil and gas sector, which occupy a significant volume of the segment and have proven methods of project implementation, developed cooperation with leading organizations and access to financing. Limitations of liability and risks of intermediary distribution of work, focus on diversification of risks and the role of legislative initiatives in the field of research are indicated. The reformatting of the design and technological infrastructure directly depends on the use of digital technologies in business processes. Reengineering allows you to improve the ability to follow the strategic goals of the organization, increase the creation of added value and organizational efficiency, and solve the problems of low technological readiness of production entities. At the same time, business process engineering depends on the industry in which the company operates, the efficiency of operations and the cost of engineering software for modern modeling. Risk diversification of process engineering and reengineering is limited by capital costs, the nature of the business model, market conditions, ownership structure, and project performance evaluation. The article summarizes the impact of the digitalization of technological engineering and reengineering on improving productivity by reducing transaction costs, reducing project lead time, and improving the business model.</jats:p>"

The speed of registration of business transactions depends on how quickly the primary accounting documentation is processed by the employees of the accounting department of the enterprise. Traditional paper accounting documentation in operation creates certain difficulties for the enterprise associated with the costs of its delivery to the contractors of the enterprise and the need to store it for some time in accordance with current legislation. This causes the associated additional costs of the enterprise. One of the ways out of this situation, in our opinion, may be the reengineering of document management at an agricultural enterprise based on the use of an electronic document management system. Electronic document management makes it possible to make document management more transparent and significantly speed it up. The integration of an electronic document management system and an accounting program will improve the efficiency of accounting and management accounting at an agricultural enterprise.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In light of the challenges of simultaneously controlling public spending and improving the efficiency and quality of social services, the relevant public institutions are facing the need to restructure, reengineer and saturate with information technology. However, the current political and economic conditions require a more effective approach to non-profit organizations whose main goal is to provide social services. In the midst of the dual challenge of managing public expenditures while also improving the efficiency and quality of social services provided, public sector organizations worldwide are currently undergoing significant transformations. This restructuring, re-engineering, and integration of information technology were once primarily applied in the realm of commercial industry. In this context, the primary task is to introduce innovations, new methods, techniques, technologies, mechanisms, and tools to improve the processes of social services provision. This task involves solving many problems that arise as a result of lack of awareness of such innovations and ways to use such technologies and implement such changes, unwillingness of individuals to reduce bureaucracy in the relevant bodies and institutions, as well as rejection of changes and unwillingness to use their benefits. In this regard, it is extremely important to create an environment in which quality services, including social services, will be provided in the most accessible way possible. An increasing number of nations are adopting a strategy that includes, among other things, implementing customer orientation, distinguishing between political and operational decisions, and managing based on results. As a result, embracing a businessfocused approach leads to a significant shift in behavior, moving away from bureaucratic concerns in organizational governance towards market-oriented priorities centered around client satisfaction. This transition involves incorporating private sector knowledge, expertise, and management practices. It is the reengineering tool that will help solve these problems and eliminate them. The use of reengineering processes implies fundamental changes in the provision of social services.</jats:p>"

Following up in person with households that do not respond online, by phone, or by mail, which is known as nonresponse follow-up (NRFU), represents a major component of this effort. For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau equipped enumerators with paper maps and notebooks filled with questionnaires and required enumerators to go door to door and collect decennial census data. The enumerators met daily with their supervisors to return completed questionnaires and update payroll information. For the 2020 Census, an advanced analytics solution, utilizing machine learning and optimization techniques, drove a reengineering of the entire field operations process, leading to substantially reduced costs and improved productivity. These reengineering efforts included business processes and technology centered around the development of this solution, the MOJO Optimizer, and resulted in an 80% increase in the number of cases completed per hour (from 1.05 to 1.92) and a 27% decrease in the number of miles reimbursed per case (from 5.05 to 3.68) compared with the 2010 Census NRFU. Capitalizing on the massive innovations realized during decennial census operations, the Census Bureau intends to use this technology to revolutionize its over 90 active surveys. </jats:p>",

Reengineering is defined as a fundamental rethinking and restructuring of a business to improve important indicators such as cost, quality, service level, speed of work, finance, marketing, information system construction, etc. The formulated goal of reengineering, which is that all sides of the business work efficiently and the entire system of interactions is designed to achieve maximum effect. It should be noted that business process reengineering is the most fundamental and consists of four business process improvement methods. It is also often referred to as process innovation because its success depends largely on the innovation and creativity of the process improvement team. The main factors that can lead to the successful implementation of reengineering are identified, namely: management readiness for changes, understanding and faith in the final result, as well as a reasonable assessment of the risks associated with the implementation of the program. The digital transformation of business processes is considered, which can become an important step in increasing business efficiency and competitiveness. In particular, digital transformation can help an enterprise reduce costs, improve efficiency and product quality, establish interaction and cooperation between different departments and employees, and ensure competitiveness in the market. The content and optimization process of business process reengineering when applying digital transformation at the enterprise was formed, which involves not only the introduction of new technologies, but also the revision and optimization of outdated business processes.</jats:p>"
