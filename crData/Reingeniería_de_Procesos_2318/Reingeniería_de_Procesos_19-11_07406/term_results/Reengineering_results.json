      "abstract": "<jats:p>Implementation of process management in the forest supply chains has a great potential for organizational and managerial improvement, at least by resource saving. Nevertheless, techniques of process management have been scarcely used to improve the forest supply chains in many parts of the world. In this study, for both Romanian state and private forests, the processes of the timber supply chain – from the harvest site to the forest-based industry plant – are mapped and analyzed. The main objectives of this work were to identify process optimization potentials and to redesign processes in order to improve the performance of the Romanian timber supply chain. Results show that particularly inter-organizational processes offer great saving potentials, mainly due to the existing multi-level hierarchy and multi-level control obligations. Therefore, introducing a web-based platform to enhance a collaborative workflow can considerably decrease the time needed for providing harvest sites or logs to customers via auctions. Further process optimization can be reached by the empowerment of lower level hierarchies facilitating the reduction of hierarchy levels of involved state organizations.</jats:p>",

In general, the main risk faced by small- and medium-sized software developers (SMEs) is the inability to meet delivery times or to adjust to project requirements, whether through lack of follow-up on the critical activities of the development process or through an inadequate distribution of workloads among members of the project team.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The methodology used to carry out the reengineering of the software development process is Hammer and Champy, which consists of six stages: introduction to the current situation of the company and the need for change; identification of the business processes; selection of the business process to be redesigned; understanding of the process selected; proposal for reengineering the business process selected; and the results of the comparison between the current situation of the process and the proposed reengineering of the process through the use of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Based on the results, the paper shows the importance of the analysis and implementation of the reengineering in a software development company. It describes step-by-step how to apply the methodology of Hammer and Champy in a business process through simulated scenarios, using BPMN 2.0. By carrying out the implementation of the proposed reengineering, the company would therefore save 45.12 percent of costs, 41.17 percent of time, and a better distribution of resources, at the same time guaranteeing the satisfaction of its clients.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study addresses the current needs of small- and medium-sized software developers, providing a step-by-step guide to the implementation of a process reengineering methodology, performing an analysis and modeling of processes in BPMN 2.0 and providing results through a simulation of the critical process, with the aim to observe the flow of activities and the significant improvements that would be achieved by implementing the reengineering proposal. This simulation schema allows business owners to observe the potential of the changes and to verify the positive impact they would have on the company before beginning to make operational changes in the organization.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

To achieve this goal, a sample of departments’ heads and agents consisting of 61 individuals. A Reengineering questionnaire, prepared by the researcher was applied. The questionnaire has three dimensions which are: electronic jobs, financial resources management and professional development of departments’ heads. The researcher used the descriptive analytic approach. Conclusions of the study were as follow: The study population agreed on the availability of technological tools , the quality of services applying the performance incentives , simplifying work procedures, applying problem solving and decision making. The rate of agreement on these dimensions was (4.006)The study population agrees strongly on applying working with others and through them in Imam Mohamed Ibn Saud University. The rate of agreement on the dimensions (3072). The study sample moderately agrees that there are difficulties in applying Reengineering Management at the University of Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University. Their approval rates (3037).    </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A simulation of the level of re-engineering organization is presented on the example of a selected group of four enterprises. It is assumed that in the conditions of the experiment there is an occurrence of an event of effective re-engineering in the field of financial relations of enterprises forming a complete group of independent events - incompatible hypotheses of quantitative and qualitative measurement of the statistical likelihood of relevant indicators of experimental events in the organization of enterprise re-engineering. The probabilities of full group events were determined using an expert evaluation matrix by the principle of pairwise comparison of the importance of each event using a 5-point scale of intensity of significance of the items in the hypothesis group. The conditional probabilities of quantitative and qualitative measurement of the statistical probability of relevant indicators in the plane of action of the factors of influence on the organization of re-engineering of the enterprise are established. The formula of full probability presents the visualization of the dynamics of the level of organization of reengineering in financial relations of enterprises in the conditions of global digitization in four time intervals since 2012. by 2019. It has been proven that the reengineering process remains an effective tool for companies seeking to operate in a competitive world; companies are required to re-engineer their business processes to deliver breakthrough results and a long-term strategy for company development.</jats:p>"
