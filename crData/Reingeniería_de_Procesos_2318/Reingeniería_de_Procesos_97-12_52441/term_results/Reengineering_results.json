      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors deconstruct reengineering as an ideology inscribed in discourse of storytelling and metaphor used to justify the displacement of workers. The deconstruction unmasks reengineering as a false duality with bureaucracy, and in the end, just another reinvention of Adam Smith's division of labor. It is yet another chapter in the story of the displacement of labor by machines, especially computers, in the continuing industrial—now information—revolution. Reengineering's creator and principal salesperson, Michael Hammer, uses stories and metaphors of medicine, warfare, and revolution that script the fate of disposable workers. Disposable workers is restoried and sold as a way for American business to achieve profit, quality, and global competitiveness. The authors end by offering some postmodern alternatives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Home health care agencies face a clear challenge in a managed care environment: reduce costs and maintain and improve quality. Organizational efficiencies and customer satisfaction are the outcomes of the reengineered home care organization. The staff of UCSD Home Care recognized that for one agency to survive and thrive, major changes had to occur. The major phases of the staff-driven, staff-led reengineering effort were accomplished within 4 months. The implementation process that affected virtually ALL home care staff continues. One year following the reengineering project's initiation, the agency has achieved a significantly healthy bottom line, customer satisfaction is high, cost per unit of service is significantly reduced, and employee morale is better than ever. </jats:p>",
