      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article presents a study of merchandising as a business process. The main problems in micro-merchandising are revealed. The expediency of using artificial intelligence technologies in micro-merchandising to increase its economic efficiency is substantiated. An approach to the reengineering of micro-merchandising based on a comparison of a planogram and a realogram using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is proposed. The evolutionary stages of development of neurotechnologies are determined: from the formalization of the concept of a neural network and the representation of complex biological processes by mathematical models to the achievement of the level of human functionality in recognizing the surrounding world and predicting the future. The article analyzes foreign and domestic experience in the use of AI technologies in various areas of human life, as well as in marketing and merchandising in retail, and proposes an approach to improve the audit of the location of goods on the shelf, taking into account the replacement of intellectual human labor with artificial intelligence and the exclusion of human factors, checking the realogram and planogram using neurotechnologies. The use of artificial intelligence in reengineering is considered, an algorithm for auditing micro-merchandising as a business process is described, a problematic interview with grocery retail merchandisers is conducted, and the hypothesis about the possibility of automating a business process is confirmed. Software (Neisla application) was developed to automate the business process, its application was tested in a large regional retail chain of the Irkutsk region in Irkutsk. As a product category, \"chocolate bars\" are used. As a result of testing within one month, an increase in the economic efficiency of micro-merchandising as a business process was confirmed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Internal control practices through assurance activities such as audits, reviews, evaluations, and monitoring; and consulting activities such as providing input, facilitation, and training have not been integrated with each other, thus affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control.  Likewise, internal control reporting has not been integrated to external partners, which affects the quality of follow-up on the results of internal control activities. This study aims to initiate a model for implementing business process reengineering in integrating government internal control and finding a form of integrating internal control reporting to external partners to create certainty of follow-up on supervision results. The research method used is qualitative with a conceptual approach and case approach. The results showed that the business process reengineering model can be carried out by integrating assurance activities such as reviews, audits, evaluations, and monitoring with consulting activities such as providing advice, training, and agency facilitation into an integrated and connected system. The results also show the form of integrating agency performance reporting in integrated internal control in independent state institutions such as the Ombudsman and the State Civil Apparatus Commission, and an integrated internal control financial audit reporting system in independent state institutions such as the Corruption Eradication Commission and the Supreme Audit Agency. \nKeywords: Business Process Reengineering Model, Internal Reporting, Integration Control System</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent advances in machine learning techniques have led to development of a number of protein design and engineering approaches. One of them, ProteinMPNN, predicts an amino acid sequence that would fold and match user-defined backbone structure. In this short report, we test whether ProteinMPNN can be used to reengineer a flavin-binding fluorescent protein, CagFbFP. We fixed the native backbone conformation and the identity of 20 amino acids interacting with the chromophore (flavin mononucleotide, FMN), while letting ProteinMPNN predict the rest of the sequence. The software package suggested replacing 36-48 out of the remaining 86 amino acids. The three designs that we tested experimentally displayed different expression levels, yet all were able to bind FMN and displayed fluorescence, thermal stability and other properties similar to those of CagFbFP. Our results demonstrate that ProteinMPNN can be used to generate diverging unnatural variants of fluorescent proteins, and, more generally, to reengineer proteins without losing their ligand-binding capabilities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study provides a comprehensive approach to reengineering business processes in transport system enterprises, which can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cargo transportation services. The purpose of this article is to consider the structural elements of management that provide reengineering of business processes of transport system enterprises in freight transportation. A comprehensive approach to the assessment of structural elements of management was developed. They form the functional flows of business process reengineering by transport system enterprises using simulation modeling and determine scenarios of quality freight, according to indicators that characterize the parameters of their effectiveness. The mathematical basis for the construction of a simulation model of scenarios for the reengineering of business processes of enterprises based on structural elements of management is substantiated. The model of the formation of the system of functional flows of management in the reengineering of business processes of enterprises is presented. The method of calculating indicators of the dynamic state of functional flows during the reengineering of business processes as structural elements of enterprise management are determined. The volume of rendering of cargo transportation services by the enterprises of the transport system of Ukraine is analyzed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined reengineering supervisory practices for effective goal attainment in public senior secondary schools in Rivers State. The study was guided by three research questions. The research design employed in this study was a descriptive research design. The population of the study comprised all supervisors in the ministry of education and the Rivers State senior secondary school board. The total population of supervisors in the Ministry of Education is one hundred and ninety-one (191), and supervisors in the Rivers State Senior Secondary Schools Board are one hundred and thirty-one (131). Hence, the population for this study is three hundred and twenty-two (322). The sample of the study is composed of three hundred and twenty-two (322) supervisors in the Rivers State Ministry of Education and the Rivers Senior Secondary Schools Board. The census sampling technique was adopted. This technique is considered most appropriate because the population of the study is quite small and can be managed. However, out of 322 copies of the instrument distributed, 280 were correctly filled and returned, which represented an 87% return rate of the instrument distributed and used for data analysis. The instrument that was used for data collection was a self-constructed questionnaire titled Reengineering Supervisory Practices for Effective Goal Attainment Questionnaire (RSPEGAQ). Reliability for the study was determined using the Cronbach alpha coefficient statistics. The reliable index yielded a result of 0.892, which showed that the instrument was reliable and was adopted for the study. Mean and Standard Deviation Statistics were used to answer the research questions. Through the implementation of supportive supervision models that foster a culture of self-reflection, public schools can witness notable enhancements in the achievement of objectives, professional development, collaboration, accountability, and instructional leadership. The study recommends, among other things, that a systematic approach be implemented, involving administrators, teachers, and other relevant stakeholders, in order to establish goals. This approach should prioritise open communication and shared decision-making to ensure that these goals are in line with the school's vision and long-term objectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Financial sector is one of the fundamental dimensions of economic expansion and evolution. Financial institutions remain indispensable because of the role they play. In Africa, however, commercial banks have been reducing in number owing to tightening regulations, mergers, acquisitions, liquidations and collapses. On the same vein, Kenyan banking sector has recently encountered diverse experiences from new threats such as increasing inflationary pressure, worries about the sustainability of the public debt, a shaky economic recovery, and volatility in financial markets and devastating impact of COVID-19. Collectively, these make it difficult for the local banks to achieve optimum financial returns. The study aimed to determine how business process reengineering (BPR) affects performance of commercial banks in Meru County, Kenya. The objective was to determine effects of BPR on performance of commercial banks in Meru County. The study moored on Technology Adoption model. It employed descriptive research survey design with a target population of sixty (60) branch management staff comprising of three participants from each of the 20 commercial banks in Meru County. Additionally, the study adopted census approach and structured questionnaires to collect data. Descriptive statistics; mean and standard deviation coupled with linear regression were used to analyze data. Data was presented in tables. It was concluded that BPR enhanced financial performance of commercial banks. Further, the study recommended that commercial banks strengthen BPR to improve business operations. The study established that BPR, if effectively implemented, was a game changer to commercial banks, since it may reduce process time, simplify and streamline operations, and revamp   service quality, thus   increased efficiency that results into better services and products.   This maximizes return on investment. Studies may be conducted to ascertain benefits and challenges of adopting BPR in commercial banks in Kenya.</jats:p>"

However, maintaining the building and its various equipment and assets can take time and effort. This study aims to optimize building maintenance by implementing Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and using an Excel-based application system to detect points of damage. The study analyzes the maintenance process's cost, duration, and damage reports using dashboard features such as Gantt chart diagrams. By comparing the Excel-based application system with the conventional system, we found that the former is more effective and efficient. The results show that the application system saves 12 hours of recapitulation time per week, increases labor productivity by 32.2%, and speeds up damage reparation by 5%.</jats:p>"

However, several factors (extensive oxidation of electrolytes, growth of thick cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), irreversible capacity loss, low coulombic efficiency) related to high energy density materials inhibit their practical application. Herein, we report the formation of the conformal LiF interfaces on NMC811/LNMO cathodes via novel electrochemical fluorination. An electrochemically induced LiF layer stabilized the interfaces and reduces the leakage of the electrons allowing lithium-ion conduction. Because of such robust CEI composed of LiF, electrochemically fluorinated cathodes demonstrated significantly improved cycling stability and enhanced capacity.    </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In-house logistics is primarily about coordinating activities; quality planning; management, implementation, control of external and internal material flow, and synchronization of information and processes. Each process is closely related to the operator, who ensures optimal conditions for its operation. Implementing software and hardware for the telephone exchange and supporting corporate information management significantly increased customer satisfaction with the solution to their specific requirements. The impact of information technology, monitoring, data collection and processing in the company aims to make these processes more intelligent, emphasising obtaining certain strategic information important for further decision-making. A powerful and reliable communication platform is used in various industries, which is presented in the submitted manuscript. The advantage of a suitably chosen communication platform is that it offers a range of functions like traditional telephones combined with intelligent solutions for uniform communication. By applying service processes through implementing a software and hardware telephone exchange in the company, we focus on adapting solutions for each customer according to requirements. In the future, the research will focus on the digitization of the company and the use of smart technologies in the prediction of service processes in the company.</jats:p>",
