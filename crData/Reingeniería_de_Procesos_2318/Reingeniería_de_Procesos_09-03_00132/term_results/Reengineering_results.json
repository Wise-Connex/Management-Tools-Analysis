      "abstract": "<jats:p> Large cargoes require multiple receptors for efficient transport through the nuclear pore complex. The 60S ribosomal subunit is one of the bulkiest transport cargoes, and in yeast three different receptors, Crm1, Mex67/Mtr2, and Arx1, collaborate in its export. However, only Crm1, recruited by the adapter Nmd3, appears to be conserved for 60S export in higher eukaryotes. We asked if export of the large subunit requires specific receptors. We made protein fusions between mutant Nmd3 and various export receptors. Surprisingly, fusions of Mex67, the tRNA exportin Los1, Mtr2, Cse1, or Msn5 to Nmd3, lacking its Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES), all functioned in export. Furthermore, these chimeric proteins supported 60S export even in the presence of the Crm1 inhibitor leptomycin B, indicating that export was now independent of Crm1. These results suggest that there is not a requirement for a specific export receptor for the large subunit, as recruitment of any receptor will suffice. Finally we show that the addition of an NES directly to the 60S ribosomal subunit protein Rpl3 promotes export. These results imply remarkable flexibility in the export pathway for the 60S subunit and help explain how different export receptors could have evolved in different eukaryotic lineages. </jats:p>",

Sequence analysis of their\n            <jats:italic>arg</jats:italic>\n            operons identified three point mutations (\n            <jats:italic>argR123, argG92</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>up</jats:sup>\n            , and\n            <jats:italic>argG45</jats:italic>\n            ) in one producer and one point mutation (\n            <jats:italic>argB26</jats:italic>\n            or\n            <jats:italic>argB31</jats:italic>\n            ) in each of the other two producers. Reconstitution of the former three mutations or of each\n            <jats:italic>argB</jats:italic>\n            mutation on a wild-type genome led to no production. Combined introduction of\n            <jats:italic>argB26</jats:italic>\n            or\n            <jats:italic>argB31</jats:italic>\n            with\n            <jats:italic>argR123</jats:italic>\n            into a wild type gave rise to arginine/citrulline production. When\n            <jats:italic>argR123</jats:italic>\n            was replaced by an\n            <jats:italic>argR</jats:italic>\n            -deleted mutation (Δ\n            <jats:italic>argR</jats:italic>\n            ), the production was further increased. The best mutation set, Δ\n            <jats:italic>argR</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>argB26</jats:italic>\n            , was used to screen for the highest productivity in the backgrounds of different wild-type strains of\n            <jats:italic>C. glutamicum</jats:italic>\n            . This yielded a robust producer, RB, but the production was still one-third of that of the best classical producer. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the\n            <jats:italic>arg</jats:italic>\n            operon of the classical producer was much more highly upregulated than that of strain RB. Introduction of\n            <jats:italic>leuC456</jats:italic>\n            , a mutation derived from a classical\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -lysine producer and provoking global induction of the amino acid biosynthesis genes, including the\n            <jats:italic>arg</jats:italic>\n            operon, into strain RB led to increased production but incurred retarded fermentation. On the other hand, replacement of the chromosomal\n            <jats:italic>argB</jats:italic>\n            by heterologous\n            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli argB</jats:italic>\n            , natively insensitive to arginine, caused a threefold-increased production without retardation, revealing that the limitation in strain RB was the activity of the\n            <jats:italic>argB</jats:italic>\n            product. To overcome this, in addition to\n            <jats:italic>argB26</jats:italic>\n            , the\n            <jats:italic>argB31</jats:italic>\n            mutation was introduced into strain RB, which caused higher deregulation of the enzyme and resulted in dramatically increased production, like the strain with\n            <jats:italic>E. coli argB</jats:italic>\n            . This reconstructed strain displayed an enhanced performance, thus allowing significantly higher productivity of arginine/citrulline even at the suboptimal 38°C.\n          </jats:p>",
