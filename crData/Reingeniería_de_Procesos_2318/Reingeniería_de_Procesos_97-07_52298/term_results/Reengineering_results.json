      "abstract": "<jats:p> Lucent Paints Pvt. Ltd., established in 1975, is a paint and enamel manufacturer with a market share of 20 per cent. With the changing environment, increasing competition and the threat of MNCs looming large the company's management decides to undertake reengineering of its processes. Ms. Anjali Parmar, a sales manager, with an engineering background and a star performer is considered to be the right candidate for this project. Parmar accepts the responsibility enthusiastically and sets about the task with full vigour. In eight months she submits the report recommending radical proposals with another ongoing quality control project being implemented under the guidance of Mr. Tikoo for obtaining ISO 9001 certification. Ms. Parmar and Mr. Tikoo get down to the new task. However, things start going wrong between them from the beginning itself. The team is plagued with disagreements and arguments. Things take such a turn that the top management has to intervene... </jats:p>",
