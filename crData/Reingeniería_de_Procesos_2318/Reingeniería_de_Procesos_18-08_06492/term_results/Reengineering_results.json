      "abstract": "<jats:p>While implementing the radical transformations, such as the business processes reengineering in the work of industrial enterprises, there is a need to increase the personnel operating efficiency in the business processes redesign. The urgent increase of control by the top management of companies is demanded for observing the procedure and standards of business processes reengineering at the enterprises in order to increase its cost effectiveness. Therefore, the relevance of the scientific research subject is indisputable. The research works of academic economists concerning the features of staffing for the business processes reengineering of companies are analyzed. The ways to overcome the resistance to organizational changes of industrial enterprises by the staff are developed. The description of the effective members of the reengineering team in the work of the company has been improved by forming special features of each member of the reengineering team. The personal and professional competencies of the personnel are shaped and offered as the most effective ones for successful realization of marketing activity reengineering at the industrial enterprises. A questionnaire was developed as part of the analysis and selection of personnel during the marketing activities reengineering at the industrial enterprises. The resulting component of the questionnaire was developed for making managerial decision on personnel selection in reengineering teams.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Recently, the City of Boston implemented a mobile, cloud-based app. Originally called “Citizens Connect,” but now called “Bos:311,” the app allows citizens to report issues related to the city's infrastructure, e.g., graffiti. Rich information in the form of pictures and descriptions provided from mobile devices, along with GPS location information, facilitates crowdsourcing monitoring of the city's infrastructure. This app provides “straight through” processing of citizen requests, reengineering the processes of monitoring and fixing city infrastructure. As a result, operations and management accounting information can be more accurate and used in real time. In addition, the cloud-based capture of information from multiple cities allows comparisons and benchmarking of critical information that likely would not be possible in other settings, while allowing economic system use by large numbers of users. This paper investigates a number of hypotheses about the use of the mobile app generated from both Hirschman's and Hammer's theories.</jats:p>",
