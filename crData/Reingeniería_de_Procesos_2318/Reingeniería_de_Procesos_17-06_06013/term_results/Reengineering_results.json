      "abstract": "<jats:p>Creative element fate of any activity may not fall to zero because of the turbulent environment in which these activities are carried out, always prevents this. Environment that makes each building unique, that is, provides the main basis of the project. When we are talking about complex construction, the share of the creative component becomes very significant. First and foremost, this is explained by the duration of the construction work, during which time to happen risk events. The article analyses the processes of construction from the point of view of their conformity to the concept of project activities. It is shown that with increasing degree of difficulty of construction or time of the last share of creative activities in the overall project grows. In recent times more and more widespread work on re-engineering complex systems, for example, building constructions. This means repair of the building, but not a simple repair with restoration of the original, incorporated in the design of building elements and their interfaces, and partial or full replacement of items that fail or are outdated, new ones require first, a new design of their structures and production technologies, as well as the design of the accessories for the installation and technology is reshaping the object. Combining the two above-mentioned factors of growth of the share of creative activities during the project management of the re-engineering of building structures: complexity and construction time, received a cognitive model of such growth. Introduced the concept of \"reengineering in construction\" as a combination of the processes of adjustment and worn or completion of unfinished buildings. It is proved that any re-engineering in construction is the project activities. Provisions are tested in a real reengineering of industrial buildings with a positive technical and economic effect.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the past decade, business process reengineering (BPR) has gradually evolved from a revolutionary principle, which provided enterprises with methods to eliminate problems, into a set of management approaches for enterprises to face unpredictable and uncontrollable circumstances. This study puts forward an integrated model, strategic business process reengineering model,, which focuses on analysis of the three stages of BPR, and explores how BPR develops into competitive advantage with strategic basic factors – positioning, unique activities, trade-offs and fit. The authors undertake SH, a famous Taiwanese brand of small appliance, for case study and analysis. The research results show that the process reengineering activities held after strategic positioning should be improved through unique activities and trade-offs, such as technology-oriented, cross-departmental labor integration and trade-offs, cross-departmental rotation and talent cultivation, and cross-organizational support for channel manufacturers in their training of technicians. During the activities, mutual fit would lead to a set of behavior system, where construction plays an essential role, as it is difficult to imitate in competitive advantage.</jats:p>"
