There were some critical factors that had to be considered. Perhaps, one of the most serious obstacles was the reluctance of some key decision makers to cease or reduce some of their authorities. Those officers believe that a direct supervision or control on the different stages of the processes is essential. The justification given is that the issue of land allocation is critical and may be problematic. Special considerations may be required under certain circumstances and these are only dealt with by key decision makers. Other factors such as reluctance of the users for change, job redundancy resulting from the change and financial resources were important but less significant. Therefore, many models were suggested before the final one was agreed on.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper is a case study that describes the reengineering processes in the public sector in UAE. This sector suffers from a great deficiency and this work represents a leading step towards improving its working practices. The value of the paper lies in the comprehensive study and analysis of this department and the efficient customized solutions it offered.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Student teams are often prearranged and then left to organize themselves and get on with their work, without any further structural support; this, however, can become a negative experience on teamwork. A varied contribution among team members often occurs and unavoidably leads to friction and reduced performance. The aim of this project is to explore the main problems in academic teamwork and investigate tools that provide relevant solutions. We present the concept of network organizational structure and discuss how this can improve collaboration and communication. The main tools to achieve a structural transformation from the more traditional form of team organization to the fairer network form, and their implications are discussed.</jats:p>",
