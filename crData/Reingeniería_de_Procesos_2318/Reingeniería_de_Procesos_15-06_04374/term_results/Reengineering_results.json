      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of multimedia either to support traditional educational tools or independently in e-learning distance programs is increasing from time to time. Accordingly, in this paper the MBA evening program in College of Business and Economics of Mekelle University has been considered as a case. In order to show how Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction can be practically applied in developing educational lesson, in this paper, business process reengineering (BPR) is selected as one aspect of strategic management course. To enhance the quality of education in teaching strategic management in general and BPR as an aspect of strategic management in particular an attempt has been made to identify relevant websites based on the concepts of “orchestrated immersion” as well as “active processing”</jats:p>"
