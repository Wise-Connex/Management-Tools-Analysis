Conceptual breakthroughs of new process were suggested. The success of implementing the project was based on infrastructure requirements for the new process and possible changes including positions and their required job skills. The paper suggests some software tool(s) that can capture the requirements and provide both backward and forward traceability.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The outcome of this work has implications for both practitioners and researchers. For researchers, the conventional, software development methodology should be amended to take into account the discussed issues in more details. For researchers, there is a need for substantial research into good practice in requirements and software development.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The original work of this project can be considered as detailed guidelines to help business process reengineering team members to successfully complete some critical activities associated with analysis and redesign of software‐development processes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Residential care facilities are an enduring feature of Ontario's community mental health system. While these facilities offer affordable housing, they are also custodial environments that are poorly suited to goals of recovery and rehabilitation. This paper examines the extent to which facilities can be “reengineered” to improve tenants' daily lives using a case study of facilities in Hamilton, Ontario. Data from a 2005 survey of 50 people with psychiatric disabilities living in residential care facilities were used to assess quality of life and the extent to which operators have implemented newly revised municipal regulations. The findings are compared with those of earlier researchers (Taylor, Elliott, &amp; Kearns, 1989) who conducted a similar survey in 1986 in Hamilton. While the two surveys differ with regard to specific items, broad comparison suggests little has changed, raising questions about the extent to which such facilities should continue to play a central role in housing for people with psychiatric disabilities. </jats:p>",
