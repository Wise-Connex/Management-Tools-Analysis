      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biominerals are extraordinary materials that provide organisms with a variety of functions to support life. The synthesis of biominerals and organization at the macroscopic level is a consequence of the interactions of these materials with proteins. The association of biominerals and proteins is very ancient and has sparked a wealth of research across biological, medical and material sciences. Calcium carbonate, hydroxyapatite, and silica represent widespread natural biominerals. The atomic details of the interface between macromolecules and these biominerals is very intriguing from a chemical perspective, considering the association of chemical entities that are structurally different. With this review I provide an overview of the available structural studies of biomineralization proteins, explored from the Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) archive and scientific literature, and of how these studies are inspiring the design and engineering of proteins able to synthesize novel biominerals. The progression of this review from classical template proteins to silica polymerization seeks to benefit researchers involved in various interdisciplinary aspects of a biomineralization project, who need background information and a quick update on advances in the field. Lessons learned from structural studies are exemplary and will guide new projects for the imaging of new hybrid biomineral/protein superstructures at the atomic level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relevance of this study lies in the fact that at the present stage of economic development, companies must continuously search for ways to improve the efficiency of economic activity. One of the ways to solve this problem is to improve the cost management complex, which will allow the company to operate more efficiently in a highly competitive environment: maximize profits, minimize costs. Achieving a sustainable advantage over competitors today is possible only if there is a lower cost of production compared to other manufacturers. One of the tools to reduce costs is the use of business process reengineering. Business process reengineering can be considered a highly effective method of cost management by a company. The result of the change in the business architecture of enterprise management is a new business model, fully focused on the economic strategy of the company and taking into account all changes in the external environment. A company that responds promptly to changes in the external environment and uses resources as efficiently as possible wins the competition, securing market share. Using the example of a construction company, the reengineering of business processes as a tool for reducing direct and overhead costs of the company is considered. A strategic map of a balanced scorecard was built for the company, the company's goal was defined, the most priority business processes affecting costs were identified, tasks were defined - to optimize the procurement and supply of materials, reduce construction time, improve the quality of construction work. The result of reengineering is presented - the formation of a new optimal model of business processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is a widely used sterol and a precursor of several costly steroidal drugs. In this study, 7-DHC biosynthesis pathway was constructed and modified in <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>. Firstly, the biosynthesis pathway was constructed by knocking out the competitive pathway genes <jats:italic>ERG5</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ERG6</jats:italic> and integrating two <jats:italic>DHCR24</jats:italic> copies from <jats:italic>Gallus gallus</jats:italic> at both sites. Then, 7-DHC titer was improved by knocking out <jats:italic>MOT3</jats:italic>, which encoded a transcriptional repressor for the 7-DHC biosynthesis pathway. Next, by knocking out <jats:italic>NEM1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>PAH1</jats:italic>, 7-DHC accumulation was improved, and genes upregulation was verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, <jats:italic>tHMG1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>IDI1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>ERG2</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>ERG3</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>DHCR24</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>POS5</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>CTT1</jats:italic> integration into multi-copy sites was used to convert precursors to 7-DHC, and increase metabolic flux. Finally, qPCR confirmed the significant up-regulation of key genes transcriptional levels. In a 96 h shaker flask fermentation, the 7-DHC titer was 649.5 mg/L by <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> synthesis. In a 5 L bioreactor, the 7-DHC titer was 2.0 g/L, which was the highest 7-DHC titer reported to date. Our study is of great significance for the industrial production of 7-DHC and steroid development for medical settings.</jats:p>"
