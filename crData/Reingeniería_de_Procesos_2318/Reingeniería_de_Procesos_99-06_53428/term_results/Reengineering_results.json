Successful testing depends, among other things, on thorough and relatively stable requirements. The paper also describes a weakness of using prototypes to refine requirements and describes how the company instead uses a multiple release software life cycle in order to define requirements incrementally.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business Process Reengineering (BPR) has been a major catalyst of the pervasive organizational change we have witnessed over the past decade. Although one can speculate on the reasons for the popularity of this phenomenon, it is important that we carefully examine its underlying antecedents for initiation, implementation, and ultimately success, if we are to add value to practitioners of this concept. This study empirically examines the importance of facets of the organizational structure, IT knowledge resources and infrastructure, and the IS function in the initiation of BPR. Data from 313 corporations were gathered using a carefully validated survey, and initiators were compared with noninitiators. The results strongly suggest that client‐server architectures, the strategic integration of IS, and cross departmental interaction are among the more important factors facilitating initiation and can be important inputs in a BPR decision‐making process. The study attempts to build a contingent theory for BPR, and the more sustainable notion of fundamental process change.</jats:p>",
