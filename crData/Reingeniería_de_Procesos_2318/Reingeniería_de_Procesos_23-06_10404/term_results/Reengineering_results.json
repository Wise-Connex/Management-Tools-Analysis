      "abstract": "<jats:p>The payment system at the Smartindo Tutoring Institute. Although it has used a web-based system that is integrated with the academic system, the existing system has not been able to run properly. So, it is forced to make adjustments in the business processes of payment section. System changes are carried out using the BPR (Business Process Reengineering) method so that the system change process can be in accordance with the needs and is able to transform conventional systems into digital systems by reducing unnecessary steps. The aim of this research is to produce a new payment system based on process optimization using the BPR method. There are 4 stages of BPR that will be carried out in this research including identify processes, review update analyze as-is, design to-be, test &amp; implement to-be. The results of these system changes resulted in a new system that showed a better level of throughput efficiency. The old system has been identified only has a throughput efficiency value of 48.39%. After analyzing and making changes to the process, the new system produces a better level of efficiency, reaching 100%. The results of better efficiency cannot be separated from the success in reducing the stages that are considered no longer needed in the workflow of the new payment system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For agroforestry industry, in this case teak production, the most challenge that are faced is the balance of teak production optimization and environmental problem. Because, when the production of timber is increased, and then the environment will be affected. Hence, it is required to be found the better solution in balancing the teak production optimization and environment conservation. By searching any literatures, either empirically or theoretically, this article reveals that business process re-engineering that can be implemented by agroforestry industry in teak production may be consist of five stages, they are identifying, model map, analyzing, improvement the process, and re-engineering. All those process must be completed by the principles in the business process they are clarity (understandable), correctness, relevance, economic efficiency, comparability, systematic design. In which must understood and completed in the business process re-engineering may include process mapping, fail-saving, teamwork, and communication. Hence, when it is implemented in the teak production process, it can deliver the positive outcomes that supported the business sustainability in teak production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of information technology is in line with the development of internet use in Indonesia, so that organizations that are unable to adapt to information technology and the internet will find it difficult to develop in the face of today's global competition. Computerized data processing contributes greatly when compared to manual data processing. SMA Muhammadiyah 2 has a library which is still relatively new and not many books. This is very inefficient, because in addition to wasting paper, data is inaccurate, filing becomes unorganized and messy. One way to increase effectiveness and efficiency is to use Business Process Reengineering (BPR) methods to improve old business processes. These stages consist of data collection, business process analysis, business process throughput efficiency test, process redesign refinement, process redesign recommendation, throughput efficiency test business process recommendation, comparison of throughput efficiency test results, solutions. The results obtained from this study are 2 the main processes studied are the process of borrowing books and the process of returning books, which are old processes that have efficiency values of 46% and 35%. However, after re-engineering the business processes of the two processes it was able to reach 100%, which found 5 processes that were eliminated and 5 processes that were automated online.</jats:p>"

Key aspects of this process are considered, such as the implementation of digital technologies, optimization of business processes and the use of innovative strategies to improve the efficiency of production operations. The work also examines the impact of these changes on the competitiveness of construction enterprises and emphasizes the need to adapt to new market requirements through the introduction of modern information technologies and optimization of management practices. This work serves as a basis for further research in the field of strategic management and digital transformation in the construction industry. In the implementation of digital technologies, which is based on data obtained automatically from IoT devices and sensors at the time of their collection. These devices and sensors are connected to machines, platforms and equipment, which allows the creation of information and mathematical models and methods. It also allows for the implementation of increasingly autonomous production and business processes that do not require constant human intervention and have the ability to self-optimize.&#x0D;\nThe formalized nature of the methodology, as well as versatile analysis, including the reasoned reasoning of specialists and managers, contribute to increasing the validity of the decisions made regarding the reengineering of business processes. This is important so that the changes developed in the processes are the most effective and meet the strategic goals of the enterprise.&#x0D;\nThe work describes the mathematical modeling of the processes that are the basis of digitalization of construction, which flow within the project. These models help optimize jobs based on various parameters such as cost, timing, business sustainability and environmental impact, as well as other characteristics defined by high-quality data (such as timeliness, relevance, accuracy and completeness).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Digital technology has enabled significant productivity gains in many industries. Manufacturers have benefited from robotics, and service businesses have benefited from self‐service technologies. An area that has seen only meager productivity gains is professional services, such as healthcare, consulting, legal services, and higher education. Despite the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies, professional services continue to be labor intensive with high labor costs. In 2021, Sampson published an empirically‐based framework suggesting that emerging technologies would allow professional services to improve productivity by automating some tasks with self‐service technologies, outsourcing some tasks to remote professionals, and delegating some tasks to semiprofessional workers. The underlying theory was that this restructuring hinges on the creative and interpersonal skill requirements of various tasks. Our research builds on Sampson's framework by modeling a professional service operation and studying the influence of task offloading on costs and quality. Our model involves discrete event simulation parameterized by empirical data. We consider labor costs, managerial costs, delay costs (including customer balking), and assessment costs. Results show contexts wherein increased task offloading can reduce costs with negligible impact on quality, suggesting great opportunities for reengineering professional services through increased automation, offshore outsourcing, and task delegation.</jats:p>",

To develop the Iraqi industrial sector, the sulfuric acid plant in Al-Furat Company for Chemical Industries and Pesticides was adopted as a sample for research, as it is one of the Iraqi industrial economic units seeking development and facing great and growing competition. Total production maintenance, this hypothesis has been proven by applying green process reengineering to the production processes of the research sample factory. The research reached several conclusions, the most important of which is that the application of green process reengineering technology steps contributes to reducing costs by improving the performance of Total productive maintenance, and helps the research sample to protect the environment, and presented a set of recommendations that contribute to the development of the research sample and environmental protection.</jats:p>",
