Those who do not heed to the signs of change will perish off. In the present competitive scenario, organisation are adopting new and new strategies for both survival and protection of their business domain. Reengineering is the buzzword of industry today. Many companies have gone for reengineering implementation, but the failure rate is pretty high for such implementation. Much has been written about reengineering but considerable uncertainty and confusion exists about what reengineering is and what factors can have significant influence over success or failure of a reengineering project. Many reasons have been cited for the failure of reengineering. One of the major reasons for failure has been negligence of human aspect during such implementations which have been brought out in this paper. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Bell Online Institute (BOLI) represents a radical change to the way Bell Canada provides internal training to its 27,000 employees. BOLI specializes in Web-based training, one type of technology enabled (distance) learning. Web-based training is a significant departure from the more traditional classroom-based practices at the Bell Institute for Professional Development, which is the organization that oversees all employee training at Bell Canada. This case study examines the use of Web-based training at Bell Canada in the context of business process reengineering. We present a theoretical context and a practical guide to how technology enabled learning changes the business processes in an organization. The study defines the processes that are required to deliver Web-based training, the value to the internal and external business practices of the organization, and the costs for each process. The wider applications of this case study are identified and will be of interest to those in other organizations that are moving from classroom delivered training to distance delivery. This case study describes changes in the organization that result from reengineering, including the impact Web-based learning has on training plans, student needs assessments, the ability to provide specialized curricula, training students and instructors in using new technologies, and establishing a principle of continuous improvement. Alternative ways of achieving project objectives are presented, along with organizational impact, technology alternatives, and cost-benefits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) is one of the largest agencies in the Tennessee state government. It is responsible for maintaining and managing an integrated transportation system as well as awarding contracts for construction and maintenance. TDOT’s concern is to fulfill its obligations to the public by providing a system that functions well and is safe and cost-effective. Like other government agencies, TDOT faces strong pressure from its stakeholders to become more efficient in a changing environment. Technological advances, management methodologies that have shifted from function-oriented to process-oriented, and a new cost-awareness based on these same trends are some of the issues that the department is currently addressing with support from the professional services firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). In their strategic planning, TDOT executives determined that the time had come for radical change through business process reengineering (BPR). BPR calls for a full-fledged effort, analyzing processes as the core task in the reengineering. TDOT began by focusing on the project-development process for new construction. Once goals were determined, a series of steps followed, including surveying the users of the various processes to establish requirements and expectations, establishing key baseline measurements, and comparing reengineered processes with best-in-class organizations. For the reengineering effort to succeed at TDOT, a close collaboration was maintained between the TDOT subject-matter experts and BPR, change-management, and information-technology experts from PwC. Successful BPR will lead to more improvement efforts in TDOT. </jats:p>",
