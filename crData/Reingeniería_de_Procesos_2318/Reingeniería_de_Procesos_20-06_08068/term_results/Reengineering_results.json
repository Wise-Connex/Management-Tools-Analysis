The goals, tasks, various options for their solution, application areas of reengineering in construction are identified, as well as its basic principles and development directions are formulated in the article. In this regard, it is assumed, that practical use of reengineering methodology will contribute to the creating of the comfortable and safe living environment, as well as competitive advantages of the building construction organizations, aimed at the reduction of cost and terms of works realization, increase of productivity and production quality. Works of foreign and domestic scientists are used as initial materials on the research issues, and functional and structural analysis are taken as cognition methods. In this regard, a retrospective of reengineering is investigated, a definition of this concept and its qualifications (“capital construction facility reengineering”, “business process reengineering”, “technological process reengineering”) are given, and directions for use in the investment-construction activities are established. At the corporate level, there are three types of reengineering: business processes, technological processes and capital construction facility. The article presents the distribution of these types of reengineering on the timeline of the investment-construction, as well as the distribution of participants by types of reengineering, the volumetric nature of reengineering is noted. It is shown, that a specific type of reengineering is the reengineering of territories and buildings and possible directions of its impulse are presented. Considering the sectoral level as the highest level in the hierarchy, the possible options for initiating reengineering “top-down” and “bottom-up” are established, and factors influencing this process are identified.</jats:p>",

In this regard, the issues of the formation of resource provision of the capital construction facility reengineering indicators, their documentary presentation, the stages of this business, the distribution of the resource provision functions between the investment-construction participants are established. The relevance and adequacy of the connection between resource supply structure and composition and current construction standards are shown. The basic theoretical aspects of the presentation of the resource provision of the capital construction facility reengineering as aggregate investment flows are stated. The efficiency of the resource supply of the capital construction facility reengineering is established to be connected with the solution of three main tasks: optimizing the composition and structure of resource provision, rational allocation of resources and works, quality assurance. The result of solving the problems may be: a decrease in the cost and duration of reengineering, an increase in the quality of capital construction object. An integrated solution to these problems may lead to a synergistic and multiplicative effect. The close correlation between the reengineering resource supply, scientific and technological progress achievements and development of the construction standards and information management and analysis systems is summarized.</jats:p>",
