      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article considers operations research methods and system analysis for solving dynamic production management problems related to increasing its flexibility. The most important elements characterizing the effectiveness of the management process are the state of the management object and the presence of certain production opportunities to change its state. The organization of effective production management in the process of innovative transformations leads to the need to consider the general scheme of managing the entire complex of works carried out during this period as a complex dynamic system, which at the stage of introducing innovations is not yet sufficiently adapted to production and technological transformations due to the wide variety of alternatives for implementing the functions of such a system. It is outlined that effective methods of system analysis have not yet been developed due to the complexity and diversity of the boundary conditions of the activities of various machine-building enterprises. However, the permanent nature of the innovative transformations of their production base allows drawing a conclusion about the perspective of the simultaneous application of the technological reengineering methodology for the management system. It is substantiated that the preliminary modeling when solving the tasks of managing the production process and performing specific works on technological rehabilitation should be built taking into account the provision of the necessary efficiency of the control system. This can ensure its technological rehabilitation. The mathematical model of the interrelationship of elements that are key to increasing the efficiency of the management system at the industrial enterprise that is conducting technological rehabilitation of its production base, and which are determined by a complex of functional management tasks, is proposed.\nKeywords: innovative transformations, process, management, organization, production base, parameters, project.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Constantly increasing competition initiates the need of market participants to catch up with others and become the first before it is too late, and this requires mechanisms that can simplify very complex things. The most successful are the changes that occur at critical moments, ie the greater the real risk of crisis or bankruptcy, the greater the probability of success, because in the latter case stimulates initiative and active implementation of changes in the company, creating completely new and more efficient business processes. By reengineering business processes, businesses can win in today's world not only with competitors, but also with the crisis that is increasingly occurring in today's world. Business process reengineering is recognized as the most radical management approach, and at the same time it can be used both in times of crisis and in terms of success to provide a competitive advantage. Reengineering is a fundamental rethinking and radical restructuring of the business, to improve such important indicators as cost, quality, level of service, speed of operation, finance, marketing, building information systems. The elements of the methodology of change management of the enterprise considered in the work allow to form a generalized methodological approach to justifying the choice of the most appropriate metaphor of the enterprise vision in the implementation of various methods of implementing organizational and strategic changes. The developed conceptual principles of implementing changes in marketing activities in accordance with the key provisions of content, contextual, systemic, process, situational and behavioral approaches can be effectively applied in the implementation of the above methods of change management within the metaphors. The considered principles of reengineering of business processes of marketing activity and stages of its realization serve as a basis for improvement of efficiency of activity of the enterprise as a whole and effective introduction of organizational and strategic changes.\nKeywords: reengineering, business processes, marketing, management, competition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The authors considered anti-evolutionary, institutional, entrepreneurial and integration models of management systems in the context of studying the transformational cycle of economic processes development. This made it possible to prove that the effectiveness of the application of a specific approach to the organization of the structure of the management system depends on the degree of its implementation at a specific economic asset, and the transition to another structure is necessary in the case of the limitations of the existing one. It has been proven that one of the most promising mechanisms is the reengineering of business processes, which provides process orientation and an inductive approach to the use of modern information technologies, allowing flexible adaptation of the management system to changes in external and internal environments. The use of an object-oriented approach to the analysis, design and synthesis of applied software is proposed.  It will allow the use of an iterative method of project development, which increases the efficiency, quality and speed of performing all types of work, as well as the possibility of forming multi-option solutions for the development of production and economic systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Some cytokines can reengineer anti-tumor immunity to modify the tumor micro-environment. Interleukin-27 (IL-27) can partially reduce tumor growth in several animal models, including prostate cancer. We hypothesized that addition of IL-18, which can induce the proliferation of several immune effector cells through inducing IFNγ could synergize with IL-27 to enhance tumor growth control. We describe our findings on the effects of IL-27 gene delivery on prostate cancer cells and how sequential therapy with IL-18 enhanced the efficacy of IL-27. The combination of IL-27 followed by IL-18 (27→18) successfully reduced cancer cell viability, with significant effects in cell culture and in an immunocompetent mouse model. We also examined a novel chimeric cytokine, comprising an IL-27 targeted at the C-terminus with a short peptide, LSLITRL (27pepL). This novel cytokine targets a receptor upregulated in tumor cells (IL-6Rα) via the pepL ligand. Interestingly, when we compared the 27→18 combination with the single 27pepL therapy, we observed a similar efficacy for both. This efficacy was further enhanced when 27pepL was sequenced with IL-18 (27pepL→18). The observed reduction in tumor growth and significantly enriched canonical pathways and upstream regulators, as well as specific immune effector signatures (as determined by bioinformatics analyses in the tumor microenvironment) supported the therapeutic design, whereby IL-27 or 27pepL can be more effective when delivered with IL-18. This cytokine sequencing approach allows flexible incorporation of both gene delivery and recombinant cytokines as tools to augment IL-27’s bioactivity and reengineer efficacy against prostate tumors and may prove applicable in other therapeutic settings.</jats:p>"

Hal ini menyebabkan terhambatnya pelayanan kantor desa kepada masyarakat dalam hal administrasi kependudukan. Selain itu sistem konvensional penyuratan yang diterapkan menyebabkan sering terjadinya surat tercecer dan hilang. Maka dari itu pengabdian kepada masyarakat ini bertujuan untuk membuat sebuah sistem administrasi surat untuk kantor Desa Sukamanah guna mempermudah para pegawai untuk melakukan layanan administrasi surat-menyurat kepada masyarakat seperti surat masuk, surat keluar, surat pindah, surat kematian, dsb. Sistem ini dibangun menggunakan bahasa pemrograman PHP dan sistem basis data MySQL dengan metode pengambangunan sistem Waterfall.</jats:p>"
