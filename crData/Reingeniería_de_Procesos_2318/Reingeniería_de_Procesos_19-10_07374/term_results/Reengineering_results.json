      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The article discusses two types of corporate-level reengineering of investment and construction activities: the qualitative transformation of capital construction projects (CCP) and technological processes. The implementation of the reengineering measures in respect of the CCP is studied as a dominant. All the mutual relations and interactions of anthropotechnical system elements and external environment are assembled around the CCP. The CCP is considered as the expression of the achieved result. Materials and methods. The study used legislative and normative documents regulating investment and construction activities in the Russian Federation as well as papers of domestic and foreign scientists. The examined normative and methodological materials allowed identifying criteria and factors of classification of reengineering measures at the level of “building project – building site” and on this basis establishing the composition of the reengineering of a CCP and reengineering of technological processes. Results. The article examines the normative component of the practical activity of the reengineering. It provides the following terms regulated by the current legislative base of construction: reconstruction, major repair, technical re-equipment, restoration. Separately, the definition of CCP reprofiling is suggested. Structural and functional relations within CCP and technological processes reengineering are studied. Conclusions. The research has demonstrated that the reengineering is an efficient mechanism of formation of a comfortable living environment based on achievements of science and technology, record and complete satisfaction of consumers’ demands, as well as the creation of competitive advantages for not only domestic construction establishments but also the whole national construction industry. All this made it possible to determine the genesis of the corporate level reengineering of investment and construction activities and to establish a structure of the CCP reengineering. In conclusion, the article presented the main directions for improving the efficiency of the reengineering mechanism. The role of information and analytical activity organization quality in this system of the measures is specially marked.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter examines the most recent and ambitious reengineering of the Japanese intelligence community. A revised Japanese intelligence reform started with the 2013 passage of a Designated State Secrets Law (DSSL) and creation of the National Security Council (NSC). Intelligence communities everywhere are in constant motion, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council had already drafted even more ambitious plans by late 2015. But the scope and scale of the 2013 reforms suggest that political leaders anticipated new security challenges by addressing many of Japan's most difficult endemic intelligence problems. This chapter also analyzes how Japan might resolve the inherent tension between enhancing alliance management and reducing the dependence on the United States.</p>",

The objective is to improve the quality, reduce costs and duration of the design process by bringing radical change to the process allowing breakthrough improvements rather than obtained by continuous improvement. For this purpose, the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is used to represent and analyse the design process. This method is particularly adapted to capture the repetitive aspect of design tasks. Indeed, iterations, an inherent feature of the design process, represent a key factor in the determination of the design process duration and cost. In this study, the number of iterative tasks is reduced by 50%. The implementation of the reorganized process needs an organisational change in the design office but the expected benefits are worth the effort.</jats:p>",

Kenya as a country highly depends on technical skills to achieve the Vision 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals. However, this can only be achieved through proper and realistic career counseling information provided by the counseling teachers at the secondary school level. According to KCSE results released every year, the majority of the candidates score below grade C+ especially in 2016 and 2017 though above D- which is the requirement for entrance for proficiency level for TVET courses.  However, the majority of students do not join Vocational or Technical Education due to a missing link between the natures of career counseling services offered at the secondary school level. Counselors have expectations and premise that the majority of the candidates join training at university levels thus package their counseling information on the few ignoring other students.  The objective behind this study was to examine the final results scored by students and the subject choice at secondary school, various career theories, and models that guide career choices formed the foundation for the study. The study used a descriptive design where data was collected through past existing data review from KNEC and one Technical Training Institute over a period of four years. Data was analyzed and presented in tables and figures. Findings revealed that the majority of the candidates (86.92%) of the KCPE candidates scored less than C+ and had no career information on Vocational and Technical Education. The study recommends reengineering of the career guidance in Kenya education system to involve the Ministry, professionals and Human Resource Management experts. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Technological advancements have revolutionized our understanding of the complexity and importance of the human microbiome. This progress has also emphasized the need for precision therapeutics, as it has underscored the dilemmas, such as dysbiosis and increasing antibiotic resistance, associated with current, broad-spectrum treatment modalities. Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease worldwide, accompanied by a tremendous financial and social burden, despite widespread and efficacious fluoride and hygienic regimens. Over the past several decades, various precision approaches to combat dental caries, including vaccines, probiotics, and antimicrobial compounds, have been pursued. Despite the distinct overall conceptual strengths of each approach, for various reasons, there are currently no approved precision antibiotic therapeutics to prevent dental caries. Specifically targeted antimicrobial peptides (STAMPs) are synthetic molecules that combine the antibiotic moiety of a traditional antimicrobial peptide with a targeting domain to provide specificity against a particular organism. Conjoining the killing domain from the antimicrobial, novispirin G10, and a targeting domain derived from the Streptococcus mutans pheromone, CSP, the STAMP C16G2 was designed to provide targeted killing of S. mutans, widely considered the keystone species in dental caries pathogenesis. C16G2 was able to selectively eliminate S. mutans from complex ecosystems while leaving closely related, yet health-associated, oral species unharmed. This remodeling of the dental plaque community is expected to have significant advantages compared to conventional broad-spectrum mouthwashes, as the intact, surviving community is apt to prevent reinfection by pathogens. Following successful phase I clinical trials that evaluated the safety and basic microbiology of C16G2 treatments, the phase II trials of several C16G2 formulations are currently in progress. C16G2 represents an exciting advance in precision therapeutics, and the STAMP platform provides vast opportunities for both the development of additional therapeutics and the overall study of microbial ecology. </jats:p>",

It is determined that the impact on the efficiency of market activities is associated with the use of marketing and logistics tools. The newest management systems will allow to combine functions (production and commercial) in the strategies for achievement of the maximum effect at positioning of the integrated enterprises in various markets. It is proved that the formation of the management system of an integrated enterprise should take place on the basis of system, complexity, integrity and unity. It has been identified that the issues of partnership marketing become especially important in the application of the marketing and logistics system and in the entry of the integrated enterprise into the target market. The main factors of influence and factors of customer-oriented management formation at the enterprises are presented. It is determined that business process reengineering requires the development of a combined internal marketing and logistics system in accordance with changes in the market environment. It is outlined that marketing logistics should be formed in order to get the best results in the management system of integrated enterprises. The necessity of using marketing through two-vector understanding, and logistics – in a broader management area is proved. Marketing logistics takes into account all the features of production and commercial activities of integrated enterprises. It is presented that the concept of marketing and logistics management in the process of reengineering the business processes of integrated enterprises will have its own functionality. The defined set of functions is a combination of marketing and logistics. The need to involve the tools of partnership marketing has been identified in the reengineering of integrated enterprises due to the peculiarities of production and commercial components of their activities. It is proved that the combination of the main activity can have target markets in different areas, so the combination of internal marketing and logistics strategies into one is a crucial stage of their effective development.\n\nKeywords: marketing, logistics, business process reengineering, integrated enterprise, marketing relations, strategies, efficiency.</jats:p>",
