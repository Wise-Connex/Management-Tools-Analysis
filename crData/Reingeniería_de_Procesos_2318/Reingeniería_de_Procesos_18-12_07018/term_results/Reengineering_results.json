      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to provide theoretical explanation of business process reengineering performance using emerging themes of adaptability and knowledge management in the context of developing economies. The study used a narrative cross-sectional survey conducted using qualitative data collection technique, specifically the appreciative inquiry. The study used operations managers and senior executive managers to gather qualitative data from Ugandaâ€™s reengineered microfinance institutions to provide indepth explanation of business process reengineering performance. The authors find that adaptability, knowledge creation and knowledge sharing explain business process reengineering performance. The results suggest that business process reengineering be made mandatory to ensure sustainable competitiveness of the financial sector. The study provides novel insights of business process reengineering performance using a theory of change and a complexity theory. Methodological, theoretical, managerial and policy implications herein play pivotal role in bridging the knowledge gap that exists in Microfinance institutions of developing economies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Topicality. Today, in order to overcome financial problems, business entities are forced to mobilize the entire economic potential. But it is precisely in the manufacturing sector that business processes are often unable to resolve the crisis effectively, so the management department should find an alternative way to overcome it. Before modern domestic enterprises, the increasing problem of increasing the efficiency of management is becoming more and more actual. One of the key issues is the dominance of functional management in organizations, which causes a lot of complexity. The process of reengineering business processes at the enterprise comes at the aid, which today needs additional study and coverage. Applying the principles of reengineering, an enterprise can prevent bankruptcy or decline in production and continue development in the chosen direction, or take on the basis of analysis of the results of the decision on the change of products, technological or market orientation.Purpose and tasks. Consider the methods of building a business on the principles of reengineering business processes at the enterprise. Analyze the major mistakes during reengineering, and specify the main advantages.\nResearch results In the article during the study of the topic found methods of building a business on the principles of reengineering business processes in the enterprise, the main advantages of reengineering. It also found that due to the reengineering of business processes at the enterprise it is possible to accelerate the growth of investment attractiveness, the introduction of new information technologies, that is, the enterprise is moving to a new stage in its development, and accordingly, there is growth, because without it it is difficult to imagine a modern enterprise, which seeks to match the international quality standards to maximize the needs of the population, support the national economy and domestic production.Conclusions Thanks to the reengineering of business processes at the enterprise it is possible to accelerate the growth of investment attractiveness, the introduction of new information technologies, that is, the company is moving to a new stage in its development. Business process reengineering can provide a radical transformation of the management and production system of enterprises and allows to significantly improve the competitiveness and efficiency of their activities, help them to win new markets, move to a qualitatively new level in a competitive market environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Enterprise information systems play a significant role in the Industry 4.0 era and are the crucial component to realize smart manufacturing systems. However, traditional enterprise information systems have some limits: (1) lack of complete information, (2) only satisfy limited business needs, and (3) lack of seamless integration, business intelligence, value-driven processes, and dynamic optimization. Clearly, the existing enterprise information systems are unable to satisfy the requirements for smart manufacturing systems: (1) autonomous operation, (2) sustainable values, and (3) self-optimization. In addition, smart manufacturing systems have become more efficient and effective, demanding for seamless information flow in enterprise information systems, knowledge, and data-driven accurately decision. Therefore, a new enterprise information systems framework is needed to bridge gaps between the requirements for traditional manufacturing system and smart manufacturing system. In this article, the integrative framework is proposed based on the business process reengineering, lean thinking, and intelligent management methods, with inclusion of six enterprise information systems aspects to provide upgrading guidelines from traditional manufacturing to smart manufacturing. The procedure of this method contains three steps: (1) it identifies requirements and acquires best practices using AS-IS model, (2) it redesigns six aspects of enterprise information systems using TO-BE model, and (3) it proposes a new enterprise information systems framework. Finally, the proposed framework is validated by real cases. </jats:p>",
