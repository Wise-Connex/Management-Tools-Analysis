      "abstract": "<jats:p>The work reported here intends to identify and mitigate the causes for failure in a plastic faucet holder, a part of an integral float faucet with a well-documented history of fracture occurrence. A methodology for the identification of hidden internal defects in plastic parts and the elaboration of the required corrective actions towards quality improvement is, therefore, presented. Firstly, part defects were identified via injection moulding process numerical simulation. The latter has enabled the prediction of an excessive volumetric shrinkage at the core of the faucet holder, highlighting the presence of internal voids and, hence, the possible deterioration of the load-bearing capacity. The supposition was later confirmed by X-ray topography scans. Part reengineering, consisting of localized thickness reduction, was the option chosen for decreasing the high shrinkage at the core. For validation purposes, structural analyses were carried out, with and without accounting for the injection moulding processing history. The results obtained during part structural analysis have enabled us to conclude that, when taking into account the residual stresses generated during injection moulding, the analysis more closely reflects the experimental data and allows us to implicitly envisage the propensity to fracture. Moreover, the part modifications, undertaken during the faucet holder reengineering, led to the reduction of the cumulative (processing and imposed by load) stresses by 50%, when compared to the original design analysed.</jats:p>"

In the analytical part, the features of the VAT refund to the exporting company are analyzed in detail. To formalize and describe business processes, the notation IDEF0 and IDEF3 was chosen. In the design part, the ―AS IS‖ model was analyzed and the main problems of the model were identified. A strategy for the future strategy based on the IDEF0 methodology was developed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The significant change in the consumption pattern of Indonesia’s modernising society––further intensified by the Indonesian Government’s plan to push towards the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, has fostered the need for manufacturing companies to create newly automated processes and make the transition to become a digitalised business entity. Enterprise Resource Planning is a software that enables the creation of integration and automation of business processes between various departments within a company, thus creating an effective business strategy. The data that has been acquired from research at a poultry processing company are then being mapped into the ERP software of Odoo V12.0, therefore creating new sets of re-engineered business processes. There are seven newly proposed reengineering business processes––in which only concentrate on the production and technical department within the particular company, by utilising the manufacturing and maintenance modules. The re-engineered business processes are assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model theory, to measure its usability and practicality, which generates the score of Likert’s interpretation above the accepted standard of 1340 and 1227, for both the manufacturing and maintenance modules respectively. &#x0D;\n Keywords: Business Process Reengineering, Enterprise Resource Planning, Manufacturing Process, Odoo, Technology Acceptance Model. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The reengineering of systems into a microservice-based architecture can be seen as an implementation of a service-oriented architecture (SOA). However, the deployment of SOA into an enterprise is a challenging task, as it may involve the modernization of mission-critical systems with high technical debt and high maintenance costs. To this end, a process is required to provide an appropriate set of steps and techniques that minimize risks and at the same time ensure the quality of the systems during the migration process. Thus, this work presents the Service-oriented Process for Reengineering and DevOps—SPReaD, an instantiation of the mainstream SOA methodology focusing on the reengineering of legacy systems integrating DevOps aspects for developing microservices systems. This process has been defined during a real software reengineering project of legacy systems from a Brazilian State Department of Taxation. The results obtained include a substantial improvement in the quality of the main taxation system used by the state, including not only code-related metrics but also performance improvements of the services offered, and a change in the methodology adopted by the software development team.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business process engineering is carried out on the business process of Wardani’s souvenir shop which is located at Jl. Monkey Forest, Ubud. This shop was chosen as the research use case because the shop is located in a strategic tourist location in the center of Ubud. Reengineering is focused on the Wardani Store’s business activities in the purchasing, inventory, and sales business functions, where at the time the research was conducted, all processes were still using the manual method. This method often causes problems, such as uncontrolled purchasing of goods, errors in recording purchases and sales of goods, length of calculation in transactions, and unclear information on availability of goods. Therefore, an approach is needed in developing an integrated system in the company's operational activities, and the application of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) can be an alternative in overcoming the problems experienced. ERP implementation is carried out by identifying ongoing business processes for purchasing, inventory, and selling goods, then making an integrated system proposal by implementing Odoo 13. System testing is carried out using the User Acceptance Test (UAT) method which is a final testing method for developing a product to validate whether the system built is in accordance with the user's needs or not. The system test results show that the Odoo ERP application is considered quite successful in helping companies in purchasing, inventory, and selling goods, so that business processes become more effective and efficient</jats:p>"
