      "abstract": "<jats:p>The application process for the Medical Assistance Fund (MAF) to help patients receive medical interventions at public hospitals has been plagued with delays due to the increasing number of applications, inefficient management, and manual tasks. This study aims to redesign the current application process through Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and to evaluate the effectiveness of a new process to be carried out by the Medical Social Work Unit (MSWU).  A new methodology, B2Lean which is based on a combination of the BPR and Lean Thinking was proposed to help identify the processes requiring improvement and to remove inefficient ones. A new online application system, the Patient Assistance Management System was proposed as an IT enabler for this BPR initiative. This study was based on a qualitative research methodology involving a case study in which interviews and observations were used to collect data. The sample study consisted of seven MSWU officers and several supporting staff selected from a government hospital. In the interviews, the ‘5W 1H’ technique was used to elicit and analyze their feedback on issues relating to the existing processes. The findings of the analysis revealed that several manual tasks were inefficient, which had to be either removed or replaced, effectively helping to reduce the overall processing time by 52%. With the new and efficient processes, practitioners could certainly expedite patients’ applications for medical assistance, thus helping them to receive prompt medical interventions. The B2Lean methodology could be used as a guideline for organizations seeking improvement in their current practices.</jats:p>"

The monitoring system consists of elements, from the monitoring sensor to the monitoring interface, designed and implemented by the research team, especially for the proposed monitoring system. The monitoring solution is intended for users who live in houses without automatic ventilation systems. The air quality sensor is designed at a minimum cost and complexity to allow multi-zone implementation without significant effort. The user interface uses a spatial graphic representation that facilitates understanding areas with different air quality levels. Presentation of the outdoor air quality level supports the user’s decision to ventilate a space. An innovative element of the proposed monitoring interface is the real-time forecast of air quality evolution in each monitored space. The paper describes the implementation of an original monitoring solution (monitoring device, Edge/Cloud management system, innovative user monitoring interface) and presents the results of testing this system in a relevant environment. The research conclusions show the proposed solution’s benefits in improving the end-user experience, justified both by the technical results obtained and by the opinion of the users who tested the monitoring system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cross-industry frameworks for business process reengineering (BPR) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing organizational efficiency, agility, and competitiveness across diverse sectors. These frameworks amalgamate conceptual models with practical executions to streamline operations, optimize resource allocation, and foster innovation. This review delves into the essence of cross-industry frameworks for BPR, elucidating their conceptual underpinnings and real-world applications. At the core of cross-industry frameworks lies the recognition that business processes transcend sector boundaries, encompassing common elements such as customer interactions, supply chain management, and operational workflows. Conceptual models form the foundational framework by articulating key principles, methodologies, and best practices for BPR initiatives. One prominent conceptual model is the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) methodology, which advocates for radical redesign rather than incremental improvement of processes. This approach emphasizes fundamental questioning of existing practices, aiming to achieve dramatic enhancements in efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction. Another influential model is the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), which provides a roadmap for organizations to systematically improve their processes by advancing through defined maturity levels. Practical executions of cross-industry frameworks entail the translation of conceptual models into actionable strategies tailored to specific organizational contexts. This involves a multifaceted approach encompassing process analysis, stakeholder engagement, technology integration, and change management. Process analysis entails mapping current workflows, identifying bottlenecks, and pinpointing areas for optimization. Stakeholder engagement is crucial for garnering buy-in and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Technology integration plays a pivotal role in modern BPR initiatives, leveraging digital tools such as business process management (BPM) software, data analytics, and robotic process automation (RPA) to streamline operations and enhance decision-making. Moreover, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain offer new avenues for process innovation and optimization. Change management constitutes a critical component of practical executions, as BPR initiatives often entail significant organizational transformation. Effective change management involves communication, training, and leadership support to mitigate resistance and facilitate smooth transition. Real-world applications exemplify the effectiveness of cross-industry frameworks in driving tangible business outcomes. Case studies spanning diverse sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and retail, demonstrate how organizations have leveraged BPR to achieve breakthrough improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction. In the manufacturing sector, for instance, companies have adopted lean manufacturing principles to streamline production processes, minimize waste, and enhance flexibility. In healthcare, BPR initiatives have led to streamlined patient care pathways, reduced administrative burdens, and improved clinical outcomes. Financial institutions have leveraged BPR to optimize loan approval processes, mitigate risk, and enhance regulatory compliance. Similarly, retailers have utilized BPR to optimize supply chain management, enhance omnichannel capabilities, and personalize customer experiences. Cross-industry frameworks for business process reengineering represent a potent paradigm for organizational transformation in today's dynamic business landscape. By integrating conceptual models with practical executions, these frameworks empower organizations to enhance operational efficiency, drive innovation, and maintain competitive advantage across diverse sectors.</jats:p>"

Formation of an economic and mathematical model as an economic platform for the protection of industrial enterprises in order to implement economic security in the frameworks of business process reengineering.   Methodology. The following methods were used in the research process: methods of theoretical generalization and comparison, analysis and synthesis (to determine the meaning of the concept of “economic security of the enterprise”), statistical method (to analyze the initial data), economic and mathematical modeling of the compositional restructuring of an economic unit – an industrial enterprise (to determine conditions under which it is advisable to reengineer the business processes of an economic unit in order to form a platform of economic security).   Findings. The results are determined by the fact that the theoretical provisions of the paper are brought to the level of specific proposals and have a form suitable for use in practical activities. An example of the practical application of the proposed economic and mathematical model is presented as illustrated by Pivdennyi Mining and Processing Plant (MPP) PJSC, where the essence of the given analysis is revealed. The obtained results proved their effectiveness and feasibility of use at the relevant domestic industrial enterprises.   Originality. For the first time, an approach to the development of economic security of the enterprise on the basis of business process reengineering has been proposed. Economic-mathematical modeling has gained further development in determining the conditions for the feasibility of implementing structural transformations of an economic unit to obtain optimal values of indicators that reveal the essence of the economic security of an industrial enterprise.   Practical value. The analysis of modeling results makes it possible to propose the implementation of imperatives – economic security of the enterprise on the basis of the implementation of its restructuring. Application of the proposed model provides a means to ensure rapid adaptability of industrial enterprises to changes, high flexibility and adaptability of all elements of the system, autonomy and economic functioning of enterprises as a whole and their structural subdivisions. The practice of using the developed economic and mathematical model based on reengineering confirmed the obtained theoretical results.</jats:p>",

A low-grade lead-zinc ore in Guangxi, China, contains valuable components like galena, sphalerite, pyrite, barite, etc. and the gangue mineral is primarily dolomite. This paper proposes a flow of “waste pre-discarding by dense medium cyclone - sequential priority flotation of lead and zinc recovery - flotation and gravity combined process for barite recovery” to realize full component utilization. In this technical approach, 38.81% of the waste rock that can be utilized as concrete aggregate was removed from the feed ore through pre-discarding prior to grinding, after that recovers lead and zinc by the sequential priority flotation method with yield of Pb concentrate and Zn concentrate at 7.61%. In order to more efficiently recover barite and pyrite from lead-zinc flotation tailings, the gravity equipment of reflux classifier (RC) was used, which obtained barite concentrate with a yield of 7.97% and pyrite concentrate with a yield of 2.28%. The remaining yield of 43.34% tailings can be used for filling after the recovery of barite concentrate. Utilizing waste rock, lead, zinc, barite, and other resources might help the mine achieve the dynamic balance of “mining-discarding-beneficiation-filling” and realize zero tailings discharge.</jats:p>",
