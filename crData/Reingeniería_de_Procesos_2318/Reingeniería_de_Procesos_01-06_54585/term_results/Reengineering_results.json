      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>At the annual meeting in April 1989, Corning’s stockholders voted to approve a new identity for the corporation, replacing the 114-year-old name, Corning Glass Works with the simpler, more contemporary, and less specific, Corning Incorporated. Jamie Houghton announced several reasons for the change. First, the growth of its diversified interests, especially lab services, meant that Corning was no longer accurately called a glass works. Second, the company sought to recognize something fundamentally new in its own nature. Corning was not a traditional manufacturing corporation, explained Houghton, but rather “a global network... a closely knit web of businesses tied together by common interests.” In 1989, the network consisted of six operating divisions, 21 subsidiary companies, and 20 joint ventures. The new Corning spanned geographical and industry borders, mixed manufacturing and services, concerned itself with horizontal processes rather than hierarchical control, and managed itself through teams, partnerships, and alliances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the recent past, a number of managerial innovations—including product line management, total quality management, and reengineering—have swept through the hospital industry. Given their pervasiveness and their cost, understanding the mix of factors that influences their adoption is of theoretical interest and practical relevance. The research reported here focuses on this general question by examining influences on the adoption and extensiveness of a particular managerial innovation, hospital reengineering. The results suggest that while economic and institutional factors have influenced the adoption and extensiveness of hospital reengineering, institutional forces play a more important role. The greater influence of institutional forces may be attributed to the high degree of uncertainty in health care, the causal ambiguity of the innovation, and the anticipatory actions of hospitals attempting to position themselves in a rapidly changing environment. </jats:p>",
