Kondisi ini sekaligus menegaskan betapa peran sistem informasi sangat penting dan dapat disebut sebagai enabler bagi keberlangsungan sebuah organisasi dan tujuan bisnisnya</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prior to 2000, and before banks in Nigeria embraced the NBS was inefficient, characterized by frauds, long queues, nonperforming loans, illiquidity and distress. As one way of overcoming these challenges banks started to focus on BPR as a veritable tool to drive efficiency customer satisfaction and improved shareholder value. With the advent of BPR and process improvement efficiency gradually strolled back in to the NBS Against the prereengineering era when the liquidity ratio of the NBS was minus 15.92 percent in 1996 with no bank meeting the 30 percent minimum prudential requirement, the NBS had a positive average liquidity ratio of 65.69 in 2011 with all the banks meeting the 30 percent minimum liquidity ratio. The banks that introduced BPR early in the 2000s have remained without distress, liquid, efficient with high growths in gross earnings, total assets profitability and total equity. The research design was deployed for the study, and it was found that BPR has positive effect on NBS efficiency.</jats:p>"
