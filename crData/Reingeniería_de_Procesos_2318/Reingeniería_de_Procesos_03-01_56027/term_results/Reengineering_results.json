      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>Information technology matters. The formulation of business models and strategies is likely to be seriously flawed if it neglects new technological changes and repercussions. Information technology and organizational learning are both critical to attaining and sustaining competitive advantage. Based on these premises, and on the increasingly evident obsolescence of the traditional, hierarchical business model, the author takes an integrated approach to the discussion of organizational learning, new value propositions, supply-chain optimization, e-commerce, new perspectives on business process reengineering, collaborative business models, globalization of business, and the continuing trend toward virtual integration.</JATS1:p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<JATS1:p>This book is not another tired exhortation to take advantage of technology to improve corporate performance. One cannot utilize technology to its full potential without also overhauling the rigid, hierarchical business model that was designed for the command-and-control corporate environment of the industrial era. Tsai takes a comprehensive view of everything that needs to be done in order to make the most of emerging technologies. The new information economy calls for companies that foster strategic collaboration through a more horizontal organizational structure. A more synchronized supply chain yields better customer service, higher quality, faster delivery, and lower inventory. In the customer-centric environment, a new value proposition is essential. Business processes must be fast, focused, flexible, responsive, and nimble. With the knowledge gained from this book, one should be able to face the future with an ability and capacity to discern technology policies and make decisions concerning strategic positioning and competitive business strategy.</JATS1:p>"

Because of the long lead-time between order and delivery, they found that responding to marketplace changes in a timely fashion was becoming increasingly difficult. In the meantime, major competitors such as Anheuser Busch were responding to consumer demands for fresher products by providing freshness label dating. Heineken USA launched its new Internet based system called Heineken Operational Planning System (HOPS) to allow the parent company to produce the beer closer to the time when they need to deliver it, so the customer receives a fresher product. The new system enables Heineken USA to achieve 50% reduction in the lead-time from order to delivery and 10% increase in sales.</jats:p>"

To take advantage of the Internet open architecture, most companies are applying business reengineering with the aim of moving from hierarchical centralized structures to networked decentralized business units cooperating with one another. As a consequence, the way in which software information systems are conceived, designed, and built is changing too. Monolithic, mainframe-based systems are being replaced by distributed, Web-centric, component-based systems with an open architecture. Ideally, business process reengineering should entail the adoption of new software systems designed to satisfy the new needs of the redesigned business. However, economic and technical constraints make it impossible in most cases to discard the existing and legacy systems and develop replacement systems from scratch. Therefore, legacy system migration strategies are often preferred to replacement. This entails that a balance must be struck between the constraints imposed by the existing legacy systems and the opportunities offered by the reengineering of the business processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transitioning from a mining to meaning perspective in organization data mining can be a crucial step in the successful application of data mining technologies. The purpose of this paper is to examine more fully the implications of that shift. The use of data mining technology was part of our cycle time study of the Poplar County Criminal Justice System (a fictitious name). In this paper we will report on the use of data mining in the Poplar County Criminal Justice System (PCCJS) study in an attempt to speed up their case handling processes. Marketing and finance researchers are more involved with “simple” (i.e., direct) relationships, whereas BPR researchers are more concerned with long chains of interacting processes. This difference appears in the tools these researchers use: marketing and finance researchers are more interested in set-theoretic problems, BPR researchers, in graph-theoretic problems. Yet data mining technologies incorporate graph-theoretic algorithms. Consequently, they should be able to support hypothesis generation in BPR activities. We were able to come up with relevant and meaningful hypotheses for BPR in the PCCJS system by using data mining technology, specifically sequential pattern analysis: “Which areas we should look into in order to speed up the case handling process?” This valuable outcome would have not been possible without data mining technology, considering the large volume of data on hand. It is hoped that this study will contribute to broadening the scope of applicability of data mining technology.</jats:p>"

If such organizations area of activities are financial and project management, integrity, consistency and security become the key factors for information system development and implementation. The article presents results of the analyses, development and implementation of n-tier Oracle-based information systems for a NGO. Organizational and management problems, current technological infrastructure, financial resources availability, software platforms and developers solutions, local and headquarter offices requirements were analyzed. The systems were developed within the following requirements: financial and management information confidentiality and appropriate availability improvement and systems integration; organizational information and procedure standards development; incomplete and inconsistent information elimination from the data flow; transparency of the projects activity for public evaluation and information technology resources utilization by the non-for-profit, academic and NGOs for the project activity within Internet components. The first system prototype was presented at the European Foundations Center (EFC) Information Technology Conference in Brussels, Belgium, 24-25 June 1999. During 2000-2001, the system was migrated into Oracle Portal environment and development process was completed.</jats:p>"

Taking a broad perspective on financial accountability, this article assesses not only the quality and availability of the financial data, but also the entire financial–reporting model. The article develops a framework for thinking critically about nonprofit financial accountability. After examining the current structure of nonprofit financial reporting and contrasting it with alternative systems developed for other industries, the article concludes with recommendations for reengineering nonprofit financial accountability.</jats:p>",

However, critical debates on these efforts typically fail to discern a number of significant issues. Many such reengineering efforts involve an intermingling of three distinctively different organizational paradigms: a professional paradigm characteristic of traditional higher education organization, a bureaucratic machine paradigm representative of traditional business organization, and an innovative or “adhocratic” paradigm defended by its proponents as a timely alternative to traditional bureaucratic organization. This intermingling typically is carried out in a fashion oblivious to the nuances of organizational design and with little or no attention to the conflicts likely to result. Continued neglect of these issues, however, will condemn proponents of higher education adhocracy to problems in the future. </jats:p>",
