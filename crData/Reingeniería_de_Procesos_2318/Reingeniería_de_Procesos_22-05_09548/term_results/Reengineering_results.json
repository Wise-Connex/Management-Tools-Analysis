      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyses the topology of a regional power system distribution grid. This research improves the efficiency of the electric power system's operation by using upgrading the redesign (reengineering) methods of topological structures within distribution grids. The research object is an electric power system that consists of generation, transmission and distribution parts and requires reengineering. The subject of research is the re-engineering of the topology of the power system distribution grid. To achieve the research purpose, modifications of k-means algorithm as well as the small step algorithm based on the statistical analysis, clustering and minimum spanning tree development methods of Prim and Kraskal are used. The modifications described in this paper allow for optimization of the network based on user needs, properties of the operating grid elements, and other additional constraints for flexibility and generality. Given the varying parameters, this method provides the means to redesign parts of the distribution grid, keeping its certain elements safe from displacement, but also the means to redesign the whole distribution grid, including changes to the number and location of transformer substations and transmission lines. Conclusions. To solve the problem of determining the territorially close groups of consumers in the paper, it was proposed to use the k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm allows us to divide consumer sets into clusters, so that coordinates of their centres will be recommended as locations of transformer substations. The modernization of the k-means algorithm was proposed by developing procedures for adding and combining clusters using different strategies for determining starting centroids. Based on this, a method for reengineering the topological structures of regional electric power systems in terms of the possibility of their fundamental restructuring was developed. The results of this research may be useful to various enterprises, organizations or institutes dealing with the elaboration or design of electric power system development on the corporate, regional or local level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INCOM Egypt has undergone automation in some processes where critical aspects of its operations are transformed and automated. This paper presents an overview of INCOM Egypt processes using Ould Riva and analyses the process of ‘handling a product’. It aims to demonstrate effective automation of the production of wires and cables process accompanied to Industry 4.0 while considering environmental and economic sustainability goals that were inhibited by COVID-19 restrictions. Ould’s Riva method is used to analyse the production process of wires and cables to propose improvements for automating the process. Business process modelling is utilised to study the processes for clearer understating. The flow of information within the process is also analysed to integrate the production process with other processes and supply chains, which helps to identify which production activities can be automated and mainstreamed into the information flow to achieve environmental and economic sustainability. The context of INCOM Egypt, as a case study, is presented along with the Riva model of its operations. The paper identifies the before, i.e., As-Is process, and after, i.e., To-Be Process, automation of the ‘handle a product’ process using the Role Activity Diagram (RAD). The process involved redesigning and improving different activities to increase resource-use efficiency to participate in achieving the goals of sustainability. The focus of this paper is to investigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and to examine the accomplishments of process automation of wire production towards environmental and economic sustainability. The results of the research reveal a relationship between business process modelling and sustainability. Moreover, automation of processes (Industry 4.0) is found to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19 on production. A triangulation between process modelling, process automation (Industry 4.0), and sustainability was determined. Each one is reinforcing and impacting one another. The RAD model demonstrates that automation of the activities in the process reduces waste, time, cost, and redundant processes as factors of sustainability, which may also help to lessen the unfavorable effects of the pandemic. The results proved generalisation on other organisations in the same line of business.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article considers the development of integration mechanisms as a direction of strategic management in the implementation of procedures for reengineering business projects. The basis for reengineering is certain production and commercial processes - business projects, which are separated from the general business structure of the company to ensure partial involvement of innovative tools to generate and implement appropriate algorithms for reengineering and strengthen action on specific market activities. Theoretical developments on outlining the possibilities of ensuring the competitive development of business projects through the involvement of tools in the field of management, the formation of various models of organizational structures and areas of attracting financial resources are presented. It is proposed to build a reengineering model for projects through the basis of technological development, organizational development and market development. Prospects for the integration of organizational and management system through a set of tools and taking into account the results of their interaction are outlined. The directions of attraction of financial resources to business projects are presented, possibilities and prospects of project financing are defined, formation of a portfolio for increase of investment attractiveness, attraction of crediting mechanisms are considered. Recommendations for involving the integration mechanism of business project reengineering are developed and algorithms of procedural implementation are presented with definition of features of introduction of risk management models. The article provides a theoretical basis and formulates practical proposals for effective development of business projects on the basis of reengineering and activation of market behavior. Market activity of business entities in the implementation of individual projects is based on the prerequisites for the creation of internal key competencies and external market success factors by strengthening the innovative orientation of business in the current uncertainty of economic systems.

However, life-threatening cardiotoxicity of many TKIs has become a major concern. Ponatinib (ICLUSIG) was developed as an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL oncogene and is among the most cardiotoxic of TKIs. Consequently, use of ponatinib is restricted to the treatment of tumors carrying T315I-mutated BCR-ABL, which occurs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and confers resistance to first- and second-generation inhibitors such as imatinib and nilotinib. Through parallel screening of cardiovascular toxicity and antitumor efficacy assays, we engineered safer analogs of ponatinib that retained potency against T315I BCR-ABL kinase activity and suppressed T315I mutant CML tumor growth. The new compounds were substantially less toxic in human cardiac vasculogenesis and cardiomyocyte contractility assays in vitro. The compounds showed a larger therapeutic window in vivo, leading to regression of human T315I mutant CML xenografts without cardiotoxicity. Comparison of the kinase inhibition profiles of ponatinib and the new compounds suggested that ponatinib cardiotoxicity is mediated by a few kinases, some of which were previously unassociated with cardiovascular disease. Overall, the study develops an approach using complex phenotypic assays to reduce the high risk of cardiovascular toxicity that is prevalent among small molecule oncology therapeutics.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Newly developed ponatinib analogs retain antitumor efficacy but elicit significantly decreased cardiotoxicity, representing a therapeutic opportunity for safer CML treatment.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
