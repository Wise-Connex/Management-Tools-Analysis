      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Background and Aims:</jats:title><jats:p> Monitoring and a continual improvement of turnaround time (TAT) in urine examination and reporting is essential for improved management of laboratory quality as well as ensuring patient satisfaction. TAT can be impacted by multiple factors, some of which appear to be beyond the control of laboratory, especially the preanalytical phase of urine examination such as specimen collection, transportation and sample preparation. The aim of the study was to compare the preanalytical variables like TAT for transportation and incidences of spill between our current urinalysis workflow process and the new urinalysis workflow process using a pneumatic chute-compatible closed urine collection system. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Materials and Methods:</jats:title><jats:p> This observational prospective study was conducted on 4/9/23 from 9 am to 4 pm at the laboratory of Apollo Main Hospital, Chennai. Pneumatic chute compatible closed urine collection cup was given to the patients in Group-A and normal screw cap containers which we are currently using were given to the patients in Group-B. Once the urine samples were collected in the respective containers, they were transported to the laboratory using pneumatic chutes for Group-A samples and manual carry for Group-B samples. Analysis of transportation time using the new collection method (Group-A) when compared with the current method of practice (Group-B) was done. The incidence of spillage was also monitored. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> A significant improvement was noticed in the transportation process and spill incidence with closed collection devices through the pneumatic chute. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title><jats:p> To conclude, the implementation of pneumatic chute compatible closed collection tubes for urine improves the transportation and processing time, eliminates the manual carry of urine samples, eliminates the incidences of leakage and spillage, reduces errors and reduces the exposure of urine to healthcare workers, thereby leading to significant improvement in patient care, patient experience and staff satisfaction. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In an era where sustainability is paramount, understanding the environmental impact of digitalizing business processes is critical. Despite the growing emphasis on sustainable practices, there is a lack of comprehensive methodologies to evaluate how digitalization impacts environmental sustainability compared to traditional processes. This paper introduces a carbon-aware methodological framework specifically designed to assess the sustainability of business process reengineering through digitalization. The Digital Green framework quantitatively analyzes the environmental costs associated with digital transformation, ensuring that truly sustainable digitalization results in lower resource consumption relative to the complexity of the process being digitalized. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the framework was applied to a case study involving the reengineering of an administrative process at a small university in southern Italy. The case study highlighted the framework’s ability to quantify the environmental benefits or detriments of digital transformation, thus guiding organizations toward more sustainable digital practices. This research contributes to the field by offering a concrete tool for aligning digitalization efforts with ecological sustainability, and by paving the way for integration with initiatives such as the Green Software Foundation’s Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specifications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Aerial cable car construction has boomed across Latin America’s urban edges. The reinvented gondola lift has circulated as a prototype to remake the city’s peripheries from the inside out. Drawing on ethnographic research on the construction of a first urban cable car line in Bogotá, Colombia, I conceptualize cable car urbanism as a form of socio-technical, political, and aesthetic retrofit. As an emergent interface for material and epistemic practices, the urban gondola lift embodies a logic of governance based on the continual adjustment of and tinkering with existing socio-spatial realities. At the same time, it constitutes a platform for ongoing reinvention and reconfiguration from below. Tracking this interplay between official engineering and grounded autoconstruction critically illuminates the limits and promise of the politics of infrastructural retrofitting. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This research investigates the synthesis and evaluation of cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) composites with surface‐engineered boron nitride nanosheets (BNNs) at various concentrations. The study focuses on the impact of Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on BNNs′ surface functionalization to improve their dispersion within the COC matrix, including its dielectric behavior, dielectric breakdown strength, thermal management capabilities, hygroscopic properties, and mechanical robustness. The methodological approach adopted for the fabrication of COC/BNNs hybrid composites commenced with the synthesis of BNNs, surface functionalization of BNNs, in‐situ mixing and hot‐press. This step aimed to enhance compatibility and adhesion between BNNs and the COC matrix, facilitating more homogeneous nanofiller dispersion. The investigative scope of this study encompassed a rigorous evaluation of the resultant composites, with a particular emphasis on their dielectric properties. The dielectric constant (ϵ′) and loss tangent (δ) were measured at a frequency of 10 GHz, revealing an ultra‐low dielectric constant of 1.28, an exceptionally minimal loss tangent of 0.000146, a remarkable 327% (In‐plane) &amp; 129% (axial) increase of thermal conductivity, significant improvement of dielectric breakdown strength up to 88.4 mV/mm, and low water absorptions observed. These results indicate the potential of COC/BNNs composites for high‐frequency electronic packaging applications requiring low dielectric constants.</jats:p>"
