The management initiatives that organizations are taking in response to today's imperatives are focussing directly on people instead of technologies or processes. Organizations are discovering that their competencies lie not in particular products or product categories, but in unique expertise or the knowledge pool of their people. They are realizing that reengineering alone will not succeed unless the right people with appropriate set of skills are placed in the process. </jats:p>",
