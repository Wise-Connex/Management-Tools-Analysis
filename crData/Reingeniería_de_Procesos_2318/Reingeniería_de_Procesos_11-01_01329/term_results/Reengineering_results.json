      "abstract": "<jats:p>Legacy systems, from a data-centric view, could be defined as old, business-critical, and standalone systems that have been built around legacy databases, such as IMS or CODASYL, or legacy database management systems, such as ISAM (Brodie &amp; Stonebraker, 1995). Because of the huge scope of legacy systems in the business world (it is estimated that there are 100 billion lines of COBOL code alone for legacy business systems; Bianchi, 2000), data reengineering, along with its related step of program reengineering, of legacy systems and their data constitute a significant part of the software reengineering market. Data reengineering of legacy systems focuses on two parts. The first step involves recognizing the data structures and semantics followed by the second step where the data are converted to the new or converted system. Usually, the second step involves substantial changes not only to the data structures but to the data values of the legacy data themselves (Aebi &amp; Largo, 1994).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>A green environment is a social as well as business issue. Business enterprises, as a large part of the global community, are obliged to make endeavours toward an environmentally sustainable operation that reflects their corporate social responsibility. One of the effective approaches of making business operations more environmental friendly is to undertake business process reengineering with the strategic focus on green perspective. This paper discusses the reengineering of a green business from its process viewpoint. This reengineering of business processes is undertaken in the context of five areas of green business characteristics (necessary, effective, efficient, agile, and measureable) and their corresponding life cycles. This analysis paves the path for an in-depth research agenda for developing and operating green business processes in organizations. The framework is explained with five key phases namely, 1) examining business processes with green process characteristics, 2) integrating business processes with the environmental standards, 3) green business process redesign, 4) training programs development and change management, and 5) performance monitoring and process improvement. The paper concludes with a suggestion of the framework validation and future research directions.</p>",

The proposed process utilizes an ultrahigh fidelity model of individual aircraft by tail number, a Digital Twin, to integrate computation of structural deflections and temperatures in response to flight conditions, with resulting local damage and material state evolution. A conceptual model of how the Digital Twin can be used for predicting the life of aircraft structure and assuring its structural integrity is presented. The technical challenges to developing and deploying a Digital Twin are discussed in detail.</jats:p>"
