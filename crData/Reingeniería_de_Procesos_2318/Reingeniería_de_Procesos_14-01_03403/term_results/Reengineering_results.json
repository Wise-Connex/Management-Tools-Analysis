The component based modeling serves as a tool for collecting requirements of an Information System in user perspective and business perspective at various stages of software development. The chapter presents a methodology for component based modeling and development of an Information System, starting from the requirements definition phase, arriving at candidate components and creation of final components and their interfaces. The methodology aims at clarifying the intricate details and usage of an Information System via business type models and use-case models. The chapter presents the interaction diagrams in order to describe interactions among objects in systems perspective, and context diagrams for reflecting upon the business domain. Finally, the chapter proposes component replacement as a methodology for system reengineering, and model-view-control framework for component refinement and evolution in order to achieve a reengineered information system that reflects upon current requirements in business domain. The reengineering techniques proposed in this chapter can be applied to legacy systems to turn them into a component-oriented reengineered system.</jats:p>"

Although the de facto standard for describing object-oriented systems is the Unified Modeling Language (UML), many legacy systems have been documented using non-object-oriented structured analysis and design methods. Problems arise in the migration because non-object-oriented documentation is inherently not conducive to the development of object-oriented systems. This chapter presents a set of rules to automate the conversion of systems which were originally modeled using structured techniques to UML. The newly created UML documentation can then be used in developing an object-oriented equivalent system. The UML model may also be used by computer aided software engineering tools to implement a new system. The reengineering rules are tested on an example structured system to demonstrate their viability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Several authors and researchers have questioned the effectiveness of business process reengineering (BPR) as a holistic organizational approach especially after the demise of giant organizations all over the world. However, at a time of economic turbulence and uncertainty, BPR becomes instrumental in helping organizations reengineer existing processes and optimize them to better stay competitive and accelerate business. This paper addresses this criticism and proposes a framework that encompasses key factors that must be considered in any BPR initiative in order to ensure its success. As well as providing executives with a practical guide to consult when starting, planning, implementing and controlling the different activities needed to complete a reengineering project. The paper also identifies and elaborates on the key success BPR factors: 1) Organization wide commitment, 2) BPR team composition, 3) Business needs analysis, 4) Adequate IT infrastructure, 5) Effective change management, and 6) Ongoing continuous improvement. These key factors are presented in light of supporting literature.</p>",

This unique system decouples the application development framework from the backend infrastructure, effectively relieving the development and growth constraints inherent in the legacy system. In a novel approach for an academic library, genealogists participated in the user-centered, iterative approach used to prototype, develop, and test the user interface. The resulting system promoted productivity gains by enabling programming staff to work in parallel from specialized areas of expertise. A post-project review process identified a number of lessons learned, including the importance of representing the requirements and priorities of internal and external stakeholders. The review process also informed an application development model that may be useful to other digital libraries.</jats:p>"

Understanding the link between process reengineering, technology assessment of enabling technologies and risk management allows user acceptance and patient safety improvements. Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (INT), offers a good example of process reengineering driven by the purpose of increasing patient safety, enabled by new technologies. A pillar of the evolution of ICT process support at INT is based on Radio Frequency Identification technologies, implemented to identify and trace items and people across processes.

It attempts also to involve teachers as designers in the engineering process of a TEL system development and to support their activity of auto-regulation regarding the students’ guidance and assistance. This aim leads to improve teaching strategies as well as to enhance the quality of the learning objects and the learning scenario itself. In fact, if the TEL system is already adaptive, by means of this approach, its improvement is fostered. If not, the process will support its iterative transformation from predefined to adaptive. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology is used since it gives educational designers (teachers for this proposal) and software designers the ability to define, communicate, and test a solution while creating artifacts that become part of the overall solution. The Usage Tracking Language (UTL) has been developed to provide the actors of a TEL system (designers, tutors, learners, and analysts) with a dutiful tool to describe the observed uses of the descriptive pedagogical scenario and their semantics, including the definition of the observation needs and the means required for data acquisition. The structure of tracks and their transformations from raw data allows the calculation of indicators which supports the building of users’ models that will influence users’ decision making. Finally, a case study using the Hop3X environment for learning Java programming to apply this process is presented.</jats:p>"
