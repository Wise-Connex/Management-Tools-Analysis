      "abstract": "<jats:p> We surveyed industries to determine what factors trigger reengineering, the nature of reengineering projects, common causes of failure, some guidelines for reducing the chances of failure, and ways to minimize losses incurred while recovering from failed projects. Improving enterprise integration is essential to improving system performance. The advances in information technology make achieving integration feasible even in very complex systems. Decision makers, instead of striving to achieve local objectives can optimize extended value-added functions that include co-related customers. They can optimize entire supply chains reaching to end customers (both internal and external). Petrinets, tools for simulating complex systems, provide a useful frames for iteratively optimizing supply chains. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A case study conducted in a British company (Company A) on reengineering business processes is presented. It gives an example on how a case study ought to be written in order to go beyond the standard for writing an industrial report to one that is acceptable by academic peers. A good case study ought to contain information that readers can use in replicating the experiences gained and lessons learnt in future endeavours under similar settings. When a collection of good case studies is available to a practitioner or researcher he could formulate his plan for the future and avoid “re‐inventing the wheel”. This is most important to research in operations management because it lends a hand in the building up of a theory in POM to make an impact in its natural settings.</jats:p>",

An element schema, which is created and defined using HTML tags categorizes the user interface and information elements presented on Internet storefronts. In order to explore the rule that elements play in characterizing popular and unpopular Internet storefronts, an analysis of the distribution of elements within the best and worst Internet storefronts was conducted. After extracting the elements underlying the construction of the best and worst Web-sites, a prototype storefront was reengineered to demonstrate the derived principles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s competitive business environment, organizations are being challenged to improve performance by improving processes, minimizing costs, and increasing output. Such changes can only be made by looking beyond traditional management systems. Continuous improvement (CI) and total quality management (TQM) have been the focus of recent quality improvement initiatives. However, in many ways, the results have not been as dramatic as desired. Business process reengineering (BPR) focuses on innovation and creativity in redesigning processes in an effort to meet customers’ needs and expectations. Experience using nonlinear systems theory in applied health care settings has revealed that nonlinear science does offer a practical new frame of reference for BPR initiatives. This article describes why radically different approaches are necessary to sustain continued quality improvement, provides the key practical insights offered by nonlinear systems theory, and provides a clinical example of multidimensional thinking as applied in an acute care setting. </jats:p>",
