      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business Process Reengineering (BPR) became an important strategy for improving operational efficiency and effectiveness across various industrial sectors. In the era of globalization and increasingly fierce competition, companies were required to continuously innovate and enhance their operational efficiency. One approach that proved effective in achieving these goals was BPR. The purpose of this study was to present a comprehensive literature review on the implementation of BPR in various sectors, focusing on analyzing the factors that influenced the success and impact of BPR implementation. The research method employed was a literature review that explored the application of BPR in different contexts, including the creative economy, product distribution, healthcare, education, and the aviation industry. A literature review was conducted on 15 published studies from 2019 to 2024. The research showed that BPR focused not only on reducing costs but also on improving service quality and customer satisfaction. By utilizing information technology and collaborative approaches, companies overhauled their business processes to achieve better results. The findings of this review provided insight into the challenges and opportunities faced by organizations in implementing BPR, as well as recommendations for best practices in its implementation.</jats:p>"

These\nsingle veterans were buried using traditional inground burial methods. Over time, these graves\nhave deteriorated due to lack of maintenance and\nare scattered across the country, making planned\nreburial (secondary burial) challenging. To meet\nenvironmental and burial management needs, the\ngovernment has been planning exhumation and\nreburial annually. The Veterans Affairs Council\nneeds to conduct statistical surveys and process\nreengineerin studies to balance budget savings and\nenvironmental concerns, addressing the burial\nissues of early single veterans. This study designs a\nposthumous handling model and explores the\nfeasibility of budget savings and process\nreengineering through in-depth expert interviews,\nproviding policy recommendations. The study\nsuggests handling the ashes through sea burial and\nenshrining the memorial tablets in the Veterans’\nShrine to reduce storage space and achieve\ninformation management. Currently, exhumation\nand reburial operations rely mainly on private\ndonations, and it is recommended that the\ngovernment establish special funds to support these\nefforts. Promoting eco-friendly burial methods,\nsuch as sea burial, and providing legal protection\nand operational guidelines are also advised.\nStrengthening public education and advocacy to\npromote the advantages and importance of ecofriendly burial methods is crucial. These\nrecommendations aim to save budget, improve\nefficiency, and promote environmentally\nsustainable burial practices</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reengineering is a radical process to redesign existing business processes with the aim of enhancing performance, quality, and efficiency. Reengineering can assist manufacturing companies in adapting to the challenges and opportunities in the era of Industry 4.0, characterized by digitization, automation, and system integration. This article aims to examine the reengineering strategies of manufacturing companies in the Industry 4.0 era, focusing on the implementation of information technology and innovation. The research method utilized is literature review, which involves collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing information from various relevant sources such as journal articles, books, reports, and websites. The research findings indicate that reengineering in manufacturing companies in the Industry 4.0 era involves several steps: (1) identifying and understanding existing business processes and customer needs; (2) determining the vision, mission, and objectives of reengineering; (3) redesigning business processes utilizing information technology and innovation, such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and 3D printing; (4) implementing new business processes involving all stakeholders, including employees, management, suppliers, and customers; and (5) evaluating and monitoring the performance and impact of reengineering. This article also discusses some of the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of reengineering manufacturing companies in the Industry 4.0 era</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Methods. The study is based on the use of the following methods: classification of retail enterprises by logistical, territorial and organizational characteristics; a system approach to designing logistics networks; discrete and continuous modeling for optimizing the distribution network. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of corporate strategies and market conditions that affect the design of distribution networks. Results. The study showed that reengineering of business processes in retail trade contributes to the formation of competitive distribution networks. The analysis of classifications of retail enterprises was conducted and tools were proposed for their rational grouping, taking into account the assortment, regional features and organizational structure. It was determined that the implementation of modern logistics strategies allows reducing service costs, improving the quality of customer service and ensuring flexibility of logistics processes. The proposed approaches contribute to adaptation to changes in the market environment, which is especially relevant in conditions of growing competition. The main factors influencing the choice of modeling methods are identified and recommendations for building optimal logistics networks are developed. Novelty. A comprehensive approach to designing logistics networks is proposed, which combines simplified and complex modeling methods for effective resource management. Special emphasis is placed on the integration of corporate strategy with logistics processes and taking into account changing market conditions. Practical value. The results of the study have significant practical value for retail enterprises that seek to increase their efficiency in a dynamic market. The proposed modeling methods allow reducing transportation and warehousing costs, as well as optimizing inventory levels. The use of modern approaches to designing logistics networks contributes to an increase in the level of customer service and increasing their loyalty. Recommendations for choosing logistics strategies can be applied not only in retail trade, but also in other sectors of the economy where optimization of logistics processes is necessary. The implementation of the proposed approaches allows enterprises to adapt to changing market conditions, increase the efficiency of resource use, and ensure long-term sustainability of business.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to explore how the scope of the external audit function has changed with digitalisation, analyse the changes in working practices within audit firms, assess the extent and implications of the skills gap created by digitalisation among external auditors, and investigate the influence of digitalisation-driven technological advancements on the success of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) initiatives in audit firms. Using a qualitative case study approach, data was collected through structured interviews with manager-level auditors, associate-level auditors from one of the Big Four audit firms and representatives from its client companies. The collected data was analysed thematically. The research reveals that while the core scope of external auditing remains unchanged, digitalisation significantly alters working practices. Notably, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have improved as a result of these changes; however, a widening skills gap among auditors has emerged as a new challenge affecting KPIs. These findings hold practical value for audit firm partners and managers, enabling them to establish novel operational standards and goals while proactively addressing the identified skills gap through targeted upskilling initiatives. Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the under-researched interplay between digitalisation, BPR, and the external audit function, shedding light on the critical role of technological advancements in ensuring BPR success within audit firms.</jats:p>"
