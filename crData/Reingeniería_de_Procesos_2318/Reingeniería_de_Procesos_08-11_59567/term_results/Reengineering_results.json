In this paper, a flexible business process modelling, simulation and reengineering (BPMSR) approach is presented. Modelling starts with precisely defining model objectives and boundaries, and carrying extensive data analysis. Simulation modelling allows testing and analysis of different scenarios to understand their impact on a broader “system” and evaluate feedback before moving forward with reengineering implementation plans. The need for a flexible and adaptive methodology is stressed to augment efficiency and effectiveness of reengineering cycle.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Flexibility and adaptability in the reengineering cycle are effective to identify early modelling incompatibility and simulation defects. It adds intelligence to BPMSR and accommodates for any technical or process changes that may subsequently arise. This approach is reliable for future process improvement or reengineering endeavours due to its flexible configuration, which can be adapted to both radical or incremental change.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>New prevention strategies for use in developing countries are urgently needed to curb the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic. The N-terminally modified chemokine PSC-RANTES is a highly potent entry inhibitor against R5-tropic HIV-1 strains, with an inhibitory mechanism involving long-term intracellular sequestration of the HIV coreceptor, CCR5. PSC-RANTES is fully protective when applied topically in a macaque model of vaginal HIV transmission, but it has 2 potential disadvantages related to further development: the requirement for chemical synthesis adds to production costs, and its strong CCR5 agonist activity might induce local inflammation. It would thus be preferable to find a recombinant analogue that retained the high potency of PSC-RANTES but lacked its agonist activity. Using a strategy based on phage display, we set out to discover PSC-RANTES analogs that contain only natural amino acids. We sought molecules that retain the potency and inhibitory mechanism of PSC-RANTES, while trying to reduce CCR5 signaling to as low a level as possible. We identified 3 analogues, all of which exhibit in vitro potency against HIV-1 comparable to that of PSC-RANTES. The first, 6P4-RANTES, resembles PSC-RANTES in that it is a strong agonist that induces prolonged intracellular sequestration of CCR5. The second, 5P12-RANTES, has no detectable G protein-linked signaling activity and does not bring about receptor sequestration. The third, 5P14-RANTES, induces significant levels of CCR5 internalization without detectable G protein-linked signaling activity. These 3 molecules represent promising candidates for further development as topical HIV prevention strategies.</jats:p>",
