      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, most companies or organizations can select a number of methodologies to improve their business processes, which include Six Sigma, Lean Thinking, Lean Six Sigma, Business Process Reengineering, Total Quality Management, Kaizen and Poka-Yoka. However, selecting an appropriate methodology has to be guided by the organization’s objectives. In this respect, the BPR is one of the best methodologies that can help organizations to ensure the continuity of their businesses so they will remain relevant for a long time. More importantly, the BPR can help members of organizations to rethink about their existing practices such as to introduce significant improvements to their business process. Based on a literature review, the researchers carried out a comparative analysis on four leading methodologies, namely BPR, Six Sigma, Lean Thinking, and Kaizen. The comparison of the methodologies were based on 11 aspects, namely the concept, effect, use of information technology, focus, involvement of workers, degree of change, level of risk, creation of a study, model, duration, and cost. In addition, the researchers elaborated the six phases of the implementation of BPR. The comparative analysis revealed that the BPR was the best among the four methodologies analysed, as it could help radically and holistically improve the overall business process of an organization. Thus, organizations that need such a change in their business processes can adopt the BPR as the most appropriate methodology than can help bring the intended improvements to their workplace.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A Software engineering is an approach to software development. Once software gets developed and delivered, it needs maintenance. Changes in software incur due to new requirements of the end-user, identification of bug in software or failure to achieve system objective. It has been observed that successive maintenance in the developed software reduces software quality and degrades the performance of software system. Reengineering is an approach of retaining the software quality and improving maintainability of the software system. But the question arises “when to reengineer the software”. The paper proposed a framework for software reengineering process using decision tree approach which helps decision makers to decide whether to maintain or reengineer the software systems.</jats:p>"
