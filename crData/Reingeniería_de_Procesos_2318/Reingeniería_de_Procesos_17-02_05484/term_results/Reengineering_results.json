      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRAKSetiap organisasi yang menyediakan pelayanan menginginkan layanan yang berkualitas. Untuk meningkatkan kualitas pelayanan, perlu dikatahui terlebih dahulu berbagai kekurangan yang ada selama ini. Berdasarkan kekurangan tersebut dapat disusun langkah-langkah praktis untuk mengantisipasinya. Salah satu cara untuk memahami proses bisnis layanan PKL adalah dengan analisis proses bisnis (APB).Analisis proses bisnis (APB) mempelajari dan memahami bagaimana aktifitas dan fungsi dari suatu proses bisnis dapat berjalan sesuai dengan pencapaian tujuan organisasi. Untuk memahami suatu proses bisnis maka digunakan beberapa peta proses bisnis dengan menggunakan beberapa standar, antara lain: ANSI (American National Standart Institute) dan ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). Dari peta proses standar ASME dapat dihitung kinerja proses bisnis dengan menghitung efisiensi throughputnya. Dengan diidentifikasinya beberapa kekurangan dalam proses bisnis maka dilakukan langkah-langkah peningkatan dan penyempurnaan desain ulang proses bisnis yang baik dan efektif.Hasil akhir dari penelitian ini adalah rekomendasi desain ulang proses bisnis (Business Process Reengineering=BPR) yang meningkatkan efisiensi troughputnya dari 31,97% pada proses sebelumnya menjadi 85,15% berarti kinerja dari proses rancang ulang dan birokrasi proses bisnis menjadi lebih sederhana.Kata Kunci: APB, BPR, efisiensi troughput, layanan PKL, ANSI, ASME, TI</jats:p>"

However, cancer data are often unavailable for months to years after diagnosis, limiting its utility.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>The objective of this study was to identify the barriers to rapid cancer reporting and identify ways to shorten the turnaround time.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>Certified cancer registrars reporting to the Indiana State Department of Health cancer registry participated in a semistructured interview. Registrars were asked to describe the reporting process, estimate the duration of each step, and identify any barriers that may impact the reporting speed. Qualitative data analysis was performed with the intent of generating recommendations for workflow redesign. The existing and redesigned workflows were simulated for comparison.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>RESULTS</title>\n                        <p>Barriers to rapid reporting included access to medical records from multiple facilities and the waiting period from diagnosis to treatment. The redesigned workflow focused on facilitating data sharing between registrars and applying a more efficient queuing technique while registrars await the delivery of treatment. The simulation results demonstrated that our recommendations to reduce the waiting period and share information could potentially improve the average reporting speed by 87 days.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>Knowing the time elapsing at each step within the reporting process helps in prioritizing the needs and estimating the impact of future interventions. Where some previous studies focused on automating some of the cancer reporting activities, we anticipate much shorter reporting by leveraging health information technologies to target this waiting period.</p>\n                </sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the emergence of global players, the Indian banking industry is facing fierce competition not only at its homeland but also with the international market. Due to continuous changes taking place in information technology, preferences of customers and competition, there is a need to redefine the mission objectives and process of the organization, so that the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization can be improved. While State Bank of India continues to dominate the Indian banking industry and its profits continue to grow, it is coming under increasing competitive pressure. The flattening of the world as a result of networking, information technology and globalization, necessitates SBI to bring out the drastic change in its procedural activities and redesign its business process. Business Process Reengineering aims at making the processes to be focused on producing the desired results. It also aims to be efficient by optimally using the available resources, to be cost effective by minimizing overall costs and should be adaptable by being able to adapt the changing customer and business needs. The present study focuses on business process reengineering interventions implemented in State Bank of India and the changes in the organization structure with special emphasis on Agra branches. The broad objective of the study was to relate the concept of Business Process Reengineering as a tool to enhance the competitive strength of State Bank of India and to improve its functioning to a world class level.</jats:p>"

As a metabolite-channeling multi-enzyme complex it acts as a complete nanomachine due to its unique geometry and by coupling a cascade of catalytic reactions using ‘swinging arms'. Mammalian and specifically human PDC (hPDC) is assembled from multiple copies of E1 and E3 bound to a large E2/E3BP 60-meric core. A less restrictive and smaller catalytic core, which is still active, is highly desired for both fundamental research on channeling mechanisms and also to create a basis for further modification and engineering of new enzyme cascades. Here, we present the first experimental results of the successful disintegration of the E2/E3BP core while retaining its activity. This was achieved by C-terminal α-helixes double truncations (eight residues from E2 and seven residues from E3BP). Disintegration of the hPDC core via double truncations led to the formation of highly active (approximately 70% of wildtype) apparently unordered clusters or agglomerates and inactive non-agglomerated species (hexamer/trimer). After additional deletion of N-terminal ‘swinging arms’, the aforementioned C-terminal truncations also caused the formation of agglomerates of minimized E2/E3BP complexes. It is likely that these ‘swinging arm’ regions are not solely responsible for the formation of the large agglomerates.</jats:p>",

To ascertain the basis for the arginine sensitivity of CcNAGK, residue E19 which located at the entrance of the Arginine-ring was subjected to site-saturated mutagenesis and we successfully illustrated the inhibition-resistant mechanism. Typically, the E19Y mutant displayed the greatest deregulation of l-arginine feedback inhibition. An equally important strategy is to improve the catalytic activity and thermostability of CcNAGK. For further strain improvement, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify mutations that improve CcNAGK. Results identified variants I74V, F91H and K234T display higher specific activity and thermostability. The l-arginine yield and productivity of the recombinant strain C. crenatum SYPA-EH3 (which possesses a combination of all four mutant sites, E19Y/I74V/F91H/K234T) reached 61.2 and 0.638 g/L/h, respectively, after 96 h in 5 L bioreactor fermentation, an increase of approximately 41.8% compared with the initial strain.</jats:p>",
