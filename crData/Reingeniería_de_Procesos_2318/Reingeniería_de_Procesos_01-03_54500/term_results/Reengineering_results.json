      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today’s business world is facing a plethora of managerial and technological changes which are beyond the capacity of any firm to control or absorb. Customer satisfaction, development of new products, and introduction of new technologies are well‐known driving forces, but their fast mutation and turmoil are making them unpredictable. Companies have to radically alter their strategic and process goals to keep up with this volatile market. In this turbulent environment, business process reengineering (BPR) has evolved as the most promising approach for designing organizations. It is extremely important for reengineers to understand the “driving” forces in this environment. One of the most important and fundamental drivers is understanding the goals (goal mapping) of the organization. Typically the goals of organizations are derived from the “voice of the customer”. In this paper we address a procedure by which optimum level of goal mapping can be considered in the preliminary stages of BPR. A cost optimization model for goal mapping is proposed using an example from the Space Shuttle Testing Facility at the SSC‐National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of a large scale change approach, namely Reengineering, as a method of implementing change in the further education (FE) sector in Northern Ireland (NI). Case studies on 17 FE colleges in NI provided a valuable source of material on how a process‐based Reengineering project can be applied to an FE college. A comparative analysis of the key change issues facing FE colleges and the key elements of business process reengineering (BPR), revealed a commonality in key areas namely: customer focus – a key element of BPR and an imperative for the FE sector; an emphasis on designing and improving key business processes – a key element of BPR and a goal for FE colleges due to internal restructuring caused by incorporation; fundamental change – an essential key tenet of BPR and a key requirement in the FE sector; critical success factors – a key BPR implementation issue covering factors unique to the FE sector that must be addressed for the successful implementation of change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Many existing refractory fabric fire booms will deteriorate quickly in use and may require frequent replacement in a large-scale burn operation. These problems can be minimized, or even eliminated, by using a highly durable and fire-resistant material in the pocket of the boom where the highest heat and stress loads exist.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this project, an existing, large stainless steel boom was reengineered to reduce its size, weight, and cost. The large boom was designed, constructed, and tested successfully in the early 1980s; however, because of the rigorous criteria used for the original design, it is expensive, heavy, and cumbersome to deploy. The project was completed in nine phases:The existing boom was redesigned to reduce its cost, size, weight, and handling problems, and to make it compatible with existing boom systems.A prototype section of the reengineered boom was constructed for testing.The boom was tested in Lake Erie to evaluate its towing and sea-keeping characteristics.The prototype was tested at OHMSETT to quantify its oil-containment capability.Three hours of burn tests in waves were conducted in a diesel fire at the U.S. Coast Guard Fire and Safety Test Detachment in Mobile, Alabama.Postburn tow tests were performed at OHMSETT to confirm the containment capability of the boom after the diesel-fire exposure.Three hours of burn tests in waves were carried out in enhanced propane flames at OHMSETT.Destructive testing was used to estimate the operational life of the flexible connector sections, and the tensile strength of several key load-bearing components.Finally, the design of the boom was refined, and final detailed engineering drawings and a report were produced.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The boom passed all tests. The final design is presented in the paper. The boom may be purchased commercially from Applied Fabrics Technologies, Inc.</jats:p>",
