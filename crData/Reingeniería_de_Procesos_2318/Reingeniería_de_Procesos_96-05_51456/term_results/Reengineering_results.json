This article reports on a study of management in organizational transformation for 20 privatized industrial companies in Russia and describes the changes in their control structures and strategies. Organizational and economic factors determining the establishing of specific control arrangements and their impact on business reengineering are analyzed by synthesis of surveys and case studies. Implications for western partners and suggestions for further research are drawn.</jats:p>",
