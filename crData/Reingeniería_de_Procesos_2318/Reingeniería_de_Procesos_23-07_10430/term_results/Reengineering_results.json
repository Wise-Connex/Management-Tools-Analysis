      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Mulyoagung Village Office is a community service office in Mulyoagung Village. One of the services offered at the Mulyoagung village office is a system for making ID cards at the village office using the SiPeduli Desa website, but after analyzing the percentage of throughput efficiency obtained is still 30.85%. There are several processes that require a long waiting time and also manual processing processes so that this condition is still less efficient. Therefore, changes in business processes need to be made to improve the old system that is currently running into a more optimal system. This significant change in business processes is called Business Process Reengineering. The concept of reengineering was born to solve the shortcomings of the old system or legacy system in a business process. Completion of a business process with Business Process Reengineering is done by eliminating processes that do not provide added value and changing manual processes into automated processes by utilizing information technology. The results of this study are business process designs that increase throughput efficiency from 30.85% in the previous process to 89.61% in processes that have been carried out by Business Process Reengineering. The application of Business Process Reengineering can help provide the design of a new business recommendation model that is obtained after an analysis of old business processes and analysis of redesign alternatives is carried out. Business Process Reengineering is also able to improve old processes both in terms of service and speed.</jats:p>"

The incorporation of digital health into medical service process reengineering (MSPR) marks a pivotal transformation and restructuring of conventional health service delivery models. Specifically, the application of MSPR to blood sampling services processes reengineering (BSSPR) holds promise for substantially enhancing the efficiency and quality of medical services through streamlining and optimizing these procedures. However, the comprehensive impact of BSSPR has been infrequently quantified in existing research.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>This study aims to investigate the influence of BSSPR on the efficiency and quality of medical services and to elucidate the key informative technological support points underpinning BSSPR.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>Data were collected from both the new and old laboratory information systems from August 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021. A combination of statistical description, chi-square test, and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; test was used to compare check-in time and waiting time of outpatients before and after the implementation of BSSPR. An interrupted time-series design was used to analyze the impact of BSSPR on medical service efficiency and quality, enabling the control of confounding variables, including changes in medical human resources and both long- and short-term temporal trends.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>RESULTS</title>\n                        <p>BSSPR had an impact on the efficiency and quality of medical services. Notably, there was a significant increase in the number of patients receiving blood sampling services, with a daily service volume increase of ~150 individuals (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.04). The average waiting time for patients decreased substantially from 29 (SD 36) to 11 (SD 11) minutes, indicating a marked improvement in patient experience. During the peak period, the number of patients receiving blood sampling services per working hour statistically increased from 9.56 to 16.77 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001). The interrupted time-series model results demonstrated a reduction in patients’ waiting time by an average of 26.1 (SD 3.8; 95% CI –33.64 to –18.57) minutes. Although there was an initial decline in the number of outpatients admitted following BSSPR implementation, an upward trend was observed over time (β=1.13, 95% CI 0.91-1.36).</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>BSSPR implementation for outpatients not only reduced waiting time and improved patients’ experience but also augmented the hospital’s capacity to provide medical services. This study’s findings offer valuable insights into the potential advantages of BSSPR and underscore the significance of harnessing digital technologies to optimize medical service processes. This research serves as a foundational basis and provides scientific support for the promotion and application of BSSPR in other health care contexts. By continuing to explore and refine the integration of digital technologies in health care, we can further enhance patient outcomes and elevate the overall quality of medical services.</p>\n                </sec>"
