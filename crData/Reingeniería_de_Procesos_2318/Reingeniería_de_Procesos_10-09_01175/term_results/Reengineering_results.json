The proposed changes involve adding another payment station and a new short‐stay ward in the process. Based upon the results, the paper supports the implementation of the changes proposed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>A couple of limitations are recognized in this paper. First, the simulation does not consider varying the capacity of resources and locations involved in the emergency care process. Second, the simulation does not consider patients by clinical disciplines in which they are treated.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The simulation results show that computer simulation can be an effective decision support tool in modelling the emergency care process and evaluating the effects of changes in the process. The results would be helpful to those who are considering reengineering and improving emergency care or other similar processes in hospitals.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Based upon a case study using real‐world data, this paper extends the line of studies on computer simulation in healthcare by considering not only patient wait times in the emergency care process but also some ways to improve patient wait times and their effects on the process.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
