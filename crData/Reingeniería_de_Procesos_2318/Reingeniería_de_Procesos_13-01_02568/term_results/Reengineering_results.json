The objective of this case study is to share experiences in reengineering this introductory computer education course, including experiences with reengineering the content, the delivery method, and the support model in a rapid rollout mode. Specifically, this case study will discuss lessons learned and speculate on the next step for future academic years based on the successes and challenges in teaching this reengineered course to 1,683 students during the 2010-2011 academic year.</jats:p>"

This unique system decouples the application development framework from the backend infrastructure, effectively relieving the development and growth constraints inherent in the legacy system. In a novel approach for an academic library, genealogists participated in the user-centered, iterative approach used to prototype, develop, and test the user interface. The resulting system promoted productivity gains by enabling programming staff to work in parallel from specialized areas of expertise. A post-project review process identified a number of lessons learned, including the importance of representing the requirements and priorities of internal and external stakeholders. The review process also informed an application development model that may be useful to other digital libraries.</jats:p>"
