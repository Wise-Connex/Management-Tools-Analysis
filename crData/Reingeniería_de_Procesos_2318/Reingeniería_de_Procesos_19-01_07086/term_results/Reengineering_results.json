      "abstract": "<jats:p>As practice shows, in conditions of crisis organizational problems and development issues, when accumulated contradictions lead to the competitiveness decline and loss of consumers, it is proposed an application of methods of reengineering, implementing turning around enterprises, organizations, companies through moving to a new quality level and modernization of the previously implemented engineering solutions of the functioning facility. The goal of the work is to find organizational forms of quality transformation of the solutions, having an anthropotechnical genesis (technical, technological, organizational, managerial etc.) through capital construction facility reengineering and technological process reengineering solutions. Literature sources and current construction standards analysis is carried out to implement the goal. Methods of the system analysis and management, comparison, expert evaluation are used. General definitions of the reengineering from Russian and foreign sources are given in the article. Criteria and factors of the reengineering events classification at the «construction facility – construction site» level are justified, the project of capital construction facility and technological process reengineering is set out, the capital construction facility reengineering structure is described, pattern solutions of the capital construction facility reengineering are formed, distribution of the reengineering types according to the stages of the life circle of the capital construction facility is presented. The structure of the capital construction facility reengineering standards is given and perspective directions of the information and analytical support development are indicated in the article. In the conclusion the fact, that reengineering is an effective mechanism of forming a comfort living environment, is justified based on the science and technology achievements, customer inquiry and most complete satisfaction, as well as the creation of the competitive edge of not only separate domestic construction organizations, but also the whole national construction field.</jats:p>"

As Stachokas writes in the introduction, “Libraries are reengineering in terms of their professional skills, organizational structures, collections, systems, tools and assessment in order to provide users with a greater number and more types of electronic resources” (xi). This reengineering is vital as processes used for purchasing and preparing print and other physical materials for use are no longer adequate to handle the increased volume of e-resources acquired by libraries. Reengineering the Library is written for academic library practitioners, and there are several chapters that will be of particular interest to those new to the field of electronic resource management.</jats:p>"

This study elaborates an ICT-enabled reengineering project in the Agency for audio and audiovisual media services in the Republic of Macedonia for the program monitoring process. It aims to investigate the motivation to use ICT as a way to shape the process redesign and find associations among ICT adaptation, process reengineering, organizational growth and efficiency. Hence, the new process structure can help the agency deliver greater public value while meeting its strategic goals to protect citizens' interests in the area of audio and audiovisual media services. It provides an example of a case study that surpasses standard industrial report to an article that contains valuable information that companies, especially in the public sector, can use in replicating experiences while undertaking similar BPR initiatives.</jats:p>",

Virtual reality immersion uses proprioceptive trackers for navigation and stereoscopy in kinesthesia generating compelling experience inside data landscapes. Nowadays, disruptive technologies melting biological, synthetic worlds (data-cyber) and physic spaces (biocybrid systems) allow synaesthetic embodied experience to the Spinozian body. In enactive affective systems, the sentient and pervasive technologies by the invasion of mobile technologies, physiological sensors, computer vision, locative, and geodesic dialogues of organisms/data and environment are in reciprocal and mutual exchanges. The ontology of life conciliates paradoxes and conflicts of emergent realities and self-organizing dialogues between artificial and natural modifying the concept of reality, which is always a philosophical concept. </jats:p>"
