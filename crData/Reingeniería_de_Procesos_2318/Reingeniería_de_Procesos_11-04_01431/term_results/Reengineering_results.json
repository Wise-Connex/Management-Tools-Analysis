      "abstract": "<jats:p>Faced with the impact of increasingly demand of customers, competitions and frequent changes, the contemporary enterprises must carry out deep analysis on the traditional working and organizing ways of enterprises, fundamental rethink and thoroughly redesign the enterprise's business process, integrate a series activities of cross-functional and cross-border involved in the process from the aspect of meeting the demand of internal activities and the needs for external customers. This article first carries out analysis on the workflow technology, life cycle, Business Process Reengineering and implementation stages, concludes that workflow technology can better support all stages of Business Process Reengineering and better realize the process management and control. Finally, this article makes a detailed description on the relevant work, methods and tools of all implementation stages in Business Process Reengineering based on workflow technology.</jats:p>"

Transparent mechanisms to guarantee the safety of patients and the integrity of the research enterprise paired with efficiencies and economies of scale are maintained by centralizing some of the functions. Assigning other responsibilities to more local levels assures flexibility with respect to the size of the clinician networks and the changing needs of researchers.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",
