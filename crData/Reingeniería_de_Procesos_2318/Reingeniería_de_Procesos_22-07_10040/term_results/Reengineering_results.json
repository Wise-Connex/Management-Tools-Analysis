      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article considers the conceptual aspects of the organization of technological reengineering in industrial enterprises. It is noted that technological reengineering is a solution to a number of problems related to achieving the goals of innovative transformations of the production base of the enterprise, which depend on many factors. The content of components of technological reengineering in their interrelation is determined. It is substantiated that, at the preliminary stage of technical preparation for technological reengineering of the enterprise it is expedient to build an approximate mathematical model of the main technological process in order to identify possible options for its improvement and justify the need for technological reengineering of the entire technological system. The usefulness of the reengineering transformation model is substantiated. It is substantiated that most decisions on innovative technological re-equipment of production on a reengineering basis cannot be made out of connection with other aspects of the enterprise, including the logistics aspect. The role of logistics reengineering in these processes is shown.   It is substantiated that at domestic enterprises these issues are not always considered as part of a single production process. As a result, the successful implementation of the goals of one of the types of work on the innovative transformation of production can often be to the detriment of others, which requires additional tasks. The general technological audit is aimed at solving this problem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Most public service institutions are generally different in design and operation compared to several years back. The advances in technology and consumer demand have resulted to public institutions adjusting periodically. New technological development has pushed most governments to modernize their systems in order to address their citizens ' demands for reliable and efficient services. As such, the Huduma Program of Kenya was launched in 2013 as a framework through which, a variety of channels advancing citizen-centric public services are supported through the use of digital technology at one stop centres throughout the country. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of Business Process Re-engineering on service delivery in Huduma centers in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMethodology: The methodology used by the researcher used both quantitative and qualitative through the administration of questionnaires that were used as a data collection tool to study a target population of 51 Huduma Centres across the 47 counties in Kenya and an entire population of 153 respondents working at the management level in all operational Huduma centres in Kenya. Hypotheses were tested using regression analysis and Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation analysis. The study findings were presented in both tables and figures.&#x0D;\nFindings: the study findings revealed that the Huduma centers conduct frequent evaluations of their business processes that affect the delivery of public services they offer. Findings established that Business Process Reengineering practice has statistically significant effect on public service delivery with a p value (0.000) which was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 significance level. The results implied that business process re-engineering is a good predictor of service delivery. The findings have also recognized the role of business process re-engineering as a critical factor affecting one stop shop operations in Kenya. However, there is a need to re-examine the present processes involved, analyze them, and redesign them to be more efficient and cost-effective. These practices must be positive in character in order for citizens to easily use government services. As a conclusion, the results have addressed the knowledge gap in the administration of the Huduma Centres in Kenya.&#x0D;\nUnique Contributions to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommended that to enable institutions to redevelop their business procedures through the acknowledgement of which business processes are obsolete and can be eliminated, group related operations, substitute old machines with others, retain gangways and hold business sectors with high frequency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business process reengineering (BPR) has been widely known for its effectiveness in generating chances for organizational improvement. Understanding and modeling the relationship between the factors that contribute to the BPR and organizational culture (OC) is critical for the success of its implementation. This paper introduces a fuzzy-based analytical hierarchy process, named FAHP, for integrating the factors affecting BPR with OC to ensure the BPR’s success. First, a real case study was conducted to investigate the operational effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach. Then, the BPR factors were validated and prioritized by a panel of experts from the American Society for Quality (ASQ) members network-Qatar chapter and a group of quality directors in Qatar. On the other side, the OC factors were investigated via a systematic literature review. Finally, an analytical correlation study was conducted to understand the relationship between the corresponding factors better. The correlation analysis study has shown that the organizational strategy, leadership, and transfer of knowledge are highly correlated with respect to people, innovation, and supportiveness. The team orientation, outcome orientation, and attention to detail factors have a medium correlation with the BPR factors. Moreover, the aggressiveness showed a weak correlation with all the BPR factors. The outcomes of this study provide decision-makers with guidelines for successful integration of the BPR and OC factors to ensure effective implementation of the BPR initiatives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article outlines the conceptual issues of technological reengineering of problematic machine-building enterprises. Special attention is paid to production reengineering as the most attractive mechanism of innovative transformations. The essence and types of reengineering components are considered. Technological reengineering is offered as the basic tool of restoration of the domestic machine-building enterprises which have suffered during a pandemic and the military conflict in Ukraine. Investment policy is seen as the basis for transformation. It is noted that the main problems in the economy of Ukraine and, in particular, in machine-building enterprises are not limited to business processes, but rather lie in the plane of the principles of formation and functioning of modern technological processes. The solution to the problem of accelerating the development of new industries should be sought in the integrated use of innovation methodology. Accordingly, technological reengineering is considered as an effective mechanism for rehabilitation of problem enterprises based on a radical change in the technologies used. It should be carried out in combination with innovative engineering, organizational redesign of production relations and management system, social reengineering, business process reengineering and logistics reengineering. In fact, we are talking about purposeful innovative transformations in the production and technological sphere of competitively problematic enterprises.</jats:p>"

Following the rapid development of smart health care, the Joint Commission of Taiwan hopes to engage in interdisciplinary cooperation, process integration, and talent training to enable healthcare institutions to meet the goals of developing medical technology, ensuring patient safety, and establishing smart hospitals. Interdisciplinary cooperation allows technology to be customized to meet medical demands; process integration involves work processes being merged with information processes and quality control being practiced so that technology can meet clinical needs; and talent training entails cultivating personnel who can realize interdisciplinary cooperation, process integration, and team communication. Technology or systems are expected to make health care more valuable. By identifying and solving technology and system problems, a safe healthcare environment can be created.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n                    </jats:p>",
