      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We investigate the reengineeering of interbank networks with a specific focus on capital increase. We consider a scenario where all other components of the network’s infrastructure remain stable (a practical assumption for short-term situations). Our objective is to assess the impact of raising capital on the network’s robustness and to address the following key aspects. First, given a predefined target for network robustness, our aim is to achieve this goal optimally, minimizing the required capital increase. Second, in cases where a total capital increase has been determined, the central challenge lies in distributing this increase among the banks in a manner that maximizes the stability of the network. To tackle these challenges, we begin by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization model for the network’s redesign. Finally, we apply this framework to practical examples, highlighting its applicability in real-world scenarios.</jats:p>",

Bu bağlamda organizasyonların etkililiğini ve verimliliğini artıracak, yönetsel anlamda bir dinamizm katacak yeni yaklaşımlar ortaya çıkmıştır. İşte bu yeni yaklaşımlardan biri de değişim mühendisliğidir. Bu kapsamda değişim mühendisliği, organizasyonların iş akışı verimliliğini ve üretkenliğini artırmak için organizasyona katma değer katacak süreçlerle organizasyon yapısının hızlı ve radikal bir şekilde yeniden tasarlanmasıdır. Nitel araştırma tarzında oluşturulan bu çalışmada, değişim mühendisliğinin en belirgin örneklerinden biri olan dünyaca ünlü Japon otomotiv markası Nissan’ın 1999 yılında Ghosn ile başlayan yükseliş hikâyesi ele alınmıştır. Bu dönüşüm hikâyesinden yola çıkılarak değişim mühendisliğinin Türk eğitim sistemine uygulanabilirliği, eğitim sistemimizde son dönemde (1999-2023) yapılan değişiklikler ve yenilikler çerçevesinde değerlendirilmiştir. Sonuç olarak Türk eğitim sisteminde son zamanlarda yapılan değişiklikler ve yenilikler umut verici, ancak değişim mühendisliği adına yeterli değildir. Bu durumun temel nedeni ise Türk kamu yönetiminin dolayısıyla Türk eğitim sisteminin yönetimsel ve örgütsel yapıdan kaynaklanan sorunlarıdır.</jats:p>"

Here we establish a general guest packaging system based on an artificial protein cage, TRAP-cage, the disassembly of which can be induced by the addition of reducing agents. In this system, TRAP-cage with SpyCatcher moieties in the lumen was prepared using genetic modification of the protein building block and assembled into a cage structure with either monovalent gold ions or molecular crosslinkers. The resulting protein cage can efficiently capture guest proteins equipped with a SpyTag by simply mixing them in aqueous solution. This post-assembly loading system which circumvents the exposure of guests to thiol-reactive crosslinkers, enables packaging of enzymes possessing a catalytic cysteine or a metal cofactor while retaining their catalytic activity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The etymology of the term \"reengineering\" was studied, which means a set of methods that the company uses to design and redesign the business in accordance with strategic requirements, where the key aspect is the improvement of the financial condition. Under the influence of digitalization, companies must constantly change in order to meet the needs of consumers and be competitive. At the same time, it is important to model, analyze and redesign complex and outdated business processes that do not meet modern requirements in the conditions of fierce competition on the world market of products and services.&#x0D;\nThe article considers the issue of formalization of reengineering stages, at which business processes are selected and evaluated, taking into account the impact of digitalization on them. A methodology for choosing business processes based on the examination of the most important success factors is proposed. The choice is made on the basis of the analysis of the integral assessment of business processes, taking into account the variability of many experts.&#x0D;\nA formalized methodology for the first stage of business process reengineering is presented, which pays attention to organized interaction between company specialists and consultants. This approach is designed to reduce the subjectivity of business process assessments, compensating for individual eliminations and increasing the objectivity of the assessment.&#x0D;\nThe formalized nature of the methodology, as well as versatile analysis, including the reasoned reasoning of specialists and managers, contribute to increasing the validity of the decisions made regarding the reengineering of business processes. This is important in order for the changes developed in the processes to be the most effective and meet the strategic goals of the enterprise.&#x0D;\nAdherence to these principles can help create a more reliable methodology for business process reengineering, providing more accurate and informed assessments, and therefore more effective process improvements</jats:p>"

The peculiarity is that the directions and trends of digitalization are grouped in accordance with the stages of the life cycle of construction objects. The necessity of re-engineering the administrative-management interaction of construction participants has been identified, since the organizational structure of projects undergoes changes under the influence of digitalization, and accordingly the organizational and economic management mechanism of construction participants, in particular engineering companies, undergoes changes. &#x0D;\nIt was revealed that a great influence on the change of the principles and structure of administration of construction projects is carried out thanks to the use of systems of integrated management of construction projects, which are based on the use of VIM technologies. An overview of the modern software market was carried out. It was found that today the software market is filled with a large number of programs that are used to solve various problems of designing and transforming digital support in construction. The most common are software complexes for VIM design, automated general purpose design, design of building structures and geotechnical calculations, development of estimate documentation, development of calendar plans. Currently, all major developers of software complexes Autodesk, Trimble, SchneiderElectric, Graphisoft, etc. implement BIM technology in their products. &#x0D;\nIt is suggested that, when building the organizational and economic mechanism of modern engineering companies, take into account two main factors of the influence of digitalization in construction: the introduction of BIM technologies in the activities of design, construction and engineering companies, supported also at the state level, and digitalization of all processes related to the creation of a construction object - from obtaining technical conditions and urban planning restrictions to putting the facility into operation. </jats:p>"

Based on the process approach and methods of strategic analysis, SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), the key company success factors were identified, an enlarged business model of “Mosenergo” was built and analysed, followed by the selection of the most preferable business process. With the help of a matrix of criteria, an assessment of business process importance or readiness for the implementation of the selected strategies was made. Key success factors for “Production of heat and electricity” business process were formed. However, in modern conditions, due to the tightening of sanctions imposed by unfriendly countries, the risks of supply disruptions and termination of equipment maintenance are increasing, which causes negative trends in key performance indicators of the selected business process, namely the accident rate and/or the frequency of emergency operation of automatics cases. The set of measures for reengineering the business process “Production of heat and electricity” is based on the idea of automatic technological business process of the company through the introduction of highly effective domestic digital technologies as part of the industry’s digital transformation strategy. The import substitution programme to minimise risks caused by geopolitical events in the world is considered.</jats:p>"

The research method used is mixed-method: concurrent embedded with a service quality measurement method: service performance (Servperf), which is equipped with a customer satisfaction index and an important performance analysis of 200 public service users. PT Pos Indonesia has implemented re-engineering of its business processes, especially by implementing information technology and digital transformation to improve the quality of its services. Based on the results of quantitative analysis, the quality of service at PT Pos Indonesia is classified as good, even though it has not yet received complete trust from the public, with public service priorities that must be prioritized regarding clarity of service standards, speed of digital access, ease of use of features and shortcuts in digital applications, politeness, and employee attitudes in providing services. Suggestions that can be given in implementing business process reengineering to improve the quality of service to the public are: increasing the socialization of the company's vision and mission regarding services; paying attention to employee incentives; increasing employee skills to face rapid technological developments and market trends; preparing and retaining the best employees; developing a flexible strategy to meet workforce needs; and realizing transformation, which is the company's action plan.</jats:p>"

Patient-reported experience measures prompted the need to evaluate reasons for prolonged appointment delays. This study seeks to analyze and address patients’ concerns, to streamline the process flow and reduce waiting time for daycare infusion therapy thereby enhancing patient experience. The define, measure, analyze, improve, and control methodology was implemented, and its impact on reducing waiting times was evaluated. The objective is to ensure that &amp;gt;85% of patients enter the daycare infusion unit within an hour of their appointment time in 6 months. The baseline data for patient waiting times was measured for a period of 2 months, and the average waiting time was determined. Potential causes contributing to prolonged waiting times were identified through time-motion analysis, with a fishbone diagram categorizing potential causes and a Pareto chart prioritizing them. Plan, do, study, and act cycles were conducted for implementing the changes, and a new process flow mapped. Baseline data showed 32% average adherence to the defined turnaround time of 1 hour, with an average waiting time of 108 minutes. Forty causes were identified for increased waiting time, of which eight were key. Adherence to waiting time turnaround time improved from 32% to 89% and the average waiting time decreased by 59 minutes from 108 minutes, increasing patient satisfaction index by 7.5%. The balancing measures include an increase in operational efficiency and throughput of the unit and the inventory levels of oncology medicine were decreased, leading to a 50% reduction in inventory value, while medication error declined by 0.62%, improving patient safety. The project gained tangible and intangible benefits impacting staff, patients, and relatives while improving operational efficiency. This study, with its scientific and systematic approach, enhanced patient satisfaction, patient safety, and better utilization of resources.</jats:p>",
