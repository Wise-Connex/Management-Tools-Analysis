      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scientific works produced by tertiary institutions are encouraged to be accessed online and openly through institutional repositories. This is motivated by various regulations from the government to prevent plagiarism and fulfil the public's information needs. The Indonesian University of Education Institutional Repository (UPI Repository), managed by the UPI Library during the COVID-19 Pandemic, experienced problems in providing access to limited collection data. Therefore this study aims to conduct a business process engineering analysis on the UPI Repository limited collection service so that it can be effectively and efficiently accessed by UPI academics so that they can contribute to the learning process. The business process reengineering analysis method refers to the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach. The results of the research are that there are additional features in the UPI Repository, namely Full-text reading services, SSO login features, and Full-Text data display on-screen access features. Changes in the design of the business process have resulted in a reduction in the process, namely VPN access, before the UPI Repository. There has been an increase in users of the Read Full Text on Screen service after the new design changes were implemented.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business Process Reengineering needs to be carried out in line with technological developments and changes in the environment. The goal is to modify procedures, systems, structures, responsibilities, and skills. the need for technology and the importance of increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of the organization or company in the face of organizational change. This article aims to classify, identify scientific publications and conduct a thematic analysis of the current literature in order to create an extensive and detailed understanding of Business Process Reengineering. The research method used is a systematic mapping study (SMS) to examine scientific publications produced from time to time, focus, locus, the type of research that is most widely investigated, as well as the most widely used research method. The SMS procedure follows established empirical guidelines and mapping data relies on the Scopus electronic database. Based on the results of SMS on research in the field of rural banks, it is known that there are 40 studies that meet the inclusion criteria. We classified 40 articles in topic areas by category of paper type, method, focus, locus, and year of research publication. Then, categorized and quantified current studies are generated on various dimensions, a summary of topics, and current research trends.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: To reform the transfer process of surgical patients, standardize the transfer process, and improve the quality of safe transfer; unify the intrahospital transfer process to achieve standardized management; ensure patient safety, improve work efficiency, and reduce the occurrence of adverse events. Methods: A transfer team was formed, a handover record sheet for surgical patients was designed, and the workflow and specifications for handover and transfer of surgical patients were formulated. Results: After using the re-designed handover record sheet for surgical patients and improving the procedure for transferring surgical patients, the accuracy of surgical patient handover was ensured, the handover and transfer time was shortened, and the surgical turnover rate improved. Conclusion: By designing and reforming the service model, it is possible to change and standardize the transfer process of surgical patients and improve the quality of safe transfer, the operating room management system so that it is more rational and humanized, the management model, the working environment, as well as the overall quality and efficiency of operating room nursing.</jats:p>"

As the construction industry is experiencing a paradigm shift towards digital transformation, this study focuses on providing a specific application toolkit for the implementation of digital technologies and the activities of construction sector enterprises and in particular engineering companies.It was found that the creation of the Unified State Electronic System in the field of construction made it possible to transform the business processes of construction organization and management, administration of construction projects, interaction of construction participants, including design enterprises, general contractors, customers, development companies, subcontractors, suppliers of construction materials, products and structures, engineering companies and other construction stakeholders.The services of engineering companies that they can provide during the implementation of construction projects and various stages of the object's life cycle are given, engineering companies are suggested to use digital and VIM technologies to optimize their organizational and management structures and business processes, demonstrating that digitalization serves as a catalyst for improvement key aspects of organizational and economic management. It explores the integration of digital tools and technologies into project planning, resource allocation and financial oversight, offering a detailed understanding of the transformative impact on traditional construction management practices.The article aims to help participants in construction and engineering companies navigate the challenges and opportunities that digitalization opens up, offering practical recommendations for integrating digital tools into existing management structures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Curriculum reengineering, web-based technology acquisition, and job creation among Nigerian tertiary institution graduates were all examined in this research. The researchers used a descriptive survey design following the quantitative research approach. The study included all Nigerian graduates eligible for national service or its exemption who earned their diplomas or degrees between 2016 and 2021. The data was gathered via an online survey titled \"Curriculum Re-engineering, Acquisition of Emerging Technologies, and Job Creation Questionnaire (CRAETJCQ). To assemble the data for this study, we used a snowball method. There were 4,874 replies countrywide after four months of data collection; however, only 4,628 responses satisfied the data analysis conditions after screening out irrelevant responses. Results indicated low curriculum reengineering in Nigerian postsecondary institutions. Nigerian graduates had a poor adoption of new web-based technologies but are increasingly using them for word processing, graphics, data science and data analysis. Nevertheless, only a few graduates employed emerging techs for other purposes (such as printing, YouTube video creation, course design and development, software development, digital marketing, online advertising, and consumer outreach). Although 58.30 per cent of graduates reported having not created any job, 41.70 per cent have done so between 2016 and 2021. Of the 1,930 graduates who owned at least one small or medium enterprise, 58.96% had no employees, whereas 41.04% had hired at least one employee between 2016 and 2021. The graduates' job creation index was estimated to be approximately 50% using a new formula. Based on these results, conclusions and recommendations were made.</jats:p>"
