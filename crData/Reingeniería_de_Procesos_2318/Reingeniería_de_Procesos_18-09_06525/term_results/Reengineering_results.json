      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research task is the improvement of scientific principles and development of a methodical approach to the modelling of enterprises’ development scenarios that apply business process reengineering in order to increase the level of competitiveness. The urgency of the research. The relevance of further researches is determined by the fact that the practical implementation of scientific approaches in Ukraine has not become popular, and the aspects of business process reengineering have been implemented only fragmentarily. Target setting. The development and discussions of procedural, systemic, and synergetic approaches to enterprise development have determined the concept of business process reengineering. Therefore, the further development of methodical principles for the realization of business process reengineering in the practice of business management is urgent and relevant. Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. The justification of the expediency of using the tools for business process reengineering through the modelling of the future results at Ukrainian enterprises requires further scientific development. Materials and methods. The historical-evolutionary method was used to investigate the essence and origin of the category of reengineering and to distinguish its main features. By means of analysis and synthesis, the conceptual bases of business processes reengineering are determined. Implementation of complex, systemic, and synergetic approaches as a basis for application of business process reengineering allowed developing a modelling methodology for forecasting scenarios of the level of competitiveness of a business unit. The application of a systematic approach is reflected in the consideration of the impact of external and internal factors on the enterprise, complex factor – in combination of factors with the criteria of the enterprises managing that are able to compete in the world market, as well as the application of method at different levels – macro, meso, and micro. Methods of economic modelling and forecasting were used for forming a model of forecasting of the level of enterprise competitiveness. Results. The main features are segregated and a method for modelling of the results of its implementation is formulated. The algorithm of modelling of development scenario as a result of the application of reengineering is developed. A model for predicting of the level of competitiveness for the Ukrainian economy is constructed as well. Practical implications. The brilliant examples of corporations that received the “second breath” as a result of the introduction and reengineering of processes were General Electric, Toyota and Chrysler, Kodak, Siemens Nixdorf Service, IBM Credit. The proposed methodological approach can be applied by enterprises to predict the level of competitiveness of an enterprise as a result of the introduction of business process reengineering, depending on possible costs and target commodity output. Value/originality. Such a method of forecasting the competitiveness of an enterprise as a result of business process reengineering is important and can be used to predict the level of competitiveness at all levels of management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Software development advances focus on productivity of existing software systems and quality is the basic demand of every engineering product. In this paper, we will discuss the complete re-engineering process with aspects of forwarding, reverse and quality assurance mechanism. As we know the software development lifecycle (SDLC) follows a complete mechanism of the engineering process. In forward engineering, we tried to follow selective main phases of software engineering(data,requirements, design, development, implementation).In reverse engineering, we move backward from the last phase of developing the product as it gathers requirements from the implemented product(implementation, coding, design, requirements, data). During reengineering, we add up more quality features on customer demands, but the actual demand is to fulfill quality needs that can be assured by external as well as internal quality attributes such as reliability, efficiency, flexibility, reusability, and robustness in any software system. We discussed a methodological approach to move from re-engineering to the journey of quality assurance. More than 50 studies come into discussion and throughput results proposed by graph and tabular form. We can say if the re-engineering process produces quality attributes, then it can be said by old software system refactoring as code refactoring, data refactoring and architectural refactoring we obtained a quality product at a lower cost instead of new software system development, which causes a decrease in quality attributes as cost, time etc. In future work, testing methodology can be proposed for quality assurance.</jats:p>"

Optimizing laboratory turnaround time (TAT) ensures timely delivery of chemotherapy, which potentially translates into improved patient outcomes and satisfaction. In this study, we aimed to reduce the laboratory TAT for key laboratory tests to optimize the timely administration of chemotherapy.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>TAT data for complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) included specimen collection to receipt (Col-Rcv), specimen receipt to result release (Rcv-Res), and the overall TAT from specimen collection to result release (Col-Res). Work flows were reconfigured to transport CBC specimens directly to the hematology laboratory after collection and to treat all CMP samples from chemotherapy clinics as urgent [i.e., shortest turnaround time (STAT)]. From the CMP, total bilirubin and creatinine—the 2 key analytes for liver and renal toxicity assessment before chemotherapy drug administration—were analyzed on ABL 800 whole blood analyzers to further improve the laboratory TAT.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>CBC showed a significant reduction in the median (Col-Res) TAT to 16 min (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). For CMP, by processing all specimens as STAT samples, the median (Col-Res) TAT was reduced from 74 min to 54 min (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), and it was further reduced to 9 min (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) for total bilirubin and creatinine.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Careful work flow analysis and reengineering of preanalytical and analytical process for key laboratory tests significantly reduced median overall TAT to &amp;lt;20 min, which helped facilitate more timely delivery of chemotherapy, without necessitating the construction of a satellite laboratory.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
