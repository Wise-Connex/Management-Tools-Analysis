      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper represents a summary of the studies conducted for the development, design and evaluation of several Turkish shipyards' expansion programs. In each case, depending on the availability of usable area, existing equipment, machinery and investment limits, different considerations and scenarios needed to be generated. During the study, definition of the scope of work and the terms of preference, perceived ship construction logic and capacity requirements are presented and discussed, leading to the selection of the overall layout amongst various alternatives. During the plant design and evaluation of selected equipment within the pre-set production targets, various industrial engineering techniques have been extensively used. Among the most important of these are the specific studies for line balancing of block production, and simulation of new steel fabrication plant. The semi-automated flow type module construction plant was developed for maximizing the throughput and work efficiency in a controlled environment. This study indicates that, under proper operation conditions, it is possible to convert an existing shipyard into a third-generation shipyard by a careful application of modern computational tools and through the adoption of an innovative approach.</jats:p>",
