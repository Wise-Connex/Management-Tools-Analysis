      "abstract": "<jats:title>The multidimensional approach to marine industry development: Part I. Obstacles and willingness to the EU marine industry reengineering</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The paper consists from two parts and generalizes traditional approaches to innovative transformations in various sectors of the EU marine industry. It is shown that shipping companies should permanently adapt and keep their business in sync with marketable changes and be ready to competitive struggle within the global economy. The critical solutions are determining the functional parameters of merchant ships at earliest stages of theirs structural designing, as and reengineering. Author offers a conceptual framework of the co-evolutionary approach to reengineering maritime transport. This problem-solving approach examines targeted ships in topological aspect as the multilayered configurations composed of various-of-a-kinds components, and in functional aspect as multicoalitional compositions. Basic attention focuses on identification of various constrains to innovative activity and choice of improvement strategies, for turning the European marine industry into the high competitive system. For completeness, in paper are presented three particular measures for an estimation of maritime transport success.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we propose a conceptual and operational framework for process reengineering (PR) in higher education (HE) institutions. Using a case study aimed at streamlining exam scheduling and distribution in a distance learning (DL) unit, we outline a sequential and non-linear four-step framework designed to reengineer processes. The first two steps of this framework – initiating and analyzing – are used to initiate, document, and flowchart the process targeted for reengineering, and the last two steps – reengineering/ implementing and evaluating – are intended to prototype, implement, and evaluate the reengineered process. Our early involvement of all stakeholders, and our in-depth analysis and documentation of the existing process, allowed us to avoid the traditional pitfalls associated with business process reengineering (BPR). Consequently, the outcome of our case study indicates a streamlined and efficient process with a higher faculty satisfaction at substantial cost reduction.</jats:p>"

Having successfully e-enabled customer facing processes, the UK government is now working towards reengineering and e-enabling back office processes and information systems to facilitate more joined-up and citizen centric e-government services; these efforts are referred to as the transformational stage of e-government or T-Government. This paper seeks to explore what T-Government means to local authorities in the UK and what process related challenges have to be overcome to successfully implement transformational change in local government.</p>",
