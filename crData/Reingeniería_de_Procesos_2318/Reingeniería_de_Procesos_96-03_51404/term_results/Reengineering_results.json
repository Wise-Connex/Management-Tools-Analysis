      "abstract": "<jats:p>When Albemarle Corporation was created as a $2.2 billion spin off of Ethyl Corporation's specialty chemical businesses in 1994, president and COO Gary Cook found himself at the helm of a company that lacked viable strategies for growth. Its production processes were driven by tradition, not the marketplace. Manufacturing and R&amp;D barely communicated, and no one spoke to marketing. Worst of all, no one paid attention to the customer. Clearly radical change was in order, and the order of the day in 1994 was reengineering. Learning as he went, Cook discovered what he called the “seven really obvious” truths about the much maligned, often mismanaged, and sometimes successful practice of reengineering.</jats:p>",

Also known as Business Process Redesign, Process Innovation, and various combinations of these keywords, it has become the subject of best-selling books, a new practice area (sometimes trademarked) for consultants, a phenomenon upon which most business academics feel they should have a view, and a growing endeavour in many companies. The protagonists seem convinced that it is a new approach to improving business performance even if it may be a synthesis of recent and not-so-recent ideas. The cynics feel that they have seen it before in different guises and stress the apparent naivety of some of the component concepts.</jats:p>",

A formal Quality Improvement Process began in 1982 with an initial focus upon error cause removal, employee involvement, and cross-functional corrective action teams. During the 1980's the program targeted manufacturing processes: statistical process control, just-in-time manufacturing, process capability studies, vendor partnering, and industry QA standards such as ISO 9000. Cost of quality plummeted from over 30% of sales to less than 5% during this period. In 1993 all change efforts were brought under the TQM umbrella and the focus shifted to reengineering the key business processes of the company. This paper will describe in detail how the TQM program evolved from a softer, quality awareness, people involvement process to a very results driven, radical change effort focused upon reengineering the activities, processes and structures of our businesses to reduce cycle times of all business processes, reduce costs, and improve quality and customer satisfaction. We will discuss the change imperative facing our industry and the basic concepts and principles of Business Process Reengineering and Supply Chain Cost Management. This will include a discussion of the benefits of customer/vendor alliances and partnerships and how to eliminate non-value-added activities throughout the supply chain to radically decrease cost and cycle time and improve quality. We will look specifically at two major reengineering efforts underway to dramatically improve the performance of the order fulfillment process and the goods acquisition process. We will conclude that the key to quality improvement and cost reduction in the Age of Systems of the 1990's is to simplify business processes and reduce cycle time. This paper will describe how to use the TQM umbrella to effect this change.</jats:p>",

The case of the City of Pittsburgh is used to argue that capital budgeting processes in many large cities often pose barriers to effective financial management. Design principles of BPR are presented; implications for capital budget management are then discussed. Pittsburgh’s capital expenditure/encumbrance process is used to illustrate implications of BPR for public financial management. By identifying shortcomings in current maps, “future” maps can be constructed that rely on organizational redesign and technology to eliminate steps that do not add value.</jats:p>",

Business Process Reengineering (BPR), it is claimed, was pioneered in a few large corporations in the 1980s (Hammer and Champy 1993). It was first described and explained at the turn of the decade ( Davenport and Short 1990; Hammer 1990) and since then an evolving stream of research has been reported (Caron et al. 1994; Davenport and Stoddard 1994; Grover et al. 1994). This paper reports results from case-study research on relationships between BPR, business strategy planning, and information systems (IS) planning. These questions are particularly relevant due to the rapid escalation in the size and scope of reengineering projects. Our work has been guided by the following questions: How have business process reengineering initiatives evolved in organizations? How has planning for BPR been integrated with strategic business planning? And with IS planning? Is there evidence that the character, scope, and size of BPR projects depends on the degree of integration between BPR, strategic business planning, and IS planning? To what extent has the degree of planning integration between BPR, strategic business planning, and IS affected change management policies and practices in firms undergoing BPR? In approaching these questions we have surfaced a number of definitions of business process reengineering.</jats:p>",

Both can be mutually supportive of each other's objectives. Information architecture design can produce a stable IA capable of supporting existing as well as improved business processes. Reciprocally, business process redesign (BPR) provides a high profile business justification for the IA endeavour. Given proper collaboration between corporate and IT strategic planners, both BPR and IA efforts should produce a number of valuable common outputs. These include the identification of business processes within an organization, the prioritization of these processes based on their strategic relevance, the establishment of process performance measures, and the modelling of these processes and their supporting information resources. A synergistic model of IA and BPR is presented and selected IA techniques and modelling methods are recommended. Future research is suggested concerning the need to test the relationship between BPR and IA. </jats:p>",
