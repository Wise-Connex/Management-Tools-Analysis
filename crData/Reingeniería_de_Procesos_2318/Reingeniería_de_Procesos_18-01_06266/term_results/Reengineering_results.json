In today's context, the need of the hour is to augment knowledge in every sphere to remain abreast of the competitive landscape. On the other hand, with the constant advent of ICT and rapid invasion of internet in the knowledge society, the online delivery models are becoming user friendly, interactive, and dynamic. Universities and colleges face significant constraints in raising revenue, growing classroom capacity, and increasing student enrolments; student graduation rates remain a major concern and graduating students are finding it difficult to find suitable jobs with corporations, who are demanding greater and varied skills and competencies. Online education platforms are constantly evolving as a great savior by providing suitable professional courses to the right aspirants at the right time, at the right place. This chapter is an exploratory study of the role of e-learning platforms, which emerged as one of the major remedies in India's education system. </jats:p>"

The additional argument of the need of reengineering of the heat supplying organizations management is the consideration of the results of their activity, connected with considerable thermal losses. The key provisions of the offered measures for reengineering, based on the creation of processes of information support of management \"from scratch\" are described. Negative changes of the performance of the heating systems of concrete types were estimated q, and thanks to that the new integrated approach to the choice of methods and technical means of diagnostics of engineering systems and analytical dependences of determination of terms of repair were offered. Obtaining of qualitatively new information through reengineering measures for making managerial decisions is considered.

This research aims to propose design improvement of procurement process in insurance company by implementing Business Process Reengineering (BPR) method. Data collection regarding procurement process was collected in one of life insurance company in Indonesia. This research uses BPR method which consist of three steps namely mapping as-is process, analyze as-is process, and modeling to-be process. Mapping as-is process using iGrafx standard Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN). Analyze as-is process by its process time to indicate problems. Modeling process to-be by using BPR best practices that will be prioritized using AHP method and selected using pareto analysis. Scenarios for to-be process then created based on the selected best practices, that will be inputed into the simulation model iGrafx standard BPMN. This research produces three scenarios of to-be process for procurement in Indonesian insurance company that reduce 35-76% of the process time compared to as-is process.</jats:p>"

In order to improving economic development, Taiwan industries hope to shift their business models towards enhancing global brand equity, i.e., transforming their companies into Original Brand Manufacturers (OBM). Increasing competitiveness and successfully pursuing sustainable businesses requires government funding agencies for industrial development to monitor the performances of companies, receiving government funding, with a set of carefully designed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This research develops a set of improved KPIs for repositioning enterprises that enhance their competitiveness across the aspects of OEM, ODM and OBM. The research evaluates the validity of currently used industry performance indicators and measurement methods.

The universal algorithm of calculation of cumulative total opinion of experts of the city district on the basis of a median of Kemeni who allows to order in the most reliable and objective way clusters rankings in the complex multilevel structures representing objects of municipal economy is offered. For receiving reliable results of an indistinct clustering it is necessary to reproduce the specified algorithm repeatedly at a certain number of clusters for various initial indistinct splitting and to compare values of criterion function of indistinct splitting which were received, for the purpose of adoption of the final decision on a necessary indistinct clustering.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Conveniently situated in Parit Raja town which is also known as the “Education Town” in Johor, Universiti Tun Hussien Onn Malaysia (UTHM) is a member of Malaysian Technical University Network (MTUN). In pursuit of turning UTHM as a Green Campus, UTHM has its own ambitious targets for sustainability. It is committed to provide sustainable, efficient, convenient, and safe travel and transport to all students, staffs and visitors. The inception of Sustainable Campus Unit (SCU) in May 2010, showed that UTHM has doubled its green efforts and initiatives to provide sustainable travel and transport in the campus when and where possible. The formation of Strategy in Operation (SIO5): Travel &amp; Transport in the SCU has encouraged active transportation and healthy commuting options in the campus by providing a wealth of innovative green transit options including bus, bicycle, pedestrian, and car. These options indeed will improve the quality of life on campus, strengthens UTHM ties to the neighbouring community, and reduces impacts on the environment as travel and transport system plays an important role on the carbon emission and pollutant level in university. This paper is therefore, trying to discuss some issues, measures and innovative strategies employed at UTHM as an integral part to achieve success in climbing the UI GreenMetric World University Ranking ladder.</jats:p>"
