      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s mobile-driven world, organizations face the challenge of adapting legacy Web applications to pervasive information systems, such as mobile applications, ensuring seamless accessibility across devices. This paper presents a systematic, three-phase approach to reengineering Web applications into mobile applications: Reverse-engineering, Transformation, and Forward-engineering. In the reverse-engineering phase, high-level conceptual models of the Web application are generated to capture its architecture and functionality. During the transformation phase, these models are refined using Unified Modeling Language (UML) profiles to align with the requirements of mobile systems. The forward-engineering phase utilizes the Acceleo technology, along with predefined mapping rules and code patterns, to automate the generation of mobile application code. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, revealing a significant reduction in manual effort throughout the reengineering process. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution for transforming Web applications into mobile applications, contributing to advancements in model-driven engineering and software reengineering.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The object of this study is the technological preparation of the production of a light aircraft wing using reverse engineering technology. The subject of research is a quality indicator – the geometric accuracy of manufacturing the convex-concave parts of aerospace technology. Calculations of geometric accuracy were performed for the program-instrumental method of co-ordination. As the experimental part it was taken the worn out wing tip of a light aircraft. The following results were obtained. An approach for specifying the aerodynamic airfoil and cross sections of the wing tip when constructing its digital model has been proposed. A 3D scanning of the wing tip with the formation of a digital portrait in STL format, as well as its refinement into a STEP format, using organic and mechanical methods, was accomplished. A digital mock-up of the wing tip was built taking into account the geometry of the aerodynamic airfoil in cross sections as well as a digital mock-up of the form (mould) for its manufacture according to the polygonal model, which was created by the organic method due to it had the highest dimensional accuracy. It was determined that the maximum deviation of the actual wing contour from the theoretical one was as follows: the upper deviation was 0.84 mm, the lower deviation was –0.65 mm. The maximum deviation of the actual wing contour from the theoretical one was ±0.3 mm. The expected (calculated) errors did not exceed the specified value of the tolerance on the wing outer contour that equal to ±1.0 mm, thus, the adopted method of assembling the wing under the conditions of co-ordination by the program-instrumental method ensured the specified geometric accuracy. The results of experimental studies confirmed the adequacy of the proposed approach for determining the aerodynamic airfoil of the cross-sections of the digital mock-up of convex-concave parts for aerospace technology during their technological preparation for production with the use of reverse engineering.</jats:p>"
