      "abstract": "<jats:p>Implementing business and manufacturing process reengineering is challenging and poses major issues. The dependence issues between process functions during the implementation phase are the main reason for the high failure rate of process reengineering. The incompetence in identifying the dependence makes existing business process reengineering approaches static for modern business and manufacturing process structures. This paper has implemented a new process reengineering approach called the Khan–Hassan–Butt (KHB) methodology that incorporates the process interdependence algorithm to identify the dependence issues. The KHB method is a hybrid process reengineering approach to identify dependence issues before implementing changes; thus significantly reducing the failure rate of implementing business process reengineering. The KHB method has been implemented in a Bangladesh fabric manufacturing facility. The mapping and verification of the process have been completed using the WITNESS Horizon 22.5 simulation package. The case study has investigated the fabric production process and identified the dependence issues between each function and suggested changes to optimize the process. The outcome has shown significant improvement in production output and process efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article analysis the methodological justification of the digital transformation of logistics processes in transport chains formed by transport and logistics companies at the national and transnational levels, which own their own infrastructure, when switching to the technology of smart contracts. The research methodology is based on the provisions of the theory of logistics and supply chain management, the theory of process management and the design and technological concept of organizational culture formation. Based on the results of the established principles of transition to smart contract technology, digital transformation of processes, a logical and time structure of the methodology of engineering/reengineering of logistics business processes in transport chains was formed during the transition to smart contract technology, which provides the most complete coverage of methodological problems solved in the process of reengineering, their logical focus, as well as correlation with the time frame. The study presents a methodological tool and results of semantic modeling of logistics processes in transport chains that form the necessary basis for further algorithmization of procedures for fulfilling the contractual conditions of a smart contract. Based on the systematization of approaches to establishing the essential characteristics of smart contracts, their models are established, as well as the necessary conditions for the successful implementation of various smart contract models and possible transition scenarios are identified. The materials of the article are largely the result of close interaction with JSC “Russian Railways” in the course of preparing a methodological justification for the transition to the technology of smart contracts in transport chains, the logical processes in which are implemented using the railway infrastructure of JSC “Russian Railways”.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The introduction of advanced technological solutions in modern conditions becomes a paramount problem for industrial enterprises. In relation to Russia where the digitalization of the construction industry is proclaimed, the priority of introducing of information technologies is forming a new goal for the country, the one to join the global process of a new technological revolution. This cannot be achieved without a fundamental re-planning of the key production processes of the construction enterprise. We consider this procedure as “reengineering of production processes”. An approach to assess the validity of the reengineering of production processes of a construction enterprise, implemented with the involvement of an engineering company, is presented. The benefits due to the involvement of an engineering company are given. The proposed approach allows calculating the reengineering console, which makes it possible to make an informed decision on the implementation of the reengineering project by both the enterprise and the engineering company. This study can be demanded by both potential participants in the process, and scientists who conduct research in this area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dealing with problems in complex environments that impede organizational cohesion, information dissemination and coordination is extremely difficult nowadays. Usage of technology without sophisticated information sharing planning and solid processes that serve with a bottom-up approach the needs of each individual within an organization, undermines time, cost and quality of deliverables.  The eG4M (e-Government for Mediterranean Countries)project basically concentrates on extending, completing and improving the e-Model through the achievement of new research results and its application by participating with the support of the Mediterranean Countries (MCs) – in establishing and consolidating their e-Government systems.  This paper focuses on the development of a generic system dynamics model that illustrates the behavior of e-governance systems based on the VSM (Viable Systems Model) as well as the development of a web, collaborative intelligent framework that is built upon the system dynamics model. The framework is meant to have the form of a web-based simulation that is able to identify critical issues related to product, customer, information sharing and service quality using visualizations, automated analytics and impact analysis delivered with natural language format to support the systemic reengineering process, mitigate risk, predict issues during the planning phase and help the user understand complexity and inform his decisions with predictive insights.  Modeling the behavior of an e-governance system and being able to automatically process complex relationships, data and issues upon this system mitigates uncertainty at all levels, increases awareness and understanding of the real world and delivers sustainability and viability, increases growth and sets the basis for process autonomy and better coordination, controls and quality of deliverables.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Nowadays, the operation of production systems common in Russia is no longer relevant. They are already outdated and cannot adequately respond to turbulent global changes, make effective decisions. Also, databases in such systems are isolated and do not interact with other systems. Currently, for enterprises of any industry, automation of information processing and management systems are becoming increasingly relevant. The article presents the project of the enterprise production processes reengineering and its implementation as exemplified by one of the leading enterprises of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, Russia. The procedure includes the development of an automated management system using software products and CASE-tools, the construction of structural-functional models of business processes in AllFusion Process Modeler (BPWin), and simulation using the Arena product. Using the complex of models presented in the article, it is possible to calculate the optimal version of the workflow of the automated control systems under consideration by setting the parameters of the document flow. The introduction of an automated control system allows you to effectively allocate time when processing documents, increase the turnover of funds, and not waste time transferring documents between departments of the branch; less human and material resources are required for the development and maintenance of software. Modeling of production processes reengineering allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the project before making direct changes in the business-core.</jats:p>",
