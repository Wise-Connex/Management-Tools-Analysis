      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes results obtained by experiments on using Moodle for teaching Science and Information Technology. \n\nModern graphical and dedicated languages are used to create content and embed the artifacts in four Moodle courses: Programming Paradigms (PP),  Internet Programming Techniques (IPT), Graphical User Interface Design (GuiD), and Multimedia Techniques (MT). \n\nThe following aspects are detailed and discussed: course format, HTML5 playing, SVG, CSS3, and JavaScript coding. The GuiD &amp; MT courses, in old versions, will be reengineered to meet the new requirements imposed by web 2.0 e-learning technologies. \n\nThe following challenging topics highgliht the efficiency of Moodle: PP(Programming in Python, Programming in Common Lisp, Programming in Prolog), IPT (Client-Server applications, Developing HTML5 complient content, Quality improvement by CCS3, Dynamic behaviour improvement by JavaScript and PHP, Server side applications, distributed data base connections), Guid (Graphical Interfaces in C# and Java, Android applications), and MT (Image standards, Audio-Video standards, Multimedia databases, Multimedia Security). Due to such a large plethora of objects, the Moodle platform is full investigated related on the support offered to build high quality e-Learning content. \n\nInteroperability assurance techniques are considered to import/export content. Not only standards on Multimedia artifacts, but the conformity with e-Learning standards are considered. Many types of resources are used to illustrate both the content of course's units, and the Moodle support. \n\nStatistical results on usage Moodle for Teaching (blended learning classes) two courses (PP &amp; ITP) are presented in order to compare different type of content used for the same class. \n\nPreliminary references:\n1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reengineering Science becomes a major goal to support high quality education in the new Information and Communication Technology millennium. Ubiquitous learning becomes a real life necessity. The new gadgets used by students provide access to Servers offering large resources to be used both for entertainment and education. Recently, technical education makes use of new ICT developments. Not only virtual laboratories but accessing resources available on \"clouds\" are real facts. This paper considers a course in Software Reliability Engineering in order to describe the usage of new technologies to provide a resource available to users connected to servers supporting various formats. Mobile learning is also supported for the mentioned course. The course describes not only fundamentals of the Reliability Engineering, but it presents software reliability models, computer aided software reliability tools (CASRE, SREPT, Frestimate), and case studies. The following formats available to students: HTML5, EPUB and MOBI (to mention only specific formats for ubiquitous learning) make use of various types of objects: text, equations, images, and video. These artifacts were obtained by processing a previous course written in \"Microsoft Word\" with multimedia attached resources. Old multimedia files will be converted to be embedded in the new formats. Preliminary references: 1. Florin Popentiu-Vladicescu, Software Reliability Engineering, Debrecen, 2012. 2.

Then, a simulation model was designed to support the BPR approach. In particular, the model was exploited to assess the performance of the AS IS scenario of the organization, then to investigate numerous TO BE process configurations and evaluate the achievable performance improvements. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – From the study, it emerged that the current efficiency level of the public administration examined has potentials to be significantly improved. For instance, by maintaining its current workforce, the public administration could consider the opportunity of providing additional services to the citizens or to serve citizens from the neighbouring municipalities. Otherwise, the organization could consider a reorganization and reduction of its current workforce, at the same time keeping the service level to its citizens almost unchanged. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Results of this study cannot be fully generalized, since the whole analysis is grounded on specific public administration. Moreover, although the simulation outcomes of the TO BE processes show interesting improvements compared to the AS IS scenario, the TO BE configurations were not (yet) implemented in practice. Therefore, the results provided should be confirmed in future research activities. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The case study allowed deriving some useful guidelines to improve the efficiency of the public administration examined, as well as to identify some TO BE configurations that could be implemented in practice. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Scientific literature includes a limited number of studies that evaluate the efficiency of public organizations in real contexts. Moreover, no studies target public administrations in Italy. Therefore, this case study represents an interesting addition to the literature.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

They need to place better solutions on the market in less time and with lower costs. Companies are achieving these goals of efficiency always more by using the offshoring strategy. It commonly describes a company’s relocation of a business process from one country to another, typically manufacturing processes towards low-cost countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – BRICS area). The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodological approach based on project management tools that supports the decision-making process in order to help companies in optimizing the re-engineering production processes and improve management costs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Primary Health Care in South Africa is being re-engineered to create a model of integrated care across different levels of the health care system. From hospitals to clinics, in the community and in the home, health care will focus more on prevention, health promotion, and advocacy for healthy lifestyles and well-being, in addition to clinical services. We provide a best-practice model of integrating community health workers (CHWs) trained as generalists into a multi-level health system in the Oliver Tambo district of the rural Eastern Cape. Methods: Based at Zithulele Hospital, a health care network between the hospital, 8 clinics, and 50 CHWs has been created. The functions of each tier of care are different and complementary. This article describes the recruitment, training, supervision, monitoring, and outcomes of CHWs who deliver maternal, child health, nutrition, and general care through home visits. Results: CHWs, especially in rural settings, can find and refer new TB/HIV cases, ill children, and at-risk pregnant women; rehabilitate malnourished children at home; support TB and HIV treatment adherence; treat diarrhoea, worm infestation, and skin problems; and distribute vitamin A. CHWs provide follow-up after clinic and hospital care, support families to apply health information, problem-solve the health and social challenges of daily living, and assist in accessing social grants. Case examples of how this model functions are provided. Conclusion: This generalist CHW home intervention is a potential model for the re-engineering of the primary health care system in South Africa.
