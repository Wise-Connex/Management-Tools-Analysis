      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most organizations today are not in need of reengineering their business or operating processes. They are more in need of reengineering their managerial orientation; introducing the right managerial approaches will lead to substantial improvement on the existing base. These organizations would be well advised to adopt a competitive strategy and operate on the basis of the three-stage model, with its promise of success at low risk and minimal investment. The small percentage of organizations (mostly large ones) at the point where their business strategy obliges reengineering focal processes or the business as a whole, would do well to first change their managerial perception by taking a global perspective of the organization, focusing on the essential, and using simple tools. By adopting proven methods such as changing traditional cost accounting procedures and adopting global performance measures, Just In Time, the Theory Of Constraints, the Complete Kit concept, and improving quality, the organization will make short-term gains. In this way, those involved in simultaneously planning reengineering the organization, will be better acquainted with the processes, the market and the people performing the organizational functions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While the BPR (Business Process Reengineering) concept is conceptually appealing, in pratice there are many unsuccessful cases. This study aimed to exhaustively identify and rate: the importance of factors proposed as important for successfully implementing BPR projects in organizations; the extent to which various problems and benefits are being encountered; the extent to which proposed BPR objectives are being included in project plans and are actually being derived; and the impact of BPR projects on specific business processes and on the organization as a whole. Several basic hypotheses regarding the BPR implementation process were tested. Last, based on the results, recommendations are made for managers to focus attention and resources on factors important to success, and to proceed in a fashion which minimizes the risk of failure. In general, organizations are not emphasizing some of the most important activies and tasks recommended in the BPR literature, such as changes to customer/market related business processes, the value-added element of every business activity, and others. On the average, the most commonly encountered problems while implementing BPR seem to be very difficult to address in pratice: making business mistakes under pressure to produce quick results, implementation difficulties due to communication barriers between company sub-units, the unexpected size of the required BPR effort, its disruption to business operations, and others. Based on the findings as a whole, it behooves top managers to engage in BPR projects only as a controlled experiment to strategically reposition the organization.</jats:p>",
