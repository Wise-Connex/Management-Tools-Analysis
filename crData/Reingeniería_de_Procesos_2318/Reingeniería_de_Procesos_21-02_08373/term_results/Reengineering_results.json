There are various dynamic challenges in business environment that must be respond by each organization. Organizational responds for each challenge very decisive to organization’s business sustainability in the future. For now, in this Covid 19 pandemic situation each organization must creative and innovative to change and modify their business model in order to survive. Motorcycle workshop was one of the SME that affected by Covid 19 pandemic, because government policy to restriction activity of people and social distancing. Decreasing customers of motorcycle workshop and to respond the situation bring up the idea to reengineering business model. Home service system was selected as alternative solution to strive for survive in this situation, of course, by implementing a good health protocol. This system was built with a mobile application as a tool in reservation and managing customers service schedules. With this system customers do not have to come and queue at the workshop, so it will be safer in this pandemic situation. Not all services can be served with this system, only minor, moderate and routine repairs that can be served with this system. The payment transaction process is carried out on the spot according to the calculations by the system. With this new business process model, it is hoped that it will be the right solution for consumers and workshops so that they can remain productive in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy. The current article introduces the scientific community with the results of reengineering at the department, which made it possible to implement certain conceptual and fundamental provisions of the dual, digital, and cluster approaches in the development of education. The problem, which resolves the contradiction between the standardization of learning processes by traditional methods and innovative learning processes based on the use of intelligent information technologies, is devised. Based on the analysis of the tendencies in the development of pedagogy methodology, it was concluded that today the methodological paradigms in the science of teaching and the formation of a new methodological paradigm of educology were changed. Cybernetic pedagogy, which combines methods of traditional pedagogy and cybernetics, has had a significant impact on the formation of educalogy. This combination of methods created a support system for the educational processes of the department. The basic theoretical decisions of the department reengineering and results of experimental research conducted based on a support system of educational processes of the department are shown in the article. The results of two full-scale experiments are presented. The purpose of the first experiment was to evaluate the possibility of independent study of science-intensive educational material in the discipline \"Mathematical processing of geodetic measurements,\" and for the second – to evaluate the possibility of creating an intellectual property exchange of scientific-pedagogical and pedagogical workers. Besides, the results of the experimental studies allowed to creation of innovative authoring training technology \"Partnership,\" which provides for participating students in the formation of educational material (tutorials). From the above, it is possible to conclude about the effectiveness of reengineering procedures in the concept of dual and digital education.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>В статье представлен анализ возможностей и практики использования инструментов реинжиниринга административных процессов в органах власти субъектов Российской Федерации на основе опыта Ленинградской области. Приоритетный проект «Реинжиниринг стандартизированных процессов в госуправлении» реализовывался в органах власти данного субъекта в конце 2018 г. в рамках реализации проектов «Госуправление 2.0: оптимальные процессы». Целью исследования является анализ опыта проведения реинжиниринга и его результатов в соотношении с научно-теоретическим и практическим подходом к понятию реинжиниринга. В силу специфических характеристик государственного управления в целом и административных процессов в частности, опыт реинжиниринга в бизнесе не может быть напрямую перенесен на эту сферу. Авторами исследуются основные трудности реинжиниринга административных процессов и ключевые причины возможных неудач его применения органами государственной власти, на базе как теоретического анализа, так и практического опыта реинжиниринга в Ленинградской области. Среди основных трудностей реинжиниринга процессов в органах власти можно выделить: сложность масштабных изменений в государственных структурах; сопротивление сотрудников дополнительной работе и непринятие внедряемых изменений; сложность охвата процессов в органах власти; уровень компетенции управленцев; проблему лидерства и ограниченность ресурсов. При анализе практического опыта Ленинградской области сделан вывод о том, что важнейшими проблемами стали: сопротивление сотрудников изменениям и повышенной ответственности; узость охвата реинжинирингом изменений; трудность выделения требуемых ресурсов для реализации проектов изменений; трудность определения показателей результата деятельности как цели реинжиниринга; ограниченность существующими информационными технологиями, сложность их замены.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>The paper presents a study on practices and capacities of the government process reengineering (GPR) in Russia. The case of Leningrad region’s government is reviewed. A priority project of the standardized government process reengineering was implemented in the official bodies of this region in 2018—2019 (as a part of the implementation of the project “Public administration 2.0: optimal processes”). The aim of this study is an analysis of reengineering experience and its results in relation to the theoretical and methodological basics. Owing to the specific characteristics of public administration in general and the administrative processes in particular, we cannot directly transfer practice of reengineering from business to the sphere of governance. The authors also explore the main challenges of GPR and the key reasons why government can fail it (on the basis of theoretical analysis and practical experience of the Leningrad region). As the major challenges of government processes reengineering we can identify the following: complexity of large-scale changes in the government bodies; the employees’ resistance to additional workload and non-acceptance of implemented changes; difficulties with coverage of the processes in the government bodies; level of competence of the administrative officers; the problem of leadership and limited resources. The study concludes that the main challenges in reviewed case of the Leningrad region are the following: the employees’ resistance to changes and increasing responsibility; narrow scope of changes that GPR projects imply; difficulties in providing the resources necessary for the GPR projects; difficulties in defining the output indicators as a goal of reengineering; constraints of existing information technologies and difficulties in replacing them.</jats:p>",
