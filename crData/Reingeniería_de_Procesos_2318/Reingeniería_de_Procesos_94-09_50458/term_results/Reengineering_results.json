With its emphasis on cross‐functional, top‐down process or system change, the tactic complements total quality management. But even though the results are potentially significant, more reengineering programs fail than succeed. Five factors are critical to the success of a reengineering initiative. This article discusses those factors and offers managers suggestions on how to make sure they get the most from their reengineering efforts.</jats:p>",
