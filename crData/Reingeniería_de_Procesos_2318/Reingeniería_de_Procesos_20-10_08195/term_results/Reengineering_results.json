      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transformative actions in education, driven by the social changes in our contemporary society, aim to adapt individuals to the new socio-economic environment. As a result, the digitalisation of adult education takes on a significant role, in response to the need for constant and less time-consuming training. How does the use of new technologies in adult education contribute to the reconfiguration of learning engineering? The aim of this article is to examine the current transformations in education, better understand the recent developments induced by blended learning and the effects observed in adults. To do so, we conducted a case study on adult learners during the academic years 2018-2020. The experimentation consisted in transforming a face-to-face course into a blended course. The presentation and analysis of the engineering of the blended learning scenario attempts to answer the following question: How does blended learning transform the practices of accompaniment, support or coaching (Papadopoulou, 2020)? As for the analysis of the three questionnaires proposed to the students, it aims to answer the question: How does the introduction of blended courses effect the adult learners? Thus, cross-analysis of the collected data provides results about the transformations of practices caused by the integration of new technologies in adult education.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Emergency departments (ED) in the USA treat 136.9 million cases annually and account for nearly half of all medical care delivered. Due to high demand and limited resource (such as doctors and beds) availability, the median waiting time for ED patients is around 90 minutes. This research is motivated by a real-life case study of an ED located in central Missouri, USA, which faces the problem of congestion and improper workload distribution (e.g., overburdened ED doctors). The objective of this paper is to minimize patient waiting time and efficiently allocate workload among resources in an economical manner. The systematic framework of Business Process Reengineering (BPR), along with discrete-event simulation modeling approach, is employed to analyze current operations and potential improvement strategies. Alternative scenarios pertaining to process change, workforce planning, and capacity expansion are proposed. Besides process performance measures (waiting time and resource utilization), other criteria, such as responsiveness, cost of adoption, and associated risk, are also considered for evaluating an alternative. The experimental analysis indicates that a change in the triage process (evenly distributing medium-acuity patients among doctors and mid-level providers) is economical, easy to implement, reduces physician workload, and improves average waiting time by 20%, thereby making it attractive for short-term adoption. On the other hand, optimizing the workforce level based on historical demand patterns while adopting a triage process change delivers the best performance (84% reduction in waiting time and balanced resource utilization), and is recommended as a long-term solution. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article substantiates the role of strategic re-engineering of corporate culture in increasing the level of competitiveness of a multinational logistics company and optimizing the efficiency of its activities. The main processes, principles and features of corporate culture transformation as one of the stages of re-engineering of the company's business processes are considered. The main concepts of corporate culture, management innovations, and re-engineering, which are effective tools for improving the efficiency of enterprise management, are defined. An algorithm for creating a corporate culture is proposed, including its positioning at the strategic level, as well as ensuring appropriate financial results. Corporate culture management is considered as an intangible asset that has value and creates conditions for generating income for the enterprise. In addition, it gives the company advantages by reducing conflicts, improving business relationships, reducing non-production time costs, and increasing the economic efficiency of the business. The factors influencing the level of employee involvement in work and transformation of employee behavior in accordance with the leader's strategic vision for company development and in accordance with his decisions on business re-engineering are identified. The main tasks of business process re-engineering are revealed, key directions and necessary tools for implementing the transformation of corporate culture are highlighted. The research methodology is based on methods of theoretical analysis and generalization of scientific literature and periodicals on the research topic, statistical analysis, classification and analytical method and methods for determining economic efficiency. The approach to scenario modeling of the process of managing the development of corporate culture of an enterprise based on a combination of components of culture, methods of managing it, basic values and strategies of enterprise management as a whole has been further developed, which allows taking into account the multidirectional interests of stakeholders and harmonizing them in the process of managing a multinational logistics company.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined effects of business process reengineering (BRP) on organisational performance in the food and beverage industry in Nigeria. The study adopted survey research design and multistage sampling methods. It utilised primary data generated thorugh a  questionnaire for the research. Multiple regression analysis was employed to analyse the data. On the hypothesis one, the findings showed that organisational resources and process function have negative and insignificant effect on competitive advantage but innovative thinking has a positive and significant effect on competitive advantage. On the hypothesis two, all the components of business process reengineering (organizational resources, innovative thinking and process function) have positive and significant effect on operational performance. Thus, the study concluded when organizational resources, innovative thinking and process function are combined together as business process reengineering components, they enhance organizational performance in the food and beverages industry in Nigeria. The study suggested that Food and Beverages firms should continue to formulate policies that will encourage innovative ideas from all stakeholders of the organizations in order to continue to achieve competitive advantage and experience sound operational performance. The process function of the organization should continue to be designed and redesigned so that they enjoy smooth operational performance, obtain new resources and upgrade the existing ones so that the firms could achieve competitive advantage. The process function and organization resources need to be evaluated and appraised from time to time to know or detect any lapses that may hinder the firms from attaining their short and long term business goals.</jats:p>"
