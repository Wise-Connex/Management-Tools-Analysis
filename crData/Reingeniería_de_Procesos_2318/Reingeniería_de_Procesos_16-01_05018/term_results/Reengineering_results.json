Business process reengineering factors that were investigated include the major improvements after business process reengineering, the major changes after implementation of business process reengineering and the personal gain after business reengineering process. The results showed that the only two factors out of the three do affect organisational performance in Riyadh factory for re-refining oils employees namely the major improvements after business process reengineering and the major changes after implementation of business process reengineering.   Keywords: Business process reengineering, organizations performance, personal gain.</jats:p>"

The absence of a unified methodology and appropriate analytic approaches prior to the implementation of reengineering projects has made authorities not to adopt correct decision making approaches in this respect. The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology that has to be adopted prior to the implementation of reengineering projects. The statistical population here consists of 25 expert analysts with MA and PhD degrees who are subject to answering a questionnaire. In this proposed methodology the Multi Criterion Decision Making model is applied to allow the analysts to select appropriate models for better and accurate implementation through the least failure coefficient. The Neyriz White Cement Corporation is selected as the subject and the obtained results are compared with the results obtained from similar implemented projects.</jats:p>"

By modeling business processes in eGovernment, public sector organizations can achieve improvements in transparency and reduction in costs and resource requirements, resulting in improved business performance and compliance. The chapter argues that applying BPM and BPR in eGovernment has the potential to enhance public sector performance and achieve organizational goals in public sector organizations.</jats:p>"

Design for Autonomy is a new member of the Design for X family, which aims at integrating the requirements from the X area, in this case autonomy, into the conceptual phase of the product development process. This tool regards to decision making activities and their outcomes: decisions about the interrelations with the design of products. The objective of Design for Autonomy is to assure that the product can be designed, produced and operated in Brazil for a defined period of time at a minimum risk of being dependent on export bans or unavailability of components. This can be accomplished by the Design for Autonomy model comprising four steps: (1) An analysis to identify critical elements and means for achieving their technological domain; (2) Preparation of nationalization; (3) Reverse engineering of the original product in order to obtain the technological know-how; and (4) Forward engineering including the adaptation for the new environment in Brazil, stimulating improvements and added value. In a pilot project, the Design for Autonomy tool is being successfully applied to the development of a Brazilian thrust vector control system, a subsystem used for attitude control of satellite launch vehicles. The technology originates from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and is transferred to the Brazilian Institute of Aeronautics and Space (DCTA/IAE).</jats:p>"

It will be meaningless, if women that constitute half of the population of the globe do not have access to education, healthcare, employment and political decision making bodies. A nation benefits fully when both men and women contribute rigorously in social cohesion, economic growth, peace and prosperity. Findings from countries and reputable institutions such as World Bank and the United Nations revealed that greater gender equality correlates positively with national economic growth. The World Economic Forum recently reported that across the 135 countries examined, greater gender equality correlates positively with per capita gross national product. Countries with greater equality between women and men have economies that are more competitive and fast growing. Hence, removing barriers on empowering women stimulates economic development. This chapter commences with the meaning of women empowerment followed by the identification of various barriers on women empowerment, and investigation on women economic empowerment in the developing countries. The patriarchal system is also introduced to explain how it influences women empowerment. Finally, this chapter argues that women empowerment in general can only be achieved if the patriarchal system is transformed or reengineered to foster more equality between both groups. </jats:p>"

Starting with intron O.i.I1 from <jats:italic>Oceanobacillus iheyensis</jats:italic>, whose crystallographically determined structure lacks branchpoint-containing domain VI, we attempted to determine what makes this intron unfit for in vitro branch formation. A major factor was found to be the length of the helix at the base of domain VI: 4 base pairs (bp) are required for efficient branching, even though a majority of group IIC introns have a 3-bp helix. Equally important for lariat formation is the removal of interactions between ribozyme domains II and VI, which are specific to the second step of splicing. Conversely, mismatching of domain VI and its proposed first-step receptor in subdomain IC1 was found to be detrimental; these data suggest that the intron-encoded protein may promote branch formation partly by modulating the equilibrium between conformations specific to the first and second steps of splicing. As a practical application, we show that by making just two changes to the O.i.I1 ribozyme, it is possible to generate sufficient amounts of lariat intron for the latter to be purified and used in kinetic assays in which folding and reaction are uncoupled.</jats:p>",

Specifically, we examine how US management consulting firms offering total quality management (TQM) services responded to the rise and fall of the rival management practice, business process reengineering (BPR), with an empirical focus on the adoption of BPR services. We find that a consulting firm offering TQM services was more likely to adopt BPR services if the firm’s organizational capabilities and institutional environments were more connected to BPR’s principles than to TQM’s principles. This suggests that management fashions are not simply bandwagon phenomena, but involve resource- and identity-based decision making. We also find that the significance of organizational capabilities increased while that of network influences decreased as BPR’s boom turned to bust. The reversal of well-established institutional accounts of innovation diffusion is explained by reference to the characteristics of management fashion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Background</jats:italic>. Antiretroviral medications are key for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, and transmission mitigation is affected by service delivery, adherence, and retention.<jats:italic> Methods</jats:italic>. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled study in 26 facilities in Nyanza, Kenya, to determine the efficacy of SMS text messages on PMTCT outcomes. The relative risk and confidence intervals were estimated at the facility level using STATA.<jats:italic> Results</jats:italic>. 550 women were enrolled, from June 2012 to July 2013. The median age was 25.6 years, and 85.3% received ARVs. Maternal ARV use was similar between the intervention and control arms: 254/261 (97.3%) versus 241/242 (99.6%) at 34–36 weeks of gestation and 234/247 (94.7%) versus 229/229 (100%) at delivery. Among infants, 199/246 (80.9%) and 209/232 (90.1%) received ARVs (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77–1.14); 88% versus 88.6% were tested for HIV at 6 weeks, with 1/243 (0.4%) and 3/217 (1.4%) positive results in the intervention and control arms, respectively. Communication increased in both the intervention and control arms, with the mean number of 7.5 (SD: 5.70) compared with 6 (SD: 9.96), <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">0.0001</mml:mn></mml:math>.<jats:italic> Conclusions</jats:italic>. We identified high ARV uptake and infant HIV testing, with very low HIV transmission. Increased communication may influence health-seeking behaviors irrespective of technology. The long-term effectiveness of facilitated communication on PMTCT outcomes needs to be tested. The study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01645865?term=NCT01645865&amp;rank=1\">NCT01645865</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>"
