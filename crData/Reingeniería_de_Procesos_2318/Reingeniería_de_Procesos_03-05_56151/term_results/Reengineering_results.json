      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reengineering databases has been a challenge since ages and it requires process mapping to understand better and significantly improve the business processes and performance. In this paper we describe a generic architecture for reengineering legacy databases, which is an outcome of working on a real software project. The goal of this research is to formalize a process that is applicable to different database reengineering scenarios and requirements. We elaborate the steps that were actually done for implementing the project.</jats:p>",
