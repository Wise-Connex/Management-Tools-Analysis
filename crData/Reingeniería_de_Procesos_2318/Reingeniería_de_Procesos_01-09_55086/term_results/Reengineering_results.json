      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            We describe the concepts and experiences we have made in an ongoing project by modeling and reengineering an experimental command and control information system which is nearly completely implemented in Ada95. For this purpose, we use the UML tool\n            <jats:italic>Software through Pictures</jats:italic>\n            from Aonix which includes a reengineering component that produces class diagrams from the source code. These diagrams serve as a starting point of a model of the complete system which itself serves as a base for modeling the most important requirements of the system. Furthermore, by refining the model through state-transition diagrams and redesigning the system the UML tool allows an automatic code generation for components which will be implemented in an other language like Java. Hence, the result of the reengineering process should be a more structured system, where proprietary solutions are replaced by commercial products (e.g. an application server) as much as possible.\n          </jats:p>",
