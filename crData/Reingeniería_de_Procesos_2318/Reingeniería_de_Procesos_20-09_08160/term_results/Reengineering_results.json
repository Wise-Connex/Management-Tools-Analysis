      "abstract": "<jats:p>Continuous cost management is considered vital for the sustainability of any business enterprise in modern society. Over the years, the Nigerian airline industry has been experiencing rising operational costs, probably due to inadequate business process reengineering. Based on the assumptions of the value chain model, this article investigates the effect of business process reengineering on operational costs of selected indigenous airline companies in Nigeria. The descriptive survey research design was adopted for the study. The population was 1,938 employees of key professional departments of the selected Nigerian indigenous airline companies. The sample size was 699 staff of the selected departments with 84% response rate. The copies of the questionnaire were administered using trained research assistants. The study adopted a mixed sampling method. Proportionate sampling was used to determine the sample size for each of the three airlines; stratified sampling was used to select the specific units within the organization, while random sampling was used to select the respondents. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and simple linear regression methods. The descriptive analysis revealed that the overall average and standard deviation for business process reengineering were 2.80 and 0.57, while operational costs were 4.29 and 0.54 respectively. The inferential result showed a positive and significant effect of the business process reengineering on operational costs (R2 = 0.024, β = 0.147, t = 3.709, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Thus, the study concluded that business process reengineering affects the operational costs of the selected indigenous airline companies in Nigeria.\nAcknowledgmentThe researchers acknowledge the contributions of the anonymous reviewers for the useful comments in making the article better.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Process reengineering (PR) is a newly introduced approach to process management; it pays close attention to all the processes that are related to the achievement of organizational objectives. Although originally developed for and applied in the private sector, PR is expected to constitute a handy tool for the transformation of work processes in public sector organizations (PSOs), especially in this era of information and communications technology. This paper x-rays PR in African public sector organizations (APSOs) with an emphasis on lessons to be learnt from the private sector. This paper adopts a descriptive approach, to validate and modify extant theoretical models that are relevant in explaining PR in APSOs. The paper observes that APSOs, unlike the private sector organizations (PrSOs), PSOs have failed in the adoption of PR as well as carrying out logically related tasks in such a way that well-defined results are achieved. It reveals further that poor PR in APSOs has been a clog in the wheel of achieving high performance, efficient service delivery, public satisfaction, efficient management of resources, and sustainable development in Africa. This paper concludes that APSOs can fully adopt PR if they cut down on excessive bureaucracy and learn more from the private sector in terms of readiness and adaptability to environmental changes and transformation as advocated by the contingency theory (CT). The paper recommends, amongst others, that there should be the availability of information technology (IT) infrastructure and the willingness on the part of government representatives to deploy new technologies through adequate support for information technology companies and the prioritization of IT application's needs for high system automation. Managers of APSOs should be given the power to effect changes when the need arises, without any form of influence. Also, there should be concerns about the future of PSOs, and citizens who are clients thereof should be held in high esteem and not to be treated as ‘people in need of favour’. Finally, APSOs should embrace radical changes associated with PR especially by ensuring that promotions are based on merit and not on seniority alone.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Процессный подход рассматривает медицинскую деятельность как заданную цепочку действий (или процессов). Итогом такой деятельности должно стать достижение определенного клинико-экономического результата. Принятие процессного подхода подразумевает внедрение новых подходов в системе менеджмента, когда в основу заложен процесс предоставления услуги потребителю. Чтобы оптимизировать налаженные бизнес-процессы в медучреждении, необходимо решить сразу несколько задач: спроектировать модель будущего процесса, алгоритмизировать действия всех участников процесса, разработать требования и стандарты для нового процесса, внедрить инновации по двум основным направлениям: социальному и медико-технологическому. Реализация всех перечисленных выше действий позволит впоследствии произвести грамотный реинжиниринг и адаптировать текущие процессы к новым условиям. После этого можно переходить к внедрению в обновленную структуру информационных систем. Реинжиниринг, как метод управления инновациями, относится к инновационному процессу, направленному как на создание новых продуктов и новых операций, так и на их применение, продвижение и распределение. Учитывая, что конечной целью реинжиниринга является инновации, то реинжиниринг в лучшем понимании - это реинжиниринг инноваций. Реинжиниринг представляет собой инженерно-консультационные услуги по реструктуризации предпринимательской деятельности на основе производства и реализации инноваций. По определению основоположников реинжиниринга М. Хаммера и Д. Чампи реинжиниринг бизнес-процессов (BPR - Business Process Reengineering) - это \"фундаментальное переосмысление и радикальное перепроектирование бизнес-процессов для достижения конкретных улучшений в основных показателях деятельности предприятия\". Целью BPR является системная реорганизация материальных, финансовых и информационных потоков, направленная на упрощение организационной структуры, перераспределение и минимизацию использования различных ресурсов, сокращение сроков реализации потребностей клиентов, повышение качества их обслуживания. Таким образом, речь идет о формировании совершенно новых деловых целей с использованием последних достижений информационных технологий</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The process approach considers medical activity as a set chain of actions (or processes). The result of such activities should be the achievement of a certain clinical and economic result. The adoption of a process approach implies the introduction of new approaches in the management system, when the process of providing services to the consumer is based on. To optimize the established business processes in a medical institution, it is necessary to solve several tasks at once: design a model for the future process, algorithmize the actions of all participants in the process, develop requirements and standards for the new process, and introduce innovations in two main areas: social and medical-technological. The implementation of all the above actions will allow you to subsequently perform competent reengineering and adapt current processes to new conditions. After that, you can proceed to implementation in the updated structure of information systems. Reengineering, as a method of innovation management, refers to the innovation process aimed at creating new products and new operations, as well as their application, promotion and distribution. Given that the ultimate goal of reengineering is innovation, reengineering in the best sense is the reengineering of innovation. Reengineering is an engineering and consulting service for the restructuring of business activities based on the production and implementation of innovations. According to the definition of the founders of reengineering M. hammer and D. Champi business process reengineering (BPR - Business Process Reengineering) is \"a fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve concrete improvements in the company's core performance indicators.\" The goal of BPR is a systematic reorganization of material, financial and information flows aimed at simplifying the organizational structure, reallocating and minimizing the use of various resources, reducing the time required to meet customer needs, and improving the quality of their service. Thus, we are talking about creating completely new business goals using the latest advances in information technology</jats:p>",

Reengineering the substrate specificity of BoNT/A’s protease domain (LC/A) could expand its therapeutic applications; however, LC/A’s extended substrate recognition (≈60 residues) challenges conventional approaches. We report a directed evolution method for retargeting LC/A’s substrate and retaining its exquisite specificity. The resultant eight-mutation LC/A (omLC/A) has improved cleavage specificity and catalytic efficiency (1300- and 120-fold, respectively) for SNAP23 versus SNAP25 compared to a previously reported LC/A variant. Importantly, the BoNT/A holotoxin equipped with omLC/A infiltrates neurons and retains its SNAP23 activity. The identification of substrate control loops outside BoNT/A’s active site could guide the design of improved BoNT proteases and inhibitors.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>One Sentence Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Directed evolution of the BoNT/A protease targets a new cellular protein, SNAP23, expanding its therapeutic potential.</jats:p></jats:sec>"
