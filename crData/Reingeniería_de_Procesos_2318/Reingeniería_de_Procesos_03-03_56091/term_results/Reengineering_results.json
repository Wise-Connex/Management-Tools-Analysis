      "abstract": "<jats:p>Describes the reengineering of a production line for household heating tubular radiators, assuming as a reference scenario the facility of one of the leading Italian manufacturers. After a preliminary characterization of products and manufacturing process, a thorough analysis of the production system has been carried out in order to highlight current problems and improvement strategies in the light of lean manufacturing concepts. Subsequently, suggests some corrective actions and also assesses their expected effectiveness in economic terms. In particular, improvement possibilities have been found in the areas of internal logistics through streamlining of materials flow and layout modifications, as well as process quality increase. Reengineering activities are especially aimed towards layout optimization mainly by resorting to a U‐shaped cell‐based architecture. Further, the reduction of rework percentage during the assembly phase has been pursued by properly modifying the operations sequence and through integration of a new automated testing station in the production line.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The new management concept of flexible business process reengineering (FBPR) may be defined as a methodology that combines the best of three management tools – positioning, continuous improvement and business process reengineering (PIR). Employing all three management tools to a sufficient degree could enhance the effectiveness of an improvement project compared to the conventional BPR methodology. The changes could be slightly less “radical” than conventional BPR, but in exchange, it is a relatively less risky strategy and can facilitate continuous learning and improvement. To maximize the organization's competitiveness through the application of FBPR, it is important to establish a value delivery system (VDS) to increase the project's effectiveness and to employ performance benchmarking to determine the performance gap. Using a case study, this paper illustrates the essentiality and the application of VDS and performance benchmarking during the implementation of FBPR.</jats:p>",
