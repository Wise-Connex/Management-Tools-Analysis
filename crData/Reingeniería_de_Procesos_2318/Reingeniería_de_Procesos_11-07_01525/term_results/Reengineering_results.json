      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to increased uncertainties in corporate demands the vendor-managed inventory method was developed; however, relevant literature indicates that the vendor managed inventory system has bottlenecks in implementation. Thus, this study applied the Fuzzy Delphi Analytic Hierarchy Process for selecting objective attributes, and constructed a vendor managed objective hierarchy structure. Using ABC Classification, category A multi-objective attributes was selected. Dynamic multi-criteria decision analysis was used to analyze category A multi-objective attributes, as selected by different sectors in the first year. If all the objectives have quantitative attributes, multi-criteria programming was used to construct the model. Further, comparisons were conducted for the results obtained from the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, the Particle swarm optimization method, and the modified multi-criteria planning method. Modified Data Envelopment Analysis was used for performance evaluation. ARIS (Architecture of Integrated Information System) analyzed relevant corporate process reengineering, and the decision results were incorporated into the management information system.</jats:p>"
