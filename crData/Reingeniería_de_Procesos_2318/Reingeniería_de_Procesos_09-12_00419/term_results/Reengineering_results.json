      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            The fermentative metabolism of glucose was redirected to succinate as the primary product without mutating any genes encoding the native mixed-acid fermentation pathway or redox reactions. Two changes in peripheral pathways were together found to increase succinate yield fivefold: (i) increased expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and (ii) inactivation of the glucose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. These two changes increased net ATP production, increased the pool of phosphoenolpyruvate available for carboxylation, and increased succinate production. Modest further improvements in succinate yield were made by inactivating the\n            <jats:italic>pflB</jats:italic>\n            gene, encoding pyruvate formate lyase, resulting in an\n            <jats:italic>E</jats:italic>\n            <jats:italic>scherichia coli</jats:italic>\n            pathway that is functionally similar to the native pathway in\n            <jats:italic>Actinobacillus succinogenes</jats:italic>\n            and other succinate-producing rumen bacteria.\n          </jats:p>",
