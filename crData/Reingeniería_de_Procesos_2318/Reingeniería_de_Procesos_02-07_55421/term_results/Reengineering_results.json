      "abstract": "<jats:p>A field study was conducted to determine organizational readiness for implementing E‐business solutions by utilizing drivers suggested in the business process reengineering literature.  Based on a literature review, we theorized a schematic framework to reflect the anticipated relationships between the independent variables of technology team capabilities, nature and scope of legacy business applications, high‐tech resources, value‐chain, management expertise, supply chain management and enterprise resource management, and the dependant variable of E‐Business readiness.  A survey collection method comprised of a 29‐item questionnaire was used.  The study was carried out with a sample population from employees in various departments of a large, multinational pharmaceutical company.  Data analysis of project hypotheses showed that 47.7% of the variance of E‐Business readiness was explained by the five independent variables, and that management expertise had the most significant influence. Recommendations directed at the senior management and E‐Business Teams include the importance of having an E‐Business team to manage new technology, and the need to create synergy between the organizational functions and departments.  Though this analytical field study was conducted in a framework of one case study, results can be used to establish a foundation for a comprehensive study across business firms. </jats:p>",

Both initial room set-up at the beginning of a typical workday and cardiac and noncardiac general anesthesia cases were studied. User errors and inefficiencies were noted. The time required to prepare de novo a syringe containing a mock emergency drug was measured using a standard protocol.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Drug/fluid tasks consumed almost 50 and 75%, respectively, of the set-up time for noncardiac and cardiac cases. In 8 cardiac anesthetics, drug/fluid tasks comprised 27 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD) of all prebypass clinical activities. During 20 noncardiac cases, drug/fluid tasks comprised 20 +/- 8% of induction and 15 +/- 7% of maintenance. Drug preparation far outweighed drug administration tasks. Inefficient or error prone tasks were observed during drug/fluid preparation (e.g., supply acquisition, waste disposal, syringe labeling), administration (infusion device failure, leaking stopcock), and organization (workspace organization and navigation, untangling of intravenous lines). Anesthesia providers (n = 21) required 35 +/- 5 s to prepare a mock emergency drug.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Intravenous drug and fluid administration tasks account for a significant proportion of anesthesia care, especially in complex cases. Current processes are inefficient and may predispose to medical error. There appears to be substantial opportunity to improve quality and cost of care through the reengineering of anesthesia intravenous drug and fluid administration processes. General design requirements are proposed.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",
