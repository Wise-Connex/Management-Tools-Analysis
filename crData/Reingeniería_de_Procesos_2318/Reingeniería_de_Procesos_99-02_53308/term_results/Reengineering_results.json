This paper demonstrates, by means of a case study, how a Midwest bank in the USA took a proactive approach to turn things around. The proposed reengineering process should produce savings of at least 50 percent in direct underwriting cost. The proposed approach can be used by other banks to obtain similar benefits.</jats:p>",
