      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is a management approach used to improve organizational performance through restructuring production activities of the core services for the purpose of enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness. Although BPR improves the efficiency of processes, it can hardly be applied in its own and thus it needs to be complemented with other concepts from other disciplines. Information technology (IT) tools are seen as accuracy and effective enabler of BPR approach in restructuring activities. This paper focuses on analyzing on how IT can be an enabler of BPR approach to restructuring processes in an organization for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of processes. It presents the roles of IT in BPR for organizations. It also presents challenges on organizations when implementing the BPR.</jats:p>"
