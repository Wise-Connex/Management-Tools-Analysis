We then examine the conditions that are conducive to its application. Among the key concepts and methods of reengineering, its nine basic principles are presented and the enabling role of information technology is discussed.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The discussion on the implementation of reengineering includes a description of the human infrastructure, and the recommended budgetary arrangements.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>As one of its strengths, reengineering provides the solution to the two known dilemmas of process management: (1) variation and dispersion and (2) scale and complexity.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            The article cites a number of factors that can cause BPR initiatives fail to reach their initial objectives, and discusses three known weaknesses of the methodology, including the\n            <jats:italic>process paradox</jats:italic>\n            .\n          </jats:p>"
