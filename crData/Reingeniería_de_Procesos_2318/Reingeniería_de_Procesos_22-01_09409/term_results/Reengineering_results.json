The theoretical foundation for the study was rooted in Deci and Ryan's (1985; 2000) self-determination theory of motivation. The researcher utilized a non-experimental correlational research design and an appropriate non-probability convenience sampling method to collect data from fifty-five (55) participants. The multidimensional work motivation, job diagnostic, and the job satisfaction scales were used to measure the variables. Non-parametric tests were used to measure the correlation between the variables and three hypotheses were tested. The results showed a strong and positive relationship exists between employee motivation, job reengineering, and the perception of job satisfaction. These findings suggest that business leaders and human capital managers of private and government enterprises may use the study as a focal point to understand a person-job fit, establish lean organizational efficiencies, and formulate strategies to improve motivation and reduce turnover.&#x0D;\nKeywords:  Emotional Intelligence, Employee Motivation, Job Design, Job Reengineering, Job Redesign, Job Satisfaction, Metacognitive Abilities, Perception, Perception of Job Satisfaction, And Self-Determination Theory</jats:p>"

To investigate the impact of nursing on drug withdrawal disputes in obstetrics and gynecology and reduce medical disputes are of great importance. In this study, documents related to medical disputes are collected and linked to relevant professional information systems for data collection and consultation. The patients are divided into groups and treated with different nursing methods, and then the correlation between nursing methods and disputes in different groups is computed. The results show that, based on the proposed nursing process, medical disputes caused by the cessation of nursing can be effectively reduced. Compared with traditional nursing methods, when the proposed nursing procedures are followed, the dispute rate is reduced by more than 10% and the possibility of serious disputes is also reduced with a reduction rate of about 15%. This shows that, based on the proposed nursing process, reengineering can play an effective preventive role in stopping obstetrics and gynecology nursing disputes.</jats:p>",

Yet, their maintenance and adaption to changed requirements consume a considerable amount of the total software development costs. Frequently, domain experts and developers involved in the original development are not available anymore, making it difficult to adapt a legacy system without introducing bugs or unwanted behavior. This results in a dilemma: businesses are reluctant to change a working system, while at the same time struggling with its high maintenance costs. We propose the concept of <jats:italic>Structured Software Reengineering</jats:italic> replacing the ad hoc forward engineering part of a reengineering process with the application of behavior-preserving, proven-correct transformations improving nonfunctional program properties. Such transformations preserve valuable business logic while improving properties such as maintainability, performance, or portability to new platforms. Manually encoding and proving such transformations for industrial programming languages, for example, in interactive proof assistants, is a major challenge requiring deep expert knowledge. Existing frameworks for automatically proving transformation rules have limited expressiveness and are restricted to particular target applications such as compilation or peep-hole optimizations. We present <jats:italic>Abstract Execution</jats:italic>, a specification and verification framework for statement-based program transformation rules on <jats:sc>JAVA</jats:sc> programs building on symbolic execution. Abstract Execution supports <jats:italic>universal quantification</jats:italic> over statements or expressions and addresses properties about the (big-step) <jats:italic>behavior</jats:italic> of programs. Since this class of properties is useful for a plethora of applications, Abstract Execution bridges the gap between expressiveness and automation. In many cases, fully automatic proofs are in possible. We explain REFINITY, a workbench for modeling and proving statement-level <jats:sc>JAVA</jats:sc> transformation rules, and discuss our applications of Abstract Execution to code refactoring, cost analysis of program transformations, and transformations reshaping programs for the application of parallel design patterns.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of society and economy, patients with coronary heart disease increasingly hope to receive more humanized services after surgery, and the reengineering of the nursing process is precisely based on humanized management. In order to create a nursing intervention that helps in boosting total nursing gains and lowering disasters, the primary element of the nursing business process reengineering is to reintegrate or condense the creative work flow that was fragmented by specialization into a whole job. The “patient” is positioned in the center of nursing process reengineering, with service quality as the main guiding principle. It follows the management principles of continuous regulation and innovation, and cultivates and promotes the development of the nursing field from the perspective of “sublation.” In the method part, this article introduces and supplements related information on nursing process reengineering, coronary heart disease, and postoperative cognitive behavioral intervention. Algorithmically, this paper proposes 3D RPN structure, loss function, capsule network, and improved activation function algorithm for coronary heart disease region extraction. In the part of experiment and results, this article collects general data of patients and compares memory ability, grades of self‐management behaviors of patients treated with coronary heart disease, scores of quality control standards before and after nursing process reengineering, scores of patients’ mental state, and comparison of postoperative physical indicators. According to the test results, the test group’s diastolic and systolic blood pressure declined by more than 20, their total cholesterol dropped from 6.23 to 5.28, and their triglyceride levels dropped from 1.82 to 1.39 after the stent was implanted. Triglycerides reduced from 1.82 to 1.39, and total cholesterol dropped from 6.15 to 5.98. It indicates postoperative memory in patients with coronary heart disease. Abilities, including recognition, number, touch memory, and associative memory, decline significantly, but it can be improved after receiving the nursing process reengineering. It can be seen that nursing process reengineering can play a positive role in the postoperative cognitive behavior of patients with coronary heart disease.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy industry operates in a highly dynamic environment, requiring robust procurement systems to ensure efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with sustainability goals. However, traditional procurement methods often fail to address emerging challenges such as fluctuating energy markets, supply chain disruptions, and increasing regulatory demands. This study explores the transformative potential of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) in enhancing procurement efficiency within the energy sector. By rethinking and redesigning procurement processes, BPR offers a systematic framework for eliminating inefficiencies, reducing operational costs, and optimizing resource utilization. The study examines cutting-edge approaches such as process automation, digital procurement platforms, data-driven decision-making, and artificial intelligence (AI) integration, which are increasingly being adopted to streamline procurement workflows and improve supplier collaboration. Through an in-depth analysis of case studies and empirical data, the research highlights how energy companies leveraging BPR strategies achieve greater agility and resilience in their procurement operations. Key findings reveal that implementing AI-powered tools for demand forecasting, blockchain for transparent supplier transactions, and digital dashboards for real-time tracking significantly enhances procurement performance. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of fostering organizational culture shifts, change management strategies, and cross-functional collaboration to ensure the successful adoption of reengineered processes. This paper further identifies critical success factors for implementing BPR in the energy sector, including top management support, employee training, and investment in scalable digital infrastructure. It also discusses the role of sustainability in procurement transformation, emphasizing green procurement practices that align with global energy transition goals. By offering actionable insights, this research provides a roadmap for energy companies to achieve procurement excellence, drive operational efficiency, and remain competitive in an evolving market.</jats:p>"

Analyzing, systematizing and summarizing the scientific works of many scientists, it should be noted that in order to successfully manage financial flows and their nodes, it is necessary to improve or create effective methods and tools in the organization. One of the methods for managing financial flows is management based on the reengineering of financial business processes. It has been substantiated that financial business processes are a set of one or more interconnected financial procedures / operations (functions) that jointly implement the financial business task of an organization within its organizational structure that describes functional roles and relationships. The paper defines and systematizes the main financial business processes. It is substantiated that the reengineering of financial business processes covers all aspects of financial activity, taking into account the goals of the organization and in accordance with the sensitivity of the market, and the process of its implementation in the organization is also recommended, where at each stage the head of the organization's division decides on the implementation of the next stage. Criteria are formulated (duration of the process; completeness, timeliness of obtaining and reliability of information; laboriousness of the process), advantages (transparency, responsibility, efficiency) and errors of reengineering of financial business processes.The paper substantiates that when reengineering financial business processes, it is effective to use CALS technologies that provide for the organization of a single information space and integrate automated systems designed to effectively solve engineering tasks and plan and manage production and organization resources. The characteristic properties of the CALS technology are determined and it is indicated that the use of CALS technologies allows the organization to improve processes during the business process or product cycle, reduce the timing of the business process and reduce the cost of the business process.</jats:p>"

Technology acceptance models (TAM) were used as a basis for the study and for hypothesizing the effects of such variables on the use of e-learning. The findings of this study found that there is significant influence of self-efficacy to perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness while perceived ease of use has direct impact to perceived usefulness and perceived usefulness has influence on intention to use towards e-learning systems. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The development and scaling out of flash-dryer innovations for more efficient, small-scale production of high-quality cassava flour (HQCF) and starch is described. The diagnoses of cassava-processing SMEs (small and medium enterprises) revealed their energy expenditures for drying were considerably higher than those of large-scale industrial companies, which was mostly due to suboptimal design of flash-drying systems. As a result, small-scale production of cassava starch and HQCF often incurs high production costs, incompatible with market prices of final products. Taking stock of this situation, RTB scientists have developed several innovations to optimize energy efficiency and costs, including a longer drying pipe, reengineered heat exchanger, larger blower for higher air velocity, and a higher product/air ratio. This was based on numerical modelling to determine the key design features of energy-efficient flash dryers, followed by construction and demonstration of a pilot-scale prototype. As a result, improved small-scale flash dryers are now being scaled out to the private sector in various countries, using the Scaling Readiness framework and achieving 10–15% gains in productivity and incomes. A method for diagnosis of process efficiency is also described, to identify technical bottlenecks and to document and measure the outcomes and impacts during the implementation of scaling-out projects.</jats:p>"
