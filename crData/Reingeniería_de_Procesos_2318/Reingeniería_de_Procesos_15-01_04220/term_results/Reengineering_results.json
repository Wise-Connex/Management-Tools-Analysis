This was conceived in the West at a time when the Japanese experience in continuous improvement systems was yielding a substantial cost advantage. However, the experience of BPR has been very disappointing. The reasons for failure are outlined and the connection with more recent transformation programs is indicated.</jats:p>"

BPR is a systematic approach to helping an organization analyze and improve its processes in digital age. BPR is a continuum of change initiatives in order to deliver better business performance standards through establishing sustainable process capability in modern organizations. BPR has become a popular tool to dealing with rapid technological and business change in the global competitive environment. Applying BPR will greatly improve business performance and reach business goals in global business.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a progressive business intelligence (BI) environment, IoT knowledge analytics are becoming an increasingly challenging problem because of rapid changes of knowledge context scenarios along with increasing data production scales with business requirements that ultimately transform a working knowledge base into a superseded state. Such a superseded knowledge base lacks adequate knowledge context scenarios, and the semantics, rules, frames, and ontology contents may not meet the latest requirements of contemporary BI-services. Thus, reengineering a superseded knowledge base into a renovated knowledge base system can yield greater business value and is more cost effective and feasible than standardising a new system for the same purpose. Thus, in this work, we propose an IoT knowledge reengineering framework (IKR framework) for implementation in a neurofuzzy system to build, organise, and reuse knowledge to provide BI-services to the things (man, machines, places, and processes) involved in business through the network of IoT objects. The analysis and discussion show that the IKR framework can be well suited to creating improved anticipation in IoT-driven BI-applications.</jats:p>"
