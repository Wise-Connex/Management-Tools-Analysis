Solusi untuk mengatasi hal tersebut ialah dengan menciptakan suatu program berbasis web yang memiliki fitur pencatatan dan pelaporan data penduduk. Dengan adanya web ini, maka pegawai tidak memerlukan buku dan microsoft word untuk melakukan pencatatan yang sifatnya terjadi dua kali. Business Process Reengineering (BPR) merupakan suatu pendekatan bisnis yang berfokus pada analisis alur kerja atau proses bisnis yang terjadi dalam suatu lembaga atau organsiasi. Penulis menerapkan metode BPR untuk mengidentifikasi alur kerja sistem yang sedang berjalan di kantor Kelurahan Kalimas dan mendapatkan gambaran untuk menciptakan aplikasi berbasis web guna membantu mempercepat proses pelayanan data penduduk di Kelurahan Kalimas. Hasil penelitian ini yaitu berupa sistem administrasi kependudukan untuk mendata SKTM, KTP, KK, Surat Kelahiran, Surat Kematian, Surat Pindah, dan Surat Pindah Datang. Pihak yang dapat menggunakan aplikasi ini yaitu pegawai kelurahan, lurah, dan admin. Aplikasi yang dihasilkan dari penelitian ini memiliki manfaat untuk mempermudah pegawai Kelurahan Kalimas dalam mengelola data kependudukan dan mempermudah lurah dapat memonitor data kependudukan Kelurahan Kalimas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The development of built-up urban areas, aimed at improving the living arrangements and standards, is implemented within the boundaries of an element of a structural plan, as well as related elements. It is important, since it affects the interests of a substantial part of the country’s population. The achievement of the goals, pursued by the national projects and programmes as socio-economic development tools, depends directly on the effective development of built-up areas. The effective development of built-up areas involves comprehensive transformation and modernization of territories and buildings on the basis of the concept of reengineering of territories and built-up areas, including methods of effective and high-quality change management.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. The subject of the study is a set of measures that ensure the qualitative transformation of engineering (technological) solutions and serve as the backbone structure of reengineering in construction. The object of the study is the process of qualitative transformation of technological (technical) solutions and business processes (management decisions). It is noted that the actual focus of transformation of territories and built-up areas is implemented in the course of actions, taken within the framework of reengineering of technological processes (technical solutions), including the stages of reconstruction, renovation, technical retooling, repurposing, and reclamation. The factors, influencing the reengineering of management solutions, are provided. Features of the composition and properties of the reengineering of territories and built-up areas, characteristic of its practical implementation, are presented. Research methods include structural and functional analyses.&#x0D;\nResults. Current fundamental differences in the nature of regulatory impacts accompanying the traditional type of restoration (modernization), as well as impacts, made within the framework of reengineering of territories and built-up areas, are described. The authors suggest that the integrated approach of impacts, made in the process of reengineering of territories and built-up areas, is conveyed in the relationship between “property development – capital construction facilities – a technological solution”, as well as the scope and intensity of impacts. The general framework for the concept, underlying the implementation of the reengineering of territories and built-up areas, is presented.</jats:p>",

Business Process Reengineering (BPR) employs process redesign heuristics to enhance an existing production line process using an assessment technique and fit-gap analysis. The simulation tool is used to model the production line process redesign. After adopting the provided approach and conducting the simulation, the company's production productivity and service level increased by about 45%. The required simulation resulted in critical measurements such as manufacturing capacity and lead-time. This research demonstrates the redesign production line process that must be followed to archive this artefact.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With globalization and the high competitiveness faced in a business environment, adopting technological solutions to satisfactory respond to an increasingly demanding customer is the watchword for organizations. With technological advances and an increasingly volatile society, it is mandatory for industries to ensure agile production processes capable of responding quickly and assertively to consumer expectations. Industry 4.0 with its technological pillars comes up to boost company to have more flexible and agile processes. This work results of a project developed in an automotive factory that will be producing a new mechanical part. The definition of the best layout of the production line was carried in an instable environment characterized by budget limitations, security and space restrictions that forced the company to study and discuss four possible layouts to define the future line. The goal was to ensure that the line was able to produce 3625 parts/week with an Operational Income of 87%. Moreover, it was also important to consider the cost of implementing a new line in the company. With this study it is proven that in an automotive industry where flexibility is required in an unpredictable environment during a decision-making process, analyzing the impact and possible consequences of every change in a layout definition phase is a great asset, where alteration like adding a conveyor, Automated Guided Vehicle or Robots can be made easy and quickly, and important conclusions can be taken from this analyze with less effort. Finally, 2 criteria were created to examine every variant and a decision was made.</jats:p>"

However, traditional nursing work consumes a lot of manpower and material resources, but it is difficult to improve the happiness of cancer patients, and it also brings a lot of troubles to many nursing workers. Based on the above reasons, we reengineered the traditional nursing process based on the BPR theory and applied the new process to the analysis of the management effect of cancer patients after oral chemotherapy drugs. The data shows that there are 23 patients with no pressure ulcer risk (score greater than 19) before care, 27 patients with low risk (15–19 points), 32 patients with moderate risk (13–14 points), and 18 people at high risk (less than 12 points). After nursing, there were 82 patients with no pressure ulcer risk, 10 patients with low risk, 7 patients with moderate risk, and 1 patient with high risk. This shows that the risk of pressure ulcers in patients with cancer after the use of chemotherapy drugs is significantly reduced compared with those without nursing. Nursing intervention can improve the psychological state of cancer patients during the recovery period, and nursing intervention can promote the compliance of cancer patients in various aspects of rehabilitation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>El concepto de reingeniería no es nuevo, desde mediados de los años 90 y en la década del 2000 en que se concretaron los principios sobre los que se rige la misma, está se aplica de manera continua en los procesos empresas, pero no sólo puede aplicarse en los procesos, también se aplica ahora en los sistemas de información automatizados tiempo atrás, éstos, pueden entorpecer en lugar de ayudar a los procesos, al haber sido diseñados  para otras condiciones tecnológicas diferentes a las que rigen en la actualidad. Con los cambios continuos en la tecnología y a través de los años, se ha llegado al punto en las empresas, en que las primeras automatizaciones concretadas, ahora son obsoletas y/o requieren de actualización en tecnología y en los sistemas en sí. Para realizar lo anterior deben aplicarse metodologías de desarrollo lo suficientemente ágiles para que los cambios causen el menor impacto posible en aspectos relacionados con la competitividad de las empresas como es la presencia en medios o mantener una ventaja competitiva. El objetivo de este artículo es evidenciar los aspectos relevantes que afectan la competitividad en una pyme al realizar una reingeniería a los sistemas de información.</jats:p>"

Based on the results, the researcher presented a set of recommendations and suggestions; the need for optimal employment of information technology, and keeping abreast of all that is new in the approach of business process reengineering, and benefit from the successful experiences in it, provided that what mentioned before is among the first priorities of the university, and establishing an independent department to continuously reengineer business processes, and remove any obstacle that may face the application of the business process reengineering approach, the researcher also suggests conducting future studies related to identifying the impact of the use of computerized artificial intelligence on the effectiveness of business process reengineering in private Palestinian universities, in addition to trying to build a proposed model for developing the management of the public university in Palestine in light of the approach of business process reengineering.</jats:p>",
