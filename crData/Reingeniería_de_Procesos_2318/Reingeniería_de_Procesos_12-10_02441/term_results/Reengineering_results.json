      "abstract": "<p>In this paper, the authors present Adimen-SUMO, an operational ontology to be used by first-order theorem provers in intelligent systems that require sophisticated reasoning capabilities (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Engineering, Semantic Web infrastructure, etc.). Adimen-SUMO has been obtained by automatically translating around 88% of the original axioms of SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology). Their main interest is to present in a practical way the advantages of using first-order theorem provers during the design and development of first-order ontologies. First-order theorem provers are applied as inference engines for reengineering a large and complex ontology in order to allow for formal reasoning. In particular, the authors’ study focuses on providing first-order reasoning support to SUMO. During the process, they detect, explain and repair several important design flaws and problems of the SUMO axiomatization. As a by-product, they also provide general design decisions and good practices for creating operational first-order ontologies of any kind.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Business process reengineering (BPR) involves the radical redesign of functional organizations into cross-functional teams to achieve dramatic improvements in productivity. Redesigning complex and dynamic processes in research and development (R&amp;D) organizations with multi-layer projects is a difficult task. Previous researchers have proposed many intuitive approaches for BPR utilizing intuition and subjective judgment from “experts” at various stages of their implementation. However, the complexities inherent in large R&amp;D organizations have restricted the effectiveness of their use in practice. The authors present an automated and structured analytic algorithm that eliminates the need for subjective human judgment. The proposed method facilitates the reorganization of R&amp;D processes into cross-functional work units and projects. The efficacy of the algorithm is confirmed with a small problem and the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated at the Air Force Research Laboratory.</p>",
