      "abstract": "<jats:p> Reengineering has rapidly become the business buzzword of the early 1990s. This examination of the reengineering phenomenon sets out to consider the extent to which it is a new model for organizational change and offers some suggestions as to why it appears to have become so popular. It disputes some claims to novelty and internal coherence and argues that explanations for reengineering's popularity might be sought through an externalist rather than an internalist account. That is, that its popularity might best be explained not by considering the uniqueness or 'inherent' rationality of the ideas involved, an 'internalist' account, but rather through the ways in which the purveyors of reengineering manage, in and through their accounts, to construct a series of sympathetic 'resonances' or compatibilities, an 'externalist' account. These are construed to exist between their ideas and popular opinion, or zeitgeist, and also between the novelty of the ideas and the cultural antecedents. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Practitioners still feel ill at ease regarding an evaluation process for reengineering tools. To address this issue, a Qu&amp;eacute;bec-based special interest group in software engineering reused a case study workshop format that had been previously implemented to compare CASE products. This case study format had to be substantially modified to allow both vendors and participants to properly position the reengineering tools. For example, the workshop committee had to prepare reengineering frameworks, including a taxonomy of tools as well as legacy system selection criteria for the case study. This article also reports on the challenges met during the project as well as lessons learned: within a context of an immature reengineering market, the time has not yet come for a full real-life case study at an acceptable economic cost.</jats:p>",
