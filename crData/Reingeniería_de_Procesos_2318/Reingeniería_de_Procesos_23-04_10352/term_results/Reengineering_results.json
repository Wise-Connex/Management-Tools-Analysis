They reveal how the effectiveness is related to the development of the whole society and the living standards of all employees. This article starts from the education model, based on relevant theoretical knowledge. It helps to explore and innovate the path to realize the ‘college scientific research and teaching collaborative education model’ within the university and construct the SVM-process reengineering model to study its feasibility. According to the calculation results, the teaching results of the enterprise teaching mode are the lowest, with an average proportion of about 32.74%, the average proportion of the teaching results of the traditional teaching mode is only 42.56%, and the average proportion of the teaching results of the collaborative education is as high as 97.86%. Therefore, measures should be taken to enhance the flexibility of training content and to carry out various forms of school research, teaching and collaborative education models.</jats:p>",
