      "abstract": "<jats:p> Motivated by technological innovation and increasingly competitive markets, U S WEST Communications has been reengineering its core service processes to improve customer loyalty, cost effectiveness, and efficiency of services. The operations research modeling group at U S WEST Advanced Technologies has developed a service process simulation model that identifies where and when process reengineering efforts should occur. In a successful implementation, we analyzed the quantitative impact of changes in key process parameters, such as the error rate and staffing level of the service center, in the metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul. U S WEST is deploying an outgrowth of this process modeling to support process reengineering in other major metropolitan areas in its 14-state region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most popular topics in American business today is reengineering. Rarely has such a misunderstood term been embraced so widely in theory and in practice. Numerous definitions and lists of key components to successful reengineering have confused managers as to what reengineering is in theory and in practice. Brings together the diverse literature and identifies clearly the activities, questions and process changes theorized to be necessary in reengineering efforts. In addition, reports the results of a survey designed to assess which of these purported activities, questions and process changes are, in practice, part of reengineering efforts as perceived by marketing professionals. Over 200 marketing professionals revealed their perception of firms’ involvement in reengineering, and evaluated involvement in key activities, process changes and asking of fundamental questions. The results reveal interesting discrepancies between theoretical reengineering and reengineering in practice. Implies that reengineering may not be a black‐and‐white issue, but rather exist on a gray continuum.</jats:p>",
