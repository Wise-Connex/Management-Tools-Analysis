Reengineering is a sub-problem of software engineering. It is the study and analysis of an existing system for purposes of understanding, maintenance, or migration towards new technologies that arise from day to day, without rewriting the software from scratch. This will save us time and money in the software development process. Author's objective is not to create new terms, but to introduce the terms already in use with new perspectives. So in this chapter, definitions and techniques are introduced, taxonomies and models are proposed, relevant questions are answered, some specialized conferences and journals are listed and compared; all this to highlight the ways to authors who are interested in writing research papers or surveys in the software reengineering field. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bearing in mind the world research study whose results show that today the industrial concept of corporations is exposed to constant processes of change, and accordingly, production processes and at the same time improvement processes should begin at the very beginning in everyday work, both in the organization of production and production. and in strategic business planning and management decision-making in the entire business system. Practice shows, that if the implementation of a change is not perceived as primary by all employees, however, the accepted change determined by the implementation of this method of improvement only in their minds, is not enough. If everything goes according to plan for all activities of employees and the team, then these changes lead to acceptable and stable improvements. It is the starting point for ensuring the long-term success of industrial production and is an important generator or engine for motivating employees. The implemented RE changes are the driving force that certainly leads to the achievement of new goals and the success of the strategic business of companies. The advantages of applying reengineering techniques in business systems in the world are reflected in the improvement of quality and sophistication of management and all employees to successfully eliminate harmful production and business processes related to the overall organization, and thus greater product placement on the world market. High managerial creativity is important for the industrial business sustainability of high market success, today and in the future. That is why efficient methods of redesigning and reorganizing certain industrial processes are being implemented in developed companies around the world. One of the key methods of achieving high quality products and services and achieving the concept of TQM – total quality management is Reengineering method – Business processes reeingeenering – RE process. Managerial creativity today has a significantly affects efficiency, so this method is effectively applied continuously in the elimination of problematic production processes in industrial business and manufacturing companies around the world.</jats:p>"

This kind of money is only fruitful and democratically livable in a transparent political environment. Otherwise, instead of unleashing innovation and collective action with the market's visible hand of qualified money, the new internet of value will deliver a digital money with the same algorithmic fate that social media met on the previous internet. The latter allows digitizing users' data and has been used to manipulate consumers and public opinion (possibly in the last two U.S. Presidential elections). Similarly, the former will let states and corporatocracy cross-reference social media and digital money's data, hurting privacy even more. As blockchains disseminate, having the crucial economic advantage of reducing transaction costs, only free-market competition between private and public blockchains guarantee transparency and democracy. Blockchain technology is the real McCoy, and decentralizing digital money is the free world's best shot, especially in the new normal triggered by COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Second, will be the supportive and hindrance factors on the adoption of KMS and the user perception and practices of KMS in the institution. A mix of methodologies is adapted to generate findings for this research. Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for this research through a questionnaire approach. The questionnaire is constructed in such a way that closed-ended questions and open-ended questions are included. The research has led to several important outcomes for the implementation of KMS in HEIs. This study has proposed a conceptual framework and support from other research outcomes (i.e., identification of the management tools used, the support and barriers for implementation, and user perception and practices for the KMS implementations). </jats:p>"

Basically, the business management of these industries is aimed at increasing efficiency by applying efficient methods and techniques that give good results in engineering. This primarily refers to those techniques that today in a complex time of business, can give a high quality approach to business management, highly efficient organization and high quality products and services that will conquer world markets today and in the future. The concept of TQM – total quality management throughout the company worldwide, originated from Japanese companies in the 1970's and quickly spread to all manufacturing companies in the world. On that basis, it can be said that the strategic intention, assessment and goal of the path of each management that will lead the business towards the fulfillment of market laws of business.

Existing types of business processes and their components has considered. It has been determined that effective management of the enterprise or business consists in exercising such influence on business processes in order to obtain the expected result. The relationship between the influence of enterprise business processes and the formation of a product value chain for customers has been researched. The differences in the concepts essence of business reengineering, business process redesign and business process improvement has analyzed. Four key elements of business process reengineering such as strategies, processes, technologies and people has highlighted. Furthermore, strategies and processes create the basis for the lucrative technology using and the redesign of the human activities system. The definition of all strategies should be carried out in relation to the development of the markets in which the enterprise operates. It is necessary to focus not on internal, but on external market opportunities. The strategy should be consistent with the company's vision, as well as internal and external constraints that determine the possible revision and strategies redefinition for further transformation. The main motives and reasons that induce enterprises to revise business processes and introduce reengineering as one of the ways to increase competitiveness have been identified. The principles on which the reengineering process based has determined. It has determined that the business process cannot be considered as a separate category without its integration into the enterprise activities. When developing an enterprise reengineering plan, all actions and measures should be linked to the enterprise strategic goals. The main types of reengineering like crisis, development, systematic, from scratch has investigated and the conditions has indicated. A comparative characteristic of traditional business processes and business processes after reengineering is carried out, the advantages that are created for the enterprise after redesigning business processes has determined.</jats:p>"

The expediency of this approach to managing financial-economic security is due to the fact that, on the one hand, financial-economic security is the initial prerequisite for long-term development, and on the other hand, it acts as a criterion for the efficiency of enterprise management. The article is aimed at substantiating the theoretical-methodical approach to the use of business process reengineering instruments in ensuring the financial and economic security of enterprises in accordance with its strategic orientation. The basic principles of building a system of financial-economic security are defined. On the basis of the system-structural approach, the classification of types of financial-economic security with the separation of market and interface security was carried out. The system of indicators for monitoring the level of financial-economic security is proposed to be built on the basis of sustainable development with the obligatory separation of ecological, social and directly financial-economic groups of indicators. A definition of the financial-economic security management from the position of strategic management is presented as follows: a set of the most significant decisions directed towards ensuring a programmed level of security of the enterprise. The relationship between the financial-economic security management strategy and the mechanisms of business process reengineering is demonstrated.</jats:p>"

According to the results of the research, it is identified that in turbulent economy conditions to improve the financial and economic state of business processes at domestic enterprises, there is a need to use innovative and progressive technologies, one of which is the reengineering technology. The main goal of business process reengineering is qualitative improvement of specific spheres of activity of enterprises. The essence of the formation of business processes of enterprise is the development and adaptation of the enterprise management system in accordance with modern challenges in the conditions of digitalization. For each business process, an aggregate of input resources, rules of work and expected results are formed. The digitalization technologies to provide the reengineering of business processes at enterprise allow to organize the most personalized interaction, which is preferred by most customers. Digital communication channels, artificial intelligence, robotics – all this should be implemented by the enterprise to achieve success. The digital transformation of business processes at enterprise is designed to provide conditions for making effective managerial decisions in order to quickly adapt the work to the requirements of our time and meet the needs of consumers. The process of providing the reengineering of business processes at enterprise on the basis of digitalization opens up opportunities for innovative ways of their development, which has become effective due to the large number of the instruments used.</jats:p>"
