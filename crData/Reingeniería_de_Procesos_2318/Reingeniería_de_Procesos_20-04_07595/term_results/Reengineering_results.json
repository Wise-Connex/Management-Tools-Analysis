      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to reengineering of technological processes - a method of their qualitative transformation on an innovative basis, which in turn assumes the availability of tools that make it possible to establish the economic efficiency and technical capability of such transformations of construction production, to identify the effect of their implementation. In this regard, the problem of forming a parametric model of reengineering of construction technological processes, which involves four enlarged groups of indicators that reflect the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the processes: materials used, working time, machine time, spatial organization, is considered. It is established that parameters can have either an absolute (physical, cost) or relative (point, percentage) expression and also make their own decomposition. The practical significance of the provisions given in the article is determined by the development of methods of technical rationing, which leads to a reduction in the cost and duration of construction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ordinary information get to control framework is to keep up the specific sharing composite Personal Health Information Records (PHIRs)in health center, operations from different health centers in cloud major research looks into in the present IT. A PHIR administration license a patient to making, overseeing, and controlling the individual wellbeing information in one spot through the web, which has made the extra room, recovery, and appropriation of the clinical data progressively effective. Uncommonly, every patient is secure the full control of clinical records and can impart the wellbeing information to an enormous scope of clients with social insurance donors and relatives. Because of the significant expense of building and keep up secured and specific server, numerous PHIR administrations are redistributed to make accessible by client from specialist organizations. Decentralized server farms the emission of CO2 is high and nature get spoiled and polluted by making reusable datacenters the data's or information's can shared through the PHIR's. By this we can keep away from the high emission of CO2, the adaptability; accessibility and similarity are increments according to Moore's law. To share the cutting edge data's from other server farm information with reusable asset and e-Health Care Service in Ethiopian health center.</jats:p>"
