          "abstract": "<jats:p>Drill cuttings are available in every well drilled and NMR is a powerful tool for characterization of rocks and fluids. It is thus desirable if useful petrophysical information can be derived from NMR drill cutting analysis. However, previous studies have shown that there are many uncertainties associated with cutting analysis by using NMR, such as (1) the small cutting size may not be representative of the formation rock pore system, and (2) the effect of drilling fluids which may penetrate and clog the pore space may result in uncertain pore typing and pore surface characterization.  In this paper, based on a detailed methodology evaluation study using cuttings with different rock types, cutting sizes, and with different mud contaminations, we present experimental evidence to show (1) the best operational practices to remove mud and excess fluid contamination, and (2) the minimal cutting size required to obtain useful petrophysical information. In addition, we will also provide recommended cuttings preparation procedures and set the practical expectations for NMR drilling cutting analysis.</jats:p>"
