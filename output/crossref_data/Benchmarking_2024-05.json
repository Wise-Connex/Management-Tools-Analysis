The present research conducts a detailed comparative analysis of three prominent large language models—ChatGPT, Mistral, and Llama—utilizing the Hugging Face platform to benchmark their performance across multiple dimensions, including computational efficiency, linguistic accuracy, and ethical alignment. Results indicate that while each model exhibits unique strengths, they also possess distinct limitations which can guide future enhancements. Specifically, ChatGPT excels in linguistic accuracy, Llama in adaptability across languages, and Mistral offers novel approaches in complex language processing. This benchmarking exercise provides critical insights into the current capabilities of large language models, highlighting areas for potential improvement and suggesting avenues for future research to enhance their effectiveness and ethical alignment. The findings showed the necessity for ongoing evaluations to support the development of AI technologies that are both powerful and aligned with ethical standards. The exploration of hybrid models that combine the strengths of these existing systems could pave the way for the next generation of language models that are not only more efficient and accurate but also more aligned with human values and ethical standards.</p>"

There has been little benchmarking of approaches for determining which signatures are present in a sample and estimating the number of mutations due to each signature. This problem is referred to as “signature attribution”. We show that there are often many combinations of signatures that can reconstruct the patterns of mutations in a sample reasonably well, even after encouraging sparse solutions. We benchmarked thirteen approaches to signature attribution, including a new approach called Presence Attribute Signature Activity (PASA), on large synthetic data sets (2,700 synthetic samples in total). These data sets recapitulated the single-base, insertion-deletion, and doublet-base mutational signature repertoires of 9 cancer types. For single-base substitution mutations, PASA and MuSiCal outperformed other approaches on all the cancer types combined. However, the ranking of approaches varied by cancer type. For doublet-base substitutions and small insertions and deletions, while PASA outperformed the other approaches in most of the nine cancer types, the ranking of approaches again varied by cancer type. We believe this variation reflects inherent difficulties in signature attribution. These difficulties stem from the fact that there are often many attributions that can reasonably explain the pattern of mutations in a sample and from the combinatorial search space due to the need to impose sparsity. Tables herein can provide guidance on the selection of mutational signature attribution approaches that are best suited to particular cancer types and study objectives.</jats:p>"

As most benchmarking experiments test object detection models with a variety of objects, it is essential to test the models using images of more relevant objects to find the most suitable algorithm. The models are tested using still images from the COCO database. Pretrained models employing five of the most popular object detection algorithms are used to process the images and find each model’s detection accuracy. To simulate real life scenarios, these objects may be partially hidden or at a distance. For each image, the models return a list of detections providing the names, confidence rating, and location of each object detected. These results will be filtered to remove detections with low confidence ratings as well as detections of irrelevant objects. The remaining results are compared to the dataset of object names and locations provided by the COCO database to calculate the distance between the predicted object locations and the true location. The algorithms will be ranked based on the number of failed detections, the time taken to analyze each image, and the accuracy of each object’s determined location.</jats:p>"

The lack of positive samples prevents us from examining the performance of NIPT algorithms on detecting trisomy on other chromosomes. Recently, we have introduced an efficient computational method to generate positive samples with trisomy from negative samples. In this paper, we applied the simulation method to generate 4600 positive samples for all 22 autosomal chromosomes as well as the X chromosome in females; and reused 1250 negative samples to assess the performance of algorithms CNVKit, WisecondorX, and VINIPT in detecting numerical chromosome aberrations. Experiments showed that WisecondorX had a sensitivity of 99.95% and a specificity of 97.2% on determining trisomy aberrations. VINIPT could detect all positive samples (i.e., sensitivity of 100%) and correctly determined 99.4% negative samples (i.e., specificity of 99.4%). The CNVkit algorithm was not as accurate as the WisecondorX and VINIPT algorithms. Its performance on some chromosomes such as chromosome 19 needs to be improved. WisecondorX and VINIPT could serve as reliable tools for analyzing NIPT data.</jats:p>"

However, accurately modeling CT states remains challenging, even with modern implementations of (time-dependent) density functional theory [(TD-)DFT], especially in a dielectric environment. To identify short-comings and improve the methodology, we previously established the STGABS27 benchmark set with highly accurate experimental references for the adiabatic energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (∆EST). Here, we diversify this set to the STGABS27-EMS benchmark by including experimental emission energies (Eem) and use this new set to (re)-evaluate various DFT-based approaches. Surprisingly, these tests demonstrate that a state-specific (un)restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (U/ROKS) DFT coupled with a polarizable continuum model for perturbative state-specific non-equilibrium solvation (ptSS-PCM) provides exceptional accuracy for predicting Eem over a wide range of density functionals. In contrast, the main workhorse of the field, Tamm-Dancoff-approximated TD-DFT (TDA-DFT) paired with the same ptSS-PCM, is distinctly less accurate and strongly functional dependent. More importantly, while TDA-DFT requires the choice of two very different density functionals for good performance on either ∆EST or Eem, the time-independent U/ROKS/PCM approaches deliver excellent accuracy for both quantities with a wide variety of functionals.</jats:p>"

To effectively train and fine-tune this massive model, we integrate PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) [1], [2] for distributed training and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (Q-LoRA) [7] for efficient fine-tuning. We address challenges associated with distributed training, including communication overhead and synchronization complexities, through optimization strategies like gradient accumulation, optimizer state sharding, and mixed precision training. Additionally, we employ advanced training techniques such as Curriculum Learning, Dynamic Batch Sizing, and Adaptive Optimization Algorithms to enhance model performance and training efficiency. Our primary focus is evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned Llama 3 70B model on two widely-recognized code generation benchmarks: HumanEval [8] and MBPP [9]. HumanEval assesses the model's ability to translate natural language problem descriptions into functionally correct code, while MBPP evaluates its proficiency in solving complex programming problems by generating accurate Python code. We present detailed performance results on these benchmarks, analyzing the model's strengths and limitations in various code generation scenarios. Furthermore, we compare the impact of our training and fine-tuning methodologies on scalability, memory efficiency, and training speed, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our approach. This benchmark study offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners exploring the application of LLMs for code generation. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of Llama 3 70B's capabilities, sheds light on the effectiveness of various training and fine-tuning techniques, and emphasizes the importance of rigorous benchmark evaluation in driving progress within this rapidly evolving field.</jats:p>"

Efficient bioinformatics tools, such as read alignment and variant calling, are essential for processing massive amounts of sequencing data. To increase the analysis speed, multiple software and hardware acceleration strategies have been developed. This study comprehensively evaluated germline variant calling via the GPU-based acceleration tool BaseNumber using WGS datasets from various sources. These included standard whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) and the Golden Standard of China Genome (GSCG) projects, resequenced GSCG samples, and 100 in-house samples from the Genome Sequencing of Rare Diseases (GSRD) project. The variant calling outputs were compared to the reference and the results generated by the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline.\nResults\n BaseNumber demonstrated high precision (99.32%) and recall (99.86%) rates in variant calls compared to the standard reference. The output comparison between the BaseNumber and GATK pipelines yielded nearly identical results, with a mean F1 score of 99.69%. Additionally, BaseNumber took 23 minutes on average to analyze a 48X WGS sample, which was 215.33 times faster than the GATK workflow.\nConclusions\n The GPU-based BaseNumber provides a highly accurate and ultrafast variant calling capability, significantly improving WGS analysis efficiency and facilitating time-sensitive tests, such as clinical WGS genetic diagnosis. This study also sheds light on the GPU-based acceleration of other omics data analyses.</p>"

The imperative requirement in delivering the projects to ensure business success and continuity calls for a strategic decision to produce and design a methodology to benchmark the projects for a comprehensive data portfolio management, which is crucial for maximizing the value of data projects to the organization. This paper outlines a novel approach on how Upstream Data innovate a portfolio benchmarking process to quantitatively assess the complexity of the projects by utilizing a modified Diamond Framework Model referred to as the Pentagon Model with the following objectives in mind: Improve resource planning and allocation efficiencyConduct a thorough project risk assessment and value realizationAnalyze project benefits and assess possible business impactIdentify appropriate project management approaches and styles</jats:p>"

Typically, this is achieved by immunohistological analyses, cell sorting, or single-cell RNA-sequencing. Alternatively, cell-specific DNA methylome information can be leveraged to deconvolve cell fractions from a bulk DNA mixture. However, comprehensive benchmarking of deconvolution methods and modalities was not yet performed. Here we evaluate 16 deconvolution algorithms, developed either specifically for DNA methylome data or more generically. We assess the performance of these algorithms, and the effect of normalization methods, while modeling variables that impact deconvolution performance, including cell abundance, cell type similarity, reference panel size, method for methylome profiling (array or sequencing), and technical variation. We observe differences in algorithm performance depending on each these variables, emphasizing the need for tailoring deconvolution analyses. The complexity of the reference, marker selection method, number of marker loci and, for sequencing-based assays, sequencing depth have a marked influence on performance. By developing handles to select the optimal analysis configuration, we provide a valuable source of information for studies aiming to deconvolve array- or sequencing-based methylation data.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Genomic surveillance is crucial for identifying at-risk populations for targeted malaria control and elimination. Identity-by-descent (IBD) is increasingly being used in<jats:italic>Plasmodium</jats:italic>population genomics to estimate genetic relatedness, effective population size (N<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>), population structure, and signals of positive selection. Despite its potential, a thorough evaluation of IBD segment detection tools for species with high recombination rates, such as<jats:italic>P. falciparum</jats:italic>, remains absent. Here, we perform comprehensive benchmarking of IBD callers — probabilistic (hmmIBD, isoRelate), identity-by-state-based (hap-IBD, phased IBD) and others (Refined IBD) — using population genetic simulations tailored for high recombination, and IBD quality metrics at both the IBD segment level and the IBD-based downstream inference level. Our results demonstrate that low marker density per genetic unit, related to high recombination relative to mutation, significantly compromises the accuracy of detected IBD segments. In genomes with high recombination rates resembling<jats:italic>P. falciparum</jats:italic>, most IBD callers exhibit high false negative rates for shorter IBD segments, which can be partially mitigated through optimization of IBD caller parameters, especially those related to marker density. Notably, IBD detected with optimized parameters allows for more accurate capture of selection signals and population structure; IBD-based N<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>inference is very sensitive to IBD detection errors, with IBD called from hmmIBD uniquely providing less biased estimates of N<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>in this context. Validation with empirical data from the MalariaGEN Pf7 database, representing different transmission settings, corroborates these findings. We conclude that context-specific evaluation and parameter optimization are essential for accurate IBD detection in high-recombining species and recommend hmmIBD for quality-sensitive analysis, such as estimation of N<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>in these species. Our optimization and high-level benchmarking methods not only improve IBD segment detection in high-recombining genomes but also enhance overall genomic analysis, paving the way for more accurate genomic surveillance and targeted intervention strategies for malaria.</jats:p>"

Given the severe challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and military actions, the resilience of the regional tourism business becomes particularly relevant. The methods used in the study, including factor and cluster analysis, the method of taxonomy, and dendrograms, have enabled the development of development programs for two clusters of hotels: those located in areas with increased military risk and those in relatively safe territories. The taxonomic analysis revealed significant differences in managerial practices and operational efficiency, largely determined by the geographic location of the hotels. Hotels in active combat zones experience a 40% reduction in tourist flow and financial instability, while hotels in safe areas demonstrate a 30% higher level of customer satisfaction. The application of advanced security systems and modern marketing techniques has led to a 40% reduction in incidents.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p> In small area estimation, it is sometimes necessary to use model-based methods to produce estimates in areas with little or no data. In official statistics, we often require that aggregates of small area estimates agree with national estimates for internal consistency purposes. Enforcing this agreement is referred to as benchmarking, and while methods currently exist to perform benchmarking, few are ideal for applications with non-normal outcomes and benchmarks with uncertainty. Fully Bayesian benchmarking is a theoretically appealing approach insofar as we can obtain posterior distributions conditional on a benchmarking constraint. However, existing implementations may be computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we critically review benchmarking methods in the context of small area estimation in low- and middle-income countries with binary outcomes and uncertain benchmarks, and propose a novel approach in which posterior samples of small area characteristics from an unbenchmarked model can be combined with a rejection sampler or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to produce benchmarked posterior distributions in a computationally efficient way. To illustrate the flexibility and efficiency of our approach, we provide comparisons to an existing benchmarking approach in a simulation, and applications to HIV prevalence and under-5 mortality estimation. Code implementing our methodology is available in the R package stbench. </jats:p>"

However, their CO‐poising is a critical hitch for large‐scale applications, so the researchers are exerting huge efforts to solve this issue. The exponentially increasing attention in this field pressures the researchers to publish their findings quickly, leading to unavoidable flawed evaluation parameters for the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts. The CO oxidation (CO<jats:sub>Oxid</jats:sub>) is highly sensitive to various factors. Thus, it is urgent to afford a deeper understanding of the inherent CO<jats:sub>Oxid</jats:sub> activity of state‐of‐the‐art electrocatalysts and adopt accurate guidelines for researchers to test, optimize, and compare their electrocatalysts. This review provides exactitude in the evaluation and precise assessment of the key descriptors related to electrocatalysts (i. e., effect of both size, shape, and support) and CO oxidation (i. e., effect of electrolyte, working electrode, and CO surface diffusion). This is besides the fundamental aspects (i. e., CO<jats:sub>Oxid</jats:sub> Process, mechanism, measurements, calculations, thermodynamics, and kinetics). Various experimental results from our group and others besides in‐situ analysis were provided to support our deep discussion.

We investigated the missing data patterns and evaluate the imputation performance in Simons Powering Autism Research (SPARK), a large-scale autism cohort consists of over 117,000 participants. Four common methods were assessed – Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), MissForest, and Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders (MIDAS). In a complete subset of 15,196 autism participants, we simulated three types of missingness patterns. We observed that MIDAS and KNN performed the best as the rate of random missingness increased and when blockwise missingness was simulated. The average computational times for MIDAS and KNN were 10 minutes, 35 minutes for MissForest, and 290 minutes for MICE. MIDAS and KNN both provide promising imputation performance in mental and behavioral health survey data that exhibit blockwise missingness patterns.</jats:p>"

However, the functional involvement and specificity of thalamic nuclei in human neuroimaging work is underappreciated and not well studied due, in part, to technical challenges of accurately identifying and segmenting nuclei. This challenge is further exacerbated by a lack of common nomenclature for comparing segmentation methods. Here, we use data from healthy young (Human Connectome Project, n = 100) and older healthy adults, plus those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, n = 540), to benchmark four state-of-the-art thalamic segmentation methods for T1 MRI (FreeSurfer, histogram-based polynomial synthesis [HIPS]-THOMAS, synthesized contrast segmentation [SCS]-convolutional neural network [CNN], and T1-THOMAS) under a single segmentation framework. Segmentations were compared using overlap and dissimilarity metrics to the Morel stereotaxic atlas, a widely accepted thalamic atlas. We also quantified each method’s estimation of thalamic nuclear degeneration across Alzheimer’s disease progression, and how accurately early and late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease could be distinguished from healthy controls. We show that the HIPS-THOMAS approach produced the most effective segmentations of individual thalamic nuclei relative to the Morel atlas, and was also most accurate in discriminating healthy controls from those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease using individual nucleus volumes. This latter result was different when using whole thalamus volumes, where the SCS-CNN approach was the most accurate in classifying healthy controls. This work is the first to systematically compare the efficacy of anatomical thalamic segmentation approaches under a unified nomenclature. We also provide recommendations of which segmentation method to use for studying the functional relevance of specific thalamic nuclei, based on their overlap and dissimilarity with the Morel atlas.</jats:p>"

A content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system using deep neural networks has been successfully devised for digital pathology. No CBIR system for oral pathology has been investigated because of the lack of an extensive image database and feature extractors tailored to oral pathology. This study uses a large CBIR database constructed from 30 categories of oral tumors to compare deep learning methods as feature extractors. The highest average area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was achieved by models trained on database images using self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (0.900 with SimCLR; 0.897 with TiCo). The generalizability of the models was validated using query images from the same cases taken with smartphones. When smartphone images were tested as queries, both models yielded the highest mean AUC (0.871 with SimCLR and 0.857 with TiCo). We ensured the retrieved image result would be easily observed by evaluating the top-10 mean accuracy and checking for an exact diagnostic category and its differential diagnostic categories. Therefore, training deep learning models with SSL methods using image data specific to the target site is beneficial for CBIR tasks in oral tumor histology to obtain histologically meaningful results and high performance. This result provides insight into the effective development of a CBIR system to help improve the accuracy and speed of histopathology diagnosis and advance oral tumor research in the future.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>The networked architecture of the brain promotes synchrony among neuronal populations and the emergence of coherent dynamics. These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearson's correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.</jats:p>"

Model inflow conditions were derived from the nacelle anemometry of the wake-creating wind farm and a mesoscale simulation. The comparison reveals that the model results show in general a good approximation of the wake losses, but underestimate the increase of losses in stable stability conditions.

          "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2023, the European Union (EU) enacted the Regulation on Batteries and Waste Batteries (hereinafter referred to as the New Law on Batteries), which strengthens the regulatory framework for the entire lifecycle of power batteries. This development presents both challenges and opportunities for global power battery manufacturers and operators. As a significant player in the global power battery industry chain and the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles and power batteries, China must systematically assess the impact of global battery management strategies, including the EU’s New Law on Batteries, from a lifecycle perspective. This understanding is crucial for maintaining China’s competitive edge in the global power battery market and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes in international trade negotiations. This paper constructs a strategy analysis framework based on the lifecycle approach. By summarizing the power battery management strategies of both the EU and China, it provides a comprehensive overview of strategies across different countries, highlights the key regulatory focus areas, and offers relevant strategy recommendations. The main conclusions and insights are as follows: (1) The New Law on Batteries achieves lifecycle regulation from “cradle” to “grave” and back to “cradle”. (2) China emphasizes the management of waste power batteries, with an increasingly robust strategy system at the recycling stage, yet lacks comprehensive measures for other lifecycle stages. (3) The EU has established a comprehensive lifecycle strategy management system centered on the New Law on Batteries, characterized by strong coordination and a synergistic combination of strategies across different sectors. Finally, this paper identifies three major compliance challenges posed by the New Law on Batteries, necessitating enhanced strategy development and implementation in the areas of carbon footprint management, circular economy, and digital battery passports.</jats:p>"

Phonocardiogram (PCG) combined with modern digital processing techniques, provides a complementary tool for clinicians. This article proposes a benchmark different time-frequency representations, which are spectogram, mel-spectogram and cochleagram for obtaining images, in addition to the use of two interpolation techniques to improve the quality of the images, which are Bicubic and Lanczos. Deep features are extracted from a pre-trained model called VGG16 and for feature reduction the Boruta algorithm is applied. To evaluate the models and obtain more precise results, nested cross-validation is used. The best results achieved in this study were for coclegram with 99.2% accuracy and mel-spectogram representation with the bicubic interpolation technique which reached 99.4% accuracy, both having support vector machine (SVM) as classifier 10 algorithm. Overall, this study highlights the potential of time-frequency representations of PCG 11 signals combined with modern digital processing techniques and machine learning algorithms for 12 accurate diagnosis of VHD.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Advances in quantum computers may pose a significant threat to existing public-key encryption methods, which are crucial to the current infrastructure of cyber security. Both RSA and ECDSA, the two most widely used security algorithms today, may be (in principle) solved by the Shor algorithm in polynomial time due to its ability to efficiently solve the discrete logarithm problem, potentially making present infrastructures insecure against a quantum attack. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reacted with the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process to develop and optimize a series of post-quantum algorithms (PQAs) based on difficult mathematical problems that are not susceptible to being solved by Shor’s algorithm. Whilst high-powered computers can run these PQAs efficiently, further work is needed to investigate and benchmark the performance of these algorithms on lower-powered (constrained) devices and the ease with which they may be integrated into existing protocols such as TLS. This paper provides quantitative benchmark and handshake performance data for the most recently selected PQAs from NIST, tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 device to simulate today’s IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and provides quantitative comparisons with previous benchmarking data on a range of constrained systems. CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium are shown to be the most efficient PQAs in the key encapsulation and signature algorithms, respectively, with Falcon providing the optimal TLS handshake size.</jats:p>"

The relevance of this problem thus provided the motivation to develop methods for the application of quantum resources to estimation protocols. Within this context, Bayesian estimation offers a complete framework for optimal quantum metrology techniques, such as adaptive protocols. However, the use of the Bayesian approach requires extensive computational resources, especially in the multiparameter estimations that represent the typical operational scenario for quantum sensors. Hence, the requirement to characterize protocols implementing Bayesian estimations can become a significant challenge. This work focuses on the crucial task of robustly benchmarking the performances of these protocols in both single and multiple-parameter scenarios. By comparing different figures of merits, evidence is provided in favor of using the median of the quadratic error in the estimations in order to mitigate spurious effects due to the numerical discretization of the parameter space, the presence of limited data, and numerical instabilities. These results, providing a robust and reliable characterization of Bayesian protocols, find natural applications to practical problems within the quantum estimation framework.</jats:p>"

This selection of metaheuristics will be subjected to an analysis of their performance using a set of problems selected from different authors. The problems selected for this analysis include problems with a single minimum or multiple minima, different sizes in terms of dimensions, and different types of mathematical functions such as polynomial, trigonometric, or exponential. The analysis offers a discussion of which scenarios are the best for each metaheuristic, analyzing aspects such as the ability of metaheuristics to explore and escape local minima. The article concludes by summarizing which metaheuristic is best for each type of problem.\n\nKeywords: Metaheuristics, benchmark, optimization problems, biological-based metaheuristics</jats:p>"

This imaging modality relies on optical excitation of an absorber followed by production of ultrasound through the photoacoustic effect, resulting in high spatial resolution with imaging depths in the cm range. Although fluorescence brightness has guided the design and optimization of improved fluorophores for fluorescence imaging, no such benchmarking parameter exists for PAI. Consequently, there is no consensus on rational design strategies to improve photoacoustic signal from small molecule dyes. Herein, we disclose the discovery of the first benchmarking parameter for small molecule dye performance in PAI, which we term the acoustic loudness factor (ALF). Importantly, ALF can predict PAI performance without the need for access to photoacoustic instrumentation. ALF enables the prediction of PAI performance for common dye classes and can be used to guide the systematic evaluation of design strategies to enhance PAI performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that enhancements in ALF are directly translatable to in vivo PAI. Akin to the use of fluorescence brightness in fluorophore design and evaluation for fluorescence imaging, we anticipate that ALF will guide the design and evaluation of improved probes for PAI.</jats:p>"

With this unification of functionality, MolScore re-implements commonly used benchmarks in the field (such as GuacaMol, MOSES, and MolOpt). Moreover, new benchmarks can be created trivially.

Improving operational efficiency is crucial for reducing overall emissions and combating climate change. Therefore, recognizing more efficient approaches and solutions with reduced carbon footprints is essential in creating future business continuity. This paper presents the application of machine learning optimization techniques in carbon emission management through technical limit performance benchmark. A Machine Learning (ML) model utilizing basic drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), rotary speed (RPM), penetration rate (ROP), and torque (TOR) was used to estimate instantaneous Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) within the technical limit of operational performance across the different Lithologies. Supervised learning algorithm with 70:30 data splits using four ML algorithms, including Random Forest, support vector regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and Categories boost, was utilized in the prediction. The estimation was then leveraged to determine the maximum achievable penetration rate baseline for various lithologies based on rock drillability. Enabling a comparative assessment between actual drilling performance against an engineered technical limit drill rate performance as well as the expected greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). A case study using a field dataset showed that the models predicted instantaneous UCS based on the low- cost drilling parameters other than using the high-cost well-log and core sample techniques. Prediction accuracy was within the acceptable margin of error with CatBoost and ANN as best predictors, with correlation coefficient (R2 ) values of 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. The defined baseline performance benchmark improved drilling performance by 30-60% with a reduction in CO2 emissions across the project by 20 tCO2e emissions, equivalent to a 50% reduction in carbon emissions. The result of this research is essential for the continuous improvement in drilling carbon emission, performance monitoring, and improvement of overall drilling performance.</jats:p>"

One of the most malware-attacked mobile operating systems today is Android. In response to this threat, this paper presents research on the functionalities and performance of different malicious Android application package analysis tools, including one that uses machine learning techniques. In addition, it investigates how these tools streamline the detection, classification, and analysis of malicious Android Application Packages (APKs) for Android operating system devices. As a result of the research included in this article, it can be highlighted that the AndroPytool, a tool that uses machine learning (ML) techniques, obtained the best results with an accuracy of 0.986, so it can be affirmed that the tools that use artificial intelligence techniques used in this study are more efficient in terms of detection capacity. On the other hand, of the online tools analysed, Virustotal and Pithus obtained the best results. Based on the above, new approaches can be suggested in the specification, design, and development of new tools that help to analyse, from a cybersecurity point of view, the code of applications developed for this environment.</jats:p>"

The study's relevance arises from the increasing adoption of new teaching methods in the education system, particularly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates rethinking the learning process. Benchmarking technologies aim to enhance these processes by leveraging best practices from leading universities globally. Purpose. The study aims to assess university students' readiness for independent work and evaluate the outcomes of preparing students for independent work using benchmarking technology. Methodology. An experiment was conducted in three stages: collecting information, developing and testing the methodology, and integrating the methodology into the educational process. The study was carried out at Sh. Ualikhanov Kokshetau University. Results. The study revealed the degree of readiness of university students for independent work using benchmarking technology. The focus was on how benchmarking technology improves the educational process and the development of self-educational components. Systematic diagnostics and constant adjustments helped achieve planned results in organizing independent work. Conclusions. The proposed methodology for organizing students' independent work enhances future graduates' competitiveness, creativity, stress resistance, communication skills, and professional development capabilities.

Unlike standard 1-to-1 communication, the unique challenge posed by n-to-n communication in IoT is that messages must not be encrypted for a single recipient but for a group of recipients. For this reason, using Secure Group Communication (SGC) schemes is necessary to encrypt n-to-n communication efficiently for large group sizes. To this end, the literature presents various SGC schemes with varying features, performance profiles, and architectures, making the selection process challenging. A selection from this multitude of SGC schemes should best be made based on a benchmark that provides an overview of the performance of the schemes. Such a benchmark would make it much easier for developers to select an SGC scheme, but such a benchmark still needs to be created. This paper aims to close this gap by presenting a benchmark for SGC schemes that focus on IoT. Since the design of a benchmark first requires the definition of the underlying business problems, we defined suitable problems for using SGC schemes in the IoT sector as the first step. We identified a common problem for the centralized and decentralized/hybrid SGC schemes, whereas the distributed/contributory SGC schemes required defining an independent business problem. Based on these business problems, we first designed a specification-based benchmark, which we then extended to a hybrid benchmark through corresponding implementations. Finally, we deployed our hybrid benchmark in a typical IoT environment and measured and compared the performance of different SGC schemes. Our findings reveal notable impacts on calculation times and storage requirements without a trusted Central Instance (CI) in distributed/contributory SGC schemes.</jats:p>"

In pursuit of this goal, large cancer cell line panels have successfully been studied to elucidate the relationship between cellular features and treatment response. Due to the high dimensionality of these datasets, machine learning (ML) is commonly used for their analysis. However, choosing a suitable algorithm and set of input features can be challenging. We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of ML methods and dimension reduction (DR) techniques for predicting drug response metrics. Using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer cell line panel, we trained random forests, neural networks, boosting trees and elastic nets for 179 anti-cancer compounds with feature sets derived from nine DR approaches. We compare the results regarding statistical performance, runtime and interpretability. Additionally, we provide strategies for assessing model performance compared with a simple baseline model and measuring the trade-off between models of different complexity. Lastly, we show that complex ML models benefit from using an optimized DR strategy, and that standard models—even when using considerably fewer features—can still be superior in performance.</jats:p>"

Discovery and use of quality chemical probes propel exciting developments for developing drugs in therapeutic areas with unmet clinical needs. Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK) serves as a possible therapeutic target in a plethora of diseases, including inflammatory diseases, cancer etc. Recent years have seen substantial increase in interest in exploring MLCK biology. However, there is only one widely used MLCK modulator, namely ML-7, that too with a narrow working concentration window and high toxicity profile leading to limited insights. Herein, we report the identification of a potent and highly selective chemical probe, Myokinasib-II, from the synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of a focussed indotropane-based compound collection. Notably, it is structurally distinct from ML-7 and hence, meets the need for an alternative inhibitor to study MLCK biology as per the recommended best practices. Moreover, our extensive benchmarking studies demonstrate that Myokinasib-II displays better potency, better selectivity profile and no non-specific interference in relevant assays as compared to other known MLCK inhibitors.</jats:p>"

This initiative collects surgical process data from over 320 German, Austrian, and Swiss hospitals. The data exhibits high levels of quantity, quality, standardization, and multi-dimensionality, making it especially valuable for operating room planning in Operations Research. We consider detailed steps of the perioperative process and group the data with respect to the hospital’s level of care, the surgery specialty, and the type of surgery patient. We compare case mixes for different subgroups and conclude that they differ significantly, demonstrating that it is necessary to test operating room planning methods in different settings, e.g., using data sets like ours. Further, we discuss limitations and future research directions. Finally, we encourage the extension and foundation of new operating room benchmarking initiatives and their usage for operating room planning.</jats:p>"

However, somatic variants may occur at low fractions due to contamination from normal cells or tumor heterogeneity; this poses a significant challenge for standard HTS analysis pipelines. The problem is exacerbated in scenarios with minimal tumor DNA, such as circulating tumor DNA in plasma. Assessing sensitivity and detection of HTS approaches in such cases is paramount, but time-consuming and expensive: specialized experimental protocols and a sufficient quantity of samples are required for processing and analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new computational approach specifically designed for the generation of artificial datasets suitable for this task, simulating ultra-deep targeted sequencing data with low-fraction variants and demonstrating their effectiveness in benchmarking low-fraction variant calling.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our approach enables the generation of artificial raw reads that mimic real data without relying on pre-existing data by using NEAT, a fine-grained read simulator that generates artificial datasets using models learned from multiple different datasets. Then, it incorporates low-fraction variants to simulate somatic mutations in samples with minimal tumor DNA content. To prove the suitability of the created artificial datasets for low-fraction variant calling benchmarking, we used them as ground truth to evaluate the performance of widely-used variant calling algorithms: they allowed us to define tuned parameter values of major variant callers, considerably improving their detection of very low-fraction variants.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our findings highlight both the pivotal role of our approach in creating adequate artificial datasets with low tumor fraction, facilitating rapid prototyping and benchmarking of algorithms for such dataset type, as well as the important need of advancing low-fraction variant calling techniques.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

To facilitate a broader assessment of scholarship in consumer research, we provide detailed statistics on the productivity and citation impact of the field’s 340 main gatekeepers: the editors, associate editors, and editorial board members of the Journal of Consumer Research and the Journal of Consumer Psychology. In addition, we introduce a new metric, called the p-index, which can be interpreted as an indicator of a researcher’s propensity for thought leadership. Using this metric, we show that productivity and thought leadership do not necessarily go hand in hand in consumer research and that a combination of the two is a good predictor of the level of esteem that consumer scholars enjoy among their peers and of the receipt of major career awards. Our analyses provide greater transparency into how productivity, citation impact, and propensity for thought leadership are currently distributed among prominent consumer scholars. Furthermore, the detailed descriptive statistics reported can serve as useful benchmarks against which other consumer researchers’ records may be meaningfully compared.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate and complete de novo assembled genomes sustain variant identification and catalyze the discovery of new genomic features and biological functions. However, accurate and precise de novo assemblies of large and complex genomes remains a challenging task. Long-read sequencing data alone or in hybrid mode combined with more accurate short-read sequences facilitate the de novo assembly of genomes. A number of software exists for de novo genome assembly from long-read data although specific performance comparisons to assembly human genomes are lacking. Here we benchmarked 11 different pipelines including four long-read only assemblers and three hybrid assemblers, combined with four polishing schemes for de novo genome assembly of a human reference material sequenced with Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina. In addition, the best performing choice was validated in a non-reference routine laboratory sample. Software performance was evaluated by assessing the quality of the assemblies with QUAST, BUSCO, and Merqury metrics, and the computational costs associated with each of the pipelines were also assessed. We found that Flye was superior to all other assemblers, especially when relying on Ratatosk error-corrected long-reads. Polishing improved the accuracy and continuity of the assemblies and the combination of two rounds of Racon and Pilon achieved the best results. The assembly of the non-reference sample showed comparable assembly metrics as those of the reference material. Based on the results, a complete optimal analysis pipeline for the assembly, polishing, and contig curation developed on Nextflow is provided to enable efficient parallelization and built-in dependency management to further advance in the generation of high-quality and chromosome-level human assemblies.</jats:p>"

The results from stepwise benchmarking are based on the underlying outranking procedure. To show the effectiveness of the approach, we used ELECTRE III as the method to rank European countries on the progress on equality of educational opportunities and then applied stepwise benchmarking to provide policy recommendations.

Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the average algorithm running time does not differ much across containers, especially those that support dynamic updates. Specifically, a simple container based on an off-the-shelf B-tree is only 1.22× slower on average than a highly optimized static one. Moreover, we observe that simplifying a graph-container Application Programming Interface (API) to only a few simple functions incurs a mere 1.16× slowdown compared to a complete API. Finally, we also measure batch-insert throughput in dynamic-graph containers for a full picture of their performance.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>To perform the benchmarks, we introduce BYO, a unified framework that standardizes evaluations of graph-algorithm performance across different graph containers. BYO extends the Graph Based Benchmark Suite (Dhulipala et al. 18), a state-of-the-art graph algorithm benchmark, to easily plug into different dynamic graph containers and enable fair comparisons between them on a large suite of graph algorithms. While several graph algorithm benchmarks have been developed to date, to the best of our knowledge, BYO is the first system designed to benchmark graph containers.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Downscaling global climate models (GCMs) provides crucial, high-resolution data needed for informed decision-making at regional scales. However, there is no uniform approach to select the most suitable GCMs. Over Southeast Asia (SEA), observations are sparse and have large uncertainties, complicating GCM selection especially for rainfall. To guide this selection, we apply a standardised benchmarking framework to select CMIP6 GCMs for dynamical downscaling over SEA, addressing current observational limitations. This framework identifies fit-for-purpose models through a two-step process: (a) selecting models that meet minimum performance requirements in simulating the fundamental characteristics of rainfall (e.g., bias, spatial pattern, annual cycle, and trend) and (b) selecting models from (a) to further assess whether key precipitation drivers (monsoon) and teleconnections from modes of variability are captured [El Niño-Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)]. GCMs generally exhibit wet biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the Maritime Continent. Evaluations from the first step identify 19 out of 32 GCMs that meet our minimum performance expectations in simulating rainfall. These models also consistently capture atmospheric circulations and teleconnections with modes of variability over the region but overestimate their strength. Ultimately, we identify eight GCMs meeting our performance expectations. There are obvious, high-performing GCMs from allied modelling groups, highlighting the dependency of the subset of models identified from the framework. Therefore, further tests on model independence, data availability, and future climate change spread are conducted, resulting in a final sub-set of two independent models that align with our a priori expectations for downscaling over CORDEX-SEA.\n                        </jats:p>"

As a result, many building owners have given smart retrofits (SRs) a higher priority. However, the utilisation of suitable SRs from a range of SRs has become a challenging task. The purpose of this paper is to develop a decision-making model to select the most suitable SRs for conventional office buildings and form a set of benchmarks for assessing the performance of SRs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A qualitative approach with six case studies was used. Content analysis was carried out using NVivo to explore the factors considered for the selection of SR techniques. A decision-making model for selecting SRs in Sri Lankan office buildings was proposed. SR performance benchmarks were developed by referring to established standards and studies done in tropical office buildings.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Out of 18 identified SRs from literature, fan cycling, ventilation control and LED luminaires have been recognised as commonly used SRs in Sri Lankan office buildings. Analysis showed that HVAC retrofits saved more energy, while lighting retrofits could be easily implemented in existing buildings. The proposed decision-making model can explore further improvements to enhance the performance of SRs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The selection of SRs is a comprehensive decision-making process.

This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking of SNP and indel variant calling accuracy across 14 diverse bacterial species using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Illumina sequencing. We generate gold standard reference genomes and project variations from closelyrelated strains onto them, creating biologically realistic distributions of SNPs and indels.Our results demonstrate that ONT variant calls from deep learning-based tools delivered higher SNP and indel accuracy than traditional methods and Illumina, with Clair3 providing the most accurate results overall. We investigate the causes of missed and false calls, highlighting the limitations inherent in short reads and discover that ONT’s traditional limitations with homopolymerinduced indel errors are absent with high-accuracy basecalling models and deep learning-based variant calls. Furthermore, our findings on the impact of read depth on variant calling offer valuable insights for sequencing projects with limited resources, showing that 10x depth is sufficient to achieve variant calls that match or exceed Illumina.In conclusion, our research highlights the superior accuracy of deep learning tools in SNP and indel detection with ONT sequencing, challenging the primacy of short-read sequencing. The reduction of systematic errors and the ability to attain high accuracy at lower read depths enhance the viability of ONT for widespread use in clinical and public health bacterial genomics.</jats:p>"

Previous benchmarks have provided limited insights into power consumption and latency. However, this study introduces algorithmic metrics that capture the potential and limitations of neural decoders for closed-loop intra-cortical brain–computer interfaces in the context of energy and hardware constraints. This study benchmarks common decoding methods for predicting a primate’s finger kinematics from the motor cortex and explores their suitability for low latency and high energy efficient neural decoding. The study found that ANN-based decoders provide superior decoding accuracy, requiring high latency and many operations to effectively decode neural signals. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a solution, bridging this gap by achieving competitive decoding performance within sub-10 ms while utilizing a fraction of computational resources. These distinctive advantages of neuromorphic SNNs make them highly suitable for the challenging closed-loop neural modulation environment. Their capacity to balance decoding accuracy and operational efficiency offers immense potential in reshaping the landscape of neural decoders, fostering greater understanding, and opening new frontiers in closed-loop intra-cortical human-machine interaction.</jats:p>"

Understanding and predicting their impact on computations is essential to counteract these errors with methods such as quantum error mitigation. Thus, it is necessary to construct and evaluate accurate noise models. However, the evaluation of noise models does not yet follow a systematic approach, making it nearly impossible to estimate the accuracy of a model for a given application. Therefore, we developed and present a systematic approach to benchmarking noise models for quantum computing applications. It compares the results of hardware experiments to predictions of noise models for a representative set of quantum circuits. We also construct a noise model containing five types of quantum noise and optimize its parameters using a series of training circuits. We compare its accuracy to other noise models by volumetric benchmarks involving typical variational quantum circuits. The model can easily be expanded by adding new quantum channels.</jats:p>"

This research aims to review the current methodologies for measuring embodied carbon of buildings and explore benchmarking strategies towards achieving Net Zero. The literature review covers various methodologies for measuring embodied carbon, including life cycle assessment (LCA) and Whole Building LCA. It also examines the limitations of these methodologies, such as the lack of standardisation and difficulty in measuring embodied carbon for complex building systems. The report highlights the importance of benchmarking embodied carbon, which involves comparing the embodied carbon of a building to a standard industry average. This study also explores the strategies that can be used to reduce embodied carbon in buildings, including material substitution, design optimization, and construction waste reduction. The study emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to reducing embodied carbon based on considering the entire life cycle of building materials and components. It highlights the potential benefits of implementing circular economy principles in reducing embodied carbon, as exemplified by material reuse and recycling. The study concludes that measuring embodied carbon is essential for achieving Net Zero emissions in the building industry. However, there is a need for standardisation and more robust methodologies to measure the embodied carbon of complex building systems. The study recommends the use of benchmarking as a strategy to incentivize the building industry to reduce embodied carbon. The report emphasises the importance of a holistic approach to reducing embodied carbon considering the potential benefits of implementing circular economy principles.</jats:p>"

Regional growth is influenced by innovative clusters, which facilitate research, cost reduction, and new technical application. Clusters in the IT industry, renewable energy, furniture and agro-industry are popular in Romania's Northwest Region, with Cluj-Napoca being as the capital of gold clusters. The aim of the study was to examine the clustering strategy in Romania's northwestern region, Transylvanian Furniture Cluster, IT Transylvania Cluster, AgroTransilvania Cluster and TREC Transylvania Energy Cluster from the perspective of the Gold Label assessment. The study reveals that the four gold certified clusters share the following characteristics: a formal strategy, a specific strategy that addresses internationalization, innovation, research, development, and know-how, services primarily directed at members, international and transnational collaboration with multiple countries, and national and international funding support programs. The proposed recommendations and activities can contribute to improve each cluster's strategy.</jats:p>"

Benchmark testing is a crucial step in the development and evaluation of new cellular deconvolution algorithms, and also plays a key role in the process of building and optimizing deconvolution pipelines for specific experimental applications. However, few in vivo benchmarking datasets exist, particularly for whole blood, which is the single most profiled human tissue. Here, we describe a unique dataset containing whole blood gene expression profiles and matched circulating leukocyte counts from a large cohort of human donors with utility for benchmarking cellular deconvolution pipelines.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Data description</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>To produce this dataset, venous whole blood was sampled from 138 total donors recruited at an academic medical center. Genome-wide expression profiling was subsequently performed via next-generation RNA sequencing, and white blood cell differentials were collected in parallel using flow cytometry. The resultant final dataset contains donor-level expression data for over 45,000 protein coding and non-protein coding genes, as well as matched neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

This research aims to uncover consistent patterns and explain variations in online travel ratings, comments, and reviews. To accomplish this, millions of reviews were collected from Pakistan's top online travel companies, Uber and Careem. Utilizing semantic affiliation analysis, subject terms were extracted, forming a semantic affiliation structure. The findings highlight significant differences among channels concerning topical vocabulary, subject distribution, structural traits, and community links. The network visualization results are particularly noteworthy, as they illustrate connections between key concepts and words within each topic, making them easily understandable. With the proposed logical method, we can better understand the strategic snafus in the travel sector and gain fresh insights into how to dig up popular assessments to better serve tourists, lodging establishments, and trade groups.</jats:p>"

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains : traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The results offer a deeper understanding of the forecasting methods, allowing us to better select the ones that are most suitable for particular datasets and settings. Overall, TFB and this evaluation provide researchers with improved means of designing new TSF methods.</jats:p>"

The heterogeneity and complexity of cell composition in the mammalian brain make it more challenging to accurately annotate ST data from brain. Many algorithms attempt to characterize subtypes of neuron by integrating ST data with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) or single-cell RNA sequencing. However, assessing the accuracy of these algorithms on Stereo-seq ST data remains unresolved. Here, we benchmarked 9 mapping algorithms using 10 ST datasets from four mouse brain regions in two different resolutions and 24 pseudo-ST datasets from snRNA-seq. Both actual ST data and pseudo-ST data were mapped using snRNA-seq datasets from the corresponding brain regions as reference data. After comparing the performance across different areas and resolutions of the mouse brain, we have reached the conclusion that both robust cell-type decomposition and SpatialDWLS demonstrated superior robustness and accuracy in cell-type annotation. Testing with publicly available snRNA-seq data from another sequencing platform in the cortex region further validated our conclusions. Altogether, we developed a workflow for assessing suitability of mapping algorithm that fits for ST datasets, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of spatial data annotation.</jats:p>"

First, we use our numerical method to evaluate the moments/cumulants of work done by the sudden quench process on the Ising or Haldane spin chains, and we study their behaviors across the quantum phase transitions. Our results show that, up to the fourth cumulant, the work statistics can indicate the quantum phase transition characterized by the local order parameters but barely for purely topological phase transitions. Second, we propose to use the fluctuation theorem, such as Jarzynski's equality, which relates the real-time correlator to the ratio of the thermal partition functions, as a benchmark indicator for the numerical real-time evolving methods. Third, we study the passivity of ground and thermal states of quantum spin chains under some cyclic impulse processes. We show that the passivity of thermal states and ground states under the Hermitian actions is ensured by the second laws and variational principles, respectively, and we also verify this by numerical calculations. In addition, we also consider the passivity of ground states under non-Hermitian actions, for which the variational principle cannot be applied. Despite that, we find no violation of passivity from our numerical results for all the cases considered in the Ising and Haldane chains. Overall, we demonstrate that the work statistics for the sudden quench and impulse processes can be evaluated precisely by the numerical MPS method to characterize quantum phase transitions and examine the passivity of quantum states. We also propose to exploit the universality of the fluctuation theorem to benchmark the numerical real-time evolutions in an algorithmic and model-independent way.</jats:p>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title/>\n            <jats:supplementary-material>\n              <jats:permissions>\n                <jats:copyright-statement>Published by the American Physical Society</jats:copyright-statement>\n                <jats:copyright-year>2024</jats:copyright-year>\n              </jats:permissions>\n            </jats:supplementary-material>\n          </jats:sec>"

In this work, we present a comprehensive review of existing magnetometer interference removal methods and introduce MAGPRIME (MAGnetic signal PRocessing, Interference Mitigation, and Enhancement), an open‐source Python library featuring a collection of state‐of‐the‐art interference removal algorithms. MAGPRIME streamlines the process of interference removal in magnetic field data by providing researchers with an integrated, easy‐to‐use platform. We detail the design, structure, and functionality of the library, as well as its potential to facilitate future research by enabling rapid testing and customization of interference removal methods. Using the MAGPRIME Library, we present two Monte Carlo benchmark results to compare the efficacy of interference removal algorithms in different magnetometer configurations. In Benchmark A, the Underdetermined Blind Source Separation (UBSS) and traditional gradiometry algorithms surpass the uncleaned boom‐mounted magnetometers, achieving improved correlation and reducing median error in each simulation. Benchmark B tests the efficacy of the suite of MAGPRIME algorithms in a boomless magnetometer configuration. In this configuration, the UBSS algorithm proves to significantly reduce median error, along with improvements in median correlation and signal to noise ratio. This study highlights MAGPRIME's potential in enhancing magnetic field measurement accuracy in various spacecraft designs, from traditional gradiometry setups to compact, cost‐effective alternatives like bus‐mounted CubeSat magnetometers, thus establishing it as a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in space exploration and magnetism studies.</jats:p>"

Machine Learning, artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms provide automated, intelligent and history-based solutions for complex scenarios. This paper aims to identify through a systematic review and analysis the role of artificial intelligence algorithms in photovoltaic systems analysis and control. The main novelty of this work is the exploration of methodological insights in three different ways. The first approach is to investigate the applicability of artificial intelligence techniques in photovoltaic systems. The second approach is the computational study and analysis of data operations, failure predictors, maintenance assessment, safety response, photovoltaic installation issues, intelligent monitoring etc. All these factors are discussed along with the results after applying the artificial intelligence techniques on photovoltaic systems, exploring the challenges and limitations considering a wide variety of latest related manuscripts.</jats:p>"

Numerical models are a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic processes in the interior of the Earth and other planets, but the reliability and predictive power of these discretized models depends on the numerical method as well as an accurate representation of material properties in space and time. In the specific context of geodynamic models, particle methods have been applied extensively because of their suitability for advection-dominated processes and have been used in applications such as tracking the composition of solid rock and melt in the Earth's mantle, fluids in lithospheric- and crustal-scale models, light elements in the liquid core, and deformation properties like accumulated finite strain or mineral grain size, along with many applications outside the Earth sciences. There have been significant benchmarking efforts to measure the accuracy and convergence behavior of particle methods, but these efforts have largely been limited to instantaneous solutions, or time-dependent models without analytical solutions. As a consequence, there is little understanding about the interplay of particle advection errors and errors introduced in the solution of the underlying transient, nonlinear flow equations. To address these limitations, we present two new dynamic benchmarks for transient Stokes flow with analytical solutions that allow us to quantify the accuracy of various advection methods in nonlinear flow. We use these benchmarks to measure the accuracy of our particle algorithm as implemented in the ASPECT geodynamic modeling software against commonly employed field methods and analytical solutions. In particular, we quantify if an algorithm that is higher-order accurate in time will allow for better overall model accuracy and verify that our algorithm reaches its intended optimal convergence rate. We then document that the observed increased accuracy of higher-order algorithms matters for geodynamic applications with an example of modeling small-scale convection underneath an oceanic plate and show that the predicted place and time of onset of small-scale convection depends significantly on the chosen particle advection method. Descriptions and implementations of our benchmarks are openly available and can be used to verify other advection algorithms. The availability of accurate, scalable, and efficient particle methods as part of the widely used open-source code ASPECT will allow geodynamicists to investigate complex time-dependent geodynamic processes such as elastic deformation, anisotropic fabric development, melt generation and migration, and grain damage.\n                    </jats:p>"

BAI peaked in the wettest sites (V; 10.4 cm2 yr-1; S, 10.8 cm2 yr-1). We detected a sharp BAI reduction (30% of the regional mean) in 2001 when springto-summer conditions were very dry. In the wettest V and S sites, larch growth positively responded to current March and June-July radiation, but negatively to March precipitation. In the R site, high April precipitation enhanced growth. In the driest M site, warm conditions in the late prior winter and current spring improved growth, but warm-sunny conditions in July and dry-sunny conditions in August reduced it. Larch growth positively responded to spring-summer wet conditions considering short (1-6 months) and long (9-24 months) time scales in dry (site M) and wet-intermediate (sites S and R) sites, respectively.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Discussion</jats:title><jats:p>Larch growth is vulnerable to drought stress in dry slow-growing plantations, but also to extreme spring wet-cloudy events followed by dry-hot conditions in wet fast-growing plantations.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow the profiling of the transcriptome of cells while keeping their spatial context. Since most commercial untargeted ST technologies do not yet operate at single-cell resolution, computational methods such as deconvolution are often used to infer the cell type composition of each sequenced spot. We benchmarked 11 deconvolution methods using 63 silver standards, 3 gold standards, and 2 case studies on liver and melanoma tissues. We developed a simulation engine called <jats:italic>synthspot</jats:italic> to generate silver standards from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, while gold standards are generated by pooling single cells from targeted ST data. We evaluated methods based on their performance, stability across different reference datasets, and scalability. We found that cell2location and RCTD are the top-performing methods, but surprisingly, a simple regression model outperforms almost half of the dedicated spatial deconvolution methods. Furthermore, we observe that the performance of all methods significantly decreased in datasets with highly abundant or rare cell types. Our results are reproducible in a Nextflow pipeline, which also allows users to generate synthetic data, run deconvolution methods and optionally benchmark them on their dataset (<jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/saeyslab/spotless-benchmark\">https://github.com/saeyslab/spotless-benchmark</jats:ext-link>).</jats:p>"

However, self‐extinguishing time (SET), as the most widely used evaluation method now, lacks benchmarks and heavily relies on the specific implementation of test procedures. This work systematically summarizes and investigates key test parameters. Based on repeatability and reliability, burning a glassfiber separator (Φ16 mm) with absorption of 0.1 g liquid electrolyte (LE) can be proposed as a unified method. The concept of self‐extinguishing efficiency (SEE) is further proposed with a new evaluation criterion of i) SEE≤70, Flammable; ii) 70&lt;SEE&lt;90, Flame Retarded; iii) 90≤SEE≤100, Nonflammable. The feasibility of the new protocol is verified by employment in evaluating the effects of 15 representative flame retardants (FRs) on combustion behaviors of LEs. Meanwhile, the underlying flame retardancy mechanism is revealed, indicating that preceding or simultaneous vaporization and pyrolysis of FRs in conjunction with the decomposition of LE promote mitigating electrolyte fire risk. In addition, machine learning is employed to aid in analyzing the significance of various features on SEE, providing further validation of the proposed mechanism. This work provides a benchmark for the safety evaluation of LEs, facilitating the advancement of fire‐safe batteries.</jats:p>"

Quantum mechanical calculations are too computationally intensive for routine simulation of molecules in the condensed phase, prompting the development of computationally efficient force fields based on quantum mechanical data. Parametrizing general force fields, which cover a vast chemical space, necessitates generating sizable quantum mechanical datasets with optimized geometries and torsion scans. To achieve this efficiently, it is crucial to choose a quantum mechanical method that balances computational cost and accuracy. In this study we seek to assess the accuracy of quantum mechanical theory for specific properties such as conformer energies, and torsion energetics. To comprehensively evaluate various methods, we focus on a representative set of 59 diverse small molecules, comparing approximately 25 combinations of functional and basis sets against the reference level coupled cluster calculations at complete basis set limit.</jats:p>"

Since most commercial untargeted ST technologies do not yet operate at single-cell resolution, computational methods such as deconvolution are often used to infer the cell type composition of each sequenced spot. We benchmarked 11 deconvolution methods using 63 silver standards, 3 gold standards, and 2 case studies on liver and melanoma tissues. We developed a simulation engine called <jats:italic>synthspot</jats:italic> to generate silver standards from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, while gold standards are generated by pooling single cells from targeted ST data. We evaluated methods based on their performance, stability across different reference datasets, and scalability. We found that cell2location and RCTD are the top-performing methods, but surprisingly, a simple regression model outperforms almost half of the dedicated spatial deconvolution methods. Furthermore, we observe that the performance of all methods significantly decreased in datasets with highly abundant or rare cell types. Our results are reproducible in a Nextflow pipeline, which also allows users to generate synthetic data, run deconvolution methods and optionally benchmark them on their dataset (<jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/saeyslab/spotless-benchmark\">https://github.com/saeyslab/spotless-benchmark</jats:ext-link>).</jats:p>"

The initial state is where all atoms are in their electronic ground state. We characterize the excitation dynamics using the maximum and time-averaged number of Rydberg excitations. DTWA results are different from the exact dynamics for large Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. In contrast, by increasing the number of hidden spins, the NQS can be improved but still limited to short-time dynamics. Interestingly, irrespective of interaction strengths, the time-averaged number of excitations obtained using NQS is in excellent agreement with the exact results. Concerning the calculation of quantum correlations, for instance, second-order bipartite and average two-site Rényi entropies, NQS looks more promising. Finally, we discuss the existence of a power law scaling for the initial growth of average two-site Rényi entropy.</jats:p>"

Deviations from the expected quality of care are identified by benchmarking the results of individual hospitals using national averages. This study aimed to evaluate the use of quality indicators for benchmarking hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery and when outlier hospitals could be identified.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A population-based study used data from two nationwide Dutch HPB audits (DHBA and DPCA) from 2014 to 2021. Sample size calculations determined the threshold (in percentage points) to identify centres as statistical outliers, based on current volume requirements (annual minimum of 20 resections) on a two-year period (2020–2021), covering mortality rate, failure to rescue (FTR), major morbidity rate and textbook/ideal outcome (TO) for minor liver resection (LR), major LR, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and distal pancreatectomy (DP).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In total, 10 963 and 7365 patients who underwent liver and pancreatic resection respectively were included. Benchmark and corresponding range of mortality rates were 0.6% (0 −3.2%) and 3.3% (0–16.7%) for minor and major LR, and 2.7% (0–7.0%) and 0.6% (0–4.2%) for PD and DP respectively. FTR rates were 5.4% (0–33.3%), 14.2% (0–100%), 7.5% (1.6%–28.5%) and 3.1% (0–14.9%). For major morbidity rate, corresponding rates were 9.8% (0–20.5%), 28.1% (0–47.1%), 36% (15.8%–58.3%) and 22.3% (5.2%–46.1%). For TO, corresponding rates were 73.6% (61.3%–94.4%), 54.1% (35.3–100), 46.8% (25.3%–59.4%) and 63.3% (30.7%–84.6%). Mortality rate thresholds indicating a significant outlier were 8.6% and 15.4% for minor and major LR and 14.2% and 8.6% for PD and DP. For FTR, these thresholds were 17.9%, 31.6%, 22.9% and 15.0%. For major morbidity rate, these thresholds were 26.1%, 49.7%, 57.9% and 52.9% respectively. For TO, lower thresholds were 52.5%, 32.5%, 25.8% and 41.4% respectively. Higher hospital volumes decrease thresholds to detect outliers.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Current event rates and minimum volume requirements per hospital are too low to detect any meaningful between hospital differences in mortality rate and FTR. Major morbidity rate and TO are better candidates to use for benchmarking.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>"

In terms of specific age groups, the 80-84 age group witnessed the highest number of deaths, with 16,069 fatalities, while the 60-64 age group had the highest DALYs, totaling 392,824 in 2019.

Clinicians should take heed of the enduring higher burden in males, emphasizing early intervention and smoking cessation counseling, especially for vulnerable age groups. Integrating prevention and smoking cessation programs into stroke care is pivotal to further mitigating smoking's impact on stroke outcomes.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"g756.jpg\"/>\n          </jats:p>"

Within TADs, the inner and smaller subTADs not only manifest cell-to-cell variability, but also precisely regulate transcription and differentiation. Although over 20 TAD callers are able to detect TAD, their usability in biomedicine is confined by a disagreement of outputs and a limit in understanding TAD hierarchy. We compare 13 computational tools across various conditions and develop a metric to evaluate the similarity of TAD hierarchy. Although outputs of TAD hierarchy at each level vary among callers, data resolutions, sequencing depths, and matrices normalization, they are more consistent when they have a higher similarity of larger TADs. We present comprehensive benchmarking of TAD hierarchy callers and operational guidance to researchers of life science researchers. Moreover, by simulating the mixing of different types of cells, we confirm that TAD hierarchy is generated not simply from stacking Hi-C heatmaps of heterogeneous cells. Finally, we propose an air conditioner model to decipher the role of TAD hierarchy in transcription.</jats:p>"

In 2019, strokes linked to household air pollution were higher in females, while males were more impacted by ambient particulate matter pollution.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>\n            This study underscores the pervasive threat posed by stroke on a global scale and emphasizes the significant role of air pollution, in exacerbating this crisis. The observed upward trend in stroke-related deaths and DALYs over the past three decades calls for immediate action in implementing pollution control measures and public health interventions to mitigate the growing burden of stroke.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\" xlink:href=\"g726.jpg\"/>\n          </jats:p>"

The lack of human studies stems primarily from the difficulties in prenatal human skin access. There is an important need to study human prenatal skin owing to the notable differences between human and mouse skin and the paucity of mechanistic understanding of congenital skin disorders.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We assembled the first comprehensive multiomic reference atlas of prenatal human skin (21 samples from 7 to 16 postconception weeks), combining single-cell (235 201 cells) and spatial transcriptomic data. We followed 84 skin organoids (SkOs) using single-cell analysis over a 5-month culture period and characterized the spatial organization of the skin in mature SkOs. Prenatal skin, SkO and any relevant pre-existing single-cell RNA-Seq datasets were integrated into the analysis. Cell–cell interactions and cell-lineage determination were explored using CellPhoneDB and trajectory inferences. We evaluated the differentiation trajectory alignment between prenatal skin and SkO using the Genes2Genes analysis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Our findings reveal predicted factors regulating the epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk during human hair follicle formation; progressive expression of scar-promoting genes in later gestation, potentially contributing to scarless healing properties of human prenatal skin observed during the early stages of gestation and expression of genes causing genetic skin disorders in the same cell types in prenatal human skin and SkO. We also found that SkOs morphologically recapitulate human skin development from early (periderm formation and shedding) to late (cornification and hair follicle formation) stages. We also demonstrated that SkO and prenatal skin mesenchyme differentiation into hair follicle dermal condensate and dermal papilla is highly conserved at the cellular and molecular level.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>SkOs faithfully recapitulate human prenatal skin development and are a valuable model for mechanistic studies on skin development including hair follicle biology and congenital skin disorders.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>"

A comprehensive cross-country analysis of BC is crucial to monitor the growing burden. Methods: Employing the global burden of disease framework, we have calculated the incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and years of life lost (YLL) attributed to BC, categorized by age, gender, year, and geographical location across the 38 OECD member countries. Results: The total number of BC cases has witnessed a notable increase, rising from 5.5 million (95%UI: 5.1-6) in 1990 to 9 million (8.2-9.8) in 2019. BC-related deaths have also risen from 172,148 (164,284-176,147) in 1990 to 214,458 (195,692-226,347) in 2019, while DALYs have increased from 4.6 (4.5-4.8) in 1990 to 5.1 (4.8-5.5) in 2019. The annual percentage change (APC) in incidence has surged by 59% (44-75%) from 1990 to 2019. The highest APC in age-standardized incidence rates was observed in South Korea at 150% (99-205), while the most substantial decrease was recorded in Switzerland at 3%. Regarding death rates, Japan saw an 11% increase, Costa Rica 10%, Mexico 9%, South Korea 8%, and Turkey 4%, whereas the remaining countries witnessed a decrease from 1990 to 2019. In terms of DALY rates, Mexico and Japan experienced a 10% increase, South Korea 5%, Turkey 3%, with the rest showing a decrease from 1990 to 2019. Males bore a higher burden compared to females, with an APC in total incidence of 109% versus 58%, deaths at 73% versus 24%, and DALYs at 57% versus 10% from 1990 to 2019. The highest overall burden was observed in the 70+ age group, while the &lt;70 and &lt;20 age groups exhibited a decreasing trend. The total number of deaths is projected to continue increasing. Conclusions: In 2019, BC accounted for 6.64% of all cancer-related deaths and 7.9% of DALYs among women. Based on these findings, low-resource countries should consider reallocating funding to combat this burden, and public health policymakers need to prioritize surveillance and early screening efforts. </jats:p>"

Within the spectrum of cancers, alcohol consumption ranks as the second leading attributable cause of death, as per the Global Burden of Disease Cancer Attributable Risk Factor Study. Methods: Employing the GBD protocol, we conducted an estimation of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to cancer caused by alcohol consumption in the US. This comprehensive analysis was stratified by age, gender, year, and geographical location throughout the US, from 1990 to 2019. To project future trends, we utilized time-series regression techniques to forecast deaths until the year 2040. Results: The total number of cancer-related deaths in the US surged from 19,898 (95%UI: 17,791-22,149) in 1990 to 34,455 (30,542-38,388) in 2019. Concurrently, DALYs increased from 532,533 (480,249-586,646) in 1990 to 854,351 (764,549-949,378) in 2019, and YLLs rose from 501,639 (452,446- 554,400) in 1990 to 802,493 (717,123-891,789) in 2019. The highest annual percentage change (APC) in ASR for mortality was observed in West Virginia, with a 32% increase, followed by Tennessee at 27%. Conversely, the District of Columbia witnessed the most significant decrease, with a 30% reduction from 1990 to 2019. In terms of DALYs rates, the highest increases were observed in West Virginia (27%) and Oklahoma (21%). Males bore a greater overall burden compared to females, with an APC in deaths of 97% vs 40% and an APC in DALYs of 87% vs 26%. The highest number of deaths occurred in the 60-64 age group, with 5,228 cases in 2019, while DALYs reached 154,034 in the same year. Projections indicate that the total number of deaths is expected to increase by 49,230 by the year 2040. Conclusions: In 2019, cancer-related deaths attributed to alcohol use represented 4.42% of all cancer mortality cases. From both a public health and clinician perspective, the study's results highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the growing burden of cancer associated with alcohol use. Efforts should focus on prevention, early intervention, and support for individuals struggling with alcohol-related cancer risks. [Table: see text] </jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p> 2084 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death among all cancer-related fatalities globally in individuals under 20 years old. Despite its significance, there is a notable dearth of data on brain and CNS cancer in this age group, necessitating a comprehensive cross-country comparison. Methods: Utilizing the Global Burden of Disease study framework, we estimated the prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to brain and CNS cancer by age, sex, year, and location across 204 countries and territories from 1990-2019. Results: The total prevalence increased from 153,334 (95%UI: 111,452-233,819) in 1990 to 212,459 (164,908-245,556) in 2019, with incidence rising from 47,373 (32,635-74,710) in 1990 to 47,600 (36,572-55,194) in 2019. Notably, the annual percentage change (APC) in deaths decreased by 21% (56-15), and DALYs by 22% (57-15) from 1990-2019. Sub-Saharan Africa and the African Union exhibited the highest APC increase in deaths, while Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania experienced the most significant decrease. The highest APC in incidence occurred in the 10-14 years age group at 27%, with a slight increase of 1% in deaths observed in the 10-19 years age group. Females bore a higher burden compared to males, with APC in prevalence at 29% versus 51%, and incidence at -4% versus 7%. Conclusions: Brain and CNS cancer accounted for 9.55% of deaths among individuals under 20 globally in 2019. While the overall global trend has shown an increase over the last three decades, females exhibit a higher burden. Despite a decrease in deaths over the same period, strategies must be implemented to combat this burden, emphasizing the importance of early investigation and management, particularly in resource-limited settings worldwide.

          "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of mobile laser scanning for mapping forests has scarcely been studied in difficult forest conditions. In this paper, we compare the accuracy of retrieving tree attributes, particularly diameter at breast height (DBH), stem curve, stem volume, and tree height, using six different laser scanning systems in a managed natural boreal forest. These compared systems operated both under the forest canopy on handheld and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and above the canopy from a helicopter. The complexity of the studied forest sites ranged from easy to difficult, and thus, this is the first study to compare the performance of several laser scanning systems for the direct measurement of stem curve in difficult forest conditions. To automatically detect tree stems and to calculate their attributes, we utilized our previously developed algorithm integrated with a novel bias compensation method to reduce the overestimation of stem diameter arising from finite laser beam divergence. The bias compensation method reduced the absolute value of the diameter bias by 55–99%. The most accurate laser scanning systems were equipped with a Velodyne VLP-16 sensor, which has a relatively low beam divergence, on a handheld or UAV platform. In easy plots, these systems found a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of below 10% for DBH and stem curve estimates and approximately 10% for stem volume. With the handheld system in difficult plots, the DBH and stem curve estimates had an RMSE under 10%, and the stem volume RMSE was below 20%. Even though bias compensation reduced the difference in bias and RMSE between laser scanners with high and low beam divergence, the RMSE remained higher for systems with a high beam divergence. The airborne laser scanner operating above the forest canopy provided tree attribute estimates close to the accuracy of the under-canopy laser scanners, but with a significantly lower completeness rate for stem detection, especially in difficult forest conditions.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p> e14624 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: The combination of PD-(L)1 inhibitors and chemotherapy (IO+Chemo) has become the standard first-line treatment for multiple types of cancer. In contrast to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, there is a lack of established biomarkers to distinguish the outcomes of IO+Chemo. The paucity of high-quality omics data in this setting has not allowed for deep biomarker exploration. We utilized RNA-seq data from two in-house randomized controlled trials (RCTs), RATIONALE-309 and ORIENT-11, with the goal to find transcriptomic biomarkers to identify patients who may not derive benefit from IO+Chemo. Methods: RATIONALE-309 (NCT03924986) was a phase 3 study conducted at 42 sites in Asia. Treatment-naive recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer patients were randomly allocated to either PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin. ORIENT-11 (NCT03607539) was a phase 3 study that enrolled patients from 47 centers in China who had previously untreated locally advanced/metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were randomized to PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab or placebo plus pemetrexed and platinum. We compared several immune-related biomarkers, including IFN-γ signature, PD-L1, cytolytic score (CYT), T-cell inflamed gene expression profile, B cell infiltration, and ESTIMATE immune score, and explored the optimal predictive threshold. Results: In the RATIONALE-309 and ORIENT-11 trials, 247 and 171 patients with RNA-seq data were analyzed, respectively. Although the addition of Chemo to IO could theoretically benefit tumors with low immune activation, we hypothesized that patients might not benefit from IO+Chemo if their activation level is extremely low. We first tested the predictiveness of several thresholds (20-50<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> quantiles) for each selected biomarker in the two RCTs. We found that low CYT and B cell are the two best indicators for identifying a lack of survival benefits from IO+Chemo versus Chemo, especially when using 20-30<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> quantile as threshold. To incorporate their distinct biological information and predictive value, we combined their genes into a single gene signature to represent immune activation. We found that patients in the lower quantile (&lt;20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>) showed no benefit of IO+Chemo over Chemo in terms of overall survival (OS) (RATIONALE-309: HR=1.01, P=0.99; ORIENT-11: HR=1.54, P=0.31) and progression-free survival (PFS) (RATIONALE-309: HR=0.76, P=0.42; ORIENT-11: HR=1.30, P=0.52). Moreover, this lack of advantage was maintained in key subgroups such as PD-L1-positive patients and former/current smokers across the two RCTs. Conclusions: Based on the two large-scale RCTs, our findings have implications for the selection of biomarkers when identifying suitable candidates for IO+Chemo treatment. B cells and CYT are crucial components required for the efficacy of IO+Chemo. </jats:p>"

X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) can provide nanoscale imaging with chemical specificity, and features comprising as few as 100 000 atoms have been detected without any need for specialized or destructive sample preparation. Presently, the ultimate limits of sensitivity of XRF are unknown – here, gallium dopants in silicon are investigated using a high brilliance, synchrotron source collimated to a small spot. It is demonstrated that with a single‐pixel integration time of 1 s, the sensitivity is sufficient to identify a single isolated feature of only 3000 Ga impurities (a mass of just 350 zg). With increased integration (25 s), 650 impurities can be detected. The results are quantified using a calibration sample consisting of precisely controlled numbers of implanted atoms in nanometer‐sized structures. The results show that such features can now be mapped quantitatively when calibration samples are used, and suggest that, in the near future, planned upgrades to XRF facilities might achieve single‐atom sensitivity.</jats:p>"

The survey included questions on palliative care department availability, involvement in tumor boards, timing of palliative care integration, and use of standardized screening tools for assessing palliative burden and psycho-oncological distress.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Of 57 centers contacted, 46 responded (81% response rate). Results indicate a dedicated palliative care department in 76.1% of centers, with palliative specialists participating in tumor board discussions at 34.8% of centers. Variability was noted in the initiation of palliative care, with early integration at the diagnosis stage in only 30.4% of centers. The survey highlighted a significant lack of standardized spiritual care assessments and minimal use of advanced care planning. Discrepancies were observed in the documentation and treatment of palliative care symptoms and social complaints, underscoring the need for comprehensive care approaches.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The study highlights a diverse landscape of palliative care provision within German neurooncology centers, underscoring the need for more standardized practices and early integration of palliative care. It suggests the necessity for standardized protocols and guidelines to enhance palliative care's quality and uniformity, ultimately improving patient-centered care in neurooncology.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"
