However, strategies to integrate differential expression (DE) analysis of scRNA-seq data remain underinvestigated. Here, we benchmarked 41 methods for integrative DE analysis of scRNA-seq data. Batch-effects, sparsity of data, and heterogeneity of samples substantially impacted the performance of DE analysis. Several methods that yielded high performances were suggested based on various simulations and real data analyses. In particular, the bulk RNA-seq tool edgeR incorporating the observation weights and the scRNA-seq tool MAST showed overall good performances. Remarkably, analysis for a specific cell type outperformed that of large-scale bulk sample data in prioritizing disease-related genes and pathways.</jats:p>"

Understanding, and ultimately controlling biomolecular function are predicated on the ability to map continuous conformational motions and identify the functionally relevant conformational trajectories. For equilibrium and near-equilibrium processes, the function proceeds along minimum-energy pathways on one or more energy landscapes, because higher-energy conformations are only weakly occupied. With the growing interest in identifying functional trajectories on energy landscapes, the reliable mapping of energy landscapes has become paramount. In response, various data-analytical tools for determining structural variability are emerging. A key question concerns the veracity with which each data-analytical tool can extract functionally relevant conformational trajectories from a collection of singleparticle cryo-EM snapshots. Using synthetic data as an independently known ground truth, we benchmark the ability of four leading algorithms to determine biomolecular energy landscapes and identify the functionally relevant conformational paths on these landscapes. Such benchmarking is essential for systematic progress toward atomic-level movies of continuous biomolecular function.</jats:p>"

For instance, for two-qubit gates, single-qubit twirling is easier to realize than full averaging. We analyze such simplified, partial twirling and demonstrate that, unlike for the standard randomized benchmarking, the measured decay of fidelity is a linear combination of exponentials with different decay rates (3 for two qubits and single-bit twirling). The evolution with the sequence length is governed by an iteration matrix, whose spectrum gives the decay rates. For generic two-qubit gates one slowest exponential dominates and characterizes gate errors in three channels. Its decay rate is close, but different from that in the standard randomized benchmarking, and we find the leading correction. Using relations to the local invariants of two-qubit gates we identify all exceptional gates with several slow exponentials and analyze possibilities to extract their decay rates from the measured curves.</jats:p>"

Despite its important place in national economies, it suffers from several challenges. Faced with this paradox, rethinking inspiration has not attracted many countries like Morocco. Any improvement must be based on a thorough analysis for efficient solutions. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to trigger, investigate, and analyse the state and paradoxical aspects of the Moroccan construction industry (MCI). A triangular approach was conducted, consisting of a literature review, official documents, and a survey of 25 professionals and 15 academics in the sector. The results reveal two main failures, one is managerial and the other technological, and the enumeration of ambitions which are also conditioned by the emergence of technology and new managerial approaches. These findings provide a platform for understanding future interventions, support the literature and suggest avenues of research for neighbouring construction industries, developing countries, and Africa due to similarities with Morocco. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for future studies, especially a new research framework for MCI and other similar countries based on the implementation of Building Information Modelling and Lean Construction.</jats:p>"

Many different, complex and economically expensive services are being tried to be carried out together. For this reason, it is finally crucial that the health services delivered by providers to scarce resources are delivered effectively and efficiently to people without sacrificing quality. Today, the most important problem of the production of healthcare services is the resource shortage as it is in other sectors. Efficiency, quality and competition are important criteria in the production and delivery of health services. Reducing costs in the production of health services is one of the main health policies for many world countries. These policies have made it necessary for international competitiveness, product and service sectors to continually improve their performance. In this study, the efficiency evaluation of the health care services of OECD were examined using Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist Total Factor Productivity. Considering the input values of the countries, the results of the input-oriented model and Malmquist productivity index were analyzed with the fixed return assumption according to the scale.</jats:p>"

We eliminated poor active spaces (20-30% of calculations) by applying a threshold to the SA-CASSCF absolute error. With the remaining calculations, we find that NEVPT2 performance is significantly impacted by the size of the basis set the wave functions are converged in regardless of the quality of their description, which is a problem absent in MC-PDFT. Additionally, we find that HMC-PDFT is a significant improvement over MC-PDFT with the tPBE density functional, and that it performs about as well as NEVPT2 and second-order coupled cluster (CC2) on a set of 373 excitations in the QUESTDB database. We optimized the percentage of SA-CASSCF energy to include in HMC-PDFT when using the tPBE on-top functional, and we find the 25% value used in tPBE0 to be optimal. This work is by far the largest benchmarking of MC-PDFT and HMC-PDFT to date, and the data produced in this work is useful as a validation of HMC-PDFT and of the APC active-space selection scheme. We have made all the wave functions produced in this work (orbitals and CI vectors) available to the public and encourage the community to utilize this data as a tool in the development of further multireference model chemistries.</jats:p>"

Common empirical models such as the Cost 231-Hata model and Cost 231-Walfisch Ikegami model have been used to predict path loss due to their simplicity and robustness; however, these models do not provide reliable accuracy for small coverage infrastructures, especially in LTE and 5G networks. Therefore, as an alternative method, deterministic models (e.g., ray-tracing models) are widely used for small coverage applications–however, these also require precise 3D digital maps, street structures, and building surface reflection indices, etc. which can be costly and need frequent maintenance. In this paper, an alternative model based on machine learning algorithms is proposed and the algorithms' prediction accuracies are evaluated. The machine learning approach trains models using signal strength data upon which they draw generalizations. The performance of these models is compared to that of the empirical models, and the results reveal that the machine learning models perform significantly better, with Random Forest outperforming other algorithms.</jats:p>"

The amalgamated paper reviews on practices of benchmarking for Higher Education (HE) teachers among different institution(s) in Nepal; and finds teacher’s professional skills, levels of formal qualification of teachers including content knowledge, professional aspiration, developing a thirst for innovations, and 21st -century teaching skills and its transference to learners as accepted areas to define their competencies. Subsequent exploration of practices, experiences of engaged professionals helped us to define the reality that enables the teacher to enter HE services in Nepal. The study reveals all Universities have set criterion to be fulfilled to enter HE teaching that includes; minimum formal academic years of learning (degree), professional experiences including publications (evidence), and required content knowledge and pedagogical skills (audited through an exam). In addition, ‘acceptance’ among students and higher social capital the ‘political linkage were two non-specified areas with noted privilege for the candidate to join University teaching. These insights signal the need for a concisely defined competency framework for a conflict-free community of practice.</jats:p>"

In this paper quantum support vector machine (QSVM) based models for the classification of three benchmarking datasets namely, Iris species, Pumpkin seed and Raisin has been constructed. These QSVM based classification models are implemented on real-time superconducting quantum computers/simulators. The performance of these classification models is evaluated in the context of execution time and accuracy and compared with the classical support vector machine (SVM) based models. The kernel based QSVM models for the classification of datasets when run on IBMQ_QASM_simulator appeared to be 232, 207 and 186 times faster than the SVM based classification model. The results indicate that quantum computers/algorithms deliver quantum speed-up.</jats:p>"

Jmeter tool and system usability scale are used to conduct performance and usability testing, respectively. In addition, a replication package is provided to increase the validity and reliability of the results. The main findings revealed that the serverless platforms are different in their architecture. Even though both of them support the same serverless concept, they differ considerably in structure, development, and creations of services. Overall, both the cloud vendors under study provide the same core capabilities one would expect but, there are some differences too. In particular, usability could be improved to extend the market and capture more customers.</p>"

This suite covers benchmarks from low-level characterization to high-level application evaluation using benchmark specific metrics. With this rather broad approach we are able to compare various hardware systems including mixed-signal and fully digital neuromorphic architectures. Selected benchmarks are discussed and results for several target platforms are presented revealing characteristic differences between the various systems. Furthermore, a proposed energy model allows to combine benchmark performance metrics with energy efficiency. This model enables the prediction of the energy expenditure of a network on a target system without actually having access to it. To quantify the efficiency gap between neuromorphics and the biological paragon of the human brain, the energy model is used to estimate the energy required for a full brain simulation. This reveals that current neuromorphic systems are at least four orders of magnitude less efficient. It is argued, that even with a modern fabrication process, two to three orders of magnitude are remaining. Finally, for selected benchmarks the performance and efficiency of the neuromorphic solution is compared to standard approaches.</jats:p>"

The results obtained are promising and show a greater AUC than earlier published findings. The cause of the exceptional predictive performance is examined, and it seems that the Feature Engineering element is critical. It observed that predictive models with good performance could achieved with feature engineering of the data. The average AUC obtained with this methodology for predicting bankruptcy is 0.949.</jats:p>"

With the availability of Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory, initial benchmarks evaluate the performance of real PMem hardware. However, these results apply to only a single server and it is not yet clear how workloads compare across different PMem servers. In this paper, we propose PerMA-Bench, a configurable benchmark framework that allows users to evaluate the bandwidth, latency, and operations per second for customizable database-related PMem access. Based on PerMA-Bench, we perform an extensive evaluation of PMem performance across four different server configurations, containing both first- and second-generation Optane, with additional parameters such as DIMM power budget and number of DIMMs per server. We validate our results with existing systems and show the impact of low-level design choices. We conduct a price-performance comparison that shows while there are large differences across Optane DIMMs, PMem is generally competitive with DRAM. We discuss our findings and identify eight general and implementation-specific aspects that influence PMem performance and should be considered in future work to improve PMem-aware designs.</jats:p>"

Using the model, a small group of librarians established a baseline of digital preservation activities at the Libraries and made recommendations for incremental improvements. By keeping the working group small and consulting stakeholders as needed, the benchmarking process was completed within a short timeline and resulted in a concise report that provided a digestible and accurate picture of digital preservation initiatives at the time of the evaluation, as well as realistic goals for the next 18 months. Sharing the report with library administration led to a charge to establish working groups that would test two preservation systems and evaluate their usefulness as tools for expanding digital preservation practices at the Libraries. The format of the model ensured that evaluation and goal-setting were straightforward, even in the absence of any unit or position dedicated to digital preservation. Speaking with peers at other institutions has revealed a need for a simple tool like the DPC RAM that can be completed more quickly than other preservation evaluation frameworks, especially given the lack of administrative support for digital preservation at many institutions.</jats:p>"

When one applies the disputable ionization-potential-electron-affinity (IPEA) shift, we show that CASPT3 provides a similar accuracy as its second-order counterpart, CASPT2, with the same mean absolute error of 0.11 eV. However, as already reported, we also observe that the accuracy of CASPT3 is almost insensitive to the IPEA shift, irrespective of the transition type and system size, with a small reduction in the mean absolute error to 0.09 eV when the IPEA shift is switched off.</jats:p>"

Customs is the main process in the industry express courier and the objective here is to apply lean principles to eliminate processes that have no added value and common parameters between the processes and optimization of resources humans or the allocation of workers. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is used to identify a variety of waste on the current conditions and the Critical Path Method (CPM) identify the critical path in the process that takes place at this time. Model simulation of the Current Value Stream Mapping and Future State Mapping developed by using lean principles in the model simulation. The design of the repair process scheduling is done by analyzing the critical path process of Customs Clearance, with a critical path analysis we can determine the most process priority and most influential against the thorough repairs.  A fusion method of Value stream mapping and Cricital Path Method supported by the method of benchmarking to finding best practice that has been done in the industry and doing the improvement so that the simulation generate a future state map with with the new critical path with faster acceleration time of customs clearance process from a total of 936 minutes before improvement and only required 389.6  minutes after improvements.</jats:p>"

The stages of assessing one's own potential for international cooperation in the form of an algorithm for conducting a benchmarking analysis of the organization of educational services are given. An algorithm for choosing a partner for international cooperation by an educational institution is proposed, which helps to select partners according to the given criteria, formed on the basis of information about insufficient resources, dynamic abilities and competences of both the educational institution and the potential partner. Based on the results of the research, the method of partner benchmarking in the development of international compatible educational projects was formulated in the form of a typology of business models, which is an assessment of the ability of the educational institution to integrate into the international educational space.</jats:p>"

First, we use an H10 benchmark set of four hydrogen model systems of different dimensionalities and distinctive electronic structures: a 1D chain, a 2D ring, a 2D sheet, and a 3D close-packed pyramid. Second, we study two paradigmatic models for strongly correlated Mott insulators, namely, a 1D H50 chain and a 4 × 4 × 4 3D H cube. We show that GNOF, without hybridization to other electronic structure methods and free of tuned parameters, succeeds in treating weak and strong correlation in a more balanced way than the functionals that have preceded it.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Photovoltaic production of a given solar power plant is mainly correlated with solar irradiance reaching the solar panel and to a lesser extent with air temperature and wind speed. Therefore, available energy in a building with roof-top photovoltaic (PV) panels in self-consumption can be highly variable due to cloud cover stochastic behaviour. Accurate irradiance forecast within the next hours are useful to help the energy management system of the building to cope with this variability and thus to maximize the consumption of the locally generated electricity at the expense of grid energy, then reducing financial and environmental costs of the overall building energy consumption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any solar energy forecast solution presents several sources of uncertainty at each main steps of the process: cloud forecast, radiative transfer of cloud and aerosols, irradiance conversion into power. Reducing the uncertainty of PV power modelled from irradiance forecast is a specific issue because it depends on certain conditions of the forecast application. PV performance models convert irradiance into PV power if PV cells characteristics are known and correctly specified by manufacturer, which is not always the case. Moreover, unexpected shadowing, panel surface soiling or aging of materials cannot be easily taken into account. If a consistent historical record of PV power data is available, a model output statistics (MOS) helps to decrease these induced uncertainties. If only real-time data are available, adaptive calibration using Kalman filter can improve the accuracy. If both historical and real-time data access are available, various machine learning approaches can set up more accurate MOS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The start-up incubator of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Institut Polytechnique de Paris&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is a building equipped with a roof-top PV farm with a total capacity of 17 kWp, made up with 53 using 8 different technologies with several tilted angle and some panels are equipped with reflectors. Minute PV power data have been continuously recorded from July 2020 onwards, collocated with the irradiance measurements of the Palaiseau BSRN station. This exceptional testbed enabled us to benchmark the several approaches for PV power modelling. We implement reference algorithms (linear regression, Kalman filter and autoregression) simulating respectively the availability data conditions (historical, real-time, both) and compared them with more complex machine-learning approaches. Results according to data availability, season, solar zenith angle, air temperature and irradiance variability are discussed. One of the outcome is that availability of real-time power measurements improves significantly forecasting results in most weather situations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

However, the existing ultrasonic characterization techniques do not have sufficient long-term gage repeatability and reproducibility (GR&amp;R), since benchmarking data are not updated. In this study, a hierarchical Bayesian regression model was utilized to provide a long-term ultrasonic benchmarking method for microstructure characterization, suitable for analyzing the impacts of experimental setups, human factors, and environmental factors on microstructure characterization. The priori distributions of regression parameters and hyperparameters of the hierarchical model were assumed and the Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm was used to calculate the posterior distributions. Characterizing the nodularity of cast iron was used as an example, and the benchmarking experiments were conducted over a 13-week transition period. The results show that updating a hierarchical model can increase its performance and robustness. The outcome of this study is expected to pave the way for the industrial uptake of ultrasonic microstructure characterization techniques by organizing a gradual transition from destructive sampling inspection to non-destructive one-hundred-percent inspection.</jats:p>"

In this context, the rising complexity of UGV systems imposes engineering steps that would ensure both capabilities of the system and resilience to its future inclusion in a system‐of‐system context. During its operational usage, the UGV is supposed to be manoeuvred for specifically designed purposes following user manual datasheet of the components off‐the‐shelf (COTS) that were integrated. This paper exposes the public user datasheet relevance compared to the system engineering requirements that are the artefacts of system design architecture.

The second is the cell-level security that enables fine-grain data access control. The SBK (Storage Benchmark Kit) is an open source software framework for the performance benchmarking of any storage system. We can measure the maximum throughput performance of any storage device/system using SBK. The SBK itself is a very high-performance benchmark tool/framework. It massively writes the data to the storage system and reads the data from the storage system. The SBK supports multi writers and readers and also the End to End latency benchmarking.</jats:p>"

The guidelines set in the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association Beef Checkoff funded Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) program are often used for assessing handling on feedlot, stocker, and cow-calf operations. There is limited information about animal handling on cow-calf operations. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify handling outcomes on cow-calf operations and compare them to national BQA program thresholds, and (2) investigate factors associated with handling outcomes. Researchers visited 76 operations across the United States to observe the following outcomes, adapted from the BQA program, during the processing of cows or yearling heifers: Prod Use, Miscatch, Vocalization, Jump, Slip/Stumble, Fall and Run. One hundred cows or less (depending on herd size) were observed moving through a restraint system at each operation. Other information specific to the animal type, facilities, and management were also gathered to be explored as potential predictors of handling outcomes. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics on an operation basis and analyzed with multi-predictor ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis tests to assess the relationship between outcomes and possible explanatory factors. Predictors included in the final analyses were: BQA certification (BQA), animal temperament (TEMP), region (REGION), chute style (CHUTE), and visual contact with humans (VISUAL). The 76 operations were sampled in 24 states (Central, n = 17; East, 30; West, 29), with herd sizes ranging from 10 animals to more than 5,000 animals. A total of 4,804 animals were observed. There were a substantial number of operations exceeding BQA thresholds for Prod Use (34.0%, 26), Miscatch (46.0%, 35), and Fall (31.6%, 24); the averages of these outcomes also exceeded the BQA thresholds (&amp;lt; 10%, 0%, and 2%, respectively). There was an association between Prod Use and several explanatory factors, including SIZE (P = 0.072), TEMP (P = 0.001), VISUAL (P = 0.027), and BQA (P = 0.104). Miscatch, Vocalization, and Fall all had single associated factors (REGION, P = 0.019; REGION, P = 0.002; VISUAL, P = 0.002, respectively). The VISUAL and TEMP factors had an association with the majority of outcomes. The findings suggest an opportunity for improving handling outcomes, which could be achieved through education and training support regarding the importance of animal handling on-farm. Future work should consider additional aspects of facilities and management that could impact cattle handling outcomes.</jats:p>"

Its concept is based on building fingerprint and training a ma-chine learning model on it, then using it for predicting the location based on the measured received signal strength RSS. One aspect of its vulnerability is its time vari-ant change due to the dynamical conditions in the environment and the access points APs. This was the most focus of the researchers in the last decades. However, minori-ty of them have considered the limitations of the existing benchmarking fingerprint in terms of lacking of support to realistic navigations runs when they are used for eval-uating indoor localization models. This article proposes a simple yet novel add-on to existing benchmarking fingerprint that assists in converting it from static fingerprint to consecutive training data with supportability to incremental learning and awareness of various characteristics of indoor navigation runs. The model was evaluated based on two benchmarking fingerprint and the generated incremental data were plotted with two levels of granularity one is corresponding to location and the other to place for referring to high resolution level and low resolution level.</jats:p>"

Performance evaluation is one of the most important benchmarking tools for modern businesses due to sophisticated technologies, computerized processes, communication, and fierce competition. The study analyzed the performance of 26 commercial banks from 2008 to 2016. Efficiency and effectiveness were calculated using data envelopment analysis(DEA). The results showed that the sub-optimal performance of banks was caused mainly by ineffectiveness compared to Efficiency. Banks were further categorized into four groups based on their average efficiency and effectiveness scores into Ace, Underdogs, Lucky, and Unlucky. This matrix suggests that banks in the Lucky quadrant should improve Efficiency, those in the Unluck group should diversify, and those in the Underdogs quadrant should merge. Banks in the Lucky, Unlucky, and Underdog quadrants should emulate the Ace quadrant's success.</jats:p>"

Organizations recognize that incorporating greening in HR practices has the potential to address environmental concerns. The present study aims to focus on investigating the relationship between green human resource management (GHRM) practices and environmental performance (EP). It is premised that the adoption of green human resource practices facilitates the development of a green organizational culture (GOC) that helps the organization to gain strategic business advantage with respect to the competitors. The literature suggests that the adoption of green human resource practices among organizations is at a nascent stage. The present study focusses on understanding the mediating role of three dimensions of GOC, that is, degree, diffusion and depth in the relationship between green human resource practices and EP that has not been addressed in the empirical literature.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The present study developed a model consisting of GHRM practices as an independent variable, the three dimensions of culture (degree, diffusion and depth) as mediators, and EP as the dependent variable.

The other two dimensions of GOC, diffusion and depth, did not have a significant mediating role in this relationship. The findings of the study have been explained in the context of social identity theory, resource based view and ability–motivation–opportunity theory.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study provides practical insights for researchers and managers who seek to adopt sustainability objectives in the organization.

By applying it to benchmark 12 differential gene expression analysis methods (including cell-level and pseudo-bulk methods) on simulated multi-condition, multi-subject data of the 10x Genomics platform, we demonstrated that methods originating from the negative binomial mixed model such as glmmTMB and NEBULA-HL outperformed other methods. Utilizing NEBULA-HL in a statistical analysis pipeline for single-cell analysis will enable scientists to better understand the cell-type-specific transcriptomic response to disease or treatment effects and to discover new drug targets. Further, application to two real datasets showed the outperformance of our differential expression (DE) pipeline, with unified findings of differentially expressed genes (DEG) and a pseudo-time trajectory transcriptomic result. In the end, we made recommendations for filtering strategies of cells and genes based on simulation results to achieve optimal experimental goals.</jats:p>"

This analysis, undertaken in the context of the creation of the ME by merging five former ministries, was intended to help identify gaps in current practices and propose recommendations for enhancing specific macroprocesses in Brazil. A team, including former ministers of finance and experts from these selected countries, participated in the technical analysis and discussions together with specialists from the Inter-American Development Bank. The findings show: (i) positive initial results after the merge in terms of policy coordination, coherence, and efficiency; (ii) recent policy reforms in line with OECD practices, some of which have just started to be implemented; and (iii) opportunities to continue enhancing management practices in selected macroprocesses.</jats:p>"

Recent developments in image recognition technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning led to an intensified research in computer vision models. This progress also allows advances for the collection of spatio-temporal data on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), in order to understand their geographical distribution and impact on the biodiversity loss. Citizen Science (CS) approaches already show successful solutions how the public can be involved in collecting spatio-temporal data on IAS, e.g. by using mobile applications for monitoring. Our work analyzes recently developed image-based species recognition models suitable for the monitoring of IAS in CS applications. We demonstrate how computer vision models can be benchmarked for such a use case and how their accuracy can be evaluated by testing them with IAS of European Union concern. We found out that available models have different strengths. Depending on which criteria (e.g. high species coverage, costs, maintenance, high accuracies) are considered as most important, it needs to be decided individually which model fits best. Using only one model alone may not necessarily be the best solution, thus combining multiple models or developing a new custom model can be desirable. Generally, cooperation with the model providers can be advantageous.\n                    </jats:p>"

The open AlphaFold Protein Structure Database covers the complete human proteome. It shows great potential to provide structural information to enable and enhance existing and new drug discovery projects. Using an industry-leading molecular docking method (Glide), we benchmarked the virtual screening performance of 28 common drug targets each with an AF2 structure and known holo and apo structures from the DUD-E dataset. The AF2 structures show comparable early enrichment of known active compounds (avg. EF 1%: 13.16) to apo structures (avg. EF 1%: 11.56), while falling behind early enrichment of the holo structures (avg. EF 1%: 24.81). We also demonstrated that with the IFD-MD induced-fit docking approach, we can refine the AF2 structures using a known binding ligand to improve the performance in structure-based virtual screening (avg. EF 1%: 19.25). Thus, with proper preparation and refinement, AF2 structures show considerable promise for in silico hit identification.</jats:p>"

The open AlphaFold Protein Structure Database covers the complete human proteome. It shows great potential to provide structural information to enable and enhance existing and new drug discovery projects. Using an industry-leading molecular docking method (Glide), we benchmarked the virtual screening performance of 28 common drug targets each with an AF2 structure and known holo and apo structures from the DUD-E dataset. The AF2 structures show comparable early enrichment of known active compounds (avg. EF 1%: 13.16) to apo structures (avg. EF 1%: 11.56), while falling behind early enrichment of the holo structures (avg. EF 1%: 24.81). We also demonstrated that with the IFD-MD induced-fit docking approach, we can refine the AF2 structures using a known binding ligand to improve the performance in structure-based virtual screening (avg. EF 1%: 19.25). Thus, with proper preparation and refinement, AF2 structures show considerable promise for in silico hit identification.</jats:p>"

However, the existing indicators of national framework conditions may have limitations in comparing the entrepreneurial efficiency of countries. Based on institutional theory, this paper presents a model to examine the efficiency of entrepreneurial activities stemming from the given conditions of a country and find benchmarks based on data envelopment analysis by scrutinizing inputs and outputs with static efficiency, dynamic efficiency, and strategic quadrant analysis. For this purpose, the study utilizes the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset from 2015 to 2020 for 24 countries and presents the research questions regarding the differences in global entrepreneurial efficiencies, the countries for benchmarking, and the implications for entrepreneurial activities. The research implications suggest that diversifying the views on entrepreneurial efficiency may be valuable, and policymakers may focus on institutional conditions and entrepreneurial efficiency regarding the activity of early-stage businesses. </jats:p>"

Part of the initial government strategy is to encourage the use public buildings in demonstrating initiatives for sustainable development to justify high capital resources investment. Mosque buildings have huge potential for this purpose because as religious public buildings for the majority Muslim community, their operations are fully funded from public funds. Selection of mosques is also driven by its unique intermittent energy consumption pattern, while early mosques adopted natural ventilation, modern mosques are often designed with mechanical ventilation (air conditioning).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>An encouragement on government initiative towards sustainable development can be escalating by producing exemplary building for intermittent use pattern categories by mosque as a model.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Sustainable development especially in EE becomes normal practices and energy and impact towards environment possibly be saved.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Sustainable development especially in EE becomes normal practices and energy and impact towards environment possibly be saved.

The following nuclear reactions excited by protons on the stable boron isotopes are considered: 10B(p,aγ)7Be, 10B(p,pγ)7Be and 11B(p,γ)12C. The optimum proton energy range was determined to be within 550 to 600 keV, while the energies of the induced gamma-radiation that can be used for quantitative estimation of the boron isotopes were 429 keV and 4439 keV for the isotopes 10B and 11B, respectively. Considering the uncertainties of measurements, the data for the 11B/10B isotope ratios, measured by the SF‑ICP‑MS and PIGE methods, are found to correlate with each other; yet they are characterized by a systematic bias. The uncertainty of measurements by the PIGE method was somewhat higher in comparison with SF-ICP-MS, and ranged from ± 4.1 % to ± 4.3 %, and from ± 1.1 % to ± 3.5 %, respectively.</jats:p>"

We explore the utility of DOGMA-seq compared to the bimodal CITE-seq assay in activated and stimulated human peripheral blood T cells. We find that single cell trimodal omics measurements after digitonin (DIG) permeabilization were generally better than after an alternative “low-loss lysis” (LLL) permeabilization condition. Next, we find that DOGMA-seq with optimized DIG permeabilization and its ATAC library provides more information, although its mRNA and cell surface protein libraries have slightly inferior quality, compared to CITE-seq.</jats:p>"

Refining device properties ultimately requires going beyond predicting vertical excitation energies, to predicting full emission spectra and color. This work presents an initial benchmark of time‐dependent density functional theory (TD‐DFT) approximations, applied to the emission spectrum and International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color of Pigment Red 179. This green fluorescent perylene diimide is representative of organic emitters used in organic light‐emitting diodes. Widely used DFT approximations predict a rainbow of emission colors from red to blue. Correlations between predicted electronic and vibrational level spacings produce zero‐sum errors in predictions of emission peak center versus peak shape. Even with empirical spectral shifts (“calibration”), predicted emission bandwidth and color purity is strongly functional dependent. The results motivate further development of benchmarks for CIE color, and further development of approximations possessing combined accuracy for excitation energies and ground‐ and excited‐state structures and force constants.</jats:p>"

The present study concerns a Life Cycle Assessment of the environmental performance of two types of floating wind turbine.

Thus, the aim of the paper was to create a benchmark for the design of innovative technologies, such as those developed by specialist companies, and to verify the validity of new designs and technologies in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions. The results show that the Carbon Intensity of Electricity of a single floating wind turbine varies in the range 26–79 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>eq·kWh<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, averaging 49 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>eq·kWh<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, in line with other studies of offshore wind turbines and other renewable energy sources (such as onshore wind and photovoltaic). Extension of our study to the whole life cycle, including manufacturing, assembly and installation, maintenance and material replacement and a hypothetical decommissioning and end-of-life, showed that wind farms are among the most promising marine renewable energy technologies for the Mediterranean.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p> A wide range of deep learning (DL) architectures with varying depths are available, with developers usually choosing one or a few of them for their specific task in a nonsystematic way. Benchmarking (i.e., the systematic comparison of state-of-the art architectures on a specific task) may provide guidance in the model development process and may allow developers to make better decisions. However, comprehensive benchmarking has not been performed in dentistry yet. We aimed to benchmark a range of architecture designs for 1 specific, exemplary case: tooth structure segmentation on dental bitewing radiographs. We built 72 models for tooth structure (enamel, dentin, pulp, fillings, crowns) segmentation by combining 6 different DL network architectures (U-Net, U-Net++, Feature Pyramid Networks, LinkNet, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network, Mask Attention Network) with 12 encoders from 3 different encoder families (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet) of varying depth (e.g., VGG13, VGG16, VGG19). On each model design, 3 initialization strategies (ImageNet, CheXpert, random initialization) were applied, resulting overall into 216 trained models, which were trained up to 200 epochs with the Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.0001) and a batch size of 32. Our data set consisted of 1,625 human-annotated dental bitewing radiographs. We used a 5-fold cross-validation scheme and quantified model performances primarily by the F1-score. Initialization with ImageNet or CheXpert weights significantly outperformed random initialization ( P &lt; 0.05). Deeper and more complex models did not necessarily perform better than less complex alternatives. VGG-based models were more robust across model configurations, while more complex models (e.g., from the ResNet family) achieved peak performances. In conclusion, initializing models with pretrained weights may be recommended when training models for dental radiographic analysis. Less complex model architectures may be competitive alternatives if computational resources and training time are restricting factors. Models developed and found superior on nondental data sets may not show this behavior for dental domain-specific tasks. </jats:p>"

Introducing a data envelopment analysis (DEA)‐type benchmarking strategy with non‐continuous knowledge inputs, the main findings suggest that innovation efficiency, although does not exert a direct impact on firm performance, moderates the relationship between the internally generated knowledge and firm performance. On the other hand, such a moderation relationship is not confirmed for the relationship between external knowledge and innovation spillovers on firm's performance. Although the impact of the embodied to innovation inputs spillovers, on firm performance, is always positive and significant, empirical results indicate that absorptive capacity exhibits diminishing returns with respect to performance.</jats:p>"

The chapter is unique as it has attempted to identify efficient and benchmark units in the energy sector in India through an integrated model based on DEA-TOPSIS. The findings of the chapter have extensive implications for all these stakeholders along with companies belonging to the energy sector, investors, and academia. The managers taking strategic financial decisions in the target units need to consider the practices followed by benchmark companies for improving their financial viability.</jats:p>"

However, the literature lacks a clear index or metric to quantify the monetary advantages of enhanced equipment performance. Thus, the paper presents two innovative monetary performance measures to estimate the financial advantages of enhancing equipment performance by isolating the effect of manufacturing fluctuations such as product mix price, direct and indirect characteristics, and cost changes.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The research provides two measures, ISB (Improvement Saving Benefits) and IEB (Improvement Earning Benefits), to assess equipment performance improvements. The effectiveness of the metrics is validated through a three stages approach, namely (1) experts' binary opinion, (2) sample, and (3) actual cases. The relevant data may be collected through accounting systems, purpose-built software, or electronic spreadsheets.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings suggest that both measures provide an effective cost–benefit analysis of equipment performance enhancement. The measure ISB indicates savings from performance increases when equipment capacity is greater than product demand. IEB is utilised when equipment capacity is less than product demand. Both measurements may replace the unitary cost variation, which is subject to manufacturing changes.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Manufacturing businesses may utilise the ISB and IEB metrics to conduct a systematic analysis of equipment performance and to appreciate the financial savings perspective in order to emphasise profitability in the short and long term.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The study introduces two novel financial equipment performance improvement indicators that distinguish the effects of manufacturing variations.

It has given a tremendous structural boost to e‐commerce enterprises by forcing customers to online shopping over visiting physical stores. Moreover, customer expectations of the digital and operational capabilities of e‐commerce firms are also increasing globally. Thus, it has become crucial for an e‐commerce enterprise to reassess and realign its business practices to meet evolving customer needs and remain sustainable. This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation framework for e‐commerce enterprises based on evolving customer expectations due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The framework comprises seven primary criteria, which are further divided into 25 sub‐criteria, including two sustainability factors, namely, environmental sustainability and carbon emissions. The evaluation approach is then practically demonstrated by analyzing the case of three Indian e‐commerce firms. The results are obtained using a multi‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) method, namely, Fuzzy VIKOR, to capture the fuzziness of the inherent decision‐making problem. Further, numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate and rank various e‐commerce enterprises based on customer expectations and satisfaction benchmarks. The findings explain the most important criteria and sub‐criteria for e‐commerce businesses to ensure customer expectations along with their economic and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

Among the US News and World Report Top 50 Hospitals, hospital-specific numeric summary scores were aggregated from the 2021 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Overall Star Rating, the Spring 2021 Leapfrog Safety Grade, and the April 2021 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Star Rating. The CHQI is the hospital-specific sum of the national percentile-rankings across these 3 ratings. In this example, mean (SD) percentiles were as follows: CMS Stars 74 (19), Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems 63 (19), Leapfrog 65 (24), with mean (SD) CHQI of 202 (49). The CHQI is used at the authors’ institution to identify improvement opportunities and ensure that high-quality care is delivered across the health system.</jats:p>"

This study benchmarks continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use across pediatric clinics in the T1Dx-QI.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Method: T1Dx-QI clinics report monthly on critical metrics, including the percentage of patients with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &amp;lt;7% or using CGM. Median values for each site were calculated using Lahey P run charts between July 2020 and June 2021. These results are shared non-anonymized internally among participating T1Dx-QI clinics.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Across 17 T1Dx-QI clinics, the percentage of patients using CGM ranged from 23% to 85% (Figure 1; mean and median CGM use were 61.3% and 61.7%, respectively) . Median HbA1c values ranged from 7.4% to 9.2%.

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Inferring the diffusion mechanisms in complex networks is of outstanding interest since it enables better prediction and control over information dissemination, rumors, innovation, and even infectious outbreaks. Designing strategies for influence maximization in real-world networks is an ongoing scientific challenge. Current approaches commonly imply an optimal selection of spreaders used to diffuse and indoctrinate neighboring peers, often overlooking realistic limitations of time, space, and budget. Thus, finding trade-offs between a minimal number of influential nodes and maximizing opinion coverage is a relevant scientific problem. Therefore, we study the relationship between specific parameters that influence the effectiveness of opinion diffusion, such as the underlying topology, the number of active spreaders, the periodicity of spreader activity, and the injection strategy. We introduce an original benchmarking methodology by integrating time and cost into an augmented linear threshold model and measure indoctrination expense as a trade-off between the cost of maintaining spreaders’ active and real-time opinion coverage. Simulations show that indoctrination expense increases polynomially with the number of spreaders and linearly with the activity periodicity. In addition, keeping spreaders continuously active instead of periodically activating them can increase expenses by 69–84% in our simulation scenarios. Lastly, we outline a set of general rules for cost-effective opinion injection strategies.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Following the tradition of modeling fluvial landscape evolution, a novel approach describing glacial erosion based on an empirical stream power law was proposed. This approach differs substantially from well established process-based models applied to describe glacial erosion in mountain landscapes. Outstanding computational performance but a number of potential limitations compared to process-based models requires extensive testing to evaluate the applicability of this novel approach. In this study, we test the validity of the glacial stream power law and its implementation into a 2-D landform evolution model (OpenLEM) by benchmarking it against a state of the art surface process model based on the integrated second order shallow-ice approximation (iSOSIA). Despite completely different approaches, OpenLEM and iSOSIA predict similar ice flow patterns and erosion rates for a wide range of climatic conditions without re-adjusting a set of calibrated scaling parameters. This parameter set is valid for full glacial conditions where the entire precipitation is converted to ice but also for an altitude-dependent glacier mass balance as characteristic for most glaciated mountain ranges on Earth. In both models characteristic glacial features, such as overdeepenings, hanging valleys, and steps at confluences emerge roughly at the same locations resulting in a consistent altitude-dependent adjustment of channel slope and relief. Compared to iSOSIA, however, distinctly higher erosion rates occur in OpenLEM at valley flanks during the initial phase of the fluvial to glacial transition. This is mainly due to the simplified description of glacier width and ice surface in OpenLEM. In this respect, we found that the glacial stream power approach cannot replace process-based models such as iSOSIA, but is complementary to them by addressing research questions that could not previously be answered due to a lack of computational efficiency. The implementation of the glacial stream power law is primarily suitable for large-scale simulations investigating the evolution of mountain topography in the interplay of tectonics and climate. As coupling glacial and fluvial erosion with sediment transport shows nearly the same computationally efficiency as its purely fluvial counterpart, mountain range scale simulations at high spatial resolution are not exclusively restricted to the fluvial domain anymore and a series of exciting research questions can be attacked by this novel approach.\n                        </jats:p>"

Data was available for 87 surgeons in the intervention group and 93 surgeons in the control group. 97.7% of surgeons in the intervention group reduced their opioid prescribing pattern compared to 95.7% in the control group. Surgeons who received the data benchmarking report intervention prescribed 14.3% less opioids than surgeons in the control group (10.54 (SD 5.34) vs. 12.30 (SD 6.02), P = .04). The intervention was associated with a 1.83 lower mean number of opioid tablets prescribed per patient in the multivariable linear regression model after controlling for other factors (Intervention group vs. control group 95% CI [−3.61, −.04], P = .04). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Discussion</jats:title><jats:p> The implementation of a peer data benchmarking intervention can drive physician behavior change towards high-value care. </jats:p></jats:sec>"

JAVELIN measured OS from the initiation of maintA among a subgroup of the overall aUC 1L treated population, including only patients who did not progress with 1L platinum-based therapy (PBT) and remained progression free during a 4-10 week treatment-free interval following completion of 1L PBT. As such, patients who progressed on or immediately following PBT were not included in the trial. To address this, we used disease modeling to estimate maintA OS measured from initiation of 1L PBT to align maintA OS with the common initiation point to benchmark with other 1L clinical trials. Methods: We developed a simulated cohort to estimate OS from initiation of 1L PBT in all aUC patients including those who received maintA. Eligibility for maintA (PBT progressed vs not progressed) was assessed at 5.6 months post-initiation of 1L PBT, accounting for 6 PBT cycles and a nominal 6-week treatment-free interval. Median OS of 14.3 months from the 1L PBT arm of a recent 1L trial, KEYNOTE-361, was used to represent the OS of the simulated cohort of 1L aUC patients. The simulated cohort was stratified by eligibility for maintA. Among the 1L treated population, 57% were projected to be progression-free and eligible for maintA based on progression-free survival (PFS) from KEYNOTE-361. Among those eligible, 85% were assumed to receive maintA based on expert clinical input. OS of maintA eligible patients was 21.4 months from JAVELIN. Our disease model estimated OS among a maintA ineligible simulated cohort, which was combined with the maintA eligible cohort to yield an estimated OS in the overall aUC population measured from initiation of 1L PBT. Results: Approximately 50% of the 1L modeled population receive maintA (i.e., 57% eligible x 85% treated). Our approach estimated a median OS of 9.9 months for the maintA ineligible cohort and 27.0 months for the maintA eligible cohort. Combined, the estimated median OS with maintA, measured from initiation of 1L PBT, in all 1L-treated aUC patients was 15.8 months (vs 14.3 months with PBT only in 1L). Conclusions: MaintA improves OS for eligible patients, however our simulation model suggests a significant proportion of patients will not receive MaintA. The estimated OS of 15.8 months for the population-level impact of maintA, accounting for patients ineligible for 1L maintA, demonstrates remaining unmet need in the overall 1L aUC population. </jats:p>"

RNA-Seq technology has matured in recent years and is now widely deployed for transcriptional analysis of clinical specimens. The goal of this study was to benchmark technical parameters of RNA-Seq in the context of a multi-site, double-blind randomized clinical trial using primary patient samples. We collected longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 10 subjects after vaccination with a live attenuated <jats:italic>Francisella tularensis</jats:italic> vaccine and performed RNA-Seq at two different sites using aliquots from the same sample to generate two large-scale replicate datasets. We evaluated the impact of: (i) filtering lowly-expressed genes, (ii) using external RNA controls, (iii) fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) filtering, (iv) read length, and (v) sequencing depth on differential expressed genes (DEGs) concordance between replicate datasets. Using synthetic mRNA spike-ins, we developed a method for empirically establishing minimal read-count thresholds for maintaining fold change accuracy on a per-experiment basis. We defined a reference PBMC transcriptome by pooling sequence data, and established the impact of read depth and gene filtering on transcript representation. Lastly, we modeled statistical power to detect DE genes for a range of sample sizes, effect sizes, and coverage depths. The results from this study provide RNA sequencing benchmarks and guidelines for planning future similar vaccine studies.</jats:p>"

However, test selection and subsequent performance thresholds must be selected, which is no easy endeavor when considering the number of promising tests and the variation in asphalt mix designs and components between states or regions. While the Virginia Department of Transportation’s (VDOT) BMD specification has been circulated for multiple years now, this article presents the approach taken by VDOT to investigate the various tests, considerations taken in selecting tests, and the establishment of performance thresholds. Data and discussion of six different performance tests encompassing durability, rutting, and cracking for 11 common Virginia mixes are presented. The performance threshold selection process is outlined. Further considerations in the final test selection process are discussed. In conclusion, the initial draft specification for BMD is provided. </jats:p>"

With the recent development of <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> microscopes that can acquire vast numbers of images of these organisms, the use of deep learning methods to taxonomically identify them has come to the forefront. Given this, two questions arise: 1) How well do deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) identify these marine organisms using data from <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> microscopes? 2) How well do CNN-derived estimates of abundance agree with established net and bottle-based sampling? Here, using images collected by the <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> Scripps Plankton Camera (SPC) system, we trained a CNN to recognize 9 species of phytoplankton, some of which are associated with Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). The CNNs evaluated on 26 independent natural samples collected at Scripps Pier achieved an averaged accuracy of 92%, with 7 of 10 target categories above 85%. To compare abundance estimates, we fit a linear model between the number of organisms of each species counted in a known volume in the lab, with the number of organisms collected by the <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> microscope sampling at the same time. The linear fit between lab and <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> counts of several of the most abundant key HAB species suggests that, in the case of dinoflagellates, there is good correspondence between the two methods. As one advantage of our method, given the excellent correlation between lab counts and <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> microscope counts for key species, the methodology proposed here provides a way to estimate an equivalent volume in which the employed microscope can identify in-focus organisms and obtain statistically robust estimates of abundance.</jats:p>"

One increasingly common use of genomic and metagenomic sequencing is in identifying the type and range of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes present in bacterial isolates in order to make predictions regarding their AMR phenotype. However, there are a large number of alternative bioinformatics software and pipelines available, which can lead to dissimilar results. It is, therefore, vital that researchers carefully evaluate their genomic and metagenomic AMR analysis methods using a common dataset. To this end, as part of the Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon and Workshop 2021, a ‘gold standard’ reference genomic and simulated metagenomic dataset was generated containing raw sequence reads mapped against their corresponding reference genome from a range of 174 potentially pathogenic bacteria. These datasets and their accompanying metadata are freely available for use in benchmarking studies of bacteria and their antimicrobial resistance genes and will help improve tool development for the identification of AMR genes in complex samples.</jats:p>"

These assays produce a cycle threshold value (Ct) corresponding to the first amplification cycle in which reliable amplification is detected. (1)Such Ct values have been used by clinicians and in public health settings to guide treatment, monitor disease progression, assess prognosis, and inform isolation practices. To understanding the risk of reporting out uncalibrated Ct values and potential for instead reporting out calibrated viral load values, we performed a multi-institutional study to benchmark major clinical platforms against a calibrated standard. We found that for any given Ct value, corresponding viral loads varied up to 1000-fold among the different tests. In contrast, when these different assays were calibrated against a common standard and then used to test unknown de-identified specimens at several dilutions, viral load values showed high precision between methods (standard deviation and range of 0.36 and 1.1 log10 genome copies) and high accuracy compared with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) determinations (difference between mean CDC N2 and Sarbeco E ddPCR determinations and mean determinations by calibrated RT-PCR assays examined in our study of 0.044 log10 genome copies). We, therefore, find strong support for calibration of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests to allow conversion of cycle thresholds to accurate and precise viral load values that are reproducible across major clinical systems. Implementation of calibrated assays will provide more reliable information for clinical decision making and allow more rigorous interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory data in clinical and laboratory investigation.</jats:p>"

One of the main caveats is that M dwarfs show a wide range of activity levels from inactive to very active, which can induce an asymmetry in the line profiles and, consequently, a spurious RV measurement.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic> We aim to benchmark the impact of stellar activity on high-precision RV measurements using regular-cadence CARMENES visible and near-infrared observations of the active M3.5 dwarf <jats:ext-link ext-link-type=\"aoi\">EV Lac</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods.</jats:italic> We used the newly developed technique of low-resolution Doppler imaging to determine the centre-of-light, or spot-induced RV component, for eight observational epochs.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results.</jats:italic> We confirm a statistically significant and strong correlation between the independently measured centre-of-light and the chromatic index, which is a measure of the amplitude variation with wavelength of the RVs. We also find circular “closed-loop” relations of several activity indices with RV for a subset of data that covers only several rotation periods. We also investigate the implications of large phase gaps in the periodograms of activity indicators. Finally, by removing the spot-induced RV component we improve the planet-mass sensitivity by a factor of at least three.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> We conclude that for active M stars, a regular-cadence observing strategy is the most efficient way to identify and eliminate sources of correlated noise.</jats:p>"

Subclonal reconstruction algorithms use bulk DNA sequencing data to quantify parameters of tumour evolution, allowing assessment of how cancers initiate, progress and respond to selective pressures. A plethora of subclonal reconstruction algorithms have been created, but their relative performance across the varying biological and technical features of real-world cancer genomic data is unclear. We therefore launched the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling -- Tumour Heterogeneity and Evolution Challenge. This seven-year community effort used cloud-computing to benchmark 31 containerized subclonal reconstruction algorithms on 51 simulated tumours. Each algorithm was scored for accuracy on seven independent tasks, leading to 12,061 total runs. Algorithm choice influenced performance significantly more than tumour features, but purity-adjusted read-depth, copy number state and read mappability were associated with performance of most algorithms on most tasks. No single algorithm was a top performer for all seven tasks and existing ensemble strategies were surprisingly unable to outperform the best individual methods, highlighting a key research need. All containerized methods, evaluation code and datasets are available to support further assessment of the determinants of subclonal reconstruction accuracy and development of improved methods to understand tumour evolution.</jats:p>"

In many low- and middle-income countries, however, sizable gaps exist in the emergency preparedness framework of national regulatory authorities (NRAs). RegTrain-VaccTrain is a project of Germany Ministry of Health’s Global Health Protection Programme that contributes to global efforts aimed at strengthening such regulatory systems by providing technical support and advice to partner NRAs. In this study, we probed the outputs of our capacity-strengthening activities for clinical trials oversight (CTO) to take stock of progress made and examine remaining priorities in order to provide specialized technical assistance in addressing them to improve operational readiness for emergencies.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Method</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Data validated from NRA self-benchmarking results in 2017 and worksheet records of November 2021 were utilized to assess the emergency preparedness capacity for CTO in three VaccTrain partner NRAs (Liberia, Sierra Leone, The Gambia) before and after interventional capacity-strengthening partnership, using specific public health emergency-related (sub-)indicators of the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A generally weak and vulnerable structural framework for CTO characterized the emergency preparedness capacity in all three partner NRAs at baseline, thus putting their operational readiness for public health emergencies at risk. VaccTrain’s collaborative work was successful at supporting individual NRAs to develop the full spectrum of operational structures (including (draft) regulations, guidelines, and standard operating procedures) required to improve regulatory preparedness. A gap in the formal approval and implementation of developed legal documents in two of three NRAs still remains. Notwithstanding, a robust emergency framework now exists and the NRAs stand better prepared to respond to (future) locally-concerning health emergencies, during which time clinical trials activity was observed to heighten.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>These results exemplify a north-south capacity-strengthening partnership model that effectively contributes in developing structures to enhance regulatory oversight and support expeditious product development in response to crises. They further underscore the equally critical role local/national processes play in facilitating the full implementation of developed structures.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

Dissecting SVs from WGS data presents a substantial number of challenges and a plethora of SV detection methods have been developed. Currently, evidence that investigators can use to select appropriate SV detection tools is lacking. In this article, we have evaluated the performance of SV detection tools on mouse and human WGS data using a comprehensive polymerase chain reaction-confirmed gold standard set of SVs and the genome-in-a-bottle variant set, respectively. In contrast to the previous benchmarking studies, our gold standard dataset included a complete set of SVs allowing us to report both precision and sensitivity rates of the SV detection methods. Our study investigates the ability of the methods to detect deletions, thus providing an optimistic estimate of SV detection performance as the SV detection methods that fail to detect deletions are likely to miss more complex SVs. We found that SV detection tools varied widely in their performance, with several methods providing a good balance between sensitivity and precision. Additionally, we have determined the SV callers best suited for low- and ultralow-pass sequencing data as well as for different deletion length categories.</jats:p>"

Improvement in the quality and safety of medical care, the formation of patient-centered healthcare as well as the introduction of quality management systems created the necessity for the development of the unified practical tool that widespread allows to assess the effectiveness of medical activities in hospitals and clinics. The above task could be solved through electronic benchmarking within digitalization and automation.  Purpose: To develop indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of medical and diagnostic activities of healthcare institutions for the subsequent construction of an automated multicriterial method.  Materials and methods. The analysis of regulatory legal acts in the field of health care, literature review of quality management systems implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness in medical organizations were carried out. The experience of implementing national and foreign quality standards in municipal healthcare institutions has been studied.  Results. The necessity of developing and automating a method for efficiency evaluation of health services in medical institutes is proved. A criteria-diagnostic complex, including 27 indicators, has been formed and an assessment methodology has been proposed. Moreover, the main software components for automated evaluation system are outlined.  Conclusions. Electronic benchmarking makes possible to evaluate the medical organizations that keep different quality standards, have different submission levels, and allows to compare capabilities of medical organizations against peer institutes within the industry in similar conditions. All this information can be widely used in planning of medical hospitals financing within the framework of the development of value-based healthcare.</jats:p>"

The lack of controlling resources within NMRCs limit the possibility for improving the efficiency of healthcare in supervised profiles. The electronic benchmarking system could’ve become such a tool for the controlling over medical organizations (MO). It would allow evaluating the activities of MO (for example, comparing the activities of the analyzed MO with the reference MO, or dynamics of changes in MO - historical benchmarking), finding and implementing the most effective methods for organization of work of MO and improving the quality of medical care provided to patients. The authors of the article describe the experience of development and implementation of benchmarking system in MO of the “Children's Oncology and Hematology” profile. Based on the initial results of the analysis, the following issues were identified: 1) absence of nutritive support algorithms (in 90 % of MO analyzed); 2) absence of children patient register for oncology and hematology (61 % of MO analyzed); 3) inability to organize radiation therapy service (55 % of MO analyzed); 4) deficit of surgeon operators in the field of “pediatric oncology” (42 % of MO analyzed); 5) absence of capacity for isolation of immunocompromised patients within intensive care units (39 % of MO analyzed). Thus, after analyzing with the use of electronic benchmarking tools, the primary problematics can be shown therefore the key problems requiring corrective measures by the MO management can be distinguished. The further dynamic assessment also allows evaluating of the effectiveness of the ‘work on bugs’ done.</jats:p>"
