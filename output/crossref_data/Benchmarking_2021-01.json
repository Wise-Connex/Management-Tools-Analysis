This paper analyses the economic sustainability of an environmental initiative, namely, effluent treatment plant (ETP), adopted by an Indian textile industry.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Two situations have been considered for the analysis. First, pure economic view with the operating and installed capacities has been considered. Second, combined economic-environmental view using shadow prices of undesirable outputs (biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, etc.) has been analysed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>It has been found that when pure economic view is considered, the net present value (NPV) of the ETP with present operating capacity (10,200 kL/day) is negative, implying that it is not economically sustainable. However, if the ETP is operated with the full installed capacity (17,000 kL/day), it becomes economically sustainable except in the case of very high cost of capital (13%). Finally, when shadow prices of undesirable outputs are considered, the NPV becomes positive, bolstering the economic-environmental sustainability of ETP.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>In future, multiple case studies should be conducted in similar organisations to extend the general applicability of the outcome of this study. This research considers the economic and environmental aspects of ETP. However, social benefits have not been considered in this research work, which can definitely be addressed in future endeavours.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Though very high capital investment of ETP acts as a barrier, the results of this study imply that the top management of textile and clothing organisations should look at it from the holistic economic-environmental viewpoint. The use of ETP also leads to social benefits by improving the health of local community and by reducing their hospitalisation, medical expenditure and absenteeism from school and workplace. The outcome of this research may enthuse the entrepreneurs to adopt environmental initiatives.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper provides a framework to evaluate the economic feasibility of ETP by considering the time value of money. It is demonstrated with a real case that the environmental initiatives can be economically rewarding.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Assessment strategies are under the microscope to provide accountability but are increasingly called to measure a wider set of attributes considered important in equipping graduates to meet 21st century opportunities and challenges. This paper reports on a shared benchmarking exercise between two universities to ensure the current assessment strategies in their undergraduate early childhood programs meet such requirements.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Data were collected using qualitative methodology and conceptualised using an interpretivist frame that enabled the collaborative groups to socially construct the meaning of assessment and identify what was specific, unique and different across the two programs. A cross-case analysis enabled a robust examination of the data.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Findings identified key structural and procedural differences between the two benchmarked university programs in terms of cohort size, university policies around assessment points, the use of exams and the choices surrounding professional experience placements.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Implications of the research note the complexity of contextual factors such as university policies on assessment and the impact these have on the quality of assessment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper is unique in that it used the conceptual framework for self-evaluation from TEQSA and followed their six key phases of benchmarking.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Par conséquent, la recherche d’efficience (d’évaluation et de benchmarking ) constitue l’un des moteurs les plus puissants et les plus déterminants de l’évolution des politiques publiques en la matière. L’évolution des mœurs plaide également pour une meilleure prise en compte des droits des personnes bénéficiaires et de leur projet de vie ; des personnes qui souhaitent être davantage actrices de leur parcours et non plus dépendre entièrement d’institutions historiques. Bref, le défi à venir est de diminuer les coûts des opérateurs par tous les moyens en recherchant des solutions alternatives aux réponses actuelles qui s’avèrent trop dispendieuses et de plus en plus inadéquates. La contribution brosse le paysage des orientations publiques et leurs enjeux, aborde leurs conséquences sur les formes d’accompagnement et d’organisation qui sont en devenir au sein des opérateurs sociaux et médico-sociaux – des opérateurs désormais soumis comme les autres acteurs aux principes de performance et de concurrence.</jats:p>"

By quantifying the intensity of host-guest interactions, it is possible to select cost-effective molecules that maximize binding towards a given zeolite framework. Over the last decades, a variety of methods and levels of theory have been used to calculate these binding energies. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the best calculation strategy for high-throughput virtual screening undertakings. In this work, we compare binding affinities from density functional theory (DFT) and force field calculations for 272 zeolite-OSDA pairs obtained from static and time-averaged simulations. Enabled by automation software, we show that binding energies from the frozen pose method correlate best with DFT time-averaged energies. They are also less sensitive to the choice of initial lattice parameters and optimization algorithms, as well as less computationally expensive. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a broader exploration of the conformation space from molecular dynamics simulations does not provide significant improvements in binding energy trends over single-point calculations. The code and benchmark data are open-sourced and provide robust and computationally-efficient guidelines to calculating binding energies in zeolite-OSDA pairs.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Cloud computing started with the promise of delivering computing resources elastically at scale, pay per use and on demand self-service to name a few capabilities. In early 2016, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched a new product called AWS Lambda which started the so called serverless hype and established a new cloud delivery model, namely Function as a Service (FaaS). FaaS offerings keep the promise of delivering computing resources on demand. They dynamically scale up and down function instances and introduce the most fine-grained billing model across all as-a-service offerings by accounting on a milliseconds basis. Despite this flexibility and the possibility to concentrate on the business functionality, a FaaS user loses operational control. Only a few configuration options remain to tune the functions. The first pay-as-you-go billing model raises new questions for performance-cost trade-offs. In order to choose a suitable configuration dependent on the use case and get a solid understanding of performance impact of FaaS platforms, SeMoDe implements a benchmarking and simulation pipeline. It calibrates a physical developer machine, simulates the function in different settings which are comparable to those of cloud offerings and enables a decision guidance to choose an appropriate configuration when deploying it. Based on a Structured Literature Review (SLR) to show the benchmarking and simulation efforts, I suggest a checklist for conducting fair, repeatable and meaningful benchmarks with a focus on documenting the experiments.</jats:p>"

Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as<jats:italic>Homo sapiens</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Drosophila melanogaster</jats:italic>, such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod<jats:italic>Chrysomallon squamiferum</jats:italic>(356.6Mb, 1.59% heterozygosity) and the bivalve<jats:italic>Mytilus coruscus</jats:italic>(1593Mb, 1.94% heterozygosity). By optimising the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40-50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by<jats:italic>C. squamiferum</jats:italic>, while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by<jats:italic>M. coruscus</jats:italic>. A phylogenomic analysis utilising the two updated genomes with other 32 published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure the efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also other marine phyla with few genomes available.</jats:p>"

Algorithms to determine coordination numbers automatically are increasingly used for machine learning and automatic structural analysis. In this work, we introduce MaterialsCoord, a benchmark suite containing 56 experimentally-derived crystal structures (spanning elements, binaries, and ternary compounds) and their corresponding coordination environments as described in the research literature. We also describe CrystalNN, a novel algorithm for determining near neighbors. We compare CrystalNN against 7 existing near-neighbor algorithms on the MaterialsCoord benchmark, finding CrystalNN to perform similarly to several well-established algorithms. For each algorithm, we also assess computational demand and sensitivity towards small perturbations that mimic thermal motion. Finally, we investigate the similarity between bonding algorithms when applied to the Materials Project database. We expect that this work will aid the development of coordination prediction algorithms as well as improve structural descriptors for machine learning and other applications.</jats:p>"

Indeed, social economy organizations, particularly associations and cooperatives, have rapidly developed thanks to the efforts made by the State, especially in the rural world for the financing and support of development projects, the fight against illiteracy, precariousness and poverty, the promotion and integration of women into the economic circuit. Even today and since May 18, 2005, the date of the launch of the National Human Development Initiative (INDH) by His Majesty King Mohamed VI, the aim of this study is to compare the Moroccan Model of cooperative with the other’s counties models.</jats:p>"

Data set used in this work have been provided by a travel agency which contains flight and hotel bookings of travelers. Initially, the data set was prepared for running data mining algorithms. Then, various machine learning algorithms were benchmarked for performing accurate traveler segmentation and prediction tasks. Fuzzy C-means and X-means algorithms were applied for clustering user data. J48 and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms were applied for classifying instances based on segmented user data. According to the findings of this study, J48 has the most effective classification results when applied on the data set which is clustered with X-means algorithm. The proposed hybrid data mining solution can be used by travel agencies to plan trip campaigns for similar travelers.</jats:p>"

When modeling complex sequences, attention mechanisms are regarded as the established approach to support deep neural networks with intrinsic interpretability. This paper focuses on the emerging trend of specifically designing diagnostic datasets for understanding the inner workings of attention mechanism based deep learning models for multivariate forecasting tasks. We design a novel benchmark of synthetically designed datasets with the transparent underlying generating process of multiple time series interactions with increasing complexity. The benchmark enables empirical evaluation of the performance of attention based deep neural networks in three different aspects: (i) prediction performance score, (ii) interpretability correctness, (iii) sensitivity analysis. Our analysis shows that although most models have satisfying and stable prediction performance results, they often fail to give correct interpretability. The only model with both a satisfying performance score and correct interpretability is IMV-LSTM, capturing both autocorrelations and crosscorrelations between multiple time series. Interestingly, while evaluating IMV-LSTM on simulated data from statistical and mechanistic models, the correctness of interpretability increases with more complex datasets.</jats:p>"

We present the results of using the author’s methodology on the example of one of the sectoral priority areas of smart specialization in European regions.\nThe relevance of the implementation of regional benchmarking and the place of its incorporation into the process of smart prioritization, taking into account the existing methodological support for the development of regional smart specialization strategies have been substantiated.\nThe methodology for regional benchmarking proposed by the authors includes the following main stages: (1) mapping and defining smart priorities for focal econo­mic activities; (2) analysis of regional priorities according to European policy objectives of smart specialization and study of their structure taking into account the innovative activity of the regions; (3) analysis of the content and goals of regional smart projects with the identification of intersectoral links; (4) analysis of attracting clusters to regional smart specialization and study their localization and selected priority areas; (5) analysis of interregional cooperation in selected thematic area of smart specialization; (6) processing and formalization of the obtained research results.\nThe results of approbation of the proposed methodology are presented on the example of involving the chemical sector in the formation of smart projects. Using data from European internet platforms, we examined 90 smart priorities selected in 69 European regions. It was determined that the dominant goals of the smart specialization policy based on chemical production are Key enabling technologies, Sustainable innovation and Digital transformation. We found that these goals were chosen mainly by the innovation-active regions, while regions with a low level of innovation development, in addition to Sustainable innovation and Key enabling technologies, also focus on projects in the field of health and safety. It is concluded that the combination of knowledge and assets in the smart specialization process in Europe is the result of increased intersectoral and interregional cooperation, including using cluster technologies. Сross-sectoral linkages in smart projects are formed mostly within the existing value chains. At the same time, recently, new intersectoral partnerships, which are focused mainly on digitalization, diffusion of innovative biotechnologies and technologies for sustainable development, have emerged and are actively developing.</jats:p>"

Today university teachers have to be ready for continuous development and advanced training throughout their lives. Thus, the study of the problem of university teachers’ professional development in Russia and abroad is very relevant and timely as a response to the modern requirements of civil society for the personality of the teacher. The need for professional development among university teachers is closely related to his (her) desire for more successful indicators in teaching activities. To do this, it is necessary to fulfill several pedagogical conditions, including the teacher's own awareness of the need for professional development; the interest of the university administration and the availability of resources to organize an effective professional development system, etc. The purpose of the article is to show some successful practices of the teachers’ professional development in Russian, Chinese and European universities which the author observed while visiting those universities within the realization the project “Enhancing teaching practice in the universities of Russia and China”.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to establish the measurement model. Multiple regression analysis was used to explain the scale's predictive ability.

Among these, nurse affective communication has a significant positive effect on patient satisfaction. The gap analysis shows that patients have high expectations for doctors' affective communication, while they perceive a low level of service performance in the realm of nurse affective communication. The study highlights a new means of measuring “reliability” in healthcare. Important findings on patients' priorities are evaluated and discussed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Healthcare organizations and practitioners can improve patient-centered care by stressing the dimensions of PCC, including clinicians' affective and instrumental communication.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The study expands the understanding of HCAHPS instruments in an emerging economy context and opens avenues for more widespread use of the measures.

To improve this behaviour, this paper aims to develop a maintenance strategy benchmarking model for concrete structures.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Fuzzy logic toolbox on MATLAB R2018a was used to develop the proposed model and it was applied to two cases. A comprehensive literature search was done to review common concrete defects, their impact on the performance and functionality of the structure, effectiveness of maintenance strategies and previous maintenance benchmarking models. The literature findings were further validated through expert interviews which have been incorporated in the model.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Case study results show that preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PdM) and corrective maintenance (CM) strategies are required more or less in similar combinations for maintenance of concrete roof structures. The best combination for case 1 is 36.42% PM, 35.40% PdM and 28.18% CM, and for case 2 is 35.93% PM, 35.08% PdM and 28.99% CM.

This challenge is particularly prominent when working with high-resolution big-datasets that are now acquired using electron tomography and serial block-face imaging techniques. Deep learning (DL) methods offer an exciting opportunity to automate the segmentation process by learning from manual annotations of a small sample of EM data. While many DL methods are being rapidly adopted to segment EM data no benchmark analysis has been conducted on these methods to date.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We present EM-stellar, a platform that is hosted on Google Colab that can be used to benchmark the performance of a range of state-of-the-art DL methods on user-provided datasets. Using EM-stellar we show that the performance of any DL method is dependent on the properties of the images being segmented. It also follows that no single DL method performs consistently across all performance evaluation metrics.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>EM-stellar (code and data) is written in Python and is freely available under MIT license on GitHub (https://github.com/cellsmb/em-stellar).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>"

Data have been collected by conducting surveys and interviews with strategic-level personnel of five esteemed organizations in automobile manufacturing sectors. A GSCM framework is developed in which a mathematical tool entropy–the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) has been used to analyze the six parameters of automobile manufacturing unit. Initially, entropy is used to find the weights of each of the parameters that influence the decision matrix of the TOPSIS method. Secondly, the proposed GSCM framework ranks the supplier. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the model satisfies the GSCM framework and benchmarked the supplier.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The result shows that “Total CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission” has an influential role for GSCM sustainability, and hence, firms should put more effort to reduce emissions to improve overall performance. Again, the parameters like investment in R&amp;D and total waste generation may be ignored in the selection process. The result reveals the benchmarked supplier and its strategies for effective sourcing, which would have an indirect effect on organizations' overall sustainability.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research entirely focuses on sustainability within supply chain considering economic, social and environmental paradigms.

This study benchmarks the supplier organizations and explores the adopted policies by benchmarked organizations. Other organizations should follow the policies followed by benchmarked organization for enhancing environmental, social and economic performance. Organizations striving for sustainable development can adopt this framework for evaluation of supplier performance and benchmark with better accuracy.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The design of the GSCM framework explores both the qualitative and quantitative data based on environmental, social and economic parameters simultaneously in the evaluation of environmentally conscious suppliers.

Some of the most critical steps in successful transformation pertain not only to data and information acquisition and digitalization but also to adequate publishing and organization of these information resources. Companies share information through their websites, so the structuring of the web content becomes critical during the digital transformation of business. In this paper, the authors present a conceptual model of the managerial tool that is based on semantic analysis of web sites in order to obtain information about the structure of web sites in a particular domain. The resulting ontological model contains information about best practices in web information organization and can be a valuable resource for management when deciding on the organization of their own web content. The system is based on grounded theory and uses current information retrieval methods, natural language processing, semantic networks, and ontologies.</p>"

The Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) Consortium released an expertly annotated STS data set and called for the National Natural Language Processing Clinical Challenges. This work describes our entry, an ensemble model that leverages a range of deep learning (DL) models. Our team from the National Library of Medicine obtained a Pearson correlation of 0.8967 in an official test set during 2019 National Natural Language Processing Clinical Challenges/Open Health Natural Language Processing shared task and achieved a second rank.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>Although our models strongly correlate with manual annotations, annotator-level correlation was only moderate (weighted Cohen &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;=0.60). We are cautious of the potential use of DL models in production systems and argue that it is more critical to evaluate the models in-depth, especially those with extremely high correlations. In this study, we benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of top-ranked DL models. We quantify their robustness and inference times to validate their usefulness in real-time applications.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>We benchmarked five DL models, which are the top-ranked systems for STS tasks: Convolutional Neural Network, BioSentVec, BioBERT, BlueBERT, and ClinicalBERT. We evaluated a random forest model as an additional baseline. For each model, we repeated the experiment 10 times, using the official training and testing sets. We reported 95% CI of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the average Pearson correlation (official evaluation metric) and running time. We further evaluated Spearman correlation, R², and mean squared error as additional measures.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>RESULTS</title>\n                        <p>Using only the official training set, all models obtained highly effective results. BioSentVec and BioBERT achieved the highest average Pearson correlations (0.8497 and 0.8481, respectively). BioSentVec also had the highest results in 3 of 4 effectiveness measures, followed by BioBERT. However, their robustness to sentence pairs of different similarity levels varies significantly. A particular observation is that BERT models made the most errors (a mean squared error of over 2.5) on highly similar sentence pairs. They cannot capture highly similar sentence pairs effectively when they have different negation terms or word orders. In addition, time efficiency is dramatically different from the effectiveness results. On average, the BERT models were approximately 20 times and 50 times slower than the Convolutional Neural Network and BioSentVec models, respectively. This results in challenges for real-time applications.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>Despite the excitement of further improving Pearson correlations in this data set, our results highlight that evaluations of the effectiveness and efficiency of STS models are critical. In future, we suggest more evaluations on the generalization capability and user-level testing of the models. We call for community efforts to create more biomedical and clinical STS data sets from different perspectives to reflect the multifaceted notion of sentence-relatedness.</p>\n                </sec>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>The research community has invested heavily in semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Their stability when scaled down to a few atoms thick makes them attractive candidates to replace or supplement silicon in many future technologies. Although this sentiment is prevalent, demonstrations of 2D field-effect transistors (FETs) often do not present their data in a way that enables a straightforward comparison. For example, some papers solely use mobility as the figure of merit, while others focus on unnormalized device on-current. Here, we benchmark the performance of a selection of 2D FETs with field-corrected metrics that allow a more accurate projection of their potential; while the demonstrated methods are by no means comprehensive, they provide insight into improved benchmarking of 2D FETs going forward. Importantly, we show that appropriate benchmarking requires consideration of the specific application, with the three dominant potential application areas of front-end-of-line (FEOL) high-performance FETs, back-end-of-line (BEOL) 3D-integrated FETs, and low-cost thin-film FETs (or TFTs) each demonstrated. We find that 2D materials have the potential to compete with silicon as the channel in scaled FEOL high-performance devices. Meanwhile, in BEOL applications, FETs from in situ synthesized 2D materials have performance limited by their low crystal quality – a result of the stringent thermal budget of BEOL fabrication, which necessitates the use of transferred 2D materials. In the TFT area, 2D materials are simpler to fabricate than their silicon-based counterparts and they are competitive with other material alternatives. As promising as these findings are, there remain many hurdles for 2D materials to overcome, including poor reliability, performance variability, and fabrication scalability. Continuous research effort, combined with appropriate benchmarking, is strongly encouraged.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>To demonstrate that nuclear reactors can be built faster and more economically than they have been in the past, the US Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy is sponsoring the development of a small nuclear reactor called the Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR) [1–2]. An important part of the design and licencing process of a new reactor is validation of the software used to analyze the reactor using established reactor physics benchmarks. This paper discusses validation of the neutronics software used to model four preliminary designs of the TCR core [2]. Because the TCR core design uses innovative technology and methods, comparable established benchmarks are limited or do not exist. For this effort, established benchmarks from the International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments (ICSBEP) [3] were considered to be suitable for this design based on analysis using the SCALE/TSUNAMI-computed similarity indices to determine the amount of shared uncertainty between the design and each selected benchmark experiment. This paper addresses the challenges faced in benchmarking a unique reactor for licensing and construction, a task that will become more common as a new generation of innovative nuclear reactors are designed and built.</jats:p>"

A follow up short survey was conducted to assess non-response bias. Analysis by region and key sheep enterprise.\n\nKey results\nThere were 354 and 250 useable responses to the main and short surveys respectively. Mean reported rainfall of 407 mm in 2018 was 27% lower than the average for respondents and &amp;gt;200 mm lower than mean reported rainfall in the previous surveys. The top three methods for worm control over the past 5 years were preventative treatments (74%), preparing clean pastures by spelling paddocks (62%) and treatment on the basis of faecal worm egg count (WEC, 54%). The proportion of respondents using WEC monitoring in 2018 was 40.4%, with a mean frequency of 3.1/year, and this was unaffected by sheep class. The frequency of anthelmintic treatment for ewes and lambs and weaners was 2.1/year. Of the respondents, 36.7% had performed an anthelmintic resistance test in the previous 5 years. The most popular flystrike control methods were timing of crutching (76.4%), preventative chemical treatment (75.9%), timing of shearing (63.1%), mulesing (46.8%) and genetic selection (46.4%). Pain relief was widely used for mulesing ewes (86.6%) and wethers (90.9%). Only 17.3% used Australian Sheep Breeding Values for traits in rams. Most respondents reported ‘evidence of lice’ in the past 5 years (55.8%) and had treated for lice off shears (50.1%), short wool (16.6%) or long wool (6.6%), with only 26.7% having not treated at all in the period. Web-based sources of information on parasite control have become increasingly important.\n\nConclusions\nNotable changes since the earlier surveys were high rates of pain relief when mulesing, an increase in the use of Australian Sheep Breeding Values for parasite-related traits, an increase in WEC monitoring since 2011 and an increased use of web-based resources.\n\nImplications\nParasite control remains important for sheep producers and continues to evolve with new drugs and approaches. The surveys highlight the effectiveness of extension networks and identify where more attention is required.\n\n</jats:p>"

The organization may make a comparison between its performance and that of the peers from benchmarking, and recognize their advantages as well as disadvantages. The main objective of the present systematic literature review has been the study of DEA benchmarking process. Therefore, it examined and gave a summary of various DEA models applied worldwide to improve benchmarking. Accordingly, a list of published academic papers that appeared in high-ranking journals between 2003 and February 2020 was collected for a systematic review of the DEA benchmarking application. Consequently, the papers selected have been classified according to year of publication, purpose of research, outcomes and results. This study has identified eight major applications including: transportation, service sector, product planning, maintenance, hotel industry, education, distribution and environmental factors. They take up a total of 82% of all application-embedded papers. Among all the applications, the highest recent development has been in both the transportation and service sectors. Results showed higher potential of DEA as a suitable evaluation method for the further benchmarking researches, wherein the production feature between outputs and inputs has been practically lacked or very hard to obtain.</jats:p>"

In order to understand the basic situation of China’s low-carbon cities more specifically, this paper selects countries with different urbanization rates to carry out benchmarking analysis with China, hoping to draw on the experience of other countries from the national level through multi-dimensional comparison, and guide the direction of China’s future urban development. Firstly, this paper selects the basic indicators such as the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions, per capita carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit GDP of each country; Secondly, it compares the proportion of coal in energy and other indicators, and analyzes the energy structure of each country in depth; Thirdly, it compares the trend of carbon emissions in each country among 1990-2017. Finally, in order to reflect the carbon emission in the development of urbanization, this paper uses the “urbanization carbon emission index”, which is the ratio of per capita carbon emission and urbanization rate, to show the relationship between the degree of urbanization and carbon emission. Through benchmarking analysis, we can more clearly understand the overall trend of low-carbon city construction in different countries, recognize the gap between China and other countries, and better guide the development of low-carbon cities in China in the future.</jats:p>"

They can greatly enhance our understanding of biological systems when effectively integrated. To achieve proper integration, joint Dimensionality Reduction (jDR) methods are among the most efficient approaches. However, several jDR methods are available, urging the need for a comprehensive benchmark with practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of nine representative jDR methods using three complementary benchmarks. First, we evaluate their performances in retrieving ground-truth sample clustering from simulated multi-omics datasets. Second, we use TCGA cancer data to assess their strengths in predicting survival, clinical annotations and known pathways/biological processes. Finally, we assess their classification of multi-omics single-cell data. From these in-depth comparisons, we observe that intNMF performs best in clustering, while MCIA offers an effective behavior across many contexts. The code developed for this benchmark study is implemented in a Jupyter notebook—multi-omics mix (momix)—to foster reproducibility, and support users and future developers.</jats:p>"

The ISM model resulted in six different levels beginning from redesign organization at the bottom of the structure. The TISM model explained why redesigning the organization is pivotal to bringing about novel agility in the supply chain.

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Flow cytometry remains a commonly used methodology due to its ability to characterise multiple parameters on single particles in a high-throughput manner. In order to address limitations with lacking sensitivity of conventional flow cytometry to characterise extracellular vesicles (EVs), novel, highly sensitive platforms, such as high-resolution and imaging flow cytometers, have been developed. We provided comparative benchmarks of a conventional FACS Aria III, a high-resolution Apogee A60 Micro-PLUS and the ImageStream X Mk II imaging flow cytometry platform. Nanospheres were used to systematically characterise the abilities of each platform to detect and quantify populations with different sizes, refractive indices and fluorescence properties, and the repeatability in concentration determinations was reported for each population. We evaluated the ability of the three platforms to detect different EV phenotypes in blood plasma and the intra-day, inter-day and global variabilities in determining EV concentrations. By applying this or similar methodology to characterise methods, researchers would be able to make informed decisions on choice of platforms and thereby be able to match suitable flow cytometry platforms with projects based on the needs of each individual project. This would greatly contribute to improving the robustness and reproducibility of EV studies.</jats:p>"

Neutronics studies, which perform in-depth analysis are typically performed using radiation transport codes such as MCNP, TRIPOLI, Serpent, FLUKA and OpenMC. The Serpent 2 Monte-Carlo code, developed by VTT in Finland, is the focus of this work which seeks to benchmark the code for fusion applications. The application of Serpent 2 in fusion specific analysis requires validation of the codes performance in an energy range, and a geometrical description, which significantly differs to conventional nuclear fission analysis, for which the code was originally developed.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>A Serpent model of the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG) Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) mock up experiment has been prepared and the calculated results compared against experimental data, as well as the reference Monte Carlo code MCNP. The analysis is extended to a model of DEMO with HCPB blanket concept. For this model, the flux, nuclear heating, tritium production and DPA are calculated, all of which are integral nuclear responses in fusion reactor analysis. In general, a very good agreement is demonstrated for both of the benchmarks, with any discrepancies pinpointed to different physics models implemented.</jats:p>"

Benchmarking is a management tool already adopted by some countries in this context, aiming to reduce the amount of non-revenue water. The present study aimed to gather information about the application models of this tool, as well as to compare the performance with other countries in which it is also not applied. It was observed that the ideal benchmarking structuring model capable of minimizing these indexes includes less than annual application frequency, partial regulation, absence of confidentiality, gratuity, open and restricted reports to service providers and mean interactivity of the results release. It was also concluded that the countries where benchmarking is practiced have better performances regarding lower levels of non-revenue water.</jats:p>"

However, this kind of system has never been implemented in Russia. OpenForecast v2—the first national-scale operational runoff forecasting system in Russia—has been developed and deployed to fill this gap. OpenForecast v2 delivers 7 day-ahead streamflow forecasts for 843 gauges across Russia. The verification study has been carried out using 244 gauges for which operational streamflow data were openly available and quality-controlled for the entire verification period (14 March–6 July 2020). The results showed that the developed system provides reliable and skillful runoff forecasts for up to one week. The benchmark testing against climatology and persistence forecasts showed that the system provides skillful predictions for most analyzed basins. OpenForecast v2 is in operational use and is openly available on the Internet.</jats:p>"

Since the evaluation of bioinformatics pipelines is not straightforward, NGS demands effective strategies to analyze data that is of paramount relevance for decision making under a clinical scenario. According to the benchmarking framework of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), we implemented a new simple and user-friendly set-theory based method to assess variant callers using a gold standard variant set and high confidence regions. As model, we used TruSight Cardio kit sequencing data of the reference genome NA12878. This targeted sequencing kit is used to identify variants in key genes related to Inherited Cardiac Conditions (ICCs), a group of cardiovascular diseases with high rates of morbidity and mortality.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We implemented and compared three variant calling pipelines (Isaac, Freebayes, and VarScan). Performance metrics using our set-theory approach showed high-resolution pipelines and revealed: (1) a perfect recall of 1.000 for all three pipelines, (2) very high precision values, i.e. 0.987 for Freebayes, 0.928 for VarScan, and 1.000 for Isaac, when compared with the reference material, and (3) a ROC curve analysis with AUC &gt; 0.94 for all cases. Moreover, significant differences were obtained between the three pipelines. In general, results indicate that the three pipelines were able to recognize the expected variants in the gold standard data set.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our set-theory approach to calculate metrics was able to identify the expected ICCs related variants by the three selected pipelines, but results were completely dependent on the algorithms. We emphasize the importance to assess pipelines using gold standard materials to achieve the most reliable results for clinical application.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

Online questionnaires were used as the instrument to collect data, and the data were analyzed by deception analysis to illustrate various features of the variables studied. Hypothesis test was conducted by Partial Least Square Path Modeling (SEM-PM). The MSME population was 231 and the representative sample was 144 culinary companies. It was found that entrepreneurial skills, benchmarking, and performance of culinary MSME innovations tended to be lower than expected. The results of this study revealed that entrepreneurship and benchmarking skills had significant effects on innovation performance. To improve innovation performance, companies must pay more attention to practical knowledge, especially knowledge of bookkeeping and digital marketing, and make more comparisons on financial aspects.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Benchmark studies of insect populations are increasingly relevant and needed amid accelerating concern about insect trends in the Anthropocene. The growing recognition that insect populations may be in decline has given rise to a renewed call for insect population monitoring by scientists, and a desire from the broader public to participate in insect surveys. However, due to the immense diversity of insects and a vast assortment of data collection methods, there is a general lack of standardization in insect monitoring methods, such that a sudden and unplanned expansion of data collection may fail to meet its ecological potential or conservation needs without a coordinated focus on standards and best practices. To begin to address this problem, we provide simple guidelines for maximizing return on proven inventory methods that will provide insect benchmarking data suitable for a variety of ecological responses, including occurrence and distribution, phenology, abundance and biomass, and diversity and species composition. To track these responses, we present seven primary insect sampling methods—malaise trapping, light trapping, pan trapping, pitfall trappings, beating sheets, acoustic monitoring, and active visual surveys—and recommend standards while highlighting examples of model programs. For each method, we discuss key topics such as recommended spatial and temporal scales of sampling, important metadata to track, and degree of replication needed to produce rigorous estimates of ecological responses. We additionally suggest protocols for scalable insect monitoring, from backyards to national parks. Overall, we aim to compile a resource that can be used by diverse individuals and organizations seeking to initiate or improve insect monitoring programs in this era of rapid change.</jats:p>"

Especially when a quick assessment of a structure is necessary, easily measurable characteristics, such as geometric properties have to be used. In this paper, the existing Application BRASSCO-NG is extended for masonry arch bridges by implementing the methodology described in paper [16] of this conference proceedings. Embedded into a worked example, the application of the tool is explained in detail from the first reconnaissance to the interpretation of the results. A subsequent benchmark evaluation to the static calculation and the empirical MEXE methodology compares the outcome to the techniques currently used in military and civil engineering. Even though the tool is mainly aimed for military application, the basic structure can easily be adopted for civil use, e.g. the rapid assessment of a structure after a natural disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

One of the critical issues for aligning strategies adopted for a master program is the need to develop critically reflective approaches to assessing a master’s thesis. In this article, we present a case study of an assessment conception for a master’s thesis in master’s programmes delivered at Northern Arctic Federal University (NArFU) (Arkhangelsk, Russia). The discussion is offered for two main reasons. Firstly, the case study could be of interest for other educators and programme developers who are involved in the process. Secondly, we offer a set of places to look for answers in search of promoting validity, reliability and fairness of internationally acknowledged quality of education. The results of the research may serve to inform the education policy-makers about initiatives to be taken for establishing a culture of assessment and continuous improvement within this sphere.</jats:p>"

The economic essence and the purpose of benchmarking as a marketing tool for ensuring competitive advantages are disclosed. The main prerequisites, the motives that presuppose the use of benchmarking in the activities of enterprises are considered. The modern approaches to benchmarking management are specified. Classification features are distinguished, types of benchmarking and scope of their use are characterized. The peculiarities of benchmarking of business processes of retail enterprises, the major success factors (assortment and laying out of goods, quality of goods/services, technology of purchase, saving of the buyers’ expenses, interaction with staff, store atmosphere, perception of the store by consumers) and the main management tasks in the process of change management, the solution of which will allow the retail trade enterprise to respond promptly to changes in market conditions and optimally combine goals and objectives of commercial activities with the needs of consumers. The factors that hinder the use of benchmarking by trade enterprises are described, in particular, the weak development of strategic analysis functions, the high cost of benchmarking research, and the deficiency of information field. Prospects for further exploration are determined as research of the mechanism and tools for the formation of information and communication provision of the benchmarking process in order to provide feedback in the processes of planning, control and adjustment.</jats:p>"

To compare the operation of accreditation bodies in Europe and to identify best practices, a management tool, the <jats:italic>Process Maturity Benchmarking Tool</jats:italic>, was developed and validated by applying it to European accreditation bodies. The benchmarking project comprised two major phases: in the first phase, the processes of accreditation bodies were systematically analyzed. A process map was developed, and processes of special relevance were identified and underpinned by indicators. In the second phase, the practical applicability of the theoretical model was demonstrated by analyzing the processes of eight European accreditation bodies. The results of this comparative assessment were subsequently discussed in a workshop with experts from those accreditation bodies, giving the opportunity to identify best practices. This article has a twofold objective. First, to present a method to benchmark European accreditation bodies, based on the European Foundation for Quality Management excellence model. The successful application of the <jats:italic>Process Maturity Benchmarking Tool</jats:italic> gives evidence that it is a suitable and capable management tool to assess the processes of the European accreditation bodies and to benchmark them. Second, the article presents the results of the first adaption of the <jats:italic>Process Maturity Benchmarking Tool</jats:italic>. A general trend of process maturity was identified: while processes based on stakeholder involvement tend to have an overall lower maturity on average, internal processes are more mature.</jats:p>"

Despite the usefulness of the methodology, difficulties exist with the interpretation of LCA results. The use of benchmarks can facilitate this process, but there is yet little research on the definition of environmental benchmarks. The aim of this paper is to analyse the distribution of environmental performance used for the definition of the benchmark and how it effects the use in selected product categories.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Method</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>LCA results from 54 Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for insulation materials and 49 EPDs for bakery products are tested for their distribution. The outcome from the statistical analysis is used to compare and evaluate three calculation methods for a benchmark.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results and discussion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The results of the study show that distributions and mid- and end-points of environmental performances of the studied indicators differ significantly for the two product categories. While some indicators for bakery products were closer to a normal distribution, most of the indicators are not normally distributed. This is reflected in the comparison of the chosen calculation methods for a benchmark, which showed that the distribution of the data affects the classification of the benchmark as well as the position of values on the benchmark.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The results emphasise that analysis of further product groups and the associated distribution of the environmental performance is needed to understand the implications of calculation methods on a benchmark. The availability of comparatively large datasets in a common structure is crucial for these analyses and can be facilitated through the digitalisation of LCA- and EPD-information. Furthermore, more research is needed on the communication formats for different benchmarking options, which must be applied for the different intended audiences to be effective.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

With the advent of smart devices, embedding cameras, inertial measurement units, visual SLAM (vSLAM), and visual‐inertial SLAM (viSLAM) are enabling novel general public applications. In this context, this paper conducts a review of popular SLAM approaches with a focus on vSLAM/viSLAM, both at fundamental and experimental levels. It starts with a structured overview of existing vSLAM and viSLAM designs and continues with a new classification of a dozen main state‐of‐the‐art methods. A chronological survey of viSLAM’s development highlights the historical milestones and presents more recent methods into a classification. Finally, the performance of vSLAM is experimentally assessed for the use case of pedestrian pose estimation with a handheld device in urban environments. The performance of five open‐source methods Vins‐Mono, ROVIO, ORB‐SLAM2, DSO, and LSD‐SLAM is compared using the EuRoC MAV dataset and a new visual‐inertial dataset corresponding to urban pedestrian navigation. A detailed analysis of the computation results identifies the strengths and weaknesses for each method. Globally, ORB‐SLAM2 appears to be the most promising algorithm to address the challenges of urban pedestrian navigation, tested with two datasets.</jats:p>"

PREMs are increasingly adopted for paediatric care, but there is little published evidence on how to administer, collect, and report paediatric PREMs at scale.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This paper describes the development of a PREMs questionnaire and administration system for the Meyer Children’s University Hospital in Florence (Meyer) and the Children’s Clinical University Hospital in Riga (CCUH). The system continuously recruits participants into the electronic administration model, with surveys completed by caregivers or adolescents at their convenience, post-discharge. We analyse 1661 responses from Meyer and 6585 from CCUH, collected from 1st December 2018 to 21st January 2020. Quantitative and qualitative experience analyses are included, using Pearson chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and narrative evidence from free text responses.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The large populations reached in both countries suggest the continuous, digital collection of paediatric PREMs described is feasible for collecting paediatric PREMs at scale. Overall response rates were 59% in Meyer and 45% in CCUH. There was very low variation in mean scores between the hospitals, with greater clustering of Likert scores around the mean in CCUH and a wider spread in Meyer for a number of items. The significant majority of responses represent the carers’ point of view or the perspective of children and adolescents expressed through proxy reporting by carers.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Very similar reported scores may reflect broadly shared preferences among children, adolescents and carers in the two countries, and the ability of both hospitals in this study to meet their expectations.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p>The model has several interesting features: inclusion of a narrative element; electronic administration and completion after discharge from hospital, with high completion rates and easy data management; access for staff and researchers through an online platform, with real time analysis and visualization; dual implementation in two sites in different settings, with comparison and shared learning. These bring new opportunities for the utilization of PREMs for more person-centered and better quality care, although further research is needed in order to access direct reporting by children and adolescents.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

The criteria of classification of country-regional models of venture financing of innovative projects that cannot fully reflect its impact on the structural dynamics of national and global innovation development and should be supplemented by a number of additional criteria are considered. It is also the market model most widely used in the Anglo-Saxon countries. The presence of the best international business schools in the world is also a major competitive advantage of the market model of venture financing for innovation; deep cooperative links between universities, government laboratories and private companies. The role of the state in supporting the venture industry is analyzed, since in the market model it consists in direct investment of state funds into innovative companies (ie participation in capital) and high-tech programs and projects, as well as implementation of guarantee programs for the development of venture activity and creation of proper regulatory, organizational-economic, financial-investment and credit-tax conditions of its support. The strategic goal is most realized today in countries with a market model of venture financing, where it has long proven its high efficiency as a significant source of innovative development. And, the deepening of the processes of technoglobalism gives the venture business a powerful impetus for development, transforming it in accordance with the impact of global economic trends and stimulating the scale-up and diversification of the regional and sectoral-sectoral structure of venture capital investments.</jats:p>"

However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Methods: </ns3:bold>We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Results: </ns3:bold>Canu v2.1 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200803 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.1/v1.3.1 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.3.0 was reliable for chromosome assembly, though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.7.0 were computationally efficient but more likely to produce incomplete assemblies.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Conclusions: </ns3:bold>Of the assemblers tested, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NextDenovo/NextPolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on long-read assembly algorithms.</ns3:p>"

It is one of the rapidly growing fields that come with huge computational power for scientific workloads. Currently, the scientific community is ready to work over the cloud as it is considered as a resource-rich paradigm. The traditional way of executing scientific workloads on cloud computing is by using virtual machines. However, the latest emerging concept of containerization is growing more rapidly and gained popularity because of its unique features. Containers are treated as lightweight as compared to virtual machines in cloud computing. In this regard, a few VMs/containers-associated problems of performance and throughput are encountered because of middleware technologies such as virtualization or containerization. In this paper, we introduce the configurations of VMs and containers for cloud-based scientific workloads in order to utilize the technologies to solve scientific problems and handle their workloads. This paper also tackles throughput and efficiency problems related to VMs and containers in the cloud environment and explores efficient resource provisioning by combining four unique methods: hyperthreading (HT), vCPU cores selection, vCPU affinity, and isolation of vCPUs. The HEPSCPEC06 benchmark suite is used to evaluate the throughput and efficiency of VMs and containers. The proposed solution is to implement four basic techniques to reduce the effect of virtualization and containerization. Additionally, these techniques are used to make virtual machines and containers more effective and powerful for scientific workloads. The results show that allowing hyperthreading, isolation of CPU cores, proper numbering, and allocation of vCPU cores can improve the throughput and performance of virtual machines and containers.</jats:p>"

However, this screening can be extremely time and labor intensive, especially when intuition is used. Machine learning offers a solution through iterative suggestions of new experiments based on past experimental data, but knowing which machine learning strategy to apply in a particular case is still difficult. Here, we develop chemically‐motivated virtual benchmarks for reaction optimisation and compare several strategies on these benchmarks. The benchmarks and strategies are encompassed in an open‐source framework named Summit. The results of our tests show that Bayesian optimisation strategies perform very well across the types of problems faced in chemical reaction optimisation, while many strategies commonly used in reaction optimisation fail to find optimal solutions.</jats:p>"

Transformation products (TPs) are especially problematic because analytical standards are rarely available. Here, we compared three quantification approaches for non-target compounds that do not require the availability of analytical standards. The comparison is based on a unique set of concentration data for 341 compounds, mainly pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and their TPs in 31 groundwater samples from Switzerland. The best accuracy was observed with the predicted ionization efficiency-based quantification, the mean error of concentration prediction for the groundwater samples was a factor of 1.8, and all of the 74 micropollutants detected in the groundwater were quantified with an error less than a factor of 10. The quantification of TPs with the parent compounds had significantly lower accuracy (mean error of a factor of 3.8) and could only be applied to a fraction of the detected compounds, while the mean performance (mean error of a factor of 3.2) of the closest eluting standard approach was similar to the parent compound approach.</jats:p>"

However, processes from DNA extraction and library construction to bioinformatic analysis include several varying tasks. Further, there is no validated recommendation for the comprehensive procedure. In this study, we examined potential pitfalls on the sequencing results based on two-person mtDNA mixtures. Therefore, we compared three DNA polymerases, six different variant callers in five mixtures between 50% and 0.5% variant allele frequencies generated with two different amplification protocols. In total, 48 samples were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Low-level variant calling at the 1% variant level and below was performed by comparing trimming and PCR duplicate removal as well as six different variant callers. The results indicate that sensitivity, specificity, and precision highly depend on the investigated polymerase but also vary based on the analysis tools. Our data highlight the advantage of prior standardization and validation of the individual laboratory setup with a DNA mixture model. Finally, we provide an artificial heteroplasmy benchmark dataset that can help improve somatic variant callers or pipelines, which may be of great interest for research related to cancer and aging.</jats:p>"

The research objectives of this article are to identify the appraisal of Greece in e-government over time and in relation to other countries as well as the role of internal audit and transparency related to digital public services. The method adopted is through an extensive bibliographic review of the Greek, European and international literature of the thematic field of e-government as well as the presentation of several frameworks to structure the discussion of e-government benchmark design based on a benchmarking with key indicators of published surveys from internationally reputable organizations. The findings of this paper are that Greece proceeded at a very slow pace in its digital transformation, shows shortcomings in e-government policies, records delays in adapting the services requested by citizens, and no matter the lack of investment in technological infrastructure, the effectiveness of e-governance presupposes proactiveness. Nevertheless, another key conclusion of the research is that Greece is far from the average performance of e-government in the European Union due to its chronic economic problems, the lack of technological equipment and the lack of overall orientation in e-government. Furthermore, this paper can be a measure of comparison for other countries that have similar characteristics to Greece in order to improve e-governance.</jats:p>"

It is still a challenging issue to generate reliable HLA genotyping results through <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> tools. In addition, the survival impact of HLA alleles in tumor prognosis and immunotherapy remains controversial. In this study, the benchmarking of HLA genotyping on TCGA is performed and a ‘Gun‐Bullet’ model which helps to clarify the survival impact of HLA allele is presented. The performance of HLA class I genotyping is generally better than class II. POLYSOLVER, OptiType, and xHLA perform generally better at HLA class I calling with an accuracy of 0.954, 0.949, and 0.937, respectively. HLA‐HD obtained the highest accuracy of 0.904 on HLA class II alleles calling. Each HLA genotyping tool displayed specific error patterns. The ensemble HLA calling from the top‐3 tools is superior to any individual one. HLA alleles show distinct survival impact among cancers. Cytolytic activity (CYT) was proposed as the underlying mechanism to interpret the survival impact of HLA alleles in the ‘Gun‐Bullet’ model for fighting cancer. A strong HLA allele plus a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) could stimulate intensive immune CYT, leading to extended survival. We established an up to now most reliable TCGA HLA benchmark dataset, composing of concordance alleles generated from eight prevalently used HLA genotyping tools. Our findings indicate that reliable HLA genotyping should be performed based on concordance alleles integrating multiple tools and incorporating TMB background with HLA genotype, which helps to improve the survival prediction compared to HLA genotyping alone.</jats:p>"

The amount of data recorded from the experiments and transported to hundreds of sites will see a thirty fold increase in annual data volume. A systematic approach to contrast the performance of different Third Party Copy (TPC) transfer protocols arises. Two contenders, XRootD-HTTPS and the GridFTP are evaluated in their performance for transferring files from one server to another over 100Gbps interfaces. The benchmarking is done by scheduling pods on the Pacific Research Platform Kubernetes cluster to ensure reproducible and repeatable results. This opens a future pathway for network testing of any TPC transfer protocol.</jats:p>"

The present cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the prevalence of rumen mucosa, lung, and liver lesions in 153 randomly selected batches of finishing beef cattle through a<jats:italic>post-mortem</jats:italic>inspection at the abattoir. At least 15 animals per batch were inspected at slaughter by two veterinarians for a total of 2,161 animals (1,376 bulls; 785 heifers) coming from 80 Italian commercial farms. Rumens were inspected by recording as binary variables (presence/absence) signs of hyperkeratosis, ruminitis, ulcer, and star scars. Similarly, lungs were inspected for signs of pneumonia and livers for signs of lipidosis, abscesses, and/or adherence. Hyperkeratosis of the mucosa and signs of ruminitis were detected in 58 and 30% of the inspected rumens, respectively. Ruminal star scars were more prevalent in bulls than in heifers (18 vs. 11%;<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.05). Signs of severe pneumonia were observed in 10% of the lungs; abscess and/or adherence in 4% of the livers. Hyperkeratosis of rumen mucosa was correlated to signs of ruminitis, and signs of ruminitis were correlated to star scars. No correlations were found between hepatic lesions and any other rumen or lung disorders. The wide variability observed among batches for the prevalence of specific lesions suggested the development of a benchmarking system to provide feedback to the farm veterinarians, as these lesions can be reflective of a subclinical disease status not easy to be detected in the live animal. Quartiles of the batch prevalence of rumen, lung, and liver alterations (if ≥1%) were calculated as a benchmarking tool, and third quartile value was proposed as an alarm threshold for each lesion. The use of the benchmarking system could allow to allocate each inspected batch to a specific “health class.” Critical batches with a prevalence above the alarm threshold for a given lesion should be reported to veterinarians of the origin farms where actions should be taken in order to identify and lower the risk factors for that specific health issue. Knowledge of<jats:italic>post-mortem</jats:italic>inspection data along with the implementation of the proposed benchmarking system should help farm veterinarians to improve herd management from a health and welfare perspective.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Benchmarking as a tool of constant self-improvement of a bank is studied with regard to the peculiarities of the banking sector. Benchmarking is considered as a method, with the help of which achievements of a bank-leader or a bank-standard serve as a reference point for improvement of own business strategy. The necessity of borrowing of the best experience in various directions of the banking sphere and its adaptation to own activity for the purpose of reception of considerable competitive advantages at the market of banking services is substantiated. The features of applying types of benchmarking are analyzed and its components in the implementation of the positive experience of competitors and partners are highlighted. It is established that benchmarking assumes the analysis of reference practice in the world and is directly connected with strategic management system. One of the most effective tools in the banking market is benchmarking. Many scientists identify its emergence with the search of new approaches and constant movement to be ahead of competitors in the banking sector. The main task for each bank is to ensure sustainable competitive advantage through the implementation of principles and methods of innovative marketing technologies. The relevance of the study is due to the emergence of a large number of intermediaries in the financial market, providing almost similar services. Benchmarking allows to identify the most effective technologies of business processes in the banking sector and to apply them in its environment. Benchmarking covers both internal and external environment of the bank. Marketing strategy to improve the management system of the bank based on the implementation of benchmarking should include classification attributes in accordance with the object of benchmarking. Firstly, it relates to the performance of the bank; secondly, it is business processes in the bank; thirdly, improvement of structural divisions; fourthly, improvement of customer service; fifthly, improvement of technologies and information systems of the bank. Benchmarking allows to understand how the most successful banks work and helps to achieve and, in some cases, considerably exceed their results, besides it reduces bank expenses, increases profitability, optimizes the cost structure and choice of bank strategy and so on. In addition, the use of benchmarking leads to a significant reduction in the cost of marketing research, that is, with the help of benchmarking it is possible to improve the bank marketing system. Thus, domestic commercial banks, using this tool, have the opportunity to significantly improve their international positions in the field of marketing research and strategic planning.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, the accuracies of popular range-separated hybrid, “rung-4” DFAs, and cWFTs that offer the best accuracy-vs-cost trade-off have until now been established only for datasets predominantly comprising small molecules; their transferability to larger systems remains vague. In this study, we present an extended benchmark dataset of ΔHf° for structurally and electronically diverse molecules. We apply quartile-ranking based on boundary-corrected kernel density estimation to filter outliers and arrive at probabilistically pruned enthalpies of 1694 compounds (PPE1694). For this dataset, we rank the prediction accuracies of G4, G4(MP2), ccCA, CBS-QB3, and 23 popular DFAs using conventional and probabilistic error metrics. We discuss systematic prediction errors and highlight the role an empirical higher-level correction plays in the G4(MP2) model. Furthermore, we comment on uncertainties associated with the reference empirical data for atoms and the systematic errors stemming from these that grow with the molecular size. We believe that these findings will aid in identifying meaningful application domains for quantum thermochemical methods.</jats:p>"

Benchmarking, as a modern management tool, is often used for competitive analysis and setting development goals. This study’s scientific problem is to assess the feasibility of applying benchmarking studies to assess the global industry’s environmental aspects. The purpose of the study is to identify the prerequisites for using benchmarking to improve environmental performance, as well as to identify best practices among world-leading companies. For benchmarking, a logical information model is proposed in the study. On its basis, eight world leaders were selected, trends in the industry’s development were analysed, and reference values of environmental indicators were established. For environmental performance assessment, it is proposed to use such indicators as greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, material efficiency, environmental management systems. Comparative benchmarking analysis of world leaders and 16 largest Ukrainian companies allowed determining the reserves for increasing environmental performance. The directions for increasing environmental performance are Investment in resource-saving technologies, production of higher value-added products, investments in energy-saving and new technologies, improvement of management systems, and certification. These ideas are complemented by recommendations for improving environmental performance, based on the Circular Economy Concept’s philosophy and Industry 4.0. The study’s practical significance is that Ukrainian companies can use their results to achieve higher environmental and economic outcomes.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Exhaled breath contains hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which offer the potential for diagnosing and monitoring a wide range of diseases. As the breath research field has grown, sampling and analytical practices have become highly varied between groups. Standardisation would allow meta-analyses of data from multiple studies and greater confidence in published results. Washout of VOCs from ingestion into the blood and subsequently breath could provide data for an initial assessment of inter-group performance. The Peppermint Initiative has been formed to address this task of standardisation. In the current study we aimed to generate initial benchmark values for thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC–MS) analysis of breath samples containing peppermint-derived VOCs using data from three independent European research groups. Initially, headspace analysis of peppermint oil capsules was performed to determine compounds of interest. Ten healthy participants were recruited by each three groups across Europe. The standard Peppermint protocol was followed. In brief, each participant provided a baseline breath sample prior to taking a peppermint capsule, with further samples collected at 60, 90, 165, 285 and 360 min following ingestion. Sampling and analytical protocols were different for each group, in line with their usual practice. Samples were analysed by TD–GC–MS and benchmarking values determined for the time taken for detected peppermint VOCs to return to baseline values. Sixteen compounds were identified in the capsule headspace, and all were confirmed in breath following ingestion of the peppermint capsules. Additionally, 2,3-dehydro-1,8-cineole was uniquely found in the breath samples, with a washout profile that suggested it was a product of metabolism of peppermint compounds. Five compounds (α-pinene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, menthol and menthone) were quantified by all three groups. Differences were observed between the groups, particularly for the recovery of menthone and menthol. The average time taken for VOCs to return to baseline was selected as the benchmark and were 377, 423, 533, 418 and 336 min for α-pinene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, menthone and menthol respectively. We have presented an initial set of easy-to-measure benchmarking values for assessing the performance of TD–GC–MS systems for the analysis of VOCs in breath. These values will be updated when more groups provide additional data.</jats:p>"

These models are studied using various approaches, including stability and bifurcation analysis, but most frequently by numerical simulations. The number of required simulations is often large, e.g., when unknown parameters need to be inferred. This renders efficient and reliable numerical integration methods essential. However, these methods depend on various hyperparameters, which strongly impact the ODE solution. Despite this, and although hundreds of published ODE models are freely available in public databases, a thorough study that quantifies the impact of hyperparameters on the ODE solver in terms of accuracy and computation time is still missing. In this manuscript, we investigate which choices of algorithms and hyperparameters are generally favorable when dealing with ODE models arising from biological processes. To ensure a representative evaluation, we considered 142 published models. Our study provides evidence that most ODEs in computational biology are stiff, and we give guidelines for the choice of algorithms and hyperparameters. We anticipate that our results will help researchers in systems biology to choose appropriate numerical methods when dealing with ODE models.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of antibiotic exposure over three years in a large network of level 3 neonatal wards where each center is informed yearly of its own results and the results of other centers and has full autonomy to improve its performance.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Patients and Methods:</jats:bold> This is a prospective, observational study of antibiotics prescriptions over the 2017–2019 period in a network of 23 French level 3 neonatal wards. The network relied on an internal benchmarking program based on a computerized prescription ordering system. Among others, antibiotics exposure, treatment duration, and antibiotics spectrum index were analyzed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The population consisted of 39,971 neonates (51.5% preterm), 44.3% of which were treated with antibiotics. Of the treated patients, 78.5% started their first antibiotic treatment in the first three days of life. Antibiotic exposure rate significantly declined from 2017 to 2019 (from 46.8% to 42.8%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.0001); this decline was significant in groups with gestational age &amp;gt;26 weeks, but not in the group with extremely low gestational age &amp;lt;27 weeks. Gentamicin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin (ampicillin), vancomycin, and amikacin were the antibiotics most prescribed. The lower the gestational age, the higher the exposure for cefotaxime, vancomycin, and amikacin. Compared to 2017, cefotaxime exposure in 2019 declined by 12.6%, but the change was only significant in the gestational age group of 32–36 weeks (17.4%) and at term (20.3%). The triple combination of antibiotics in the first three days decreased by 28.8% from 2017 to 2019, and this was significant in each gestational age group. During the study, the delayed ending of antibiotics in unconfirmed early-onset neonatal infection increased from 9.6% to 11.9%.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This study showed that a strategy characterized by the collection of information via a computerized order-entry system, analysis of the results by a steering committee representative of all neonatal wards, and complete autonomy of neonatal wards in the choice of prescription modalities, is associated with a significant reduction in the use of antibiotics in newborns with gestational age greater than 26 weeks.</jats:p>"

Our study involves 230 MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> FETs and 160 WS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> FETs with channel lengths ranging from 5 μm down to 100 nm. We use statistical measures to evaluate key FET performance indicators for benchmarking these two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers against existing literature as well as ultra-thin body Si FETs. Our results show consistent performance of 2D FETs across 1 × 1 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> chips owing to high quality and uniform growth of these TMDs followed by clean transfer onto device substrates. We are able to demonstrate record high carrier mobility of 33 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> V<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in WS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> FETs, which is a 1.5X improvement compared to the best reported in the literature. Our experimental demonstrations confirm the technological viability of 2D FETs in future integrated circuits.</jats:p>"

In this prospective longitudinal study in 6 European countries, 6-month societal costs of resource utilization of 2060 older home care clients were estimated. Three care models were identified and compared based on level of patient-centered care (PCC), availability of specialized professionals (ASP) and level of monitoring of care performance (MCP). Differences in costs between care models were analyzed using linear regression while adjusting for case mix differences. Societal costs incurred in care model 2 (low ASP; high PCC &amp; MCP) were significantly higher than in care model 1 (high ASP, PCC &amp; MCP, mean difference €2230 (10%)) and in care model 3 (low ASP &amp; PCC; high MCP, mean difference €2552 (12%)). Organizations within both models with the lowest societal costs, systematically monitor their care performance. However, organizations within one model arranged their care with a low focus on patient-centered care, and employed mainly generalist care professionals, while organizations in the other model arranged their care delivery with a strong focus on patient-centered care combined with a high availability of specialized care professionals. </jats:p>"

This study describes the thermomechanical characterisation of a novel copper diamond grade selected for use in tertiary collimators of the HL‐LHC. The data obtained are used to build an elastoplastic material model and implemented in numerical simulations performed to benchmark experimental data obtained from the recently completed MultiMat experiment conducted at CERN’s HiRadMat facility, where various materials shaped as slender rods were tested under particle beam impact. The analyses focus on the dynamic longitudinal and flexural response of the material, with results showing that the material model is capable of replicating the material behaviour to a satisfactory level in both thermal and structural domains, accurately matching experimental measurements in terms of temperature, frequency content, and amplitude.</jats:p>"

However, surface waters contain natural organic matter (NOM) which, upon chemical disinfection, is readily converted into hazardous disinfection-by-products. Hence, NOM removal from these waters is critical. Chemical coagulation is a readily implementable technology to minimize these undesired side-effects by NOM removal. Herein, capabilities of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as pre-treatment for NOM abatement from natural raw surface water have been benchmarked. Excitation-emission fluorescence matrix (EEM) spectroscopy characterization of NOM fractions demonstrated high removal efficiency. A two-level full factorial design was employed to analyze the effects of coagulant dosage and initial pH on the removal of turbidity, humic acid-like substances and fulvic acid-like substances from the raw water. Higher removal of ~77% NOM was attained with PACl than with FeCl3 (~72%). Optimization through response surface methodology showed that the initial pH—coagulant dosage interaction was significant in removing NOM and turbidity for both PACl and FeCl3. These results identify the opportunity for coagulation technologies to prevent and minimize disinfection-by-products formation through NOM removal.</jats:p>"

The physical mechanisms that control seismicity have been studied through rock mechanical experiments and combined physical-statistical models to support development of a framework to forecast induced-seismicity risks. To investigate whether machine learning techniques such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines bring new insights into forecasts of induced seismicity rates in space and time, a pipeline is designed that extends time-series analysis methods to a spatiotemporal framework with a factorial setup, which allows probing a large parameter space of plausible modelling assumptions, followed by a statistical meta-analysis to account for the intrinsic uncertainties in subsurface data and to ensure statistical significance and robustness of results. The pipeline includes model validation using e.g. likelihood ratio tests against average depletion thickness and strain thickness baselines to establish whether the models have statistically significant forecasting power. The methodology is applied to forecast seismicity for two distinctly different gas production scenarios. Results show that seismicity forecasts generated using Support Vector Machines significantly outperform beforementioned baselines. Forecasts from the method hint at decreasing seismicity rates within the next 5 years, in a conservative production scenario, and no such decrease in a higher depletion scenario, although due to the small effective sample size no statistically solid statement of this kind can be made. The presented approach can be used to make forecasts beyond the investigated 5-years period, although this requires addition of limited physics-based constraints to avoid unphysical forecasts.</jats:p>"

It provides a multi-faceted view of measurements that is conducive to a comprehensive assessment of the overhead induced by runtime monitoring. The tool is able to generate significant loads to reveal edge case behaviour that may only emerge when the monitoring system is pushed to its limit. We evaluate our framework in two ways. First, we conduct sanity checks to assess the precision of the measurement mechanisms used, the repeatability of the results obtained, and the veracity of the behaviour emulated by our synthetic benchmark. We then showcase the utility of the features offered by our tool in a two-part RV case study.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>PURPOSE: The review of the literature and numerous online sources, in particular the information platforms of international organizations supporting the activities of the water sector, was aimed at verifying research experiences in the field of digital maturity of enterprises, identifying research approaches used in benchmarking water utilities, and determining the level of interest in the analysis of the water supply industry value chain. It was found that there is no benchmarking methodology that would enable the observation of changes in the business processes of water supply companies under the influence of digital technologies. Therefore, this article presents a framework for benchmarking the digitization of business processes. The article also presents the premises for benchmarking the digitization of processes included in the value chain of a water supply company and the benefits of including digital technologies supporting processes from an economic, social, and environmental perspective. One of the key stages of creating the concept of benchmarking research is creating a matrix of variables relating to the objectives pursued by water supply companies. METHODOLOGY: The proposed concept of benchmarking the digitization of business processes included in the value chain of a water utility company was prepared based on literature studies and analysis of selected internet platforms of international organizations operating in the water sector. FINDINGS: The analysis of the decomposition of the enterprise value chain, the criteria, and levels of process maturity assessment, and the latest digital technologies made it possible to prepare two scenarios of the benchmarking stages of processes and use digital technologies depending on the level of process maturity and benchmarking experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND PRACTICE: The proposed model is highly conceptual and requires validation in pilot studies to verify the levels of decomposition of the value chain, to select key digital technologies for research and to determine the scale of digital maturity for each of the technologies included in the study. Organizations conducting benchmarking research can broaden the scope of their research and provide water utilities with information on the latest digital technologies supporting business processes. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: Using value chain taxonomy to assess the support of business processes by digital technologies is an original approach. It enables the acquisition of knowledge about the importance of digital technologies in all processes carried out in the enterprise.</jats:p>"

Recently, single‐virus genomics (SVG), although still in an incipient stage, has opened new avenues in viral ecology by allowing the sequencing of one single virus at a time. The investigation of methodological alternatives and optimization of existing procedures for SVG is paramount to deliver high‐quality genomic data. We report a sequencing dataset of viral single‐amplified genomes (vSAGs) from cultured and uncultured viruses obtained by applying different conditions in each SVG step, from viral preservation and novel whole‐genome amplification (WGA) to sequencing platforms and genome assembly. Sequencing data showed that cryopreservation and mild fixation were compatible with WGA, although fresh samples delivered better genome quality data. The novel TruPrime WGA, based on primase‐polymerase features, and WGA‐X employing a thermostable phi29 polymerase, were proven to be with sufficient sensitivity in SVG. The Oxford Nanopore (ON) sequencing platform did not provide a significant improvement of vSAG assembly compared to Illumina alone. Finally, the SPAdes assembler performed the best. Overall, our results represent a valuable genomic dataset that will help to standardized and advance new tools in viral ecology.</jats:p>"

The object of the study is General Motors, the object is the benchmarking process as part of its activities. The paper used methods of systems and factor analysis, economic and mathematical modeling, groupings, modeling, evaluation, forecasting and planning. Suggestions for reducing the cost of goods, reducing production and entering more promising markets. It was concluded that the application of Tesla's strengths in the operation and management of the integrated structure of General Motors would allow it to achieve increased economic efficiency in modern market conditions.</jats:p>"
