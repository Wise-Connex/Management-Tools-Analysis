One factor that typically limits the extent of sucrose recovery from final molasses is that cooling crystallizers are high capital and maintenance cost items. The target purity of the final molasses is the commonly used benchmark to assess the effectiveness of exhaustion of final molasses. However, this benchmark does not relate to an actual loss of sucrose. A benchmark that calculates the Target Sucrose Loss (TSL) in molasses for the factory is proposed. Factories would aim to maintain the sucrose loss in final molasses to within 1 unit of the TSL. A close approach to the target purity is still required as part of the drive to achieve this result. An advantage of the TSL is that it considers the influence of the quantity of soluble impurities in the cane supply on the actual sucrose loss in molasses. Data from Australian factories are presented to demonstrate the application of the TSL. Several factors affecting the exhaustion of final molasses are discussed, including the effects of Cmassecuite purity, crystallizer station performance and shear rate on the massecuite within the crystallizers. Some Australian factories have recently refurbished horizontal, rotating coil crystallizers with designs incorporating fixed cooling elements and rotating paddles to provide high shear rate conditions and overcome maintenance issues associated with the coil design. Experience shows that the fixed-element design is an economical way to provide strong exhaustion performance.</jats:p>"

Kinetic models of metabolism are among the most mechanistically detailed tools for phenotype prediction. Kinetic models describe changes in metabolite concentrations as a function of enzyme concentration, reaction rates, and concentrations of metabolic effectors uniquely enabling integration of multiple omics data types in a unifying mechanistic framework. While development of such models for<jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>has been going on for almost twenty years, multiple separate models have been established and systematic independent benchmarking studies have not been performed on the full set of models available. In this study we compared systematically all recently published kinetic models of the central carbon metabolism of<jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>. We assess the ease of use of the models, their ability to include omics data as input, and the accuracy of prediction of central carbon metabolic flux phenotypes. We conclude that there is no clear winner among the models when considering the resulting tradeoffs in performance and applicability to various scenarios. This study can help to guide further development of kinetic models, and to demonstrate how to apply such models in real-world setting, ultimately enabling the design of efficient cell factories.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Author summary</jats:title><jats:p>Kinetic modeling is a promising method to predict cell metabolism. Such models provide mechanistic description of how concentrations of metabolites change in the cell as a function of time, cellular environment and the genotype of the cell. In the past years there have been several kinetic models published for various organisms. We want to assess how reliably models of<jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>metabolism could predict cellular metabolic state upon genetic or environmental perturbations. We test selected models in the ways that represent common metabolic engineering practices including deletion and overexpression of genes. Our results suggest that all published models have tradeoffs and the model to use should be chosen depending on the specific application. We show in which cases users could expect the best performance from published models. Our benchmarking study should help users to make a better informed choice and also provides systematic training and testing dataset for model developers.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Attempts comparing these methods revealed that the choice of reference marker signatures is far more important than the method itself. However, a thorough evaluation of the combined impact of data transformation, pre-processing, marker selection, cell type composition and choice of methodology on the results is still lacking.</jats:p><jats:p>Using different single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we generated hundreds of pseudo-bulk mixtures to evaluate the combined impact of these factors on the deconvolution results. Along with methods to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data we also included five methods specifically designed to infer the cell type composition of bulk data using scRNA-seq data as reference.</jats:p><jats:p>Both bulk and single-cell deconvolution methods perform best when applied to data in linear scale and the choice of normalization can have a dramatic impact on the performance of some, but not all methods. Overall, single-cell methods have comparable performance to the best performing bulk methods and bulk methods based on semi-supervised approaches showed higher error and lower correlation values between the computed and the expected proportions. Moreover, failure to include cell types in the reference that are present in a mixture always led to substantially worse results, regardless of any of the previous choices. Taken together, we provide a thorough evaluation of the combined impact of the different factors affecting the computational deconvolution task across different datasets and propose general guidelines to maximize its performance.</jats:p>"

An open question for researchers is how sensitive the results of EEG analyses are to variations in preprocessing methods and parameters. To address this issue, we analyze the effect of preprocessing methods on downstream EEG analysis using several simple signal and event-related measures. Signal measures include recording-level channel amplitudes, study-level channel amplitude dispersion, and recording spectral characteristics. Event-related methods include ERPs and ERSPs and their correlations across methods for a diverse set of stimulus events. Our analysis also assesses differences in residual signals both in the time and spectral domains after blink artifacts have been removed. Using fully automated pipelines, we evaluate these measures across 17 EEG studies for two ICA-based preprocessing approaches (LARG, MARA) plus two variations of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR). Although the general structure of the results is similar across these preprocessing methods, there are significant differences, particularly in the low-frequency spectral features and in the residuals left by blinks. These results argue for detailed reporting of processing details as suggested by most guidelines, but also for using a federation of automated processing pipelines and comparison tools to quantify effects of processing choices as part of the research reporting.</jats:p>"

Following an event, infrasonic waves travel through a dynamic atmosphere that can change on the order of minutes. This makes infrasound event classification a difficult problem, as waveforms from the same source type can look drastically different. Event classification usually requires ground-truth information from seismic or other methods. This is time consuming, inefficient, and does not allow for classification if the event locates somewhere other than a known source, the location accuracy is poor, or ground truth from seismic data is lacking. Here, we compare the performance of the state of the art for infrasound event classification, support vector machine (SVM) to the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a method that has been proven in tangential fields such as seismology. For a 2-class catalog of only volcanic activity and earthquake events, the fourfold average SVM classification accuracy is 75%, whereas it is 74% when using a CNN. Classification accuracies from the 4-class catalog consisting of the most common infrasound events detected at the global scale are 55% and 56% for the SVM and CNN architectures, respectively. These results demonstrate that using a CNN does not increase performance for infrasound event classification. This suggests that SVM should be the preferred classification method, as it is a simpler and more trustworthy architecture and can be tied to the physical properties of the waveforms. The SVM and CNN algorithms described in this article are not yet generalizable to other infrasound event catalogs. We anticipate this study to be a starting point for development of large and comprehensive, systematically labeled, infrasound event catalogs, as such catalogs will be necessary to provide an increase in the value of deep learning on event classification.</jats:p>"

Salah satunya terjadinya resistensi dan hal itu biasa terjadi dan harus dikelola dengan baik agar tidak berlarut-larut dan menghambat proses benchmarking dan menjadikan madrasah bertransformasi sesuai dengan apa yang dicita-citakan madrasah. Metode penelitian yang digunakan penulis dalam penelitian ini adalah penelitian kualitatif deskriptif analitis, menggambarkan proses Proses Benchmarking Kepala Madrasah Dalam Melakukan Transformasi Madrasah Di Kota Jambi. Proses benchmarking yang harus dilakukan setiap kepala Madrasah meliputi empat faktor: (a) pengetahuan, terutama yang berkenaan dengan aspek proses dan praktik suatu pekerjaan yang diperoleh dari hasil penelitian benchmarking. (b) motivasi, dapat memotivasi setiap orang untuk terus belajar dan meningkatkan produktivitas kerja. (c) situasi, yaitu peluang bagi setiap orang untuk menerapkan pengetahuaannya dalam meningkatkan efisiensi dan produktivitas. (d) kemauan setiap orang untuk mengembangkan pengetahuannya. Karakteristik madrasah yang unggul/terbaik dalam kelasnya yang akan dibenchmarking adalah: (a) fokus pada prestasi, perbaikan kualitas, dan produktivitas, (b) kesadaran atas biaya, (c) memiliki hubungan yang dekat dengan para peserta didik, (d) memiliki hubungan yang dekat dengan para mitra, (e) memanfaatkan teknologi mutakhir, (f) fokus pada inti dan tujuan yang akan dicapai.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>The first clinical engineering (CE) benchmarking between Chinese and American hospitals was performed in 2014. At that time, only data from Zhejiang province were available. A new comparison was completed in 2018 with data collected from 11 hospitals from the capital city of Beijing. These data were compared with those from 270 acute care hospitals in the United States. First, comparisons were made with hospital data such as patient discharges, patient days, equipment quantity and cost, and operating costs. The CE benchmarking comparison was made in 3 categories: (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">a</jats:italic>) operations, (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">b</jats:italic>) finance, and (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">c</jats:italic>) staffing/productivity. Within the operations category, the following metrics were compared: equipment amount/operating beds, annual repairs/equipment amount, and annual scheduled maintenance/equipment amount. Within the finance category, the following metrics were compared: total CE expense/total hospital operating expense, total CE expense/operating beds, and total CE expense/equipment cost. Within the staffing/productivity category, the following metrics were compared: total CE full-time equivalent (FTE)/equipment amount, total CE FTE/operating beds, and total CE FTE/total hospital operating expense. These comparisons showed the following: (1) Although still a bit lower than the United States, Beijing hospitals have more equipment than Zhejiang but a slightly lower amount of repairs and scheduled maintenance per equipment; (2) the total CE expense/total hospital operating expense ratio is around 1% in both Beijing and the United States, but slightly greater than in Zhejiang; however, the total CE expense/operating beds and total CE expense/equipment cost are still lower in Beijing and Zhejiang than in the United States; and (3) the CE FTE amount is lower in Beijing than in Zhejiang and closer to the United States relative to both equipment amount and total hospital operating expense, but still a bit lower than the United States relative to the number of operating beds. Some of the differences detected are likely caused by the same factors found in the previous study of Zhejiang hospitals, namely, higher length of stay in China than in the United States, lower wages and living costs in China, and different healthcare delivery methods in these countries. The differences found between Beijing and Zhejiang cannot be explained solely by inflation (~2%/year) or even higher cost of living in the capital but likely because of more equipment-intensive medical practice. Overall, these results confirm the outstanding progress and level of excellence of CE in China.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Various challenges, such as limited freshwater resources, climate change impacts, rapid population growth, urbanisation and underinvestment in water supply infrastructure, have led to intermittent water supply (IWS) in potable water distribution systems. Earlier research has confirmed that IWS negatively impacts the consumers, the infrastructure and the water supply authorities.  Water supply authorities need tools to help understand IWS and the associated implications. A new indexing framework involving the causes and impacts associated with IWS is presented in this paper. In addition, a novel approach allows for quantification of the severity of IWS based on knowledge of a few readily available inputs. The severity quantification is based on two ratios: the intermittency ratio is a temporal measurement, accounting for supply duration; the connection ratio describes spatial aspects, using the number of service connections affected. The indexing framework and quantification tool could lead to improved understanding of IWS and could assist water supply authorities faced with IWS to make informed decisions. Improved planning of remedial actions to mitigate or avoid risks associated with IWS is aided. The tools presented in this paper could be used as basis for future development of a key performance indicator.</jats:p>"

For an initial benchmarking approach, this paper compared a poor long-term market performance company (Grove &amp; Clouse, 2019) with a strong long-term market performance company (Grove &amp; Lockhart, 2019). The following benchmarked differences in the boards of directors of these two companies were key success factors for constellation: specific industry knowledge, younger directors, coaching/nurturing, involved roles, long-term compensation of directors, no board entrenchment, board assessment, and board committee rotation. The major sections of this paper are literature review, corporate board practices, benchmarking board of directors: poor long-term market performance example, benchmarking board of directors: strong long-term market performance example, conclusions, and future research. A major limitation of this paper, which could be investigated in future research, is to analyze benchmarked board categories to see if they help explain differences in comparative long-term market performances by many companies since companies and their markets are diverse.</jats:p>"

The procedure was applied to the 38 reactions in Truhlar’s HTBH38/08 and NHTBH38/08 databases. Mean unsigned deviation (MUD) for the complete set of 68 independent barriers is 0.43 kcal mol-1, compared to 1.37 kcal/mol for G4 and 1.69 kcal/mol for the dispersioncorrected M06-2X method. Its accuracy is also better that that of other calculations using composite methods of similar cost. The MUD of the new scheme on the barriers in the DBH24/08 subset (12 out of the 38 reactions in both other sets) is 0.31 kcal mol-1, better than that obtained at the expensive CCSD(T,full)/aug-cc-pCV(T+d)Z level (0.46 kcal mol-1) and comparable to the most exact (and costly) Wn calculations (MUD=0.14 kcal mol-1). The maximum unsigned deviation (MaxUD) of the new method for all the reactions studied is 1.71 kcal/mol. G4 and M06-2X, on the other side, exhibit MaxUDs of 6.7 and 8.4 kcal/mol respectively</jats:p>"

This implementation should be done in different dimensions according to a holistic and whole-school approach. Different tools have been adapted and developed to assess this integrated approach. The aim of this research is to critically reflect the existing tools to assess and benchmark ESD implementation and to discuss their applicability in two case studies. Two public Universities in Southern Europe, with headquarters in the capitals of Portugal and Spain were selected to assess and compare the integration of ESD according to a whole-school approach—Universidade Aberta in Portugal and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in Spain. After a critical analysis of the existing tools based on literature review and a list of criteria classified by experts, two tools were selected to be applied in the case studies. The online Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System Reporting Tool was used in Universidade Aberta and Green Metrics tool was used in Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. The tools were complemented with focus group with key-actors in both universities. The results obtained allowed to identify the need to define a common objective of the assessment tools and limitations they still have. The tools need improvements on their development namely to integrate the external impact of Higher Education Institutions on sustainability, to integrate participatory processes and to assess non-traditional aspects of sustainability. This research hopes to contribute to the continuous research about the usefulness of these assessment and benchmarking tools as drivers to HEIs improve their sustainability performance and their role as agents of changes.</jats:p>"

It explores the nature and value of benchmarking in this context by examining an ongoing initiative – the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI) – that is developing a public databank of temperature observations as well as a system for benchmarking the methods that databank users employ to further process the data. Interestingly, the benchmarking system will make use of “synthetic data” generated with the help of computer simulation models. It is argued here that the benchmarking system has crucial scientific and gatekeeping roles to play in the context of ISTI. It is further suggested that, once we appreciate how synthetic data are to be produced and used by ISTI, we uncover yet another variety of what Paul Edwards (A vast machine: computer models, climate data, and the politics of global warming. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2010) has described as “model-data symbiosis” in the practice of climate science.</jats:p>"

Uplift models assist decision-makers in optimally allocating scarce resources. This allows the selection of the subset of entities for which the effect of a treatment will be largest and, as such, the maximization of the overall returns. The literature on uplift modeling mostly focuses on queries concerning the effect of a single treatment and rarely considers situations where more than one treatment alternative is utilized. This article surveys the current literature on multitreatment uplift modeling and proposes two novel techniques: the naive uplift approach and the multitreatment modified outcome approach. Moreover, a benchmarking experiment is performed to contrast the performances of different multitreatment uplift modeling techniques across eight data sets from various domains. We verify and, if needed, correct the imbalance among the pretreatment characteristics of the treatment groups by means of optimal propensity score matching, which ensures a correct interpretation of the estimated uplift. Conventional and recently proposed evaluation metrics are adapted to the multitreatment scenario to assess performance. None of the evaluated techniques consistently outperforms other techniques. Hence, it is concluded that performance largely depends on the context and problem characteristics. The newly proposed techniques are found to offer similar performances compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</jats:p>"

The research responds to the literature review of current leading academic journals and conference proceedings, specific to IIoT-BRs such as I4-Business Growth (BG), I4-Business Optimization (BO), I4-Operational Excellence (OE), I4-Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), I4-Manufacturing Executive system (MES), I4-Process Control Network (PNC), I4-Functional Excellence (FE), I4-Business Strategy, (BS), I4-Human Resource Management (HRM), I4-Integration (I). The authors utilize an open (Google) internet-based research search engine (OIBRSE) as a conduit to acquire the digital object identifiers and universal resource locators if the DOI non-exists with research articles. The research work archives the one hundred sixty-five research articles, gleaned by conducting the literature review upon IIoT-BRs. The research results that research trends and contributions of I4-(BO) and I4-(BG) are strong. However, I4-(BO) and I4-(BG) are slightly prose than I4-(MES) and I4-Network (PNC). The research growth is a weak residue of the industry 4.0's (IIoT-BRs). The research stores the authentic evidence to supervise the researchers for current research gaps and motivates them to extend their glance to weak IIoT-BRs. The research work aids the new researchers of industry 4.0 to learn and optimize their knowledge in empire of industry 4.0 too.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Streamflow prediction is a vital public service that helps to establish flash-flood early warning systems or assess the impact of projected climate change on water management. However, the availability of streamflow observations limits the utilization of the state-of-the-art streamflow prediction techniques to the basins where hydrometric gauging stations exist. Since the most river basins in the world are ungauged, the development of the specialized techniques for the reliable streamflow prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) is of crucial importance. In recent years, the emerging field of deep learning provides a myriad of new models that can breathe new life into the stagnating PUB methods. In the presented study, we benchmark the streamflow prediction efficiency of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks against the standard technique of GR4J hydrological model parameters regionalization (HMREG) at 200 basins in Northwest Russia. Results show that the LSTM-based regional hydrological model significantly outperforms the HMREG scheme in terms of median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), which is 0.73 and 0.61 for LSTM and HMREG, respectively. Moreover, LSTM demonstrates the comparable median NSE with that for basin-scale calibration of GR4J (0.75). Therefore, this study underlines the high utilization potential of deep learning for the PUB by demonstrating the new state-of-the-art performance in this field.</jats:p>"

A suite of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations geared toward chemical process equipment modeling has been developed and validated with experimental results from the literature. Various regression-based active learning strategies are explored with these CFD simulators <jats:italic>in-the-loop</jats:italic> under the constraints of a limited function evaluation budget. Specifically, five different sampling strategies and five regression techniques are compared, considering a set of four test cases of industrial significance and varying complexity. Gaussian process regression was observed to have a consistently good performance for these applications. The present quantitative study outlines the pros and cons of the different available techniques and highlights the best practices for their adoption. The test cases and tools are available with an open-source license to ensure reproducibility and engage the wider research community in contributing to both the CFD models and developing and benchmarking new improved algorithms tailored to this field.</jats:p>"

However, due to various resource constraints, it has become challenging for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of growing economies to survive in this global competition. Effective supply chain management (SCM) can be a major driving factor for success of Indian SMEs in dynamic world economy. SMEs face many operational challenges while implementing effective SCM. The purpose of this paper is to study different strategic issues for successful implementation of SCM in Indian SMEs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A survey has been conducted in Indian SMEs of different sectors. Major constructs of survey instrument are motivations, hindrances, investment priorities, supply chain practices and performance. In total, 1,500 Indian SMEs have been approached for collecting response through survey instrument. 257 complete responses were finalized. Statistical analysis of data acquired from survey is performed by using SPSS software.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>It is observed that managing customers, organization resources, and inventory are main SCM practices. Major investment areas are systems for developing quick response and quality management. Currently, human resource and knowledge management have been found to be less priority areas for SMEs.

Europe and the Asian Tigers, considered to have made significant progress in quality of higher education, are used as benchmarks for best practices in higher education. Relying on the review of extant relevant literature and document analysis, the chapter finds that practices such as massive inclusion of vocational and technical trainings in higher education curricula; increase budgetary allocations to higher education and policy implementation beyond mere formulation have impacted positively on higher education in Europe and among the Asian Tigers. As such, the chapter concludes that if Africa must make significant progress and improve on the quality of its higher education, it must begin to use these practices. </jats:p>"

A common addition to synthetic data sets is White, Gaussian Noise (WGN) which is used to mimic noise that would be present in recorded data sets. The first section of this paper focuses on comparing the effects of WGN and realistic modelled noise on standard microseismic event detection and imaging algorithms using synthetic data sets with recorded noise as a benchmark. The data sets with WGN underperform on the trace-by-trace algorithm while overperforming on algorithms utilizing the full array. Throughout, the data sets with realistic modelled noise perform near identically to the recorded noise data sets. The study concludes by testing an algorithm that simultaneously solves for the source location and moment tensor of a microseismic event. Not only does the algorithm fail to perform at the signal-to-noise ratios indicated by the WGN results but the results with realistic modelled noise highlight pitfalls of the algorithm not previously identified. The misleading results from the WGN data sets highlight the need to test algorithms under realistic noise conditions to gain an understanding of the conditions under which an algorithm can perform and to minimize the risk of misinterpretation of the results.</jats:p>"

With this benchmark, we examine the widely used PBE+D3 method and recently developed SCAN+rVV10 method for density functional theory calculations. Our benchmark is based on two molecules: glycine (or Gly, an amino acid) and uracil (or U, an RNA base). We consider six dimer configurations of the two monomers and their potential energy surfaces as a function of relative distance and rotation angle. The Gly-Gly, Gly-U, and U-U pairs represent London dispersion, hydrogen bonding, and <jats:italic>π</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>π</jats:italic> stacking interactions, respectively. Our results show that both PBE+D3 and SCAN+rVV10 methods can yield accuracy better than 1 kcal/mol, except for the cases when the distance between the two monomers is significantly smaller than the equilibrium distance. In such a case, neither of these methods can yield uniformly accurate results for all the configurations. In addition, it is found that the SCAN and SCAN+rVV10 methods can reproduce some subtle features in a rotational potential energy curve, while the PBE, PBE+D3, and the local density approximation fail.</jats:p>"

Such 1-h forecasts are commonly used to underpin the background for an hourly updated surface temperature analysis. The benchmark in this article was produced through a gridded statistical interpolation procedure using only surface observations and a diurnally, seasonally dependent gridded surface temperature climatology. The temporally varying climatologies were produced by synthesizing high-resolution monthly gridded climatologies of daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the contiguous United States with yearly and diurnally dependent estimates of the station-based climatologies of surface temperature. To produce a 1-h benchmark forecast, for a given hour of the day, say 0000 UTC, the gridded climatology was interpolated to station locations and then subtracted from the observations. These station anomalies were statistically interpolated to produce the 0000 UTC gridded anomaly. This anomaly pattern was continued for 1 h and added to the 0100 UTC gridded climatology to generate the 0100 UTC gridded benchmark forecast. The benchmark is thus a simple 1-h persistence of the analyzed deviations from the diurnally dependent climatology. Using a cross-validation procedure with July 2015 and August 2018 data, the gridded benchmark provided competitive, relatively unbiased 1-h surface temperature forecasts relative to the HRRR. Benchmark forecasts were lower in error and bias in 2015, but the HRRR system was highly competitive or better than the gridded benchmark in 2018. Implications of the benchmarking results are discussed, as well as potential applications of the simple benchmarking procedure to data assimilation.</jats:p>"

The interpretability of attention-based models is leveraged to describe patients-at-risk. Several deep learning architectures making use of attention mechanisms, recurrent layers, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and medical concept embeddings with time-aware attention were trained using publicly available electronic medical record data (MIMIC-III) associated with 45,298 ICU stays for 33,150 patients. Bayesian inference was used to compute the posterior over weights of an attention-based model. Odds ratios associated with an increased risk of readmission were computed for static variables. Diagnoses, procedures, medications, and vital signs were ranked according to the associated risk of readmission. A recurrent neural network, with time dynamics of code embeddings computed by neural ODEs, achieved the highest average precision of 0.331 (AUROC: 0.739, F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>-Score: 0.372). Predictive accuracy was comparable across neural network architectures. Groups of patients at risk included those suffering from infectious complications, with chronic or progressive conditions, and for whom standard medical care was not suitable. Attention-based networks may be preferable to recurrent networks if an interpretable model is required, at only marginal cost in predictive accuracy.</jats:p>"

This method has also been used frequently in scaffolding nucleotide sequences obtained by de novo genome sequencing and assembly, in which the number of resultant sequences rarely converges to the chromosome number. Despite its prevalent use, the sample preparation methods for Hi-C have not been intensively discussed, especially from the standpoint of genome scaffolding.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To gain insight into the best practice of Hi-C scaffolding, we performed a multifaceted methodological comparison using vertebrate samples and optimized various factors during sample preparation, sequencing, and computation. As a result, we identified several key factors that helped improve Hi-C scaffolding, including the choice and preparation of tissues, library preparation conditions, the choice of restriction enzyme(s), and the choice of scaffolding program and its usage.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This study provides the first comparison of multiple sample preparation kits/protocols and computational programs for Hi-C scaffolding by an academic third party.

However, most tracking benchmarks are focused on ground level videos, whereas aerial tracking presents a new set of challenges. In this paper, we compare ten trackers based on deep learning techniques on four aerial datasets. We choose top performing trackers utilizing different approaches, specifically tracking by detection, discriminative correlation filters, Siamese networks and reinforcement learning. In our experiments, we use a subset of OTB2015 dataset with aerial style videos; the UAV123 dataset without synthetic sequences; the UAV20L dataset, which contains 20 long sequences; and DTB70 dataset as our benchmark datasets. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of different trackers in different tracking situations encountered in aerial data. Our findings indicate that the trackers perform significantly worse in aerial datasets compared to standard ground level videos. We attribute this effect to smaller target size, camera motion, significant camera rotation with respect to the target, out of view movement, and clutter in the form of occlusions or similar looking distractors near tracked object.</jats:p>"

By the sleeve gastrectomy initial weight loss is easier, but the progress of patients have diverse variability in terms of maintaining weight loss. Predicting models for weight changes may provide doctors and patients a good tool to modify their approach to obesity treatment.The main objective of this research is to verify the dependence of weight loss on sleeve coefficients and to forecast the weight loss. The weight loss and its dependence on remnant gastric volume compartmants (antral and body parts), after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is discussed in this paper. Data was obtained from a previous study which included 63 patients. Deep analysis of weight loss after LSG and its relation with remnant gastric volume is still a challenge due to weight loss dependence on multiple factors. During this research, with the aid of machine learning regression classifier, the relationship(s) between the sleeve coefficients’ formulae and weight loss formulae (%EWL and %TWL), are developed in a novel way. Other factors such as age and gender are also taken into account. A robust approach of artificial intelligence, i.e. the “Neural Network Bayesian Regularization” is adopted to utilize the third month, sixth month and first year weight loss data, to forecast the second year weight loss. Models are proposed to demonstrate the dependance of total weight loss on crucial parameters of components of remanat gastric volumes. A comparative study is conducted for the appropriate selection of artificial intelligence training algorithm. </jats:p>"

These temperature analyses are often generated through data assimilation procedures, whereby a background short-range gridded forecast is adjusted to newly available observations. Even with frequent updates to newly available observations, surface-temperature analysis errors and biases can be comparatively large relative to errors and biases of midtropospheric variables, especially over land, despite more near-surface in situ observations. Larger near-surface errors may have several causes, including biased background forecasts and the spatial heterogeneity of surface temperatures that results from subgrid-scale surface, vegetation, land-use, and terrain variations. Are biased raw background forecasts the predominant cause of surface temperature analysis errors? Part I of this two-part series describes a simple benchmark for evaluating the error characteristics of short-term (1 h) raw model background surface temperature forecasts. For stations with a relatively complete time series of data, it is possible to generate an hourly, diurnally, and seasonally dependent observation climatology at a station. The deviation of the current hour’s temperature observation with respect to this hour’s and Julian day’s climatology is added to the climatology for the next hour. For contiguous U.S. stations in July 2015, the station benchmark was lower in error than interpolated 1-h high-resolution numerical predictions of surface temperature from NOAA’s High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) system, although not including full postprocessing. For August 2018, 1-h HRRR forecasts were much improved when tested against the station benchmark.</jats:p>"

The goal of the present work is to benchmark the performance of a new TPS/Gantry system for proton therapy centers which have established already a baseline standard of care.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods and materials:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A total of 31 cases (=52 plans) distributed around 7 anatomical sites and 12 indications were randomly selected and re-planned using Eclipse™.

Rainwater infiltration and evapotranspiration affect the stability of man-made and natural slopes and cause shallow foundations and embankments to settle and heave. Very frequently, the ground surface is covered by vegetation and, as a result, transpiration plays a major role in ground-atmosphere interaction. The soil, the plant, and the atmosphere form a continuous hydraulic system, which is referred to as Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum (SPAC). The SPAC actually represents the ‘boundary condition’ of the geotechnical water flow problem. Water flow in soil and plant takes place because of gradients in hydraulic head triggered by the negative water pressure (water tension) generated in the leaf stomata. To study the response of the SPAC, (negative) water pressure needs to be measured not only in the soil but also in the plant. The paper presents a novel technique to measure the xylem water pressure based on the use of the High-Capacity Tensiometer (HCT), which is benchmarked against conventional techniques for xylem water pressure measurements, i.e. the Pressure Chamber (PC) and the Thermocouple Psychrometer (TP).</jats:p>"

The authors substantiate the necessity and expediency of including a separate benchmarking course in the programs of university and postgraduate mountain education, which is based on the postulates of the process approach to management. It is necessary to gain understanding and knowledge of all processes occurring in the organization, based on illustrating the flow of processes with drawings, graphs of changes in process parameters; have a clear understanding of the standards in order to use their experience in relation to their activities, as well as managers should have a pronounced desire to improve their activities in order to achieve the maximum financial result. The paper presents the results of a study on testing the mechanism for using benchmarking tools conducted by the authors at mining enterprises of an open and underground mining method. Among the main tasks of top managers to reduce the risks of inadequate business processes in coal enterprises, it is necessary to resort to a criterion-based assessment of business processes through internal process benchmarking and the provision of analytical information to interested parties, which will allow them to identify «narrow» places during the implementation of the process and make informed management decisions. The presented conclusions are recommended for consideration when drawing up educational standards and programs for the training and retraining of managerial personnel for the mining industry.</jats:p>"

However, little such research has focused on adapted teaching materials for English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts, and to date there has been no systematic effort in establishing syntactic complexity benchmarks to guide text adaptation practices in such contexts. This paper reports on a large‐scale study that assessed the quantitative differences in syntactic complexity among adapted teaching materials for different grade levels in the EFL curricula in China. Our data consisted of 3,368 adapted English texts solicited from a corpus of teaching materials approved for use in the 12 primary and secondary grade levels in China by the Chinese Ministry of Education. All texts were analyzed using 8 syntactic complexity measures representing different dimensions of syntactic complexity. All 8 measures showed significant between‐level differences with moderate to large effect sizes and nonuniform patterns of progression, and 5 measures were identified as significant predictors of grade levels in a logistic regression analysis. The implications of our results for establishing syntactic complexity benchmarks to inform future text adaptation practices are discussed.</jats:p>"

For that purpose, DEA analyses provide information on both target setting and peer identification. However, the identification of peers is actually a by‐product of DEA. DEA models seek a projection point of the unit under evaluation on the efficient frontier of the production possibility set, which is used to set targets, while peers are identified simply as the members of the so‐called reference sets, which consist of the efficient units that determine the projection point as a combination of them. In practice, the selection of peers is crucial for benchmarking, because organizations need to identify a peer group in their sector or industry that represents actual performances from which to learn. In this paper, we argue that DEA benchmarking models should incorporate into their objectives criteria for the selection of suitable benchmarks among peers, in addition to considering the setting of appropriate targets (as usual). Specifically, we develop models having two objectives: setting the closest targets and selecting the most similar reference sets. Thus, we seek to establish targets that require the least effort from organizations for their achievement in addition to identifying peer groups with the most similar performances, which are potential benchmarks to emulate and improve.</jats:p>"

All this causes the need for teachers to be ready for continuous development and advanced training throughout their lives. Thus, the study of the problem of university teachers’ professional development in Russia and abroad is very relevant and timely as a response to the modern requirements of civil society for the personality of the teachers and their activities in the conditions of international educational integration. The need for professional development among teachers is closely related to the desire for more successful indicators in pedagogical activities. To do this, it is necessary to fulfill several pedagogical conditions, including the teacher's own awareness of the need for professional development; the interest of the university administration and the availability of resources to organize a professional development system; having a goal and choosing a professional development model, etc.  The purpose of the article is to show models of individualization of the teachers’ professional development abroad, which are aimed at improving the professional qualifications of university teachers, ensuring their adaptation and successful activity in a constantly changing educational society.  Research results: 1. The article presents the possibilities of benchmarking in education, in particular, the use of a benchmarking project as a method of studying the successful experience of organizing the teachers’ professional development in a modern university.  2. Based on the analysis of the best practices of university teachers’ professional development, authors identify three main models of implementation of teachers’ professional development in higher education organizations. These models can serve as a guide for Russian higher education reformers in the context of state educational policy.  The article concludes that effective European models of teachers’ professional development, identified by using the benchmarking technology, can be successfully implemented in Russian universities under certain conditions.</jats:p>"

It considers architectures that are based on the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) and composed of three main layers: trajectory optimization, simplified model control, and whole-body quadratic programming (QP) control layer. While the first two layers use simplified robot models, the whole-body QP control layer uses a complete robot model to produce either desired positions, velocities, or torques inputs at the joint-level. This paper then compares two implementations of the simplified model control layer, which are tested with position, velocity, and torque control modes for the whole-body QP control layer. In particular, both an instantaneous and a Receding Horizon controller are presented for the simplified model control layer. We show also that one of the proposed architectures allows the humanoid robot iCub to achieve a forward walking velocity of 0.3372[Formula: see text]m/s, which is the highest walking velocity achieved by the iCub robot. </jats:p>"

Two drawbacks of radar plots – the presence of missing information and ordering of indicators – are addressed. Ten different orthopaedic surgery procedures were considered in this study. Moreover, twelve outcome indicators were provided for each of the 10 surgeries of interest. These indicators were displayed using a radar plot, which we call a scorecard. At the hospital level, we propose a facile process by which to consolidate our 10 scorecards into one. We addressed the ordering of indicators in our scorecards by considering the national median of the indicators as a benchmark. Furthermore, our the consolidated scorecard facilitates concise visualisation and dissemination of complex data. It also enables the classification of providers into potential low and high performers that warrant further investigation. In conclusion, radar plots provide a clear and effective comparative tool for discerning multiple outcome indicators against the benchmarks of patient admission. A case study between two top and bottom performers on a consolidated scorecard (at hospital level) showed that medical provider charges varied more than other outcome indicators. </jats:p>"

Pre-operative, immediate post-operative and 24–48 hours post-operative serum sodium concentrations were entered into EXCEL worksheet. In addition post-transplant neurological complications were identified in addition to length of stay in critical care unit.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>During the review period, 23 males and 23 females underwent OLT. Their mean age was 56 yrs (ranging from 23 - 70 yrs). The primary indication for transplantation was cirrhosis (57%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (35%). Fatty liver disease was most common etiology for cirrhosis (46%), followed by PBC (27%), Alcohol-related (15%). Average natural MELD-Na score was 20 (with a range from 7 – 41). Average OR time was 7hr 23min (range 4hr 15min – 15hr).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In 22% of patients, the rate of delta-Na levels were rapid (more than 8 mEq/L) between the pre-operative and immediate post-operative period. Only 2% of patients had more than 8 mEq/L change in their serum sodium levels between the first and second post-operative days. Prior to OLT 21 (46%) patients had hepatic encephalopathy but this was mild or controlled in the majority of patients. In 8 (17%) patients there was multiple-etiology encephalopathy/delirium in the post-operative period. None of these patients developed neurological deficits. Only in 3 patients, tremors were documented (probably multifactorial including calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity). In this project, none of these findings correlated with a high rate of delta-Na.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The average number of days in critical care unit was 6 (range 1 – 62 days). There was no clear correlation between length of stay (surrogate marker for neurologic complications) and rate of delta-Na.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In this benchmarking project, we were unable to identify a specific cut-off rate for delta-Na to correlate with either neurologic complication or length of stay in critical care unit. Rapid correction of serum sodium is often associated with various neurologic complications including central pontine myelinosis. Larger data-base with more numbers of liver transplant patients are needed to show any significant relationship and optimize the electrolyte and volume management. Rapid change in serum sodium could not help with our attempt to classify this benchmarking metric into one of four categories: productivity, quality, time and cost-related.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Funding Agencies</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>NoneKEVORK M PELTEKIAN</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>"

The benchmark of the 1st criticality core of RSG GAS using different nuclear data libraries such as JENDL-4.0, JENDL-3.3, ENDF/B-VII.0, and JEFF-3.1 have been performed in the previous work and compared with the experiment result. In this work, the newly released ENDF/B-VIII.0 neutron reaction and thermal neutron scattering libraries will be used and the important neu-tronics parameters such as multiplication factor, kinetics parameters, and fission reaction rate will be calculated using Monte Carlo code MCNP6.2 and compared against the previous work and the experiment result.</jats:p>"

It uses the Deepening our Understanding of Quality in Australia (DUQuA) study published in this Supplement and DUQuA’s predecessor in Europe, the Deepening our Understanding of Quality improvement in Europe (DUQuE) study, as models. Benchmarking is where the performances of institutions or individuals are compared using agreed indicators or standards. The rationale for benchmarking is that institutions will respond positively to being identified as a low outlier or desire to be or stay as a high performer, or both, and patients will be empowered to make choices to seek care at institutions that are high performers. Benchmarking often begins with a conceptual framework that is based on a logic model. Such a framework can drive the selection of indicators to measure performance, rather than their selection being based on what is easy to measure. A Donabedian range of indicators can be chosen, including structure, process and outcomes, created around multiple domains or specialties. Indicators based on continuous variables allow organizations to understand where their performance is within a population, and their interdependencies and associations can be understood. Benchmarking should optimally target providers, in order to drive them towards improvement. The DUQuA and DUQuE studies both incorporated some of these principles into their design, thereby creating a model of how to incorporate robust benchmarking into large-scale health services research.</jats:p>"

It was up to the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) to create a model that led to the reduction projected by the authorities. To reach this level, the Ministry of Mines and Energy proposed that the electric power transmission concessions be renewed in advance, according to new rules (MP 579/2012 and Law 12.783/2013). An important part of the new rules was the calculation of efficient operational cost through Data Envelopment Analysis - DEA, a methodology already used by ANEEL in two tariff reviews. The objective of this article was to study the evolution of the efficient operational cost calculation models adopted at these times. This analysis showed that ANEEL still needs to promote improvements in the modeling to better represent the operational reality of the concessionaires and eradicate the need for adjustments that reduce the reliability and transparency of the process.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Protons and carbon ions have been extensively used for radiotherapy treatments, and in comparison to conventional radiotherapy, they allow a more conformal dose to the target tumor, especially in case of deep-seated tumors. However, the accuracy of hadron therapy treatments is affected by uncertainties in the particle range calculations. Several techniques are under development for in-vivo range verification, one of which consists on measuring the activity distributions of positron emitters, such as <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>C, <jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C and <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>O, which are produced in the patient body during proton and carbon ion treatments. A comparison between measured and expected positron emitter activity distributions can provide information on the quality of the delivered treatment and accuracy of the particle range calculations. In this work the FLUKA production cross sections for <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>C, <jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C and <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>O originated from proton and carbon ion beams in carbon and oxygen targets were compared with experimental data, at low and therapeutic energies.</jats:p>"

The second-order ISR(2) equations for the one-particle (transition) density matrix have been derived and implemented as an extension of the IP-(U)ADC(3) method available in the Q-CHEM program. As a first systematic test of the present IP-(U)ADC(3)/ISR(2) method, the dipole moments of various electronic states of closed- and open-shell molecules have been computed and compared to full configuration interaction (FCI) results. The present study employing FCI benchmarks also provides the first rigorous estimates for the accuracy of electron detachment energies obtained using the IP-ADC(3) method.</jats:p>"

As part of the joint IAG/FIG Working Groups 4.1.1 and 5.5 on Multi-sensor Systems, a benchmarking measurement campaign was conducted at The Ohio State University. Initial experiments have demonstrated that Cooperative Localization (CL) is extremely useful for positioning and navigation of platforms navigating in swarms or networks. In the data acquisition campaign, multiple sensor platforms, including vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians were equipped with combinations of GNSS, Ultra-wide Band (UWB), Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Raspberry Pi units, cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and inertial sensors for CL. Pedestrians wore a specially designed helmet equipped with some of these sensors. An overview of the experimental configurations, test scenarios, characteristics and sensor specifications is given. It has been demonstrated that all involved sensor platforms in the different test scenarios have gained a significant increase in positioning accuracy by using ubiquitous user localization. For example, in the indoor environment, success rates of approximately 97% were obtained using Wi-Fi fingerprinting for correctly detecting the room-level location of the user. Using UWB, decimeter-level positioning accuracy is demonstrable achievable under certain conditions. The full sets of data is being made available to the wider research community through the WG on request.</jats:p>"

It has recently become clear that HS06, which is based on real applications from non-HEP domains, no longer describes typical HEP workloads. The aim of the HEP-Benchmarks project is to develop a new benchmark suite for WLCG compute resources, based on real applications from the LHC experiments. By construction, these new benchmarks are thus guaranteed to have a score highly correlated to the throughputs of HEP applications, and a CPU usage pattern similar to theirs. Linux containers and the CernVM-FS filesystem are the two main technologies enabling this approach, which had been considered impossible in the past. In this paper, we review the motivation, implementation and outlook of the new benchmark suite.</jats:p>"

Schottky contacts to β‐Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> are of paramount importance to this end; however, they are not yet fundamentally understood. Intrinsic sources of interfacial disorder, including oxygen‐related defects and extrinsic fabrication factors, are thought to greatly determine the properties of such contacts, for example by originating Fermi level pinning and causing patches with different Schottky barrier heights (SBHs). Ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) is used to probe band bending and interfacial inhomogeneity at the nanoscale for prototypical Au/ and Pt/(100)β‐Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> single crystal Schottky barrier diodes. It is shown that SBH fluctuations amount to 40–60 meV under vacuum, occurring over length scales of tens of nanometers. Furthermore, a remarkable SBH modulation of ≈0.2 eV takes place upon exposure of devices from vacuum to ambient air. Such findings—better obtained by BEEM than by macroscale approaches—point to the existence of an ubiquitous inhomogeneous interfacial layer, controlling band bending and ambient sensitivity via oxygen ionosorption and interface redox chemistry. This study ascribes a key role to interfacial oxygen vacancies, and has practical implications for transport modelling and interface engineering.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: The eighth Society for Acute Medicine Benchmarking Audit (SAMBA19) took place on Thursday 27th June 2019. SAMBA gives a broad picture of acute medical care in the UK and allows individual units to compare their performance against their peers.  Method: All UK hospitals were invited to participate. Unit and patient level were collected. Data were analysed against published Clinical Quality indicators (CQI) and standards. This was the biggest SAMBA to date, with data from 7170 patients across 142 units in 140 hospitals.  Results: 84.5% of patients had an Early Warning Score measured within 30 minutes of arrival in hospital (SAMBA18 84.1%), 90.4% of patients were seen by a competent clinical decision maker within four hours of arrival in hospital (SAMBA18 91.4 %) and 68.6% of patients were seen by a consultant within the timeframe standard (SAMBA18 62.7%). Ambulatory Emergency Care is provided in 99.3% of hospitals. 61.8% of patients are initially seen in the Emergency Department (ED). Since SAMBA18 death rates and planned discharge rates, while the use of NEWS2 increased from 2.5% to 59.2% of hospitals.  Conclusion: SAMBA19 highlighted the evolving complexity of acute medical pathways for patients. The challenge now is to increase sample frequency, assess the impact of SAMBA open a broader debate to define optimal CQIs.</jats:p>"
