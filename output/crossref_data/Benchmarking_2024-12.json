Based on the essence of the process approach, the author of the article presents the process of organizational change management as a certain sequence of stages, which are considered through the prism of the main management functions. According to the results of the conducted research, it is substantiated that: the implementation of organizational changes should be an important component of the strategic management of the organization; this process should be holistic and systemic in nature, which combines personnel management practices with the implementation of technologies and change management strategies, meeting the principles of flexibility, adaptability and is implemented through the main management functions; digitalization and artificial intelligence fundamentally transform organizational structures and processes, causing significant changes in the development of business processes and this factor must be taken into account when implementing changes; intensive training for employees, leadership development, training programs and employee support systems can help organizations overcome resistance to change; the integration of individual changes of employees into organizational changes, etc. is important. The article proposes to develop the concept of change management in an enterprise through the formation of an integrative approach, the essence of which is to implement various conceptual approaches into the change management model, such as design thinking, agile management, and organizational ambidexterity. Design thinking is a concept of innovative ideas, products, experiences, and services to improve the lives of end users, regardless of whether they are customers, stakeholders, or employees. The philosophy of design thinking in an organization involves everyone in implementing changes in the organization and accelerates digitalization processes. Ambidexterity is a management and organizational model that consolidates the simultaneous increase in the efficiency and innovation potential of the company, provides a balance between effective business and creative innovation. An agile approach creates new thinking in a complex and uncertain world. The basis of agile change management is: flexibility, adaptability, customer orientation, innovation, focus on productivity, creativity, the formation of entrepreneurial thinking and the upbringing of culture throughout the organization’s activities. Thanks to this combination, the concept of change management will take on the character of a flexible, people-centered and value-oriented management and organizational model of implementing changes.</jats:p>"

In the last twenty years, the increased internet penetration and digital infrastructure, technological advancements such as Radiology Information System, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems and application of deep learning algorithms in imaging technology has resulted in the significant growth in this field but has also engendered a significant cybersecurity concern. It is important for providers and users to be constantly vigilant and to implement strong information security practices to protect against cyber-threats and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data. With cyber threats evolving at an alarming rate, every employee plays a crucial role in protecting an organization from potential attacks. Employees are often the first line of defense, acting as gatekeepers against breaches, phishing scams, and other malicious activities. Therefore, regular employee training is a crucial aspect of the successful implementation of cybersecurity systems. This article provides an overview of the best practices that an ideal cybersecurity system of a teleradiology service provider should follow. An ideal cybersecurity workflow in a teleradiology reporting system should include risk assessment, policy and procedure development, network security through firewalls, data and image encryption, regular employee training, incidence response plan and continuous monitoring and evaluation of the cybersecurity system. A deep understanding of the topic is integral in ensuring the safe, secure and successful implementation of teleradiology in healthcare.</jats:p>"

In developing the framework and implementation procedure, the study employed an exploratory data collection (qualitative) approach to review the phenomenon of water accounting factors. Then, in this study’s second phase, Fuzzy-DEMATEL is used to evaluate the areas identified in the presented framework. In this study, Fuzzy-Delphi is also used to verify the reliability of the core components so that it is possible to generalize the factors to the Fuzzy-DEMATEL process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results obtained from the process of ground theory indicate the identification of 3 categories, 6 core components and 29 propositional themes, which are considered to constitute the framework of water accounting. Besides was determined in the quantitative phase that the optimal water consumption efficiency is considered the most effective component of implementing water accounting in capital market firms.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research is one of the few studies in the field of water accounting framework and Fuzzy evaluation of its functions in the capital market. Because prior research has only described the importance of financial functions and sustainability in the form of a case study, this study seeks to achieve a framework for the implementation of water accounting. Also, through the evaluation of Fuzzy-DEMATEL, this study tries to develop the strategic functions of firms in managing water consumption. The originality of this study is, firstly, the identification of the driving fields of the water accounting, and secondly, the study follows the Fuzzy-Delphi and Fuzzy-DEMATEL of the factors identified in the TSE. Both implications raised in this section show the knowledge-enhancing and practical capacities of the study.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Especially, in terms of the applied algorithms, measurement data, quantities and features used, as well as congruent appliance event and state definitions. Therefore, performance evaluation and the establishment of comparability is not straightforward. The aim of the presented work was to address these challenges, through the development of an application-oriented, general methodology for parametrization, optimization and performance evaluation of NILM algorithms. The methodology is based on the general NILM framework and applicable to a wide range of NILM approaches and measurement data. Temporary, individual appliance measurements were utilized to build an extended appliance database and for providing a reliable ground truth for common performance evaluation metrics. Therefore, also a congruent event and state definition was formulated. For the application of the methodology, the focus was set on event-based NILM algorithms and measurement data of a commercial building and for one significant appliance, regarding the building´s overall energy demand. The methodology proved to be suitable for the aimed purpose. Two different event detection algorithms could be optimized, regarding their input parameters to be able to identify the appliance operation behavior optimally.</jats:p>"

As airports increasingly rely on this data in order to adapt to evolving passenger experience demands, business environments and regulatory requirements, data governance becomes essential for managing, safeguarding and leveraging data effectively. A robust data governance framework provides the structure for ensuring data quality, security and compliance while enabling airports to harness data for artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as predictive maintenance and passenger flow management. By starting with a clear scope, objectives and policies, airports can build a data governance framework that addresses both current needs and future challenges. This paper explores the role of data governance in making airports AI-ready, outlining best practices for implementing a governance programme. It highlights the importance of tools such as data lineage tracking and the need for strong data security measures to comply with regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The paper also emphasises the need for a culture of accountability, outlining key roles such as data stewards and chief data officers (CDOs) to ensure consistent, robust data management. As AI adoption grows, airports must focus on maintaining data integrity, fostering transparency and ensuring regulatory compliance to unlock the full potential of their data assets while safeguarding privacy and building stakeholder trust.</jats:p>"

To address this knowledge gap, this study explored the models for financing SWM initiatives in Tanzania and benchmarked them against international practices. In addition, the study investigated the advantages and disadvantages of the financing options available for grassroots initiatives. The findings from the systematic literature review and analysis of seven waste collection initiatives indicate that, while in advanced countries SWM activities are financed through carbon financing, and loans from the capital market, financial institutions and international agencies, in Tanzania, they are mostly financed through interest-free municipal loans, user charges (service contract), commercial loans, grants and members’ subscriptions. However, the service contract was the most common financing model in Tanzania, mainly because of the limited budget the government allocated for waste management activities. The financing options identified have some advantages and disadvantages, depending on their cost, flexibility, terms and conditions, accessibility and the inclusiveness of beneficiaries. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid model for financing SWM encompassing the public and private sector, especially in a context where government budgets allocated for SMW are limited.</jats:p>"

It is argued that the essence of a crypto assets smart contract is that it is a self-executing contract which is represented and executed by a computer program, remains unchanged and unstoppable after the creation of this contract, and its terms are included in the internal functions of a decentralized database which is not controlled by the databases of the parties to the contract or third parties. It is noted that a cryptoasset smart contract, like any contract, may be declared invalid if the will to conclude it does not meet the conditions for the validity of this transaction, regardless of the form in which this transaction is concluded, as in this case in the form of a computer code. It is also stated that the terms of a cryptoasset smart contract must be specific (clear, unambiguous), feasible (objective), legitimate, and capable of automation (no evaluative terms, such as “reasonable time,” may be used), exist within the blockchain platform (on which cryptoassets are currently transacted) and not involve obtaining and confirming information from outside (in this regard, the terms of force majeure are not specified in the smart contract). The study applies dialectical, comparative legal, formal and logical, and systemic and structural methods of scientific knowledge. It is proved that a smart contract is a contract which is represented and executed by a computer program, the components of which are a computer code, some or all of the terms of this contract which are fulfilled upon the occurrence of predefined events, are stored in an electronic register system which records the result of execution of this program, and the contract itself cannot be changed and is executed in accordance with the programmed instructions of the computer program. The author concludes that the determination of the person who is legally liable when a smart contract fails to perform the programmed function depends on the terms of the smart contract, and in their absence, the provisions of applicable law regarding the legal consequences of non-performance of the contract and liability for such non-performance should be used.</jats:p>"

The results of the study show that the Trans Sumatra toll road Pekanbaru Dumai section needs a financial evaluation. The evaluation showed an average ability to pay (ATP) of IDR 237,461.00 and an average willingness to pay (WTP) of IDR 146,046.00. The research found that the optimal rate is IDR 115,500.00 that users can accept. The Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of the project based on ATP and WTP rates is 8.97%, indicating a relatively low rate of return compared to the Business Plan. Innovative strategies in operational management, including service efficiency and revenue diversification, can improve financial performance and ensure long-term investment continuity.</jats:p>"

Benchmarking serves as a comparative framework, enabling public institutions to evaluate their performance against peer organizations, thus facilitating the identification and adoption of best practices. The discussion underscores the dual benefits and constraints inherent in the process, particularly the importance of integrating both qualitative and quantitative metrics to achieve comprehensive evaluations. While the potential advantages—such as improved transparency, efficiency, and innovation—are notable, the analysis also acknowledges that the success of benchmarking initiatives may be compromised by existing cultural and political barriers.</jats:p>"

This paper reviews the major concepts and methods\nsignificant for modern data architecture in \"Data Modeling Essentials: Techniques, Best Practices, and Future\nTrends.\". We start by considering the base techniques, namely Entity-Relationship and Dimensional modeling, and\nlook into their applications in operational and analytical data systems. The paper also covers more advanced topics\nthat include Data Vault modeling for agile data warehousing and NoSQL modeling to accommodate unstructured\nand semi-structured data, increasingly important in today's big data era.\nThe paper also gives an overview of best practices in developing scalable, flexible data models: stakeholder\ncommunication, documentation, and the use of automation tools in accelerating model development and\nconsistency. Data quality, adherence to regulations, and alignment of models with business objectives are among\nthe practices identified as crucial in today's fast-moving data environments.\n\nNew trends are taking precedence, and data modeling is continuously evolving. We will review the rise of AI-\nassisted data modeling, graph database structures for highly interconnected data, and model-driven development to\n\naccelerate system deployments. This paper examines actionable insights for data professionals, IT teams, and\nbusiness leaders on how to design robust, agile models that improve the quality of data, enhance decision-making,\nand foster innovation in an ever-changing data ecosystem.\nKeywords\nData Modeling, Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling, Dimensional Modeling, Data Quality, Scalable Data Models,\nModel Driven Development (MDD), Data Management, Structured &amp; Unstructured Data, Future Trends in Data\nModeling.</jats:p>"

They also support the government broader agenda of improving the citizens quality of live across the key domains of United Nations 17 Sustainable development goals (SDGs), Africa Agenda 2063; the “prosperous Africa that we want”, Kenya Vision 2030; “transforming the County in key Social, economic and Political spheres”, and the 2022-2030 government agenda focusing on “five priority areas of social economic transformation of Kenya by 2030. However, approximately 70% of these commercial SOEs are loss making despite being in key sectors. The objective this study was to examine the effect of financial management practices on SOE’s performance in Kenya. The study applied a post- positivism research philosophy and a cross-section approach to descriptive research design. The sampling frame and unit of analysis was the 41 commercial state-owned enterprises in Kenya. The unit of response was 205 managers of the SOEs. A closed ended questionnaire was used to collect primary data for the predictor and a secondary data collection sheet for the target variable. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) coefficient and Bartlett’s Chi-Square from Confirmatory Factor Analysis were used to enhance construct validity. Ordinary Least Squares was used for inferential analysis after testing the data for Gaussian distribution, linearity and autocorrelation. The study found that 62.8% of the variations in SOEs performance could be explained by financial management practices and that there is a statistically significance influence of these practices on SOEs performance. These findings imply that departing from best practices in financial management practices can have a significant effect on SOE performance. Risk management policy, risks assessments, risk appetite thresholds, risk monitoring &amp; reporting and comprehensiveness of internal financial controls are also elastic to these practices. This study recommends a focussed approach to the review and harmonization of policy/ies driving these financial management practices at entity level and attention to utilisation of technology in financial management processes so as to drive strategic performance.</jats:p>"

The integration of business innovation and supply chain management (SCM) has brought about the redesign of business processes through the implementation of a closed-loop approach. The Circular Economy (CE) offers a sustainable solution to improve business opportunities by ‘closing the loop’ and following the principles of rejuvenation and reuse inspired by nature. Presently, numerous studies have attempted to establish the concept of SCM by integrating CE principles, which are commonly denoted as circular SCM. With this study, we try and provide a more definite approach, as to what truly makes a SC circular. While many scholars have recognized the challenges of transitioning to CE, there is still a lack of consensus on business best practices that can facilitate companies in embracing CE across the supply chain. Hence, this paper conducts a thorough literature review to scrutinize the SCM practices utilized for CE and how they differ from other SCM models. It then identifies the obstacles and recommends best practices that can enhance a company's ability to incorporate CE principles toward business innovation and supply chain performance. Further, the paper proposes future research in the field of using technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain, as business innovation tools for supply chain management towards CE adoption.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p> Water crisis is a major problem across the world. It is significant to migrate for effective methodologies to meet future water demand. Solar-based desalination system is environmental friendly and suitable method for potable water yield production from saline/brackish water and also cost effective than other methods. The role of optimization study in maximizing the water yield is paramount for the performance enhancement of solar-based desalination system and its effect was insufficiently addressed. In present study, a new approach of waste scraper and double fan arrangement is introduced inside the conventional solar still (SS). Then, using response surface methodology, Box–Behnken design (BBD)-based optimization is performed to determine optimal solution for the influence of input parameters (operating Time interval, Time duration and voltage of scraper and dual fan) on the output parameter relative humidity (RH) to increase the condensation and evaporation rates of a SS, which helps to enhance the water yield productivity. Experiment is conducted at 9.672° (North) and 77.994° (East) Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Validation of experiment results is done using the BBD method. Result reveals that the analysis of variance model with double-fan arrangement inside the still shows better with optimal performance with a coefficient of determination R<jats:sup>2 </jats:sup>= 97.78%, adequate precision = 46.22, RH = 76.515% than that with scraper arrangement ( R<jats:sup>2 </jats:sup>= 96.7%, adequate precision = 35.76, RH = 76.327%). The optimized model exhibit promising results with statistically significant P-value less than .0001 for the both methods and its F-value is noticed that 126.96 (for a SS with scraper) and 190.66 (for a SS with double fan).The outcome of this study helps to enhance the condensation rate to produce the more amount of fresh water from hybrid photovoltaic with thermal system. </jats:p>"

A baseline audit examined the existing care for sleep disturbances in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Eight criteria were applied to evaluate compliance with best practice recommendations. A JBI Getting Research into Practice (GRiP) analysis was conducted, and five barriers to recommended practices were identified. Fourteen improvement strategies were then implemented and a follow-up audit was conducted to measure changes in practice.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The baseline audit showed that the sleep screening rate was 71% (Criterion 1).

This session includes four data-based papers that will discuss essential elements of design and evaluation of early-phase dyadic interventions with older adults and their care partners in both cognitive impairment and chronic illness contexts. First, Dr. Joan Monin and colleagues will describe the advantages of, and phases involved in, using an Appreciative Inquiry Workshop approach to develop an attachment-based communication intervention with dyads living with dementia. Second, Dr. Kalisha Bonds Johnson and colleagues will present phase I data from a study to develop and test a formal care decision-making intervention for African-American parent-adult child dyads living with dementia. The paper will discuss the importance of intentional community engagement, use of theory, and type of dyad (e.g., mother-daughter) when designing dyadic interventions. Third, Dr. Michael McCarthy and colleagues will use data from several studies to exemplify the advantages of mixed-methods designs in developing dyadic interventions, particularly in rural samples (e.g., strengthening participant engagement, maximizing resources, surfacing new questions). Finally, Dr. Karen Lyons and colleagues will present two approaches to evaluating dyadic benefits of interventions in small samples, the importance of assessing pre-test risk status within care dyads, and the need to assess relational impact of behavioral interventions. Speakers will share best-practices in developing, designing and evaluating early-phase dyadic interventions followed by a discussion of key take-homes by Dr. Steve Zarit.</jats:p>"

This study used a quantitative descriptive approach through structured observation data collection of Physics classes. The aspects assessed included the readiness of practicum equipment and materials, the effectiveness of the division of tasks in the group, the active involvement of students, the application of the Project Based Learning (PjBL) method, and the ability of students to apply SEP, including experimental design, data collection and analysis, physics model making, and preparation of practicum report results. The results showed that implementing the physics practicum in the Good category had an average score of 76.2. The application of SEP, especially in the use of technology and the ability to work together, also contributed significantly to the effectiveness of the practicum. This finding confirms the importance of strengthening science and engineering practices in physics practicum learning and its implications for the development of students' scientific and technical skills.</jats:p>"

While RPA automates repetitive, rule based work, cloud computing is the scalable, flexible and decentralized infrastructure for storing and processing of data, and collaboration. With RPA integrated with cloud platforms, organizations gain several advantages including accessibility, low cost and real time collaboration. Choosing the right cloud provider that supports RPA workloads, ensuring data flow seamlessly between RPA bots and cloud systems, and using cloud based RPA tools that can scale and that add flexibility, are the best practices for RPA and Cloud integration. It is also important to enforce robust security protocols, data governance as well as comply with risks. Integration is successful when RPA links with cloud native apps and services with as little disruption to work as possible and as much automation effect as possible. It is therefore recommended that performance monitoring, testing and continuous improvement of automation process should be given priority. Through the implementation of these best practices, organizations can attain near full potential RPA and cloud integration for operation efficiency, better customer experience and faster digital transformation. In this paper we explore the key strategies, challenges and solutions to ensure success with the integration of RPA into cloud technologies to help businesses looking to optimize the use of automation and cloud capabilities in unison.</jats:p>"

Testing demands have likewise increased, prompting healthcare facilities to adopt a range of methods, from simple point-of-care immunoassays to comprehensive chromatographic and mass spectrometry-based techniques. Each of these testing methods has trade-offs related to cost, performance, speed, and convenience, requiring healthcare facilities to carefully determine the best options to meet their clinical needs. Unfortunately, current testing practices may result in unnecessary costs and certain methods, such as immunoassays, have significant limitations that affect their clinical utility. As such, the goal of this review is to frame the current state of drug testing and related cost-effectiveness and patient centered approaches to address this evolving public health challenge.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Content</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This review discusses the current state of substance use mortality/morbidity, the economic impact of substance use disorders, provides an overview of testing methods and their relative cost-benefit, solutions to improve test utilization and cost-effectiveness, and finally, future threats and new opportunities that can improve the clinical utility of these tests.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The cost-effectiveness of drugs of abuse testing revolves around proper test utilization, including understanding what test is being ordered, its limitations, understanding results, and ordering testing when it can provide actionable information. Fundamental principles of test utilization such as education, clinical informatics, and optimizing test panels remain essential. Future threats in this space include new compounds and regulatory changes. However, novel solutions such as new noninvasive sample types, automation, and artificial intelligence can play a significant role in improving overall test utilization practices.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>"

This systematic review explores the role of global election observation in promoting free and fair elections and best practices in election management. The review focuses on the history, principles, approaches, impact, and challenges of international election observation. The origins of international election observation can be traced back to the 1857 European commission that observed the elections in Moldavia and Wallachia. Today, international observer missions are structured, systematic, and involve hundreds of individuals over several months, deployed by various international organizations such as the European Union, OSCE, African Union, OAS, IRI, NDI, and Council of Europe. International election observation is based on two fundamental principles: clear commitments by governments for ensuring democratic elections and the role of observers as objective individuals who do not interfere in the process. The review highlights the importance of transparency, hard work, dedication, professionalism, and experience in ensuring the credibility and effectiveness of international observation. The impact of international election observation includes raising voter confidence, evaluating the legitimacy of electoral processes and outcomes, promoting bilateral exchanges of knowledge and information on electoral practices, and sometimes leading to lasting international relations. However, the review also acknowledges the challenges and criticisms of international observation, such as the perception of conferring legitimacy on flawed elections, the need for adequate time, resources, qualified observers, comprehensive coverage, and accreditation.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on domain knowledge management of the Malaysian construction industry. Thirty-one respondents from various categories of construction organizations have participated in this concurrent mixed-method study. A purposive sampling procedure has been used to obtain the required data. Before that, an instrument was prepared, consisting of measurement on four constructs, namely Perception about Organization Environment (POE), Perception about Knowledge Management in Organization (PKO), Knowledge Discovery Practices (KDP), and Appreciation System (AP). Since the ordinal scale was used, the qualitative descriptive analysis was done based on median, maximum, and minimum values. Additionally, a Spearman Correlation analysis was conducted, revealing several significant correlations, including those between PEO and KMO, PEO and KDP, KMO and KDP, KMO and AP, as well as KDP and AP. During the survey, suggestions from the respondents regarding the best practices for knowledge management were also sought. This qualitative data was later analyzed using thematic analysis. As a result, it is revealed that most of the sampled construction organizations provide encouraging environments for good knowledge management practices. They support knowledge discovery and acquisition while implementing an appreciation system to maintain the good practice of knowledge management. The thematic analysis has also indicated that knowledge management applications are crucial for these organizations. Overall, this study has expanded the existing body of knowledge by providing insights into implementing scalable and sustainable knowledge management practices tailored for construction organizations.</jats:p>"

These factors not only impact the well-being of the community but also pose serious health and safety risks for the workers. In response to this situation, a detailed analysis of occupational, health, and environmental risks is conducted, highlighting significant threats to both workers and the surrounding community. This article proposes a series of actions aimed at implementing best practices in the candelilla extraction process in the Valley of Acatita, located in the municipality of Francisco I.

The increasing presence of such figures in these communication channels makes it challenging to select consistent and influential influencers for a specific audience. This paper introduces an innovative approach to defining these figures based on the analysis of relationships within the brand's network. Specifically, this methodology will be applied to the case study of a brand named “Anemonia”. The approach relies on the sequential application of various steps, including the use of tools such as Social Network Analysis (SNA) centrality, Sentiment Analysis (SA), and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Through the application of this methodology, the brand has been able to identify influencers consistent with its aesthetics and vision.</jats:p>"

Most existing studies evaluate performance using a single research method. This paper combines qualitative and quantitative research methods and integrates a comprehensive, scientific, rigorous economic performance analysis system with multi-criteria decision-making. First, utilising numerous journal articles, interview data, book materials, and 407 questionnaire responses, a preliminary economic performance analysis system for engineering project management was developed through three-level coding using grounded theory. Subsequently, a factor analysis was employed to select indicators for the analysis system, resulting in an evaluation framework for the economic performance of engineering project management with eight core assessment indicators. Finally, based on the evaluation system, the relationships between the indicators and the calculation formulas for the three-level indicators were summarised, culminating in a closed-loop, systematic, and multi-dimensional analysis framework. This study enhances the evaluation framework for the economic performance dimension in engineering project management within construction enterprises. It provides robust methodological and data support for assessing economic performance in engineering project management.</jats:p>"

Some of the issues are; teacher supply in remote areas, and moving from one environment of learning to another. At the same time, the paper is devoted to the positive practices in the Finnish model of HRM, such as, professional learning, work engagement and job satisfaction of teachers, support for education enhancing the context of the learning system in Finland.</jats:p>"

The study provides an AI Project Framework that identifies the significant differences between AI projects and other information technology (IT) projects, including the AI development lifecycle, risks, issues, and challenges. The study creates a conceptual structure that combines aspects from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 21502:2020-12 Project Management standard and the AI project lifecycle. Finally, it weaves a practical framework of interdependencies and success factors for managing AI projects. The study uses an integrative literature review methodology that follows a hermeneutic framework. The study results should offer practical benefits to sponsoring organizations, project sponsors, and project managers in planning and governing AI projects.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of AI-powered automated code review tools has significantly transformed Agile software development by improving efficiency, maintaining coding standards, and enhancing developer productivity. These tools streamline repetitive tasks, identify potential issues early, and enforce consistency in code quality. However, their adoption comes with challenges such as accuracy constraints, difficulties in integrating with legacy systems, and hesitation among developers. This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques to examine the benefits, challenges, and best practices associated with AI-driven code reviews. To gather insights, surveys and interviews were conducted with software engineers, DevOps professionals, and Agile practitioners. Additionally, real-world case studies analyzed how organizations have implemented AI-based code reviews, while an experimental study measured performance indicators such as error detection rates, review efficiency, and developer workflow improvements. The findings suggest that AI tools significantly reduce code review time, enhance consistency, and allow developers to concentrate on complex problem-solving rather than manual review processes. However, AI's inability to fully grasp context-sensitive issues, challenges in analyzing complex code logic, and resistance from developers remain notable barriers. Concerns about job security and loss of control over decision-making further contribute to adoption challenges. To overcome these issues, this study emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach where AI tools assist rather than replace human reviewers. Regular training and updates are crucial to improving AI accuracy and keeping pace with evolving coding practices. Gradual integration with existing systems can mitigate compatibility challenges, while transparent communication can help alleviate developer concerns. Additionally, establishing a validation mechanism, where human reviewers verify AI-generated recommendations, can enhance reliability and trust in these tools. In conclusion, while AI-driven automated code reviews offer substantial benefits for Agile teams, their successful implementation depends on strategic deployment, ongoing refinements, and a well-balanced collaboration between AI and human expertise. By following best practices, organizations can optimize AI-assisted code reviews, ultimately improving software quality and streamlining development workflows.</jats:p>"

In order to evaluate the long-term hydrological consequences of LULC for the purposes of land use optimization in the Hulan River Basin, Northeast China, the validated Long-term Hydrological Impact Assessment (L-THIA) model was employed to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) non-point source (NPS) loads from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, the load per unit area index (LPUAI) method was utilized to identify critical source areas. The findings indicated that the regions with elevated pollution levels were predominantly situated in areas designated for agricultural and construction activities. The greatest contributor to nitrogen and phosphorus loads was agricultural land. There were clear increases in both TN and TP during the study period, with increases of 51.73% and 55.56%, respectively. As a consequence of the process of urbanization in the basin, the area of land devoted to construction activities increased, reaching a coverage of 5.02%. Nevertheless, the contribution of construction land to the total basin NPS load exceeded 10% in 2020. This was the primary factor contributing to the observed increase in pollution loads despite a reduction in agricultural land area over the past two decades. TN and TP loads were markedly higher during the flood season than the non-flood season, accounting for over 80% of the NPS load. The sub-watersheds in the southwest and northeast have been identified as significant sources of nitrogen and phosphorus loss, contributing to the overall burden of NPS pollution. Implementing measures such as fertilizer reduction and conversion of farmlands to forests and grasslands can effectively mitigate NPS pollution, particularly TN pollution. This study proposes that the integration of L-THIA with GIS can serve as a valuable tool for local planners to consider potential pollution risks during future planning and development activities.</jats:p>"

Examining strategic management practices in Nepalese commercial banks is aim of this study. Four independent variables i.e., environmental scanning, strategy formulation, strategy execution, and strategy assessment control, as well as one dependent variable i.e., performance of Nepalese commercial banks, were primary focus of this study. This study is quantitative in nature. For the study, a causal comparative research design was chosen. To gather primary data on the factors and investigate their relationship, a survey was conducted. Simple random sampling was used to distribute self-administered questionnaires for this investigation. Data was collected from 216 respondents from among 10 commercial banks of Nepal. In the analytical section, both descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted. Data analysis was made using SPSS. With an R2 value of 0.685, the inferential analysis demonstrates that every aspect of strategic management techniques under investigation has a favourable and statistically significant effect on the operations of Nepal's commercial banks. Among the four dimensions of strategic management practices strategy formulation have the most influential role on performance of commercial banks in Nepal in financial and non-financial terms. Managers of Nepalese commercial banks should take steps to continuously apply the approaches of strategic management for long-term competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Several aspects, such as reducing cost and time to market, push companies towards integration of V&amp;V methods earlier in development to support effective decision-making. One foundational methodology seeing increased attention in industry is the use of MBSyE, which brings benefits of models with well-defined syntax and semantics to support V&amp;V activities, rather than relying on natural language text documentation. Despite their promise, industrial adoption of these practices is still challenging.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            This article presents a vision for\n            <jats:italic>readily available early V&amp;V</jats:italic>\n            . We present a summary of the literature on early V&amp;V in MBSyE and position existing challenges regarding potential solutions and future investigations towards this vision.

During the construction phase, delays and a decline in building quality that did not align with the planning phase were observed. Therefore, a review of the management approach is necessary to ensure timely completion, maintained quality, and cost efficiency. This study evaluates the effectiveness of time, cost, and quality management in the construction project. The analysis method used is the interactive data analysis paradigm, involving data reduction, storage, and analysis using IBM SPSS 20. The analysis results indicate that time and cost management have been effective, with the construction work being completed within the set schedule and the costs not exceeding the Budget Plan. Quality management is rated very good with a score of 4.35, indicating that the construction process is strictly carried out according to specified materials and work procedures. Cost savings are also rated very good with a score of 3.89, indicating effective cost control. Time efficiency is rated good with a score of 4.06, showing that the project can run the schedule efficiently. Based on the research results, the researcher recommends enhancing leadership aspects and increasing active involvement of top management in supervision and strategic decision-making. This study also shows that self-management can promote transparency, efficiency, and high-quality outcomes in construction projects.</jats:p>"

Implementation of the intervention was piloted and evaluated via a process evaluation. This study aims to evaluate contentedness with the intervention, implementation effort, implementation determinants, intervention fidelity, and perceived intervention effects using a mixed-methods process evaluation. Methods: The mixed-methods process evaluation explored the views of general practitioners, medical assistants and patients regarding the intervention components. Data were collected through semi-structured telephone interviews and a survey questionnaire. Qualitative data were first analyzed inductively, followed by a deductive–inductive approach based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. Survey data were analyzed descriptively. Results: Participants (n = 21) reported a strong contentedness with the intervention, high intervention fidelity, low implementation effort, and a change in perception of compression therapy as the central treatment element. Healthcare professionals emphasized increased patient education and patient and family involvement. Patients reported feeling better informed and empowered to take an active role in their treatment, primarily due to increased knowledge and skills in compression therapy. As a result, they were more content with their care and reported positive experiences with wound healing since trial participation. Conclusions: The Ulcus Cruris Care intervention can lead to a noticeable change in knowledge and potentially influence practice teams’ approach to venous leg ulcer management, facilitating a significantly more frequent use of compression therapy in VLU care. A confirmatory evaluation of potential effects in a definitive RCT seems warranted.</jats:p>"

The GFRP bars have comparable structural performance while providing a non-corrosive option for corrosion-prone-reinforced concrete bridge decks. This study presents the results of the performance evaluation of two similar bridge decks, one reinforced with GFRP bars and the other one reinforced with steel bars. The two bridges were instrumented using several vibrating wire strain gauges to collect their long-term data over time in response to the seasonal temperature changes. The GFRP bars were also tested in the lab to extract their stress–strain behavior and compare their mechanical properties to those of the conventional steel. Finally, the two bridge decks were compared in terms of economical characteristics through a set of life-cycle cost analysis based on the initial cost, bridge deck reconstruction, and also repair and rehabilitation costs during the service life of the bridges. The study revealed no concerning difference between the structural performance of a GFRP-reinforced and a steel-reinforced bridge decks, showing that GFRP bars could be used as a viable alternative material in bridge decks.</jats:p>"

Specific factors that can narrow the fund's participation in investment projects are given. Specific proposals are given to activate the investment of the fund's capital in the company's activities. This study explores the development and challenges of institutional investment processes in Uzbekistan, focusing on the accumulative pension fund (APF) as a key player in the country’s investment landscape. Utilizing both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies, data from official Uzbek databases were analyzed statistically. The results highlight significant limitations in the current investment climate, including underdeveloped financial infrastructure, narrow investment portfolios, and regulatory constraints on fund activities. Despite these challenges, the APF has the potential to catalyze market growth through strategic investments in securities and corporate bonds. The study concludes that creating a favorable investment environment, coupled with improved management practices and broader financial instruments, could transform institutional investors into vital contributors to Uzbekistan’s economic growth and industrial development</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Emerging social, economic, and environmental concerns bring operational challenges and the worldwide economy has seen magnifying pressure to incorporate environmental performance (EP) as a part of strategic decision. Studies in the field of environmental management and, particularly, in the areas of green practices, zero waste, and green innovation have suggested that, if executed properly, these organizations are able to promote EP. Under these conditions, organizations’ practices and mechanisms that ensure the enhancement of the EP of these business organizations have gained the wider attention of researchers and management. Focused on the environment and social responsibility, this study explores the complex relationships within sustainable green supply chain management (GSCM) and explores whether GSCM practices significantly impact both zero waste management and green innovation. The analysis also studies whether there are possible beneficial links between zero waste management, green innovation and environmental performance (EP). Additionally, through assessing the level to which these items come together in sustainable strategic actions, the paper shows the correlation among four important topics: GSCM practices, green innovation (GI), zero waste management, and EP. This study explores the relations between zero waste management and EP as well as green innovation and EP, examining whether these aspects of green practices have a positive relationship with effective waste management techniques in the presence of GSCM practices. The paper analyses interactions between GSCM practices and EP, and the mediation role of zero waste management and GI. Moreover, the moderating role of green knowledge sharing (GKS) also been tested. A total of 389 managers in the manufacturing sector completed the survey and the results were analyzed applying SPSS 25.0 and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings confirmed a significant association among GSCM practices, GI, zero waste management, GKS, and EP. Furthermore, findings also revealed that zero waste management GI has a positive intervention role between GSCM practices and EP. GSCM practices facilitate the promotion of EP by incorporating eco-design, green purchasing, new techniques for production or processes, and green marketing that ensures waste reduction and recycling practices.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study examines the ways through which technological innovation may contribute to knowledge management implementation and thus result in improved organizational performance and innovation. The sample of this research was 364 manufacturing companies in Indonesia. The questionnaire was used as a tool to collect data via email and follow‐up with phone calls. To perform data analysis, the Partial least square structural equation modelling is implemented. Findings indicate that knowledge acquisition, exploitation, protection, and integration significantly and positively influence the innovative ability of an organization. Thus, in order to test these factors in different contexts, more studies must be performed. In the current study, the role of Knowledge Management Process was highlighted for increasing the organization's innovative capability.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Transit facilitation and supply chain management are crucial for improving trade competitiveness, especially for landlocked countries like Nepal, which faces unique challenges due to its dependence on neighboring nations, particularly India, for access to global trade routes. This article explores global best practices in transit facilitation and supply chain management, highlighting how countries with similar geographical constraints, such as Switzerland and Austria, have effectively addressed logistical challenges through integrated infrastructure, digitalization, and regional cooperation. It examines how these strategies can be adapted to Nepal’s context to optimize its transit systems, reduce costs, and enhance its trade competitiveness. Key strategies include streamlining customs procedures, adopting digital integration like blockchain and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and investing in efficient infrastructure, such as multimodal transport systems and dry ports. The article also underscores the importance of regional cooperation, exemplified by frameworks like ASEAN, which can offer Nepal opportunities to harmonize policies and reduce trade barriers. Furthermore, Nepal’s transit challenges—ranging from its dependency on India, infrastructure gaps, bureaucratic delays, and limited digitalization—are discussed, with actionable recommendations for overcoming these obstacles. Opportunities for Nepal include leveraging the India-Nepal Transit Treaty, enhancing digital platforms for transparency, improving infrastructure, and strengthening regional cooperation. By aligning with global best practices and strategically addressing its challenges, Nepal can improve its logistics and transit systems, foster economic growth, and enhance its position in regional and global trade networks. This study provides a comprehensive roadmap for Nepal to build resilience and competitiveness in the evolving global trade landscape.</jats:p>"

By digitizing this process, data flows can be expanded to include metadata and paradata that allow survey administrators to evaluate and improve survey processes and parameters. Between 2017 and early 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided technical support to country partners to implement MPS gathering indicators on noncommunicable diseases within adult populations in seven countries. These surveys resulted in 37 591 completed interviews containing no personal identifiable information. When combined, these surveys result in over 25 million rows of paradata representing timestamped interactions between the data collection platform and each survey respondent. Using exploratory data analysis, five key metrics were identified which had implications on MPS process optimization: timing of engagement, question randomization, contacts to complete, errors and mode effect. The use of survey paradata allows for real-time process evaluations and identifies factors that can improve efficiency and effectiveness of MPS methods.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>The insurance sector plays a crucial role in Kenya's economic development by supporting businesses and promoting financial market stability. However, the Insurance Regulatory Authority of Kenya has noted a concerning decline in the industry's overall claims ratio, primarily due to inadequate risk management. This failure in risk management has led to substantial financial losses and the collapse of several insurance companies in Kenya. Specifically, it aims to determine the effects of claims management on these companies' financial performance. The study adopted a descriptive research design, targeting all 56 insurance companies registered in Kenya as of January 31, 2023. Primary data was collected using questionnaires, while secondary data was gathered from existing sources and systematically recorded on data collection sheets for the independent variables. This secondary data was sourced from the Insurance Regulatory Authority for the period between 2013 and 2022. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS. Descriptive statistics included measures of central tendencies such as means, frequency distribution, and standard deviations, while inferential statistics comprised correlation and regression analysis to determine the relationships between research variables. Data findings were presented using tables and graphs. The study found that claims management had a significant positive effect on the financial performance of insurance companies in Kenya. Claims risk management had a greater impact on financial performance when measured by ROE compared to ROA. In conclusion, the study indicates that claims risk management positively and significantly affects the financial performance of insurance companies in Kenya. Therefore, it recommends that the management of these companies continuously improve their risk management practices to reduce claim rates, enhance financial performance, and increase shareholders' wealth. Further research is suggested to explore other factors beyond risk management practices that may contribute to the reduced return on equity among insurance firms in Kenya.\r\n </jats:p>"

Additionally, the study investigates the mediating role of employee involvement in the relationship between HR practices and project performance. By employing a quantitative research methodology, data were collected from 225 employees working on the PTCL 4G project. Statistical tools such as correlation analysis, regression analysis, and the Baron and Kenny approach were utilized to explore direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The findings reveal that recruitment and selection, compensation and rewards, and training and development have a significant and positive impact on project performance. Furthermore, employee involvement plays a crucial mediating role, amplifying the effects of HR practices on performance outcomes. The results highlight that organizations can achieve enhanced project success by fostering employee engagement alongside implementing robust HR practices. The study emphasizes the importance of strategically aligning HR practices with organizational goals to improve project performance. It also demonstrates that employee involvement acts as a key driver for optimizing the benefits of HR practices, particularly in the dynamic and competitive telecommunications industry. These findings provide actionable insights for management, offering a framework to enhance both employee participation and project outcomes. The study underscores the necessity of integrating HR strategies with employee involvement to achieve sustainable organizational success.</jats:p>"

For their financial security and quality of life, financial literacy and behavior are absolutely vital. Many young workers lack enough financial knowledge and management skills, which results in bad financial decisions and behaviors. This difference could lead to unstable finances and compromise long-term security. Putting in place structured financial literacy initiatives fit for this group might greatly improve financial performance. Therefore, the aimed to assess the financial management practices and financial behavior among young professionals of business process outsourcing companies in China. The challenges encountered were also analyzed towards an intervention plan proposal. The study reveals that young professionals in BPO companies generally have a positive view of financial management, but their authority over decisions varies. Financial conduct is influenced by peer influence and societal expectations, and they exhibit varied financial behaviors in budgeting, saving, and long-term planning. However, they face challenges like limited understanding, lifestyle inflation, and balancing short-term and long-term goals.</jats:p>"

Widely integrated into national sanitation strategies in low- and middle-income countries, CLTS is implemented through pre-triggering, triggering, and post-triggering activities. However, limited evidence exists on how implementation process promotes behaviour change.This study retrospectively evaluates a community-based intervention in Chiradzulu District, Malawi, that employed CLTS alongside market-based sanitation and hygiene promotion campaigns. Using the UK Medical Research Council process evaluation framework, we analysed project documentation and collected data from household surveys (n=1,151), interviews (n=36), and focus group discussions (n=14).All planned activities were implemented, though adaptations affected fidelity and required additional household visits. Intervention reach was suboptimal: 46% of households attended triggering events, 64% received visits, 16% were exposed to market-based sanitation, and 47% received hygiene campaigns. Exposure to both triggering sessions and household visits increased the likelihood of latrine availability (OR = 1.63; CI = 1.55–1.72) and HWF presence (OR = 1.39; CI = 1.03–1.86). High costs, limited awareness of masons, and extreme weather events affected latrine adoption. Our findings emphasize the need for multi-level engagement, flexible delivery, and addressing barriers for sustainable sanitation adoption.</p>"

The Mechanical Design phase involved utilizing computer-aided drawing programs to create the AUV model. Important design considerations encompassed manufacturability, cost, power, weight, and durability. Comparisons with nominal values of existing market products validated the precision of the produced designs. Particular emphasis was placed on optimizing the weight of the models, ensuring the AUV's efficiency, lightness, and exceptional maneuverability in underwater environments. The Software stage entailed the development of AUV software to enable sensitive and effective vehicle operations. Seamless functioning, devoid of errors or complications, was imperative to ensure optimal autonomous driving, running, and operational capabilities. Image processing algorithms were incorporated into the software to maintain high accuracy and provide dimensional and geometric information of targeted areas. Furthermore, the software phase involved the development of an image processing algorithm based on color analysis, further augmenting accuracy. The selection of electronic components for the AUV was also a vital consideration, alongside ensuring safety measures at every stage of the UAV's development.</jats:p>"

The article is devoted to the analysis of the current state of psychological and educational support for building students’ life strategies within the system of moral education in universities of the Russian Federation. The purpose of the study is to identify the specifics of psychological and educational support for the process of building life strategies by students based on the analysis of the best practices in the implementation of youth policy in modern conditions.\nMaterials and Methods. The theoretical and methodological bases of the study ware the ideas and concepts of learner-centered approach. The authors used the methods of expert assessment and content analysis. An array of empirical data was obtained as a result of the analysis of applications submitted by higher educational institutions for the Review-competition of the best practices in the implementation of youth policy and the organization of educational activities at the university. The data array consisted of 1215 applications.\nResults. The authors conclude that there is a contradiction between the relevance of the task of building a life strategy for student age and a pronounced lack of activities in psychological and educational support of this process. The authors emphasized the internal orientation and isolation of moral educational activities at universities, which hinders the spread of practices of supporting the construction of students' life prospects outside the university. Among the existing formats of psychological and educational support, the centers of psychological counseling, adaptation and training programs, monitoring and diagnostic programs, clubs and communities of pre-psychological assistance and mutual assistance prevail. However, educational activities and youth policy at universities have a pronounced indirect or mediated influence on the construction of students’ life strategy. The most significant potential of this activity in relation to long-term planning is an increase in the level of awareness and social orientation of the individual, his or her ability to self-knowledge and consciously build a life prospect. \nConclusions. The authors identify specific characteristics of psychological and educational support for the construction of life prospects by students at the university: a pronounced lack of attention to the task of building a long-term life prospect; the dominance of practices of supporting orientation and planning in the near future; institutionalization of support for building a life strategy in psychologically-oriented formats; significant indirect influence of the university on the process of building a life perspective; deficiencies of formats that affect significant components of building a life perspective (family and career planning); deficiencies of formats that form social immunity to negative environmental influences, thereby removing barriers to building a life perspective. \n</jats:p>"

It points to the economic and social consequences of faulty storage solutions in developing countries. It stresses the necessity for upgrading agricultural storage, sharing technologies, incorporating online storage, and applying modern storage facilities, especially among smallholder farmers. The issue of agri-warehousing, however, runs into numerous challenges in infrastructure, technologies, and regulatory frameworks in both developed economies as well as in emerging economies. Given the emphasis on theory, policy, and best practices, it is hoped that this chapter will provide a necessary foundation for better understanding of the agricultural warehouse system from a more practical perspective.</jats:p>"

Historically, SAS has been the predominant tool for creating TLFs; however, with the\nincreasing adoption of open-source software in the pharmaceutical industry, R has emerged as a viable alternative.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive approach to creating TLFs using R, focusing on the required R packages,\nstrategies for handling missing values, and methods for rounding numeric values. By leveraging R's capabilities,\norganizations can achieve greater flexibility and efficiency in their reporting processes, potentially reducing costs\nassociated with software licensing and training. Additionally, the integration of R in clinical workflows can facilitate\nreal-time data analysis and enhance decision-making, positioning R as a powerful tool for the pharmaceutical\nindustry’s evolving landscape. This work demonstrates how R can be effectively used for clinical trial reporting,\noffering significant advantages compared to traditional tools.\nKeywords: R packages, ggplot2, dplyr,R Shiny for clinical trials, R in clinical trials, Adverse event tables, Data\nvisualization, Data preparation, Regulatory submission, Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs)</jats:p>"

The study was conducted at a pet clinic in Malang City using a quantitative approach and hypothesis testing through the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. The results showed that Organizational CRM practices had a positive and significant effect on clinic performance and customer retention, while Technology CRM practices had a significant effect on customer retention but were not significant on clinic performance directly. Customer retention proved to be a partial mediator in the relationship between Organizational CRM and clinic performance, as well as a full mediator in the relationship between Technology CRM and clinic performance. These findings emphasize the importance of focusing on organizational management and CRM technology integration that supports customer retention to improve veterinary clinic performance. This study provides theoretical and practical contributions related to CRM implementation in the context of increasingly competitive animal health services.</jats:p>"

Обгрунтовано, що оцінка ефективності стратегії управління аграрним підприємством повинна врахувати наступних елементів: продуктивність праці (оцінка того, наскільки ефективно використовуються управлінські ресурси в процесі реалізації стратегії), економічна доцільність (визначення того, як витрати, що вкладаються в стратегію, співвідносяться з отриманими результатами), фінансова стабільність (стратегія повинна забезпечувати достатню фінансову стійкість, дозволяючи підприємству витримувати економічні труднощі, та ліквідність), адаптивність стратегії (оцінка того, наскільки стратегічні рішення здатні адаптуватися до змінних умов ринку, кліматичних або економічних факторів). Представлено результати розрахунку індексу ефективності стратегії управління досліджуваних аграрних підприємств Черкаської області та індексу їх економічної ефективності. Визначено, що при рекомендованому значенні індексу ефективності стратегії управління аграрними підприємствами більше 1 жодне з досліджуваних підприємств Черкаської області протягом 2019-2023 років не мало такого значення, що вказує на низьку ефективність стратегії управління, що впроваджувалася, суттєві недоліки у процесі її впровадження або недостатню адаптацію стратегії. Доведено, що розроблені показники можуть бути корисними для проведення оцінювання ефективності стратегії управління підприємствами, постійного моніторингу значень розроблених показників, як індикатору щодо необхідності коригування стратегії управління підприємствами.</jats:p>"

This study aims to explore the financial management challenges specific to small-scale theatre productions and develop a tailored financial planning framework to address these constraints and enhance competitiveness. The research employs a qualitative methodology, adopting a case study design focused on two prominent entities: ThreeSixty Theatre and Revolution Stage Studio. Data collection involves in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, analysis of financial records, and field observations to comprehensively understand the financial dynamics of alternative theatre productions. The findings reveal that financial management in small-scale theatre productions is significantly influenced by factors such as the availability of funding sources, the size and expertise of production teams, and the clarity of task scopes. Additionally, the effective use of celebrity actors and strategic promotional efforts were identified as critical elements for optimizing financial outcomes. This study underscores the importance of a structured financial planning framework tailored to the unique challenges of alternative theatres. By integrating factors such as resource allocation strategies, actor popularity, and promotional planning, alternative theatre productions can achieve greater financial stability and operational success. These insights provide valuable guidance for practitioners and stakeholders in the theatre industry seeking to navigate financial constraints while preserving artistic excellence.</jats:p>"

While substantial research has been conducted on its execution, studies specifically examining the management processes remain scarce. This study aims to investigate the management of the Driving School program at the senior high school level. Employing a phenomenological approach, the research was conducted at SMAN 5 Lubuklinggau, South Sumatera, Indonesia. The participants included the principal, vice principals, facilitator teachers, alumni, teaching staff, and school administrative personnel. Data were collected through interviews and analyzed using an interactive model for qualitative data. The findings revealed that effective management of the program involves a comprehensive approach encompassing planning, organizing, implementation, and evaluation. Key areas of focus include: 1) student management, from enrollment to graduation; 2) the professional development and performance of teaching and administrative staff; 3) infrastructure and facilities management; 4) financial management; 5) curriculum development; and 6) fostering community partnerships. The study suggests the establishment of a detailed procedural framework, such as Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), to guide future program implementation. Additionally, future research could explore the effectiveness of these management procedures in achieving the program's overarching objectives.</jats:p>"

The researcher aims to assess the green banking practices employed by commercial banks, examining the relationship between these practices and bank performance, and analyse the impact of green banking on the perceived performance of commercial banks. The study employs an analytical research design to analyze the variables associated with green banking practices. The population comprises bankers from financial institutions across Chitwan, with a sample of 189 respondents selected through purposive sampling. Statistical tools were used to analyze the relationships between independent variables (employee-related practices, daily operation practices, customer-related practices, and bank policy-related practices) and the dependent variable (bank's environmental performance). The results showed that commercial banks in Chitwan generally have a positive view of their sustainability practices, with bank policy-relatedpractices showing the highest positive perception among employees. The study also found a positive correlation between green banking practices and environmental performance, with bank policy-related practices having the strongest relationship and customer-related practices the weakest. The study underscores the importance ofstrategic policy implementation and employee involvement in promoting sustainability within the banking sector.</jats:p>"

The government has introduced Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure sustainability. This study aimed to assess BMP knowledge and adoption among Sri Lankan shrimp farmers while identifying socio-demographic and behavioral factors influencing them, which have not been previously assessed. Data were gathered from 131 shrimp farmers in Puttalam district in Sri Lanka through a questionnaire survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics and ordered logistic regressions. The results showed that 26% of farmers had poor BMP knowledge, while 37% each had fair and good knowledge. Regarding adoption, 2% exhibited poor, 89% fair, and 9% good BMP adoption. According to the ordered logistic regression results, BMP training (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01), education (<jats:italic>p &lt;</jats:italic> 0.05), and workforce (<jats:italic>p &lt;</jats:italic> 0.05) significantly affect the knowledge level of BMPs. In contrast, age (<jats:italic>p &lt;</jats:italic> 0.05), experience (<jats:italic>p &lt;</jats:italic> 0.05), income share (<jats:italic>p &lt;</jats:italic> 0.1), and risk preference (<jats:italic>p &lt;</jats:italic> 0.1) significantly affect the adoption of BMPs. It is recommended to provide more BMP training to shrimp farmers, to improve their knowledge. Moreover, considering socioeconomic and behavioral factors is crucial when designing policies and interventions to promote BMP adoption.</jats:p>"

As a result, introducing low carbon sustainable concrete designs without compromising performance has become one of the greatest challenges over the last few decades. This complexity was majorly caused by heterogeneity of concrete due to the existence of cementitious particles, fibers, or fine filler materials. Further, this multi-scale material heterogeneity of concrete influences the performance of concrete at macro levels and makes it more complicated to understand the hydration behaviors. Macroscale trial and error-based mechanical property testing might not always be the feasible way to find the optimum mix designs, because those techniques cannot quantify the root cause relationship to the microstructure. Therefore, microscale quantitative chemical and mechanical characterizations pave the way for cement to upscale strength from microlevel to structural level using strength homogenization, revealing the compositional characteristics which contributed to the strength variation in any novel cement mix. Since microphase identification is crucial to achieve that task, in this study, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) together with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to quantify the hydration of an ultra-high-performance cement paste at microlevel. The image analysis is carried out using the mapping data collected from four different locations of the same cement batch, and the accuracy of the hydration quantification is compared with an independent analytical hydration simulation software, Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory (VCCTL) by NIST.</jats:p>"

Although the assessment of the negative effects of anti-competitive practices is of particular interest to competition authorities in order to justify state intervention in the economy through competition policy, the debate on the effectiveness of competition policy does not stop. In order to analyse the impact of anti-competitive practices, the financial market has been structured starting from the consumer. Traditional methods of assessing the impact of anti-competitive practices often reduce consumer welfare to consumer surplus. For a complete analysis of the impact of anti-competitive practices on consumer welfare, the assessment of the change in consumer surplus is insufficient, because competition is not only manifested in price and quantity, but also in quality, innovation and variety. As a result of the research carried out, a methodology is proposed for assessing the impact of anti-competitive practices on consumer welfare in financial markets.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is urgent to establish proper management tools in order to support or-ganizations' top management in addressing these goals. While larger firms are making progress in measuring, managing and reporting sustainability performance, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind for various reasons – such as the lack of regulatory frameworks, standards, managerial competence and more. In OECD countries, SMEs account for 40% of private sector GDP. As such, their relevance and role in pursuing sustainability cannot be overlooked. This research aims to advance understanding of the development and implemen-tation of performance measurement and management (PMM) systems taking into account the sustainability dimensions of performance in SMEs. This is key to al-lowing businesses and their management to measure and monitor their impact at the economic, social and environmental levels. In order to do this, the research is based on action research and the incorporation of an interventionist approach. In particular, the authors have developed a sus-tainability PMM for a medium citrus company operating in the B-to-B market and based in Southern Italy.</jats:p>"

The reflection on improving the governance of Basic Health Coverage (BHC) in Morocco leads us to analyze successful solutions that have been implemented in other countries. Objectives: This study aimed to make an international benchmark of BHC’s governance models and look for good practices in other countries in order to study the possibility of their implementation at the Moroccan level. Methods: We benchmarked BHC's governance models by determining the criteria for selecting the benchmark countries. We have selected five countries, namely: Turkey, Malaysia, France, Chile, Rwanda. We analyzed governance models based on the five dimensions of the World Bank study \"Governing Mandatory Health Insurance: Learning from Experience\", which are: Coherence of the decision-making structure, stakeholder involvement, transparency and access to information, supervision and regulation, coherence and stability. Results: Our analysis based on the five dimensions showed that there are relative common factors with the governance model between the benchmark countries that allowed them to achieve universal health coverage, however, each country has introduced innovative rules and solutions adapted to its context and constraints. There are several good governance practices that we have drawn from this benchmark. Morocco can use these good practices to improve its governance model for BHC. An adaptation effort is necessary, taking into consideration the existing situation. Discussion: There is not a governance model suitable for all countries. Each country is trying to find a formula that will allow it to overcome its challenges. Morocco can draw inspiration from these models to instaure good practices to adopt, but this cannot happen without repositioning the governance of health coverage in the government's strategic vision in relation to the social protection agenda and the objectives of the health system. Conclusion: Improved governance has a direct impact on the performance of the basic health coverage system. In this sense, Morocco must take this aspect into consideration in the process of achieving universal health coverage as many other countries that have made this great step forward.</jats:p>"

The chapter aims to identify the challenges, outline best practices in citizen co-creation based on the results of selected EU H2020 projects, and provide future research directions. Best practices are analysed in three phases. (1) <jats:italic>Recruitment Phase</jats:italic>: The first phase of engagement encompasses all the moments in which potential users are exposed to information that is relevant to participating in a specific project or programme until the moment in which they sign up. Core success factors for the set-up of a promising recruitment phase will be outlined. (2) <jats:italic>Consumer Response Phase</jats:italic>: In the second consumer response phase, strategies are directed at initiating and consolidating responses to innovative net-zero projects. This phase starts with the user’s own acts of planning and reflecting on how best to integrate existing into changing and rearranging urban and domestic living perceptions. (3) <jats:italic>Persistence Phase:</jats:italic> In the third phase (i.e., persistence), engagement strategies seek to maintain interest and continuous involvement in programmes. By prolonging interest and interaction over time, the goal of this phase is to ensure that participation remains sufficiently interesting and comfortable for users, transferring them to ambassadors and multipliers for innovative solutions. The chapter provides a co-creation framework with project insight-based best practice recommendations and proposes a clustering of stakeholders according to a quintuple helix approach and a stepwise phase approach towards the set-up of net-zero built environment projects.</jats:p>"

A critical component of the management and containment of these viral diseases in grapevine is both the identification of infected vines and the characterization of new pathogens. Next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, i.e., HTS technologies, have been widely adopted for their ability to quickly, broadly and directly characterize molecular sequences associated with potential pathogens. We empirically analyze the performance of HTS as a diagnostic tool in a phytosanitary context and make recommendations on its deployment for detecting known and novel viruses in grapevine. Three popular and widely used modalities for analyzing HTS data are characterized and compared using the standard diagnostic performance criteria of sensitivity (the true positive rate), specificity (the true negative rate) and analytical sensitivity (dilution series).</jats:p>"

The study used panel and correlational designs in investigating the effect of ERM Practices measured by strategy and operations objectives of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisation (COSO) on the financial performance of insurance firms measured by Tobin’s Q. Secondary data obtained from the annual financial statements of the insurance firms for the periods of 2018-2022 were used in the analysis. The study used panel data regression model to estimate the relationship. The findings revealed the existence of a positive significant effect of strategic objectives on the financial performance of insurance firms in Nigeria. However, a negative significant effect of operational objective on the financial performance of insurance firms in Nigeria was documented. The study recommended that insurance firms in Nigeria should continue to ensure full conformity to the provision of COSO components while carrying out their business operation. They should also re-strategize and monitor their financial performance outcomes in line with their established objectives in order to attain the holistic application of ERM strategic objectives in the overall business operations.</jats:p>"

This study explores how the psychological distance between evaluators and those evaluated in a Smart Work environment influences assessments, centering around Construal Level Theory. The findings reveal that Smart Work increases the psychological distance for evaluators, thereby elevating their level of construal and leading to outcome-focused thinking. In contrast, traditional work methods keep psychological distance relatively closer, fostering process-oriented thinking. This research highlights the crucial role of psychological distance in shaping evaluation strategies in workplaces and offers valuable insights for organizations aiming to effectively integrate Smart Work practices. This exploration not only contributes to our understanding of Smart Work's organizational and psychological dynamics but also suggests implications for performance management systems in contemporary work environments.</p>"

This study aims to assess the effect of time management practices on the performance of building project delivery in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria. The study focused on planning, scheduling, and monitoring and evaluation as project time management practices. A survey research design which involves the use of structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The study obtained a sample size of 208 construction professionals from a population of 433 registered construction professional members in the study area, the selection of the participants was based on stratified random sampling technique. The data collected were analysed using multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed that there is a positive effect of time management practices on performance of building project delivery. Planning and scheduling have insignificant positive effects on performance of building project delivery while monitoring and evaluation has significant positive effect on performance of building project delivery. The study revealed that time management practices could predict 33.9% of the variations in the performance of building project delivery in Akure, Ondo State. The study concludes that time management practices have positive effects on the performance of building project delivery in the study area. Monitoring and evaluation is the major predictor of building project delivery performance. Hence, this study recommends that construction professionals should improve planning and scheduling of building project and give more attention to monitoring and evaluation of building project, so as to enhance the performance of building project delivery. Also, government and construction professional bodies should organize seminars and workshop for construction professionals to educate them on the importance of time management practices.\r\n </jats:p>"

Adopting best crop management practices (BCMPs) is crucial to enhancing production and meeting the supply demands of contracting firms. Understanding the factors influencing farmers' decisions is key to successfully implementing strategies that promote BCMP adoption. This study explored the effects of farmers' perceptions of contract farming arrangement (CFA) effectiveness on sugarcane BCMP adoption, using survey data from 400 farmers in Tanzania. The results from both a multivariate probit model (for specific practices) and ordinal regression (for adoption intensity) revealed positive effects. In particular, the perceived effectiveness of pricing and payment systems and produce supply management had a stronger influence on BCMP adoption than resource support and extension service provision. These findings suggest that efforts to improve BCMP adoption among sugarcane contract farmers should not only focus on enhancing production capabilities through input, credit, and technical support packages but also emphasize the creation of robust incentive structures. Ensuring fair pricing, timely payments, and compliance with contract terms—alongside mechanisms to mitigate farmer loss risks—would significantly enhance BCMP adoption rates.</jats:p>"

The results of the research are changes in attitudes, behavior, and better and positive responsibilities of policy stakeholders in the Mentality Approach category, aspects of the function and organizational structure of implementing waste management policies in each Kelurahan spread across the Rimbo Tengah and Market sub-districts are quite good in the System Approach category, and in the aspect of synergy must be able to build synergy in institutional aspects, program policies and budgeting, human resources, information data and monitoring and evaluation strategies for policies and programs. As for the symbiotic mutualism aspect, it must be based on the principles of mutual need, mutual benefit, and mutual support. From this approach, it can be analyzed that the strategic partnership aspect is still not going well in the Networking Approach aspect.</jats:p>"

After-sales emerges as an essential pillar to guarantee loyalty, going beyond simple\ncustomer satisfaction. This article explores the implementation of after-sales excellence, highlighting strategies\nand practices that strengthen the company-consumer relationship in a \"one-to-one\" model.\nHistorical analysis reveals how technological advances and the evolution of marketing have shaped the industry.\nFrom the mass production model of Taylor and Ford, to Japan's flexible, technological approach of the 1970s, a\nfocus on efficiency and meeting consumer demands has become central. The introduction of marketing in the\n1950s marked a new era, using tools and advertising campaigns to understand and capture the customer's spirit,\nensuring loyalty and building value.\nFrom the 1980s onwards, marketing redirected efforts towards after-sales, prioritizing a personalized and lasting\nrelationship. Innovative strategies, such as the intensive use of technology and the creation of direct\ncommunication channels, have consolidated after-sales as an essential tool for differentiating brands in saturated\nmarkets. This study also addresses the importance of integration between sectors, such as sales and after-sales,\nto avoid failures in the consumption cycle.\nConclusion: History demonstrates the relevance of integrated communication between production, sales and\nconsumption for building solid relationships with customers. This article analyzes the evolution of after-sales as\na strategic tool, linked to marketing and technological advances, highlighting the importance of balancing\ninnovation and personalization.\nAfter-sales, strengthened by investments in information and communication technologies, such as Big Data,\nbecomes essential to understand and meet consumer demands. However, relying exclusively on technological solutions neglects the human element, which is essential in building lasting connections.</jats:p>"

Indonesia, with its vast forest resources, has the potential to significantly contribute to global carbon reduction efforts. However, challenges such as deforestation and forest degradation persist, particularly in regions like Central Kalimantan. This study explores the potential of a jurisdictional approach to REDD+ in Central Kalimantan, which focuses on multi-level collaboration, local government involvement, performance-based incentives, and effective monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). By empowering local communities and aligning with national and international policies, this approach aims to achieve sustainable forest management and carbon emission reduction. This research delves into the key steps involved in implementing a jurisdictional REDD+ approach, including planning, stakeholder engagement, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and scalability. It highlights the importance of addressing social and economic factors alongside environmental considerations to ensure the long-term success of REDD+ initiatives. By adopting a jurisdictional approach and addressing the complex interplay between environmental, social, and economic factors, Central Kalimantan can position itself as a leader in sustainable forest management and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation efforts.</jats:p>"

This narrative review explores practical and advanced approaches for controlling bleeding in dentoalveolar procedures, with a focus on patient-centered strategies that minimize risk while accommodating complex clinical needs. Based on this narriative review, Beginning with an overview of the pathophysiology of bleeding in the oral cavity, the review examines conventional methods such as mechanical compression, sutures, and the use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors. Further, it evaluates the application of pharmacological agents, including topical hemostatic products like gelatin sponges, oxidized cellulose, and tranexamic acid, which have shown efficacy in high-risk patients without disrupting systemic anticoagulation therapy. For special populations, including those with congenital coagulopathies and liver disease, tailored approaches are reviewed to address unique bleeding challenges. Additionally, innovative hemostatic materials and laser-assisted techniques are discussed as emerging options that promise enhanced safety and effectiveness in complex cases. By synthesizing current knowledge on bleeding control methods, this review provides clinicians with practical guidance for optimizing hemostasis in dentoalveolar surgery. The insights and recommendations presented aim to improve patient outcomes, reduce perioperative complications, and support a balanced approach to local and systemic hemostatic management in diverse patient groups.</jats:p>"

Primary and secondary hospitals often face different challenges due to infrastructure, resources, and waste volume variations. This study evaluates healthcare waste management practices and identifies associated problems in primary and secondary hospitals in Mianwali. Objective: To evaluate the healthcare waste management practices in primary and secondary hospitals in Mianwali. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in public hospitals of Mianwali. About 112 participants, including staff from primary (59) and secondary (53) hospitals, were selected through simple random sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and quantitative observations. Key areas assessed included waste segregation, storage, transportation, treatment methods, staff training, and compliance with regulations. Results: Primary hospitals demonstrated higher compliance with segregation practices (80% using color-coded bins) compared to secondary hospitals (70%). However, secondary hospitals had more frequent training sessions (93% of staff trained) and generated higher volumes of hazardous waste (20% compared to 15% in primary hospitals). Challenges reported included a lack of resources (70-75%), inadequate infrastructure (11.7-5%), and insufficient enforcement of regulations. Significant gaps were observed in the disposal of pathological, cytotoxic, and liquid waste, with secondary hospitals more likely to use outdated incineration methods (85% vs. 60%). Conclusion: The study highlights disparities in healthcare waste management practices between primary and secondary hospitals. While primary hospitals excel in segregation compliance, secondary hospitals face challenges in resource allocation and infrastructure. Addressing these issues requires targeted training programs, stricter enforcement of regulations, and investment in modern waste treatment technologies.</jats:p>"

The drug discovery with rapid screening turnovers and innovative approaches demands infrastructure expansion by increasing several other capabilities in vivarium. The strategic portfolio changes  and therapeutic areas closure retained several high-end equipment’s left unused that eventually occupied  space in the barrier system which intricate daily operations and space management became challenging  over the period. The vivarium facility was under continuous improvement by the quality assurance program  based on monthly independent audit reports and compiled the compliance including animal welfare  standards of at least 5 years period. Corporate initiatives such as Kaizen events, 5S concepts, Gemba walk  and green labs certifications were implemented systematically at various phases across the organization  including vivarium. The leadership team was a driving force behind the lean management practices and its  implementation. The quality assurance program was able to bring out several improved operational  processes notably by creating an additional quarantine space; repurposing high-end equipment for other  investigators to support their ongoing programs; effective space utilization by creating in-house diagnostic  laboratory; donating low-density animal racks for academic institutions as part of educational outreach  efforts; containment of solid radioactive waste disposal by compaction process for longer half-life  radioisotopes. In conclusion, lean management practices collectively demonstrated a measurable  outcome in terms of continuous process improvement, effective vivarium management by ensuring  compliance based on periodical observations without compromising animal welfare, conservation of  energy and resources, effective space utilization and systematic implementation of 5S concepts by  repurposing of equipment to other laboratories. Overall, the system-driven process has improved the  standards with better performance that eventually enhanced the quality and productivity at the laboratory  animal facility </jats:p>"

The questionnaire used a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6. Respondents were selected through purposive sampling, targeting officials or staff managing state finances in the Working Unit of the Bureau for General Affairs and Procurement Goods/Service of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of Indonesia. The final sample consisted of 32 observations and was analyzed using SmartPLS 3.0.\nResults: The study found that Employee competency positively impacts budget implementation performance in state financial management. However, budget planning and ERP-based information systems did not significantly influence budget implementation performance.\nLimitations: The sample size of the study was limited because of the limited time for data collection. Furthermore, the study focused solely on officials responsible for managing state finances, excluding Budget Planners and Procurement Officers, who also played a vital role in the budget process.  \nContribution: This study provides valuable insights for future studies and serves as a reference for improving government performance. It also offers practical recommendations for decision makers.\nNovelty: This study introduces new indicators based on current regulations, focusing on ERP-based systems in Indonesia's public sector. The SAKTI system, an ERP-based budget implementation tool, was fully implemented across all Ministries/Agencies in Indonesia by 2022, making this study particularly timely.</jats:p>"

This article aims to provide practical guidelines for SMEs, by investigating the most critical construction management practices adopted by SME contractors. Utilising a quantitative approach, data were collected from 59 purposefully selected participants, including directors, construction managers, quantity surveyors, site agents, and technicians, all registered under the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Grades 1-4 in General Building (GB). The management practices of SME contractors were analysed using the relative importance index (RII) and factor analysis to rank these practices according to their significance. Findings indicate that SME contractors prioritise health and safety strategies, effective resource utilisation, integrated project management systems, competent recruitment, strong leadership skills, and robust health and safety management as essential practices. The principal component analysis identified six key management factors to enhance competitiveness while contributing to the region’s sustainable development goals. These factors include shared knowledge among management, effective project scope planning, comprehensive health and safety management, ownership of construction business knowledge, scope control on projects, and clearly defined goals for management teams. This study is original in its focus on the specific management practices that can strengthen the sustainability of SME contractors within a developing region, providing a valuable framework for enhancing their operational effectiveness.</jats:p>"

Over the past decade, this integration has attracted significant attention in both academic and industrial discourse. Despite the increasing recognition of the benefits of green logistics practices (GLPs), only a few firms have implemented green-oriented or sustainable logistics practices; hence, a comprehensive understanding of what could drive its implementation as well as how and when firms can benefit from GLPs is of key importance for theory, policy and practice. Drawing on dual theoretical lenses, this study investigated how supply chain ethical leadership (SCEL) could stimulate green logistics practices by building green core competencies (GCC) under varying conditions of corporate green culture (CGC).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>An integrated model motivated by social learning and contingency theories was tested using responses from 208 managers of logistics firms in Ghana.

This further implies that building ethical leadership and competencies alone may not be sufficient to drive superior emission reduction and subsequent sustainability; rather, cultivating a green-oriented culture that values sustainable logistics is crucial to fully realize the potential of ethical leadership and competencies in enabling the implementation of GLPs and subsequently enhancing carbon-neutral SCP.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The novelty of the present study lies in the integration of social learning and contingency theories to unearth the mechanism and conditional roles of green competence and green culture in optimizing the SCEL–GLPs–GLP relationship.

While prior studies have shown that high status enables employees to perform well, we emphasize that it may also elevate role expectations, which then become hard to meet. Building on expectation confirmation theory, we argue especially that high‐status employees may be less rewarded for their performance because high expectations of them have been established. Although low‐status employees are less likely to perform well, they receive greater rewards on attaining success, suggesting a potential advantage to being disadvantaged ex ante. Moreover, while prior literature highlights various benefits of having prestigious peers, we maintain that the presence of high‐status teammates also raises expectations of teamwork. As such, employees will be less rewarded for team performance when they work with high‐status teammates. We test our hypotheses in a sample of NBA players and find general support. Our findings highlight employees’ status as a potential liability in performance evaluation.</jats:p>"

The aim is to critically assess the effectiveness of U.S. governance mechanisms, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and internal controls, in fostering transparency and accountability within organizations. A qualitative approach was used, analyzing relevant case studies, legislation, and scholarly articles to examine both successes and failures in fraud prevention. Key findings reveal that while the U.S. model provides valuable tools for combating fraud, its applicability in other regions is influenced by cultural, economic, and regulatory differences. The paper highlights the challenges of applying U.S. governance standards globally and calls for a more adaptable, context-sensitive approach. The implications of this study suggest that for corporate governance frameworks to be effective internationally, there is a need for greater global cooperation and the development of harmonized standards that balance local and global expectations. Finally, the paper proposes directions for future research to examine the evolving relationship between emerging technologies, cultural factors, and corporate governance in the fight against fraud and unethical practices.</jats:p>"

Properly managing these wastes is essential for preventing the spread of diseases caused by infectious agents from these wastes and reducing environmental pollution. Nevertheless, despite the available regulations and guidelines, many hospitals around the world have poor waste management due to infrastructure, financial, and educational challenges. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the types and classes of BMW, current means of disposal and treatment, and the regulatory board of BMW management and new attitudes, which are promising opportunities for waste management. The latter includes technological innovations, such as automation and new waste disposal and treatment methods that are environmentally friendly. However, despite extensive experience in BMW management, the problem is still relevant. The future of BMW in hospitals is to integrate sustainable methods and new technologies and improve regulatory authority enforcement.</jats:p>"

One of the effective methods for reducing stormwater volume and managing urban floods is the low-impact development best management practice (LID-BMP). This study aims to mitigate flood volume and peak discharge caused by land use changes in the Darabad basin located in Tehran, Iran, using LID-BMPs. For this purpose, land use maps were extracted for a period of 23 years from 2000 to 2022 using Landsat satellite images. Then, by using a combination of geographic information system-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) method and spatial criteria, four types of LID-BMPs, including bioretention basin, green roof, grass swale, and porous pavement, were located in the study area. Next, rainfall–runoff modeling was applied to calculate the changes in the mentioned criteria due to land use changes and the application of LID-BMPs in the area using soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method. The simulation results showed that the rise in built-up land use from 43.49 to 56.51 percent between the period has increased the flood volume and peak discharge of 25-year return period by approximately 60 percent. The simulation results also indicated that the combined use of the four selected types of LID-BMPs will lead to a greater decrease in stormwater volume and peak discharge. According to the results, LID-BMPs perform better in shorter return periods in a way that the average percentage of flood volume and peak discharge reduction in a 2-year return period were 36.75 and 34.96 percent, while they were 31.37 and 26.5 percent in a 100-year return period.</jats:p>"

A conceptual model structured with six hypotheses that are tested through articulated study, the study with an empirical approach is developed and applied to 350 questionnaires of middle‐level managers in Bangalore city and rural areas. The results of the study indicate that GKS has a significant impact on SBP and SCA. While GOC plays an insignificant moderator role on the relationship between GKS and SBP. In contrast, GI plays a positive mediation impact on the relationship between GKS with SBP and SCA. In addition, GS has a positive impact on SCA.</jats:p>"

Although MSMEs have great potential to improve the economy and absorb labor, various obstacles such as low product quality, limited human resources and technology still hamper development. This study aims to determine and analyze the effect of the implementation of Total Quality Management on the quality competitiveness and improvement of operational performance of MSMEs in Makassar City. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with validity testing through normality and reliability tests. The results of the study indicate that the implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) has a positive and significant effect on the quality competitiveness of MSMEs in Makassar City. TQM improves product quality, makes MSMEs more competitive in the market, and helps manage the production process more efficiently, reduces errors, and increases customer satisfaction. Although TQM also has a positive impact on operational performance, its effect is not significant, indicating that other elements such as human resources, technology, and the business environment also influence. Overall, TQM contributes to improving operational performance through quality competitiveness and operational efficiency. The output produced from this study is in the form of scientific publications. Theoretically, it becomes a theoretical basis for quality management practices, quality competitiveness and improving operational performance in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in Makassar City.</jats:p>"

Consequently, there is a gap in the market for a delivery system that can provide a treatment for this disorder. The present study is based on the objective to develop dual release bilayer tablet designed by BBD approach. The bilayer tablet contained an immediate release layer of paracetamol and a sustained release layer of thiocolchicoside. The optimization of the bilayer tablet was done using a three-level, three-factor Box-Behnken design. A total of thirteen formulations of paracetamol and thiocolchicoside were developed based on the design composition of paracetamol, sodium starch glycolate and sodium bicarbonate for the IR layer and thiocolchicoside, HPMC and magnesium stearate for the SR layer respectively. The developed dual release layers were compressed to form a bilayer tablet. The initial characterization and drug-excipient interaction studies were performed initially using infra-red (IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies (XRD). Formulations showing good micrometric properties, disintegration and drug release, were selected for final compression of bilayer tablets. Formulation F13 showed the fastest drug release (91.34%) at 60 minutes and quick disintegration time (97 s). The sustained release thiocolchicoside tablet layer (F11-F13) had a hardness that varied from 4.05 to 4.90kg/cm2. Formulation F5 had the highest hardness, whereas F6 showed the lowest hardness. The sustained release layer showing 98.21% of drug release after 10 hours was selected for the compression to bilayer tablet. The developed dual layer tablets were investigated for quality parameters like hardness, percentage friability, weight variation, disintegration and dissolution. A high level of patient compliance is ensured through the current design as the patient does not need to get out of bed at night to take the medication.</jats:p>"

Effective collaboration stands out as a pivotal element for the success of new product development (NPD). There are a variety of control mechanisms applied to mitigate uncertainty and foster cooperation. Despite the importance of these controls, the interplay between formal and informal management controls in NPD has been underexplored in prior research. The goal of this study is to validate the relationship between formal and informal control in a new product development scenario, responding to the debate about whether there is a substitution effect or a complementary effect between the two. This study addresses this gap by initially employing ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to examine the role of each management control. Subsequently, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is employed to identify strategies for achieving high NPD performance in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The results from the OLS analysis demonstrate that all forms of management control, especially trust, are effective in the improvement of NPD performance, while the results from fsQCA confirm that there is a complementary effect between formal and informal control, suggesting that informal control cannot function well without formal control. This research illuminates the synergistic dynamics of management controls within an open innovation context and emphasizes the importance of integrating both formal and informal controls to optimize NPD performance.</jats:p>"

In line with this terminology, the numerous DFT benchmark studies might be considered the “safari” of DFT evaluation efforts, reflecting their abundance, diversity, and wide range of application and methodological aspects. These benchmarks have played a critical role in establishing DFT as the dominant approach in quantum chemical applications and remain essential for selecting an appropriate DFT method for specific chemical properties (e.g., reaction energy, barrier height, or noncovalent interaction energy) and systems (e.g., organic, inorganic, or organometallic). DFT benchmark studies are a vital tool for both DFT users in method selection and DFT developers in method design and parameterization. This review provides best‐practice guidance on key methodological aspects of DFT benchmarking, such as the quality of benchmark reference values, dataset size, reference geometries, basis sets, statistical analysis, and electronic availability of the benchmark data. Additionally, we present a flowchart to assist users in systematically choosing these methodological aspects, thereby enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of DFT benchmarking studies.</jats:p>"

The findings suggest that investors can under/overreact compared to post-election sectors performance, the public services sector being the exception.

We note two antecedent conditions to support new ways of working. First, hybrid managers, who combine professional and organizational perspectives, act as a conduit for implementation of new ways of working through supporting implementation of high performance work practices (HPWPs). Second, the financial context faced by social care providers influences whether new ways of working, and HPWPs associated with this, aim to improve productivity, or enhance capability and commitment of social workers. We identify three HPWPs that support the new way of working because they align with professional identity of social workers. First, hybrid manager jobs were designed to afford opportunity for recruitment of appropriately able social workers to enact strategic influence over SBP implementation. Second, intervention to support peer‐to‐peer learning enhanced the ability of social workers to deliver SBP, and also motivated social workers toward SBP implementation because they retained professional autonomy in developing their practice. Third, performance management intervention was developmental rather than judgmental, designed to enhance ability of social workers to deliver SBP. Similar to the peer learning intervention, it remained within control of social workers, hence motivated them to engage with SBP.</jats:p>"

Those banks are described as Systemically Important Banks (SIBs). This group consists of the two main reputed public sector commercial banks which have been targeted in this study. However, the ineffective implementation of the Human Resource Management function of public sector Commercial banks has been a continuing issue within the Sri Lankan context. The current study examines how the perceived organizational performance of public sector commercial banks is linked with human resource management practices namely, Recruitment and Selection, Training and development, Performance Appraisal, Rewards management, Employee retention, and Employee relations which provides a solution for the problem of relatively low performance of state commercial banks in Sri Lanka compared to employee base. The study was quantitative and the survey method was applied for data collection. A structured questionnaire was distributed using simple random sampling and 158 clear and completed responses were returned representing a population of 750 managerial employees within two public sector commercial banks of Northwestern Province of Sri Lanka. The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0. The methods used in the analysis of this study involved simple descriptive analysis, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. The findings concluded a significant positive relationship of perceived organizational performance with recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal, rewards management, employee retention and employee relations.</jats:p>"

Consequently, sports shoes have become a necessary requirement in this situation. This paper explores the preference for sports shoes among Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) students. This study aims to analyse the attributes or important criteria that influence their choices and how much influence these factors have on students’ preferences in sports shoe selection. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was employed to evaluate the important factors and alternatives and identify the criteria and alternatives that best represent the preferences of UUM students. The four key criteria examined were price, comfort, design, and brand loyalty, with the three alternatives being Nike, Adidas, and Skechers. The results indicated that design is the most influential factor, followed by price, comfort, and brand loyalty. Among the brands, UUM students preferred Adidas, while Skechers was the least favoured. This study significantly enhances our understanding of the factors influencing UUM students’ sports shoes selection preferences, providing insight for better catering to the needs of this demographic.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to investigate the effect of recruitment practices on employee performance in public universities in Nyanza region, Kenya. The target population comprised of 3,129 individuals, and the sample size of 355 teaching and non-teaching staff were determined using the Yamane formula, employing random sampling techniques for data collection. A structured questionnaire was utilized as the primary data collection tool in a quantitative research design. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for each scale in the questionnaire. Data analysis was conducted using both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics with the aid of SPSS version 23. To ensure reliability, the results were as follows: recruitment practices have a significant positive effect on employee performance ((β = 0.165, p&lt;0.05). The study concluded that recruitment practices have a significant positive effect on employee performance. The study recommended that hiring decisions in universities should always be made on the basis of a person’s potential to do a job.  The study recommended that hiring decisions in universities should be made on the basis of a person’s potential to do a job. The recruitment process should continue to be done in a transparent manner and the recruitment processes in the universities should keep on being improved to enhance employee satisfaction. The employee selection process should always be done in an ethical manner and in a manner that is fair.</jats:p>"

Malaysia faces various issues and challenges in developing e-Government, including organizational performance weaknesses. Therefore, empirical studies are important to demonstrate the impact of eGovernment on the performance of the public sector holistically and comprehensively, which is greatlyneeded to serve as input in efforts to improve the quality of e-Government. This study explores the literature on e-Government and organizational performance to see the extent of e-Government's contribution to the performance of the local government sector. To fill the research gap, an empirical study using quantitative research methods was conducted on local government in Malaysia. A total of 149 questionnaires were distributed to Local Authorities in Malaysia, and 87 questionnaires were returned. Then, the data were analysed using descriptive methodology and an inferential statistical approach. The study findings indicate that the implementation of e-Government does not have a significant impact on organizational performance. The difference results may be attributes to variationsin the e-Government development index between developed and developing countries. Additional factors such as the difference acceptance level and challenges in implementation may further affect the outcomes. Therefore, the study's findings conclude that the direct relationship is not significant. It is possible that other intermediate factors or variables exist within the relationship, which could allow for the study to be tested indirectly.</jats:p>"

This study is an initial step to examine the factors that can influence the sustainable performance of village-owned enterprises. Based on previous literature and applicable regulations in Indonesia, this study suggests examining the impact of transformational leadership, organizational capability, good governance, and innovation on the sustainable performance of village-owned enterprises. This study also suggests exploring in-depth the measurement of sustainable performance in two dimensions, financial and social. Furthermore, for the future, measuring the good governance of village-owned enterprises can refer to the principles established in the regulations.</jats:p>"

When it comes to optimizing energy performance and indoor climate, a paradox often exists. This paradox becomes even more challenging in the context of educational buildings, where it can be difficult to achieve both optimal indoor climate and passive house standards due to potential negative impacts on energy performance, particularly with regard to energy use for cooling. In this study, energy performance and indoor climate are assessed in a pilot project (the school project: one of Norway’s most environmentally friendly schools). The connection between energy supply solutions, building envelope, and technical details will be elucidated. The study underscores the importance of post-occupancy evaluation to compare a building’s projected performance with its actual outcomes. This process helps identify gaps and discrepancies, allowing for adjustments to meet intended energy efficiency and environmental goals. This paper is partly based on a bachelor’s project by three bachelor’s students from Oslo Metropolitan University.</jats:p>"

The quantitative technique was employed, and convenient random sampling was used to determine 50 respondents. An adapted research survey questionnaire was used to gather data. Frequency, percentage, weighted mean, standard deviation, chi-square, and correlation coefficient were used. The findings revealed that the participants perceived themselves as having a \"moderate\" level of essential best practices of inclusive education and having a \"moderate\" implementation of inclusive education. Furthermore, results revealed no significant relationship between the level of essential best practices in inclusive education and its profile as to age and gender, teaching position, number of years in service, number of LSENs in class, and number of special/inclusive education trainings attended. There was no significant relationship between implementation of inclusive education as to age and gender, number of years in service, number of LSENs in class, number of special/inclusive education training attended, and number of hours in special/inclusive education training attended.  It is concluded that essential best practices of inclusive education have influenced inclusive school practice.  To address the issue, an action plan was formulated for implementation.</jats:p>"

A sustainable safety culture combines principles in favor of protecting the health and lives of workers with sustainable development principles, while improving operational and environmental performance. The aim of this study was to identify best practices, challenges, and strategies for implementing this type of culture in manufacturing companies. A mixed-methods approach was used, including quantitative surveys, in-depth interviews, case study analysis, and field observations at selected companies. This research was conducted at two food companies from Poland. The findings indicate that the successful implementation of a sustainable safety culture relies on strong leadership, employee engagement, pro-active risk management, and continuous process improvement. Additionally, this article discusses major challenges, such as resistance to change, financial constraints, and regulatory complexity. Ultimately, this article provides practical recommendations for industry leaders developed from the research findings to support long-term efficiency and safety in manufacturing organizations.</jats:p>"

The focus is on the planning, implementation, and evaluation processes within the learning management framework, highlighting challenges and strategies for improvement. The research employs a qualitative approach using a case study method. Data were collected through interviews, observations, and document analysis to gain insights into the PAI learning management practices and their outcomes. The findings indicate that the management of PAI at SDIT Al-Munawwar is effectively conducted. Planning involves structured lesson plans integrating Islamic values into the curriculum. Implementation is characterized by the use of innovative pedagogical methods, including project-based and problem-based learning, enhanced by digital technologies. These approaches have significantly improved student engagement and comprehension. Comprehensive evaluation strategies, including both formative and summative assessments, effectively address cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. Despite its strengths, the school faces challenges in adapting to educational technologies and enhancing teacher competencies. To overcome these issues, SDIT Al-Munawwar has initiated ongoing teacher training programs and fostered collaboration between the school, families, and the broader community. The study underscores the importance of integrated and innovative learning management in PAI education. While significant progress has been made, continued efforts in professional development and technological adaptation are essential for sustained success.</jats:p>"

The research seeks to offer insights into the way in which these financial practices interact and impact on performance in organizations, with the objective of helping to improve the efficiency and sustainability of organisations. Quantitative research design was used, where data were collected through survey questionnaires from managers and financial experts in organizations. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to the analysis of the data to test hypothesized relationships among the variables. Findings show that financial strategies, risk management and budgetary controls have critical and positive influence on the performance of the organizations. We also found that financial decision-making mediated the relationships between these financial practices and performance, and that sound decision making is critical for realizing the benefits of financial strategies and risk management. The results of the study emphasize the need for harmonizing of robust financial strategies and smart risk management frameworks to improve organizational resilience and performance.</jats:p>"

The problem-solving abilities of those foundational models have been a direction of improvement for many different STEM fields, including mathematics and physics, and has been witnessing significant breakthroughs. We have been working on a multitude of ways to advance space engineering, and one promising direction is the application of LLMs and foundational models. To understand the full potential of LLMs in astrodynamics, we have developed the first Astrodynamics Problems Benchmark (APBench) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this field. We crafted for the first time a collection of questions and answers that range a wide variety of subfields in astrodynamics, astronautics, and space engineering. On top of this first dataset built for space engineering, we evaluate the performance of foundational models, both open source models and closed ones, to validate their current capabilities in space engineering, and paving the road for further advancements towards a definition of intelligence for space.</p>"

A common strategy is to invest in international standards or accreditation models such as ISO, HCAC, or Magnet. This research seeks to examine the impact of the Magnet Model and Accreditation on healthcare organizations and their transformational journey toward nursing excellence and patient‐centered care. The paper explains the Magnet Model’s five key tenets—transformational leadership, structural empowerment, exemplary professional practice, fresh knowledge and innovations, and empirical results. The research examines the importance of Magnet status and highlights its significant benefits. Achieving Magnet status positively impacts nurse satisfaction, patient outcomes, and overall organizational success. However, there are a number of implementation challenges in the United Arab Emirates, and this study is to answer this research question “What are the challenges in implementing Magnet Accreditation in the United Arab Emirates on a wider scale?” As such, qualitative research began by conducting a literature review, complemented by input from fifteen (15) subject matter experts operating within the healthcare industry. By examining a wide range of published articles and existing literature, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of patients’ perspectives. The significance of this research lies in its ability to consolidate and analyze existing knowledge in the field. By synthesizing the available literature, it offers valuable insights into the pros and cons of Magnet Accreditation in general and in the UAE market in particular. The findings of this review suggest 5 key challenges for an effective Magnet Model implementation: (1) misalignment with local regulatory environments, (2) minimal improvement to nurses’ working conditions, (3) claims of no real change to nurses or patients, (4) significant financial investment yet questionable ROI, and (5) numerous workforce considerations.</jats:p>"

The results show that sustainable supply chain management practice has a positive impact on environmental performance and environmental regulations are not enough grounds to affirm a moderating role in the relationship between sustainable supply chain management practice and environmental performance of Vietnamese agricultural enterprises.

A total sample of 155 respondents was selected using simple random sampling for questionnaires, while 13 participants were purposively selected for in-depth interviews. Data collection involved structured questionnaires and interviews, analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS to ensure robust findings. Findings- The findings revealed a positive and significant influence of circular packaging on manufacturing firm performance. Adopting innovative packaging materials and clear disposal instructions can enhance competitive advantage, increase profit margins, and attract environmentally-conscious consumers, leading to higher market share and revenue. Practical Implications- The study highlights the importance of environmental sustainability practices for manufacturing firms in Tanzania. By adopting sustainable approaches, businesses can contribute to a healthier environment, reduce their carbon footprint, and promote responsible consumption. This can have positive implications for both the local community and the global ecosystem. The study recommends that firms invest in circular economic practices, such as innovative packaging and recycling. Policymakers are urged to provide incentives, such as tax relief and subsidies, to support green technologies. Collaboration between public and private sectors to fund research and development is also emphasized. Additionally, consumer advocacy for sustainable products and practices is critical to driving change</jats:p>"

The banks face several struggles competing with large banks due to limited resources, lack of economies of scale, and inadequate innovative practices. By embracing innovative practices, these banks will develop and offer new products and services that meet the evolving needs of their customers, differentiate themselves from larger banks, and create value for their shareholders. The main objective of the study was to examine the influence of product innovation practices on the financial performance of Tier III Commercial Banks in Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive research design. The population was all twenty-one (21) Tier III banks listed according to CBK categorization as of 1st February 2023. The census technique was adopted to encompass all the bank managers of the branches based in Nairobi County. The data was collected from both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected using questionnaires, whereas secondary data was collected using data collection sheets for a period of 3 years (2020-2022). The study found that product innovation practices have a positive and significant effect on the financial performance of tier III commercial banks. The study recommended that tier III commercial banks in Kenya should enhance the adoption of innovation practices in order to improve their financial performance.</jats:p>"

Second, companies tend to increase their investments in innovation and capital expenditure as a result of better ESG performance. While capital expenditure boosts financial performance significantly, innovation investment, though promising, yields uncertain outcomes and has less influence compared to capital expenditure. Furthermore, the financial performance of nonstate-owned and nonpolluting firms is more susceptible to fluctuations in ESG performance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The findings are context-specific and may not universally apply to all industries and regions.

Transformational leadership serves as a key factor influencing employee safety behaviour and performance. By providing inspiration, guidance, and positive role models, transformational leaders can strengthen safety practices in the workplace and ensure employees constantly adhere to established safety procedures. The study also emphasizes the significance of support to workers through ongoing training, adequate rest, and recognition of their efforts, all of which contribute to improved workplace safety. In addition, effective safety policy enforcement and monitoring through awareness campaigns also play an essential role in ensuring employee compliance. The results of this study reveal that transformational leadership increases employee motivation and strengthens the enforcement of safety policies, ultimately leading to increased employee safety as a whole.</jats:p>"

However, the evaluation dimension needs improvement. It is hoped that by optimizing all dimensions of management, effective and efficient learning management can be achieved. Therefore, the evaluation dimension should become a primary focus moving forward in learning development management.\nContribution/value\nThe planning and implementation that have been carried out cannot measure their effectiveness. This should become a main focus for Pondok Senyum in the future, as in learning management, it is not enough to simply formulate good planning, and it is not enough to execute the plan effectively in the actuating stage.</jats:p>"

The sample comprises 393 Basic Eight students from a population of 20,885 in the study area using the multi-stage sampling procedure. Ten Basic Science teachers were observed in class. Data collection instruments include the Basic Science Process Skill Acquisition Test (BSPSAT), the Basic Science Performance Test (BSPT), and the Basic Science Teachers’ Assessment Practices Observation Scale (BSTAPOS). The reliability coefficients were 0.71 for BSPSAT, 0.86 for BSPT using Kuder–Richardson Formula 21, and the BSTAPOS value was 0.66 using Spearman’s rank correlation. The descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation as well as an independent t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for analysis. Significant differences were found regarding the impact of teachers’ low, moderate, and high classroom assessment practices on the mean process skills acquisition scores and the mean performance scores of students in basic science. Students’ gender did not show a significant difference regarding the impact of teachers’ low, moderate, and high assessment practices on process skills acquisition and performance scores in basic science. It is recommended that teachers of basic science should use assessment guides and workbooks to acquaint themselves with the appropriate assessment practices.</jats:p>"

We demonstrate that all prerequisite activities for CAFF (relationship building, question choice and data representation) were present in every virtual AGF session. Virtual facilitation was effective in supporting the transition of participants through different steps of CAFF in each session to lead to change talk and planning. All participants contributed to discussion during the AGF sessions. The post AGF session surveys were filled by 66% of participants (55/83), with over 90% of respondents reporting that the session helped them improve practice. 46% of participants (38/83) completed personal commitment to change forms at the end of the sessions.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Virtual AGF sessions, developed and implemented with fidelity to the CAFF approach, successfully engaged physicians in a group learning environment that led to change planning.

Using normative legal research methods, the approach taken includes analysis of legislation, conceptual studies, as well as case studies of a number of relevant Constitutional Court decisions. The results show that the values of Pancasila, particularly the second and fifth precepts, play a fundamental role as the philosophical basis in the application and interpretation of human rights principles in Indonesia. The Constitutional Court has a strategic role in safeguarding the constitution while ensuring the enforcement of human rights through progressive legal interpretation. However, despite these positive steps, challenges such as inconsistencies in lower court decisions and mismatches between the rule of law and the needs of society remain. This research recommends strengthening Pancasila-based legal education, harmonizing legal policies, and increasing the capacity of judges in integrating human rights with social justice principles holistically. The findings confirm that the judicial system, with a strong constitutional approach, can be an effective tool in realizing social justice in accordance with the values of Pancasila and the constitution.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the present research aims to find this nexus in the Saudi banking sector by applying the mediating role of Banking Economic Sustainability (BES). For this purpose, primary data was collected from 356 employees of the banking sector in Saudi Arabia, and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is applied for hypothesis testing. The findings disclose that GBP improves both BEP and BES and also BES enhances BEP. Thus, BES moderated the relationship between GBP and BEP. The research recommends the Saudi banking sector to further adopt environmentally sustainable practices to achieve their economic sustainability and environmental performance. Thus, the Saudi banking sector could play its role in achieving environmental sustainability in Saudi Arabia by reducing energy consumption and pollution emissions from banking operations.\n\n</jats:p>"

The issue of human resources development is particularly important for enhancing the effectiveness of social services in the Republic of Armenia. It is reasonable to study the issue of human resources management within the framework of the Unified Social Service (USS). This institute is responsible for the provision of social protection services. This article examines the best practices of HRM, focusing on two main components of it: staffing and performance management. Information for this study about the USS, its personnel, and work-related challenges stems from interviews with social service specialists. During the study, several critical aspects of the USS were noted, including issues associated with selection and staffing due to low wages and scope of work, various bureaucratic bottlenecks, and lack of opportunities for career advancement. Further, the article discerns significant shortcomings in the performance management systems: absence of certain essential elements such as key performance indicators (KPI), feedback systems, and demotivational performance reward structures to even the high achievers. It was concluded that more effective recruitment methods should be implemented in order to reform the HR management system within the USS and to boost service quality and employee performance. With the above modifications, the USS will have sufficient potential to improve the quality of services provided, meet public needs, and endorse employee motivation and performance. The scientific novelty of this article lies in its context-driven approach to HRM within Armenia’s USS, focusing on reforms and performance evaluations specifically adapted to Armenia’s social sector. It introduces a localized perspective on recruitment challenges, providing actionable insights that are sensitive to Armenia’s unique socio-economic environment. By comparing private-sector performance models with Armenia’s public social services, the article highlights the need for a sector-specific approach rather than a direct private-sector application. The proposed reforms are particularly innovative, as they are tailored to Armenia’s regulatory and socio-economic framework, addressing HRM issues uniquely within the context of Armenia’s social protection system.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>This Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) aimed to investigate the impact of electronic medical record (EMR) implementation on the process and outcomes of nursing handover by synthesising the existing scientific literature. Clinical nursing handover involves transferring patient information, responsibility and accountability to ensure continuity of care and patient safety. Poor or absent clinical handover can negatively impact quality of care, patient safety and patient outcomes. EMRs are patient information systems that facilitate the real‐time sharing of patient data. It has been proposed that EMRs may assist in addressing communication issues often associated with poor nursing handover, yet the implementation and impact of EMR implementations remain varied. A database search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane. Articles for inclusion were studies in which the impact of an EMR implementation was evaluated, where participants were nurses performing handover from shift to shift in a hospital setting. Eleven studies from 4 different countries were included. The study findings revealed 4 broad themes that serve to answer the research question: use of the EMR during handover; nurse perceptions and satisfaction with the EMR; barriers to use; and enablers to use. EMR‐mediated handover was described in 7 studies. EMR‐structured handover was described in 7 studies. EMR‐generated printouts were described in 4 studies. While the EMR was routinely used to validate and check certain pieces of information during handover, nurses considered their personalised paper‐based forms to be the preferred handover tool. The main findings were that nurses generally expressed dissatisfaction with using the EMR to facilitate handover, with three studies reported dissatisfaction with EMR‐based handover. 50% of nurses found printouts cumbersome, and 69% reported irrelevant information. Barriers to EMR use included 6 studies that identified design‐related barriers. 4 studies emphasised the importance of cognitive support and situational awareness. 4 studies highlighted the lack of nursing engagement and codesign. 5 studies discussed variations in nurse digital literacy. Enablers to EMR use included two studies highlighting the importance of nurse engagement and codesign in successful EMR‐facilitated handover. Three studies showed nurses deliberately adopting EMR‐based handover tools, contrasting with previous examples of forced adaptation. No single tool was able to provide nurses with the whole patient story, the required situational awareness, nor the cognitive support required to convey and receive information during handover. An effective EMR‐mediated solution that improves the efficacy and quality of nursing handover has not yet been realised. Future efforts to design EMR‐mediated solutions to better support nurses must fully appreciate the complexities of nursing handover, the mental workload associated with the task and the definitive qualities of tools to provide this support. This REA has demonstrated the need for clinical nurses to be more directly involved in the iterative development and evaluation of these tools in order to specifically enhance processes and outcomes of nursing handover.</jats:p>"

Nowadays different Advanced Oxidation Processes have been used to treat pesticide pollution. Among all these AOPs Photocatalytic ozonation is most effective and inexpensive. In this study deltamethrin was degraded from synthetic wastewater using photocatalytic ozonation. TiO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3 </sub>catalyst has been used and prepared from sol-gel method. For ozone gas constant flow ozonator has been used. To measure the combined effects of catalyst dosage, pH, and pesticide concentration on deltamethrin degradation, 3D response surface approach is utilized. Results of photocatalytic ozonation analysis show that 26% degradation of deltamethrin after 60 minutes of reaction time. By eliminating issues like catalyst recycling and making it simple to apply on an industrial scale, photocatalytic ozonation provides an effective and environmentally friendly method of treating pesticide.</p>"

The challenges lie in effectively managing power fluctuations and sudden changes in reactivity that could result in unsafe situations. Reactor power fluctuations can cause changes in behavior. At the same time, the transfer of heat from the fuel to the coolant and reactivity changes resulting from differences in fuel and coolant temperatures can also make the systemunpredictable. The primary goal of a power controller used in a nuclear reactor is to sustain the specified power level, which guarantees the security of the power plant. To address these challenges, this paper presents a dynamic model of a PWR and applies several control techniques to the system for power level control. Specifically, a traditional PID controller, a Neural Network controller, a Fuzzy self-tuned PID controller, and a Neuro-Fuzzy self-tuned PID controller were individually designed and evaluated to enhance the performance of the reactor power control system under constant and variable reference power. In addition, the robustness of each controller was appraised against time delays and external disturbances. The system was tested with various initial power values to evaluate its performance under different conditions. The results demonstrate that the Neuro-Fuzzy self-tuned PID controller has the best performance, as well as the fastest response time compared to the other controllers.Furthermore, the intelligent controllers were found to exhibit good robustness against time delays and external disturbances. The system's stability was not significantly affected by changes in the initial power value, although it had a minor effect on the transient response. Overall,the findings of this study can inform the design and optimization of control systems for PWRs, with the ultimate goal of improving their safety, reliability, and performance. </jats:p>"

The results show that system losses do not exceed 1.3%, with performance rates ranging from 73-79% for BIM2 and 74-88% for Buon Ma Thuot. Correlation analysis between module operating temperature, solar irradiance, and energy yield reveals an inverse relationship between the temperature-irradiance ratio and energy yield. A considerable decline in power plant efficiency is observed when this ratio exceeds 8. Additionally, vital monitored indices for PV plant operation are investigated, including energy supplied to the grid, PV array temperature, ambient temperature, and loss metrics.</jats:p>"

This study identifies seven factors to develop an extended theory of planned behavior (ETPB) with the help of experts and literature surveys. The DEMATEL method is used to analyze the prominence of factors, interrelationships, and causal relationships between the identified ETPB factors based on experts' opinions. The results indicate that there are three cause factors and the rest four are effect factors. ‘Social Pressure’, ‘Circular Incentives’, and ‘Pro-environmental Behavior and Responsibility’ are the significant causes. The Inbound Supply Chain is the prominent factor affected by all the six factors of ETPB. The research findings will be beneficial for academicians, policymakers, and practitioners as they provide insights into CSCM model development and help in recognizing significant measures to implement it.</jats:p>"

In this article, we explicate the challenges to be met and responsibilities that formal linguists must take in data collection, documentation, and analysis to ensure high ethical standards. We direct our attention especially toward research on heritage, minoritized and endangered languages, which have enriched the theoretical landscape in recent decades. Finally, we show that, when proper ethical concerns are recognized and accounted for in formal research, this collective body of research in its current form is also fully capable of respecting the integrity of individual speakers and their communities.</jats:p>"

Research has established the importance of fitness-to-drive (FTD) evaluations for those older adults with medical conditions. These medically-at-risk drivers, at any age, are generally evaluated by specialized driver rehabilitation specialists (DRS) to determine FTD. In the last 10 years, much research has established which assessments best determine FTD with cognitive assessments being the primary determinant. The aim of this research study was to compare assessment tools with the best evidence with the actual tools being currently used by DRSs. A comprehensive review of tools was completed by 321 practicing DRSs. Results show that cognitive tools such as Trails A, Trails B, and clock drawing are being used by 91%, 92%, and 74% respectfully. However, other tools with strong evidence are being used much less (MOCA-46%, UFOV-30%). Additionally, assessment with limited or no evidence (e.g., Traffic signs-66%, brake reaction-71%) or with vehicle technology changes, are not essential to FTD (e.g., muscle strength-91%, ROM-95%) are used extensively. Highlights from the research will include how the on-road assessment is used as a determining factor for FTD with statements. For example: If a driver with moderate dementia passes the on road, he/she should be able to continue driving. While 71% indicted this was probably/definitely false, 29% felt it was probably/definitely true. Implications of these results will be discussed.</jats:p>"

The value system at enterprises is analyzed in the context of the Shingo model and its role in the involvement of employees in the process of transformation of production. The Shingo model is used to analyze the role of employees in the process of transformation of production. In the present circumstances of the transition of Ukrainian enterprises to a highly volatile stage of development, the significance of the subject matter is undeniable.\r\nValue orientations and authentic models of employee behavior of developing enterprises become topical in the context of the need to move towards high productivity. It is therefore important to assess the degree of readiness of the economy for the transformation process, its ability to adapt to changes, and its potential speed of introduction of technologies and innovations. In this work, the effective structure of the production transformation process and the individual elements of the transformation are indicated. It is demonstrated the impact of innovative methods and methods of transformation on the speed of growth and development of productivity at enterprises. The material presented in the article encompasses significant aspects of the fundamental essence of the innovative nature of development based on the Shingo model.</jats:p>"

Process discovery algorithms construct process models that describe the executed process. With the increasing availability of large-scale event logs, process discovery has shifted towards a data-oriented research discipline, aiming to design algorithms that are applicable and useful in practice. This shift has revealed a fundamental problem in process discovery research: Currently, contributions can only be considered in isolation. Researchers conduct experiments to show that they move the field forward, but due to a lack of reliability and validity, the individual contributions are hard to generalize. In this article, we argue that one reason for these problems is the lack of conventions or standards for experimental design in process discovery. Hence, we propose “process discovery engineering”: a research methodology for process discovery, consisting of a shared terminology and a checklist for conducting experiments. We demonstrate its applicability by means of an example experimental evaluation of process discovery algorithms and discuss the implications of the methodology on the field. This article is not meant to be prescriptive but to invite and encourage the community to contribute to this discussion to advance the field as a whole.</jats:p>"

Characteristic findings include erythema, induration, and tenderness around the breast bud. Fluctuance and purulent drainage may be present with abscess formation. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection. Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of neonatal mastitis in high-income countries, and no literature available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infection such as meningitis or urinary tract infection. A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most neonatal mastitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes. Treatment of neonatal mastitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration. Surgical intervention, such as incision and drainage or intraoperative debridement, may be needed for frank abscesses. While antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower risk infants with mastitis.</jats:p>"

The study integrates dynamic capability theory to explore how CE and HCM practices synergistically influence organisational performance. These approach highlights the challenges such as resource scarcity, regulatory constraints, and cultural influences that organisations face in leveraging robust CE initiatives and optimising HCM practices in achieving targeted performance outcomes, such as improved innovation, operational efficiency, and market responsiveness. Focusing on experiences in developing countries, with a focus on Nigerian organisations, this study adopted a conceptual approach, in contributing to the understanding of how CE and HCM can be aligned to drive sustainable development in developing countries. It was reported that CE, characterised by innovation, pro-activeness, and risk-taking within an organisation, is a critical driver of competitive advantage. Similarly, effective HCM practices encompassing talent acquisition, training, retention, and strategic human resource planning are essential for cultivating a skilled and engaged workforce. The study also offers insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to enhance organisational competitiveness in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

This research explores secure multi-cloud architectures, focusing on best practices for safeguarding data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The study investigates challenges unique to multi-cloud environments, including inconsistent security configurations, data fragmentation, and inter-cloud communication vulnerabilities. By leveraging a comprehensive framework, this work identifies and evaluates solutions such as zero-trust models, encryption techniques, identity and access management (IAM), and compliance-driven governance policies. Additionally, emerging trends like secure APIs, artificial intelligence-driven monitoring, and blockchain-based data protection are discussed. The findings offer practical guidelines for enterprises to implement robust security measures, reduce risk, and optimize data protection strategies in multi-cloud ecosystems.</jats:p>"

Factors contributing to project performance include support from the PMO. PMO at PT. XYZ will begin to be implemented starting in 2019. From 2019 to 2022 work on 3 project assignments from the local government. In practice, there were problems where 2 of the three projects experienced delays in completion and 1 other project experienced payment delays, where the risks to the project have not been optimally managed. This study aims to identify the role of the project management office (PMO) owned by PT. XYZ, identify risks in PMO management and identify the role of PMO that has the most influence on risk-based project performance at PT. XYZ. The research method used in this study is a survey method for several respondents where the previous questionnaire was validated by experts and a pilot survey was carried out and the results of the questionnaire will be analyzed using the SEM method. This is to be able to provide results if risk control in PMO management is carried out effectively or on target so that it can improve project performance at PT. XYZ.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the integration of GenAI in higher education, focusing on its potential to enhance teaching and learning. Through a series of workshops and courses delivered to university professors, it examines opportunities such as improved resource creation and challenges like ethical AI usage, proposing best practices for the sustainable implementation of GenAI in the classroom. The main objective is to analyze how the use of GenAI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can improve teachers’ professional skills and the overall educational experience while ensuring ethical and responsible use. The methodology comprised a literature review and practical experimentation with university professors. Data collection involved observations, surveys, discussion forums, cooperative activities, and exercises focused on evaluating AI-generated educational resources and analyzing forum insights to identify best practices. The results highlight several opportunities around the use of GenAI in education, including improving writing, creating educational resources, supporting lesson planning, and increasing teacher productivity. In addition, significant challenges were identified, such as the ethical use of AI and strategies for detecting AI-generated text. For instance, workshops demonstrated a 30% increase in teacher confidence with GenAI tools like ChatGPT, highlighting the effectiveness of these technologies in professional development. To address these challenges, best practices for the responsible integration of GenAI in education are presented, focusing primarily on ongoing training, the establishment of institutional policies, the encouragement of responsible use, and the ongoing evaluation of impact in the educational setting. Best practices include clear ethical guidelines, prompt development techniques, and continuous professional training to ensure teachers can effectively and responsibly integrate GenAI tools into their instructional practices. These practices for the effective use of GenAI tools in education aim to maximize benefits while mitigating risks. These include the development of effective prompts for various activities and guidance on the ethical use of AI to ensure a balanced and responsible approach to the integration of GenAI in higher education.</jats:p>"

The program struggled to meet recruiting, retention, and program goals in its inaugural year. In response to less-than-desirable progress, the principal investigator partnered with Reckon Branding to define a messaging focus for the program that better connected with each of its key audiences: Church leaders, caregivers, and partner programs within their space. Considering 71% of customers recommend a brand based on their emotional connection to it, Reckon knew they had to tell a story that extended beyond facts and figures. The program was provided with a new verbal and visual focus through internal ideation sessions, audits of competitive programs, and external interviews of Church leadership and caregivers of those with cognitive impairments. Armed with the more memorable name ALTER, a new logo, and more consumer-friendly marketing materials, the team was able to secure 83 partnerships over the next 4 years. This strategic pivot has helped ALTER exceed its partner goals by over 300% and empowered the program to develop consistently impactful marketing materials, which provided improved recruitment reach, increasing the participants from 7,500 to more than 100,000. Thanks to this success, ALTER has extended its reach from Georgia, to many more African American communities of faith across 14 states.</jats:p>"

Although developed nations have faced regulatory pressures to adopt environmentally friendly methods, this problem has received less attention in developing economies such as India. In light of the time sensitivity, it is crucial to identify the catalysts of green business adaptation into their entrepreneurial activity, specifically focusing on the essential variables among them.\n\n?The objective of this study is to identify and establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the elements that support green entrepreneurship, using the gray DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique. The distinctiveness of this research is its simultaneous emphasis on identifying factors that facilitate and establishing cause-and-effect links, which has not been investigated in previous studies. The creation of green manufacturing capabilities, obtaining funding for green innovation, getting loans from financial institutions easily, and following environmental regulations are the most important components of a comprehensive list of 10 factors that support green business.\n\n?Moreover, the study enhances its contribution by providing managerial and practical implications, with the purpose of supporting managers of the case organization in implementing green innovation techniques. This comprehensive method seeks to connect the divide between identifying factors that enable something and cultivating a more profound comprehension of how these factors are interconnected, in order to facilitate the implementation of sustainable entrepreneurship practices.</jats:p>"

The presence of anemia is an independent risk factor for perioperative morbidity and mortality. However, it is also associated with transfusion, which is also associated with worse outcomes. Thus, preoperative correction of anemia may reduce a patient’s perioperative risk and improve his or her surgical outcome. This chapter will review the diagnosis and classification of anemia, its treatment, and the evidence available to guide therapy, including iron supplementation therapy and the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.</jats:p>"

The potential havoc it can wreak underscores the necessity of preventing and identifying such instances, as they are pivotal for an organization’s financial security, credibility, and reputation. This is a crucial area of research in criminology and fraud detection. Using a criminological perspective, this paper introduces the unique process of detecting internal corruption, specifically embezzlement. The method, a rule-based internal corruption detection system that employs Case-based Reasoning (CBR) and a criminological approach, is not just an advancement but a pioneering leap in the field of fraud detection in companies.</jats:p>"

Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, data was collected from 106 employees of Karachi-based private banks and analyzed using Smart PLS software. Results reveal a significant positive impact of GHRM practices, particularly green recruitment, training, and performance management, on SOP. However, GTFL showed an insignificant moderating effect on these relationships. Practical implications include fostering green practices like online banking and sustainability-focused training. This study contributes to the understanding of GHRM and SOP, with a focus on green leadership's role in developing economies.</jats:p>"

Interventions need to be improved to prevent exacerbations and reduce high readmission and mortality rates. Evidence suggests that including a telephone follow-up (TFU) call in discharge plans could improve outcomes in patients with a chronic disease.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Objectives:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This project aimed to improve how primary care nurses in Gran Canaria, Spain, followed up COPD patients after hospital discharge.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This project was guided by the JBI Evidence Implementation Framework, which includes the JBI Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System (PACES) and the Getting Research into Practice (GRiP) method.

Five barriers to best practices were identified and improvement strategies were developed. The follow-up audit revealed 100% compliance for Criteria 1 and 2, which related to COPD patients having a discharge plan and that plan including TFU. There was a 4.88% improvement for both Criteria 3 and 4, which involved the TFU being prompt and using a validated clinical questionnaire. Following project implementation, the 30-day readmission rate increased from 2.78% to 4.88% but the 30-day emergency room presentation rate decreased from 25% to 9.76%.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The practice changes were partly achieved, but further strategies are needed to achieve full compliance.

Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) adopted this program the same year, but no prior studies have evaluated its implementation. This study aims to assess the OBE-CBTP implementation process at VSMMC, as perceived by third-year resident physicians and the training core faculty. Data was collected through two sets of questionnaires distributed to third-year residents and the training core faculty, focusing on eight program outcomes, their associated learning objectives, teaching-learning activities, and assessment tasks. Results showed that both groups rated the implementation of the eight program outcomes as Very Highly Implemented. Resident physicians specifically rated the learning objectives as Very Highly Implemented, while teaching-learning activities received ratings of Very Highly Implemented and Highly Implemented, and assessment tasks were rated as Very Highly Implemented. Importantly, no significant differences in evaluations were found based on age, sex, or the type of curriculum from which the residents graduated. Similarly, training core faculty ratings did not show significant variation when analyzed by age, sex, and years of practice, providing insufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The study highlights the successful implementation of an outcome-based education (OBE) approach in the training of Internal Medicine residents at VSMMC, focusing on specific competencies expected at each training level. Participants affirmed that the practice of the Philippine College of Physicians’ Outcome-based Education Competency-Based Training Program (PCPOBE-CBTP) is effective, serves as a model for others, and has yielded excellent results in training internists. In conclusion, the findings underscore the PCP-OBE-CBTP program's critical contribution to enhancing postgraduate medical education and practice in the Philippines. It is recommended to conduct further studies in other hospitals with similar residency training programs to validate these findings.</jats:p>"

This study examines corporate environmental disclosure practices in the U.S., emphasizing their relationship with financial attributes and their impact on environmental performance. By analyzing key financial indicators like CRR, WTA, DBTA, CFTA, and ROTA - the study finds a meaningful collective relationship with environmental disclosure (ENVNDS). However, more than half of the variability (55.3%) remains unexplained, suggesting that additional factors influence ENVNDS. The weak and statistically insignificant relationship between DBTA and WTA further highlights the complexity of financial-environmental interactions. Benchmarking frameworks like GRI-302, GRI-303, GRI-305, and GRI-306 help assess corporate compliance and environmental performance. Despite some limitations, environmental reporting has become integral to corporate transparency and sustainability efforts in the U.S.A. Future research should focus on improving environmental disclosure metrics, evaluating the influence of reporting on organizational behaviour, and assessing the long-term benefits of transparency. A deeper understanding of these factors can enhance reporting frameworks and drive meaningful corporate sustainability initiatives.</jats:p>"

The emphasis is on the need to form in them such qualities as responsibility, endurance, discipline and self-control.\r\nSpecial attention is paid to the role of the coach, his professional training and methodological readiness to work with this category of adolescents. Key methodological requirements are outlined, including: taking into account the individual characteristics of adolescents, creating a favorable emotional environment, encouraging physical activity, correcting behavior through daily self-control and supporting a positive \"I-concept\".\r\nThe multifaceted role of the coach as a mentor, educator and organizer is revealed. The methodology for creating subject-subject interaction between the coach and adolescents is detailed, including the formation of an asset in sports teams. The importance of gradually involving adolescents in social activities in order to cultivate moral and volitional qualities is noted.\r\nThe article proposes approaches that contribute to the effective work of a coach with difficult adolescents, and identifies prospects for further research in this area.</jats:p>"

The goal is to minimize patients' exposure to radiation and reduce escalating hospital costs.\nMaterial and Methods: This prospective, descriptive study included 370 pediatric patients aged 0–18 years with minor head trauma who presented to the Emergency Department of Düzce University Research and Application Hospital over a one-year period. Detailed records of demographic data, presenting symptoms, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, CT scan decisions, results, and discharge status were collected using patient follow-up forms.\nResults: The majority of pediatric patients with minor head trauma were male (58.4%) and had a GCS score of 15 (92.2%). The most common presenting symptoms were nausea/vomiting (11.6%) and headache (10.5%). CT scan decisions were influenced by presenting symptoms. Most CT scans yielded normal findings (42.7%), while the detection rate of abnormal findings was low (6.3%).\nConclusions: This study highlights critical findings for optimizing CT scan decisions in pediatric minor head trauma cases. The results support strategies to reduce unnecessary CT scans, thereby minimizing radiation exposure and enhancing the cost-effectiveness of healthcare services.</jats:p>"

There are several circularity indexing systems that account for material circularity in buildings. However, there is a lack of harmonized benchmarking systems, meaning that circular buildings are mostly compared with alternatives of their own design. This study addresses these research gaps by exploring a mass-based circularity indexing system and identifying current and future references for the circularity performance of buildings, for use in FutureBuilt, a Norwegian green building innovation programme. The FutureBuilt Circularity Index system rates a building’s circularity performance between 0% and 100%. The indexing system discerns between materials and masses used during construction, and materials available at the end of life of the building. A weighting system is introduced to emphasize the importance of reusing materials at the highest level of functional quality, and to emphasize the importance of current resource circularity versus circularity at the building’s end of life. The circularity index is tested on four Norwegian buildings that have a high focus on circularity, achieving indexing levels from 44% to 69%. A mixed methods approach using statistics, environmental product declarations, and interviews is applied to establish the reference baseline for Norwegian buildings (i.e. 7% circularity) and scenarios for future circularity in 2050 (from 35% to 80% circularity). Actors in the Norwegian construction industry can evaluate the level of ambition for circular buildings by using this novel indexing system and benchmarking approach, which can also be adopted to other national or regional contexts.</jats:p>"

The consequences include reduced durability, increased maintenance costs, and compromised safety. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of grout edgelifting, focusing on its identification, underlying causes, and preventive strategies. Detailed procedures including material preparation, application, and curing, are discussed alongside reinforcement techniques using dowel and wicket bars. The integration of these advanced methodologies ensures enhanced durability, better performance, and adherence to international standards.

The objective is to identify how green accounting implementation can help the company manage the environmental impact of its production waste, enhance the transparency of sustainability reporting, and support operational efficiency through digital-based systems. The findings reveal that CV. Anugrah Print has not systematically implemented green accounting. Environmental costs are not adequately recorded, and the company’s sustainability report does not fully reflect its social and environmental responsibilities. The implementation of an internal audit based on the COSO Framework can enhance operational risk management and environmental oversight but requires adequate digital infrastructure support. As an initial step, the company is recommended to adopt green accounting, document environmental costs in sustainability reports, and integrate digital systems to support the COSO Framework's implementation. This research provides practical contributions to CV. Anugrah Print in improving the quality of sustainability report disclosures, operational efficiency, and fulfillment of environmental responsibilities. Additionally, it offers insights for academics and practitioners regarding the importance of green accounting and internal control in supporting sustainability in small and medium enterprises.</jats:p>"

Using quantile regression and three different performance measures, the study analyzes how the effect of intellectual capital changes across different performance levels. The sample is 358 Indonesian non-financial companies (1,074 firm-year observations) from 2018 to 2020. The results show a positive relationship between intellectual capital and firm performance, which supports the resource-based theory (RBT). However, the effect varies between high-performing and low-performing companies, showing that intellectual capital has a different influence depending on the firm's performance level.</jats:p>"

This study addresses the lack of transparency and regulation in surcharge application, which allows businesses to manipulate costs, creating unfair advantages. The purpose of this research is to analyze international fuel surcharge regulations and propose best practices for promoting fair competition. Using a literature review of studies from 2018 to 2023, this study compares regulatory frameworks across countries and industries. Empirical data were analyzed to identify patterns of surcharge inconsistency. The study concludes by recommending actionable, data-driven reforms that can standardize surcharge practices, ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and a level playing field for businesses of all sizes.Navigating Fair Competition: Best Practices for Fuel Surcharge Regulations Across Industries</jats:p>"

This study provides an inclusive proposal for a sustainable process safety management 4.0 (SPSM 4.0) framework, concentrating on its evolution, drivers, and a comprehensive framework highlighting structures and applications. The core values of I5.0 (sustainability, human‐centricity, and resilience) and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), industrial Internet of things (IIoT), and cyber‐physical systems (CPS) are integrated with the PSM system. SPSM 4.0 aims to alter the PSM ecosystem through the applications of digital transformations at workplace by ensuring the process safety, well‐being of employees and assets while leveraging socioeconomic environmental concerns at an improved efficiency. The proposed framework bridges the gap between PSM and sustainability, which serves as a foundation stone for future SPSM 4.0 guidelines targeted at practitioners, policymakers, and academicians. In addition, the study proposes a comprehensive umbrella paradigm integrating PSM with sustainability pillars in an I5.0 landscape. Concluding, the research focuses on a critical discussion of the decision support system operationalizing the SPSM 4.0 system and suggesting critical takeaways for the managers and researchers.</jats:p>"

This framework integrates the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy neural network methodologies to devise a comprehensive supplier performance assessment model. Leveraging extensive historical supplier data, the author employs MATLAB’s neural network toolbox for model training and simulation. The results indicate that the error value output after running the validation sample is relatively small. This indicates that the model can be effectively applied to the performance evaluation of common integrated circuit product suppliers in CM company. According to the performance results of the model application, all participating suppliers have performance scores greater than 0.7, indicating that in the supply and service process of butterfly integrated circuit products, the performance evaluation scores of each supplier meet the requirements of qualified suppliers, among them, suppliers DS1, DS8, and DS9 with a comprehensive performance score greater than 0.8 are relatively excellent suppliers. The model’s effectiveness and accuracy have been confirmed, demonstrating its practical applicability to CM Company. Moreover, its insights provide valuable guidance for establishing supplier performance evaluation systems across various product categories within telecommunications enterprises.</jats:p>"

As a result, discussions surrounding the relevance and benefits of telerehabilitation have gained prominence among practitioners, who continually seek to enhance patient care while maintaining high standards of quality. Associated with these discussions are concerns over being able to provide care in an ethical way, as well as addressing equity issues that might be hindered or improved via telerehabilitation. To address the ethical and equity concerns around telerehabilitation, a series of five parallel rapid reviews of the scientific literature were conducted, focusing on different rehabilitation fields: physiotherapy and occupational therapy (1); speech therapy and audiology (2); psychology and neuropsychology (3); and in two age groups: older adults (4); and pediatrics and young adults (5). The objective of this series of rapid reviews is to evaluate the evidence presented regarding telerehabilitation; identifying and recommending best practices especially in the realm of ethics and equity. Methods: Medline; CINAHL; and EMBASE were searched between 2010 and 2023 for English or French-language reviews (2010–2020) and individual studies (2020–2023) pertaining to telerehabilitation and these fields of interest. Data were extracted following a standardized form focusing on: outcomes; findings; quality assessment/biases; limitations; and discussion of ethical and equity concerns. Results: The results are presented according to the most relevant themes, which include: findings; strengths; limitations; and ethical/equity considerations. Conclusions: This research presents a methodology rarely published before, on how to conduct multiple parallel rapid reviews on the theme of telerehabilitation, based on different rehabilitation fields and age groups. This research will shape future guidelines and standards in applying ethical and equity standards in telerehabilitation.</jats:p>"

But the strategies employed by companies in exploring green innovation activities have gained little or no attention in literature. This study proposes a conceptual model that outlines green innovation strategies, corporate performance, and the moderating effect of green dynamic capacity. Based on the perspective of the Resource Based viewpoint and the notion of dynamic capabilities, this study addresses a) what is the relationship between green innovation practices and enterprise performance? and b) to what extent do green dynamic capabilities moderate the connection between green innovation practices and enterprise performance? We used a cross-sectional data from SMEs in Ghanaian manufacturing firms, analysed utilizing the advanced PLS-SEM systematic procedures. Our findings revealed a significant relationship between green product innovation, green process innovation, and green service innovation on financial performance and that green dynamic capacity moderate these relationships. Our research contributes to expanding the knowledge of green innovative practices among SMEs in the manufacturing sector. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications, opening numerous options for further research.</jats:p>"

To achieve better management, a firm must investigate several aspects, including supply chain management and quality management practices. The study aims to establish the relationship between various quality management practices, such as process management, continuous improvement, and leadership, and their impact on supply chain performance in selected SMEs in Malaysia. Primary sources, specifically questionnaires distributed to respondents via online Google Forms and printed copies, provided the data for this study. This study included a purposive sample of 40 respondents from specifically selected SMEs in Johor, Melaka, and Negeri Sembilan. The study found no statistically significant relationship between process management, continuous improvement, and leadership with regard to supply chain performance. This suggests that these aspects of quality management practices are not essential for enhancing supply chain performance. Further research is therefore suggested to look for other strategic management factors possible, such as business analytics, innovation, and talent management that might improve supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

Empirical evidence argues the synergetic effect of high-performance human resource practices (H-PHRPs) on its outcomes. Scholars have, however, questioned the appropriateness and applicability of H-PHRPs in developing economies, one of the eye-catching debates being the implicit universality of H-PHRPs. Literature has also banded the H-PHRPS and established the antecedent role of H-PHRPS on its outcomes. This study aims to examine the relative importance of H-PHRPs on discretionary work behavior (DWB) using a sample from public university employees to confirm the external validity of H-PHRPS constructs by replicating the findings in an Eastern setting and, more so, a developing nation like Uganda.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In the study, the authors used relative analysis to determine the role of H-PHRPs in enhancing DWB.

This study investigates the impact of training and development on employee performance and turnover intention among millennials in Malaysia. The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was utilized to analyse the data obtained from 307 Malaysian millennial employees. The findings show that the respondents have a high level of training and development satisfaction, a medium level of employee performance, and a low turnover intention. The findings also reveal a weak but significant positive relationship between training and development and employee performance. In addition, the results show a significant negative relationship between training and development, employee performance, and turnover intention.

Methods: Thirteen participants (5 English speakers, 8 Spanish speakers), who had completed at least six months of the 1-year iDSMES program, were invited to join focus group discussions. Participants were asked about barriers, facilitators, and suggestions for promoting the program. Results: Barriers to effective diabetes self-management included financial constraints, lack of social support, stigma surrounding treatment, and miscommunication with healthcare providers. However, the iDSMES program’s support system emerged as a major facilitator. Participants valued the relationships they developed with others facing similar challenges, which motivated them to keep working toward their health goals. Conclusions: The iDSMES program was successful in promoting behavior changes and improving health literacy. Addressing financial barriers in underserved communities is essential for supporting long-term behavior change.</jats:p>"

In recent years, the berry production system has changed to cultivation in substrate and pots and this alternative system has shown the potential to produce high yields of high-quality berries. The quality of the substrate and the parameters of the pot are known to influence plant growth and fruit production. Many authors have evaluated the composition of the growing media and the size of the container with the aim of optimizing the appropriate growing conditions that affect the plant growth and berry yield. The physical characteristics of the substrate play a special role in berry cultivation; then, a good substrate should be of high quality, in order to provide the plant root system with the adequate environment to develop. The management of water irrigation and nutrient contents during berry production in substrates has a great importance on the yield and quality of fruits. Thus, suitable irrigation systems and a fertilizer solution containing all the essential nutrients are essential for yield and high-quality berries. In this perspective, the objective of this chapter is to present the equipment and practices used for the cultivation of berries in substrate.</jats:p>"

RVSOM medical students are exposed to the 4Ms in the second year of undergraduate courses and the framework is further emphasized during the required 4-week clerkship. To standardize content delivered to students rotating at a host of rotation sites and to augment the assigned self-study modules, a new initiative was introduced at the beginning of academic year (AY) 2024-2025. Students now participate in a full day of in-person didactics designed to teach them to use evidence-based screening tools and employ best practices when caring for older patients. A post-clerkship survey on the 4Ms approach was administered in AY 2023-2024 which allows an examination of differences between cohorts of students who received the in-person didactics and those who did not. Analysis of the data indicates that students benefit from the focused didactics as significant differences emerged on nearly half of the survey items [e.g., sufficient knowledge to perform a Geriatric Assessment [t(109) = 2.45, p =.016, d =.47] and confidence in initiating a conversation about Advance Care Planning [t(109) = -2.69, p =.008, d = -.51]). Findings indicate that enhanced training and exposure to Geriatrics best practices bolsters students’ confidence in understanding geriatrics issues and assessing older patients.</jats:p>"

Based on a comparative research method, the paper highlights the differences between the policies of the Republic of Moldova and those of neighboring European countries, particularly regarding indicators of economic stability in crisis situations. A great accent is put on analyzing data between the global crisis of 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), identifying the economic vulnerabilities of the Republic of Moldova, such as pro-cyclical fiscal policy, low public revenues, a consumption-based economic model, low investments, a shrinking workforce, and exchange rate instability during crises. Additionally, it highlights the differences between the policies of the Republic of Moldova and those of neighboring European countries, such as Poland and Bulgaria, in terms of economic stability indicators during crisis situations. Research demonstrates a strong correlation between the economic growth of Poland and the EU in the pre-accession period. The paper identifies the key areas for sustainable economic development: modernization of the economic structure, counter-cyclical fiscal policy, increasing public revenues, enhancing public services, boosting public investments, developing private pension funds, and promoting financial education. It raises the question, „What should national policies contain?” to ensure sustainable economic development of the Moldovan economy, taking into account the experiences of new EU member states in implementing modern IT systems and digitizing tax administration. If these policies are applied in the first decade following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Moldova can transition from a consumption-based economic model to a sustainable investment-oriented one.</jats:p>"

The method, based on a performance-based design, defines a structure’s capacity curve through elastic and rigid plastic analyses. It is validated by comparing the results with those from 420 pushover analyses. Additionally, the method is applied to two case studies designed according to older code provisions, and its accuracy is verified through Incremental dynamic analyses (IDA). The results demonstrate that the simplified method is reliable and provides an accurate evaluation of the structure’s capacity compared to code-based tools.</jats:p>"

The purchasing decision of the consumer is highly dependent on the specific criteria when it comes to the adoption of Battery electric vehicles. This work helps to analyze those specific criteria that are important from a consumer point of view before purchasing a BEV. The selected criteria analyzed in this study are the range of the vehicle, its full charging time, the purchasing price of the vehicle, the battery capacity of the vehicle, and the energy consumption of the vehicle. The analysis to find out the most prominent criteria that affect the purchasing decision of the consumer is done with the help of the Fuzzy AHP approach which provides the weights of the selected criteria and the other technique used is the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution TOPSIS, which provides the rank of the selected alternative electric vehicles.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div class=\"section abstract\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"htmlview paragraph\"&gt;Object detection (OD) is one of the most important aspects in Autonomous Driving (AD) application. This depends on the strategic sensor’s selection and placement of sensors around the vehicle. The sensors should be selected based on various constraints such as range, use-case, and cost limitation. This paper introduces a systematic approach for identifying the optimal practices for selecting sensors in AD object detection, offering guidance for those looking to expand their expertise in this field and select the most suitable sensors accordingly. In general, object detection typically involves utilizing RADAR, LiDAR, and cameras. RADAR excels in accurately measuring longitudinal distances over both long and short ranges, but its accuracy in lateral distances is limited. LiDAR is known for its ability to provide accurate range data, but it struggles to identify objects in various weather conditions. On the other hand, camera-based systems offer superior recognition capabilities but lack the precision in range resolution. Fusion of all the three sensors could improve object detection results, however at a higher cost and may be redundant in some cases. In autonomous driving, different functions like dynamic fusion, static fusion, and road model are used to detect a variety of objects like vehicles, motorcycles, guardrails, and road lanes. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of each sensor, the nature of the data it generates, its level of accuracy, and the limitations it encounters in detecting various objects. For each object, the paper outlines important steps and recommendations that can be implemented to achieve optimal results. This paper elucidates a framework for multi-sensor fusion in object detection, demonstrating superior performance through a practical use case. Model output is rigorously validated against ground truth data using proven devices. The proposed methodology yields demonstrably improved and refined obstacle and environment classification.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

The present study adopted a quasi-experimental design using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method to explore the long-term effects of an AWE system known as Utah Compose on students’ state test English Language Arts (ELA) performance. The participants included 134,425 students in Grades 4–10 in Utah from school year 2015 to 2018. Findings showed AWE’s cumulative benefit to students’ ELA performance, but those cumulative effects decreased each year and peaked after three years of implementation. This study is the largest evaluation of AWE effects to date in terms of both its sample size and the duration of investigation. The findings regarding AWE’s cumulative effects on students’ state test ELA performance, which is a distal outcome at the state level, have significant implications for policy and practice regarding large-scale AWE implementation.</jats:p>"

The most common application of the term \"green HR\" is to describe how people management practices and policies support the larger business environmental objective. Of all the production inputs, human resources are the most valuable. However, human resource management oversees all organizational operations and is essential to the growth of any corporation.For most HRM professionals and scholars today, green resource management is a new idea. An organization's employees are always encouraged to go green by GHRM. A human resource principle and policy known as \"green HRM\" aims to promote sustainable management in businesses. The prime focus of this research paper is to to study the concept, significance benefits and limitations of green HRM. This research paper also focuses on how far it is helpful in contributing human and technical sustainability in the organization to the maximum extent and the implementation process of GHRM in companies.</jats:p>"

Ports still face issues, including insufficient cargo handling equipment or equipment sharing during loading and unloading, which requires manual container inspection and delays clearance. This research aims to enhance the port logistics performance at one of India's cargo-handling ports. This paper seeks to identify various situations, actors, processes, learnings, actions and performance metrics particular to India's major container handling port.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The study objectives are accomplished using the Situation-Actor-Process–Learning-Action-Performance (SAP-LAP) framework, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Interpretive Ranking Process (IRP). The FAHP prioritises or ranks actions in a fuzzy environment.

The analytical tool used to test the hypothesis is Partial Least Square (PLS) with the help of smart PLS software version 4.0. The research results succeeded in proving a direct relationship between the management control system affecting firm capability, the management control system on firm performance, and firm capability on firm performance. Apart from that, the results of this research also prove that firm capability can mediate the relationship between the management control system and firm performance. This indicates that the company’s success in achieving optimal performance and achieving competitive advantage lies in the strategy of implementing the management control system and firm capability. Therefore, the company continues to improve its management control system and capability so that firm performance can improve and achieve competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

This study seeks to examine the impact of employee performance on the application of TQM tools, focusing on the experiences of working mothers in public and private sectors. The labor force statistics do not provide a specific percentage of working mothers. Working mothers encounter challenges from workplace, organization, family, colleagues, as well as society. This chapter utilized quantitative studies. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 working mothers. The questionnaires were organized into five primary sections: demographic information, total quality management, job satisfaction, policy management, and performance evaluation. The subsections are organized into five distinct policies: breastfeeding-friendly, maternity, paternity, support, and work flexibility. The findings indicate that policies are not implemented correctly. If implemented effectively, mothers would experience enhanced performance, improved mental health, a positive environment, and a more manageable balance between caring for their child and work.</jats:p>"

Data analysis includes descriptive statistics for initial data review and inferential statistics using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test hypotheses, with a significance level set at 0.05.Results – human resource management practices, particularly in the areas of recruitment and selection, reward system, career management and performance appraisal, have a statistically significant influence on employee performance at Cadre Training and Conference Center (Hotel) in Xicheng District, Beijing, with a predictive power of 83.3%.Implications – The study suggests key implications for enhancing employee performance. Companies should improve performance appraisal systems to ensure fairness, transparency, and alignment with organizational goals. Recruitment processes should be thorough and transparent, attracting the right talent and supporting employee integration. A fair and well-communicated reward system is essential for maintaining motivation, and companies should offer additional benefits to meet employee needs. Lastly, clear career management strategies should be implemented to support employee growth, with regular monitoring to align career development with organizational goals.Originality/Value – This study offers new insights into how specific HRM practices—recruitment, reward systems, career management, and performance appraisals—significantly impact employee performance in the hospitality sector. It provides practical recommendations for improving HR strategies, making it valuable for HR professionals and managers in similar settings.</jats:p>"

Using basic random sampling methods, the appropriate respondents were chosen from the target groups. The relationship between competitive advantages and the mediating impact was examined using the structural equation model (SEM) with AMOS software. The findings suggest that increased organizational performance and a stronger competitive advantage can arise from higher levels of logistical practice. Additionally, a competitive edge can directly and favorably affect the functioning of a business. Hence, in order to support MSEs, policy makers, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and other interested parties should focus on giving them the tools and training they need to advance their eco-logistics practices, which will boost their organizational performance and competitiveness.</jats:p>"

This research employs a quantitative method with AHP to analyze homemakers' preferences when selecting melon gas cylinders. AHP breaks down complex problems into a simple hierarchical structure, facilitating priority determination. The study involves homemakers chosen through purposive sampling. Data were collected through questionnaires covering relevant criteria and sub-criteria, using a Likert scale to measure the importance of each criterion. The research results based on dynamic sensitivity analysis show that price is the most important factor, followed by ease of use. This study provides a clear picture of the relative weights of various criteria and alternatives when choosing melon gas cylinders. The study's conclusion indicates that homemakers prefer subsidized gas over non-subsidized gas.</jats:p>"

It seeks to explain how organizations might utilize SSC and SCMP to improve performance by promoting ethical practices and good leadership. An empirical analysis was performed utilizing data gathered from 350 respondents from enterprises across several industries in Bangladesh through a quota sampling strategy. We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the direct and indirect effects. Ethical Dilemma (ETD) and Leadership (LED) quality were used as mediating variables. The results indicate that SSC and SCMP have a beneficial effect on SCP, with LED quality as a significant mediator. However, less directly impactful, ETD creates an essential framework for ethical practices inside the supply chain. The Importance-Performance Map highlights LED quality and SCMP as critical elements to improving SCP, suggesting that firms must prioritize these areas for optimal performance. The study's weaknesses include its cross-sectional methodology and concentration on a small geographic area, which may impact generalization. Future research may investigate SSC's long-term effects on SCP and future technologies' influence on ethical decision-making in global supply chains. This work enhances SSC literature by highlighting the significance of LED quality and ETDs as mediators in the link between SSC, SCMP and SCP.</jats:p>"

While QM practices have been extensively studied in manufacturing and service sectors, their application in HEIs remains underexplored, particularly in terms of distinguishing between soft (human-centered) and hard (technical) practices. This research addresses that gap by adopting a multidimensional perspective to examine how both soft and hard QM practices influence organizational performance and sustainability. The findings show that balancing soft QM elements, such as top management support, student focus, supplier management, people management, strategic planning, with hard QM processes, like process management, information and analysis, continuous improvement, and program design are critical to improving performance and fostering sustainability in HEIs.</jats:p>"

For this reason, the use of solar energy systems is increasing today. This study combines experimental data and machine learning algorithms to evaluate the energy performance of four different photovoltaic (PV) panel designs (monocrystalline, polycrystalline, flexible, and transparent) under harsh environmental conditions on Horseshoe Island (Antarctica). In this research, the effects of environmental factors, such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, on the panels were analyzed. Electrical power output of the PV panels are analyzed using six machine learning models. Random forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB) models showed the highest accuracy and reliability among these models. According to the experimental results, Monocrystalline PV provided the highest electrical power (20.5 Watts on average), and Flexible PV provided the highest energy efficiency (19.67%). However, Flexible PV was observed to have higher surface temperatures compared to the other panel types. Furthermore, using Monocrystalline PV resulted in an average reduction of 4.1 tons of CO2 emissions per year, demonstrating the positive environmental impact of renewable energy systems. Thanks to this study, renewable energy research for temporary stations in Antarctica will focus on explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence models that will provide an understanding of the factors affecting the energy performance of PV panels. The research results will be an important guide for optimizing energy consumption, management, and demand forecasting in temporary research stations in Antarctica.</jats:p>"

The present study was conducted by integrating inorganic fertilizers with Azotobacter chroococcum as an N-fixer and Aspergillus niger as a P-solubilizer. Further, zinc was provided as ZnSO4 (0.5%) and/or boron as borax (0.2%) through foliar spray. The study was conducted during 2020-21 and 2021-22, and pooled data were analyzed to test the efficacy of treatments. The observations recorded on various parameters revealed that the application of 75% of the recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) supplemented with Azotobacter as an N-fixer in combination with recommended doses of phosphorous and potassium and foliar spray of zinc as ZnSO4 (0.5%) and boron as borax (0.2%) resulted in highest average plant height (30.997, 63.767, 97.577, and 108.957 cm, respectively), per plant count of branches (4.242, 13.063, 22.227, and 29.750, respectively) and leaves (31.033, 54.433, 74.533, and 86.900, respectively). The chlorophyll content (64.490 mg/g), leaf area index (0.757), total plant biomass (3,719.52 g), and the average fruit weight (173.83 g/fruit) in brinjal were recorded. The best-integrated approach for brinjal cultivation was ascertained as (i) 75% RDN + 100% recommended dose of phosphorous (RDP) + 100% recommended dose of potassium (RDK) + N-fixer, and (ii) 75% RDN + 75% RDP + 100% RDK + N-fixer + P-solubilizer when applied in combination with foliar spray of zinc as ZnSO4 (0.5%), and boron as borax (0.2%)..

The objective of this study was to analyze the different approaches to vaccine administration implemented by several Italian regions since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: After careful qualitative review of information gathered from scientific articles, official reports (grey literature), contact with regional health authorities, and local health departments, five vaccination strategies across several Italian regions focusing on alternative vaccine providers and/or settings were identified. The innovative practices implemented by different actors covered specific topics and were then examined and described in detail. Results: In Veneto, where prevention departments were the main actor, herpes zoster vaccination coverage for the 65-year-old cohort increased from 44.4% to 54.9%; in Tuscany, family pediatricians administered 64% of all childhood vaccines; in Liguria, pharmacies delivered 70.1% of COVID-19 vaccines, while vaccinating in schools in Taranto led to higher human papilloma virus vaccination rates compared to regional and national averages. Finally, in all the regions, hospitals focused on vaccinating healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. Conclusions: The positive outcomes of these five experiences may, in a context of limited resources, encourage other national and international entities to adopt innovative practices, which offer new perspectives beyond the traditional delivery methods (i.e., local health authority vaccination centers for childhood and adolescent immunizations, and family doctors for adults and the elderly). These strategies suggest the efficacy of specific local approaches favored by regional autonomy in optimizing vaccine distribution and coverage.</jats:p>"

Surgical intervention is often necessary to correct affected anatomy and alleviate symptoms, yet post-surgical management is also crucial. This literature review aims to investigate surgical approaches and post-surgical management of AC in children, as well as identify remaining knowledge gaps. Literature search was systematically conducted through PubMed using relevant keywords. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies within the past 15 years pertaining to pediatric neurosurgery and Chiari. The literature review identified 6 relevant studies highlighting the importance of intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring, comparison of outcomes between posterior decompression with and without duraplasty, correlation of CSF flow with surgical outcomes, post-operative pain management, and indications for syringosubarachnoid shunt placement. Surgical intervention for AC in children is a critical step, yet meticulous post-surgical management is required. Studies highlight knowledge gaps regarding long-term effects of intraoperative monitoring techniques, outcome comparisons between surgical procedures, the relationship between CSF flow and surgical outcomes, and post-operative pain management. Cross-disciplinary collaboration and emphasis on a holistic approach are necessary to enhance understanding and care of AC in children.</jats:p>"

Conducted from June 1 to September 1, 2024, this study employs a qualitative method with descriptive analysis. Data were collected through literature reviews, direct observations, and interviews with staff and management involved in the service delivery process. The findings reveal that the service planning at the UPTD Animal Health Center and Veterinary Public Health has not effectively engaged farmers, which has resulted in a disconnect between the programs offered and the actual needs of the farming community. Although the internal organization of the center is assessed as practical, the accessibility of services for farmers residing in remote areas remains a significant concern that requires attention. The execution of veterinary health services showcases the competence and skills of health workers. However, there are notable deficiencies in communication and the availability of information that hinder effective service delivery. Furthermore, the existing control system does not adequately accommodate user feedback, highlighting an urgent need for enhanced communication channels. Overall, this research aims to provide actionable recommendations to improve the quality of veterinary health services in Seruyan Regency, ultimately fostering a more responsive and user-centered service environment. The insights gained from this study will contribute to the ongoing efforts to align veterinary health services with the community's needs, ensuring better health outcomes for livestock and the farming population.</jats:p>"

The purpose is to formulate an effective strategy to enhance social and economic growth in the village through improved infrastructure. This research adopts a descriptive qualitative method, involving primary data from interviews and observations and secondary data from various references. The findings reveal that Tamansari Village's road infrastructure development aims to optimize natural resource potential, enhance the local economy, and improve the quality of life for residents. Strengths include strong community participation and government support, while weaknesses include limited budgets and road maintenance issues. Opportunities such as economic growth and tourism development contrast with threats like policy changes and worker safety risks. The study concludes that addressing these challenges requires strategies including improved budget management, workforce training, socialization, and maintenance programs to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of road development efforts. The results provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders in rural development initiatives.</jats:p>"

While applauded for adhering to the UNSCR 1325 normative commitments on women's roles in peace processes, it's unclear how adopting a gender perspective affects the entire agreement's implementation success. This article analyzes monthly data on the implementation of 578 stipulations and 70 subthemes (reforms or programs) and evaluates peace implementation from a gender perspective. The findings from the stipulation level analysis reveal an implementation gap between gender and gender‐neutral or non‐gender provisions. The subtheme level analyses further confirm this finding that gender provisions alone do not contribute to the overall peace implementation success; rather, implementing those provisions is foundational for advancing the overall peace implementation.</jats:p>"

The study used the mixed method whereby the sample size was 400 heads of households while purposive sampling enabled to obtain 8 Village Committees and 8 Monitoring Officers. Quantitative data was analysed using Pearson’s correlation and regression model while qualitative data was analysed using content analysis. The study established a significant influence between households’ involvement in the implementation of the M&amp;E plan (t= 8.472, p-value =.000) on the performance of the Tanzania CCTP. It was recommended therefore that the Tanzania CCTP M&amp;E policy should be reviewed to ensure it is vital for households’ involvement in the M&amp;E cycle. The research recommended further study on the organizational practice and level of use of M&amp;E information for further improving performance.</jats:p>"

This research investigates advancements in dental implant technology, including material innovations, surface treatments, and osseointegration techniques, which contribute to improved patient outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of material selection, design, and stress analysis and fatigue life for better treatment. Additionally, this study explores the role of biocompatible materials, such as titanium, zirconia alloys and ceramic composites, in enhancing implant durability and integration. The impact of digital dentistry tools, including computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) for custom implants, was analysed to determine their effect on surgical precision and recovery times. Results indicate that enhanced surface treatments and optimized implant geometries significantly increase stability and longevity, reducing complications associated with traditional implants. These findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary advancements in improving the reliability of dental implants and suggest future directions for further refinement.</jats:p>"

All steps applied aimed at optimizing the tool arrangement, streamlining the workflows, and encouraging a culture of cleanliness and continuous improvement. Results show major cuts in the time it takes to get tools, and improvements are evident in the workplace safety, employee engagement, and cost efficiency. Shadow boarding and standard practices in the rearrangement of tools allowed SLBL to establish a clean environment conducive to increased productivity. The specific research objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of 5S on productivity and efficiency, determine its effects on quality and cost reduction, and analyze its role in enhancing employee morale and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. The findings indicate quantitative improvements in retrieval times and cost savings, highlighting the methodology's effectiveness in attaining productivity gains and operational excellence.</jats:p>"

Research into new programming languages and techniques is essential because it makes the design, implementation, and application of automation to general or particular problem-solving ever easier, more accessible, and more performant. GPLs typically are designed to be purely domain agnostic---meaning they can be applied in any field, for any problem kind. However, this normally also makes them hard and difficult to use in problems where non-programmers or even experts with little or no GPL programming skills are required to leverage programmatic problem-solving capabilities, which is why DSLs come into play; they are generally more fine-tuned toward improving human productivity and performance than that of the machine, while making solving particular, domain-oriented problems simpler. In this paper, we review the literature concerning how to design and then fully implement a new DSL, with a special focus on a DSL for generic problem-solving leveraging Text Processing methods---a Text Processing Language (TPL). We consider leveraging the Design Research paradigm as a systematic framework for guiding research into the development of new TPLs. We present for the first time, a new unifying theory concerning general, but also TPL-specific language engineering theory and guiding frameworks---UPLT, PLEF \\&amp;amp; PLEf. With a re-introduction of the SOE framework, we consider quantitative and qualitative evaluation of software languages, with specific focus on programming languages. Finally, we highlight identified pending problems for future theoretical and pragmatic research into the field of language engineering, especially with a focus on TPLs.</jats:p>"

The PEARLS Equity Study guided new dissemination and implementation strategies that aligned with the strengths, priorities, and needs of community-based social service organizations (CBOs) including cultural organizations, area agencies on aging, senior centers, and family and human services agencies. New communication approaches included proactive group and 1:1 outreach to organizations; a new peer-to-peer video with PEARLS organizations sharing how they have reached underserved communities; and updated PEARLS messaging that resonated with values of CBO leadership, staff and clients. For example, new messaging included downplaying “evidence-based program” which has often been used to promote programs that were not designed with diverse older adults, and instead amplifying stories of impact that highlight both quantitative and qualitative changes in outcomes that mattered. New supports for program adoption included 1:1 support calls for tailored guidance for different CBO, staff, and community contexts; distance on-demand training with trainers from diverse CBOs to improve accessibility and sustainability; and Zoom webinars and community conversations co-led by PEARLS partners (including local partners featured during this GSA Symposium) and our research center that targeted what CBOs are looking for to address depression and disconnectedness in their communities. Our community-academic partnership and PEARLS community of practice continues to engage regularly to share adaptations as an implementation strategy for health equity.</jats:p>"

The study objective sought to establish the influence of principals’ management of teachers’ working conditions on students’ academic performance. Such conditions included the provision of adequate teaching and learning resources, essential facilities, and supportive environments. Additionally, the study explored challenges such as inadequate facilities, long commutes, and poor working conditions that hinder effective school operations and academic success. The study used  descriptive survey research design to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. The target population for this study consisted of all 26 principals from the 26 public day secondary schools and all 249 teachers in Kitui West Sub County. The study used census and systematic sampling technique to obtain a sample of 26 principals and 38 teachers respectively. The study used questionnaires as data collection tools. Instrument reliability was determined by a test re test technique. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse data. Quantitative data was analysed and presented using frequency distribution tables and cross tabulation tables. Qualitative data was analysed by organizing it into themes in line with the research objective and presented narratively. The study found that 80% of principals and 86.9% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that effective management of working conditions, including adequate teaching resources and addressing facility deficiencies, positively influences academic performance. However, challenges like long commutes, lack of facilities, and poor working conditions hinder school responsibilities and achievement. The study concluded that effective principals’ management of teacher working conditions positively influences student performance. However, issues such as institutional deficiencies hinder academic success. The study recommends that principals and school management to prioritize on improvement of working conditions, address infrastructural deficiencies and providing adequate resources and support the motivation of teachers in order to enhance students’ academic performance.</jats:p>"

This research develops an emergency grid disruption timeline with MNR deployments to respond and recover grids after severe weather events. This response integrates a series of models for transportation networks, power distribution, and decision strategies that utilize MNR capabilities while using real-world disruption events within the past decade for scenarios. The study then seeks to analyze the performance of MNRs when using different deployment strategies for emergency grid disruption response. First, this research investigates the trade-offs between time and cost in the emergency grid disruption timeline when integrating MNRs. This research also explores the conditions of disruption scenarios that contribute to the best MNR performance in grid recovery.</jats:p>"

The research highlights the importance of both internal resources and external factors in achieving sustainability goals. Using a quantitative approach and a descriptive survey design, data were collected from 374 manufacturing firms in Ghana and 379 in Indonesia. The study employed a structured questionnaire and applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to analyze the relationship between sustainable logistics practices, IoT growth, and sustainability performance. Sustainable logistics practices positively influence sustainability performance, with IoT moderating this relationship. Firms in Indonesia demonstrated higher performance due to advanced IoT infrastructure, while Ghana showed limitations due to less developed technological infrastructure. The findings emphasize the need for investment in IoT infrastructure to enhance the effectiveness of sustainable logistics practices, particularly in developing countries. The study contributes new insights into the moderating role of IoT in sustainability and offers practical guidance for policymakers and businesses. This study provides a novel cross-country perspective on how IoT development influences the effectiveness of sustainable logistics practices in emerging economies, bridging gaps in the existing literature on technology-driven sustainability strategies.</jats:p>"

Quantitative Train-of-Four (TOF) monitoring has emerged as a tool for ensuring precise neuromuscular blockade management. Objectives: This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of neuromuscular blockade reversal guided by quantitative TOF monitoring with reversal conducted without such monitoring. Methods: A literature-based analysis was conducted, evaluating existing data and trends regarding the use of quantitative TOF monitoring in clinical practice. Performance metrics, such as precision in blockade reversal, efficiency, and associated outcomes, were assessed to highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach. Results: Findings demonstrated that quantitative TOF monitoring facilitates a more consistent and reliable reversal of neuromuscular blockade. It reduces the risk of residual paralysis and enhances patient safety. In contrast, practices without TOF monitoring showed variability in outcomes, reflecting potential gaps in blockade management. Conclusions: Incorporating quantitative TOF monitoring into anesthesia practices improves the accuracy of neuromuscular blockade reversal, emphasizing its importance in modern anesthetic care. The study underscores the need for broader adoption of such technologies to standardize outcomes and enhance procedural safety.</jats:p>"

Despite FI's crucial role in resource allocation and national stability, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive research on the significance of sustainable practices for driving financial performance (hereto FP) within these institutions. This study addresses this gap through a systematic review of 533 articles from (1983–2024), employing bibliometric analysis to map key contributors, themes, and future research directions. Additionally, a meta‐analysis of 40 articles assesses the relationship between sustainable practices and banks' FP. Results show a positive yet weak association between the two, suggesting that banks have not fully embraced sustainable principles in it. Social and governance practices positively correlated with FP, while environmental factors exhibit a negative relationship. This may be due to the required investment, the time differential to materialize the same, and other factors adhering to the relationship, such as innovation, development of sustainable products, or adherence to sustainable processes for screening investment choices. The study concludes by discussing implications and offering suggestions for further research.</jats:p>"

Araling Panlipunan (term for Social Studies in the Philippines) is one of the subjects included in the K-12 curriculum that learners tend to find uninteresting. It is often ignored and considered as a minor subject.  \nObjectives. To gain insight into the problem and contribute to addressing it, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of LaroTuro (Teaching Game Approach in the Philippines) as an intervention in improving test performance in the Araling Panlipunan.\nMaterials and methods. Using an embedded experimental mixed-method design, twenty-eight (28) selected Grade III learners from Dadiangas West Central Elementary School participated in the study during the 2023-2024 academic year. Pre-test and post-test assessments, along with interviews, were conducted. A statistical analysis involved in carrying out the study comprised t-tests, descriptive statistics, and thematic analysis to measure the effect of the intervention.\nResults. The findings revealed that before implementing the method of LaroTuro as an intervention, learners had a very low level of test performance in the Araling Panlipunan due to factors like information overload, teacher-centered instruction, and limited engagement. However, after the intervention, they achieved a high level and significant enhancement in test performance, attributing to the features of the intervention such as comprehensible scope and sequence of topics, participatory game-based learning, and questioning techniques.\nConclusion. LaroTuro effectively improves the learners’ test performance in Araling Panlipunan, elaborated by relationship patterns between factors and features. This research recommended conducting further studies incorporating other local games to optimize the effectiveness and practicability of LaroTuro.</jats:p>"

Still, access to it by primary care healthcare professionals (HCPs), coupled with appropriate training, would improve the diagnosis and management of patients with MODY2. Thus, to evaluate the implementation in primary care of genetic testing for the screening of MODY2 (iMOgene study), an implementation pilot study has been designed supported by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Method and analysis</jats:title><jats:p>Two primary care clinics will be involved in the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (Québec, Canada).

To overcome these obstacles, we propose solutions aimed at defining the business view of EIS. This study addresses these issues by proposing solutions tailored to the business view of EIS. Specifically, it introduces the core ontology of sensitive business processes (COSBP), a conceptual framework designed to formalize and define the multidimensional dimensions of sensitive business processes (SBPs). By providing a unified structure of central concepts and semantic relationships, COSBP enhances both knowledge management (KM) and business process management (BPM) in organizational contexts.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This paper adopts the design science research methodology covering the phases of a design-oriented research project that develops new artifacts, such as the COSBP ontology, based on SBP modeling requirements. Following a formal multi-level, multi-component approach, COSBP is structured into sub-ontologies across different abstraction levels. Built upon the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) foundational ontology, COSBP integrates and extends core concepts from core domain ontologies in business processes. The framework specifies six key modeling dimensions of SBPs – functional, organizational, behavioral, informational, intentional and knowledge – each represented as a distinct class of ontological modules (OMs).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>COSBP offers a semantically rich and precise framework for modeling SBPs, addressing complexity and ambiguity in conceptual modeling. It supports the creation of expressive and effective SBP models while enabling consensus-driven representation at a generic level. Additionally, COSBP serves as a foundation for extending modeling notations and developing tools that align with these notations. Its application in enterprise environments improves the integration, adaptability and interoperability of EISs, ultimately enhancing organizational processes and decision-making.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The development of the COSBP ontology holds considerable potential for application in various industries beyond its original focus on business process management and KM. The ontology’s capability to semantically model sensitive, knowledge-intensive and dynamic processes can be extended to other real-life scenarios in other complex domains and sectors – for example, finance and banking, government and public services, insurance, manufacturing and supply chain management, retail, E-commerce, logistics and transportation crisis management, government and public services, higher education and so on. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with the COSBP ontology, we aim to enable more intelligent decision-making, process monitoring and improved management of SBPs in knowledge-driven domains.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

There are obstacles in running the business with the sales target that was set in 2019 being unable to be achieved. It is known from the small number of Instagram account followers compared to other competitors. Another factor is the low level of brand awareness obtained when obtaining results based on a preliminary survey. Zflora Gardening has not been able to optimize the implementation of its marketing communications. This research produces an integrated system design related to improving the marketing communications program at Zflora Gardening using the benchmarking method with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool. This research resulted in an improvement plan for 14 marketing communications criteria tailored to Zflora Gardening's capabilities.</jats:p>"

Literature abounds with versions of Six Sigma and discourses on other quality management tools and models, frequently portraying the models as exclusive of each other. This chapter examines the philosophical underpinnings of Six Sigma and its methodological contrivances. The literature review stretched across specialist journals, blogs and texts. Ten quality specialists and six trainers/tutors within Six Sigma curriculum were engaged in qualitative discussions. Gathered data was treated synthetically within a continual comparative framework. Conspicuous observations were the migration of Six Sigma into the service industry accompanied by data science and data analytics. The use of control charts, check sheets, graphs, flowcharts, scatters, Pareto and Ishikawa processes stood at the centre of high-intensity users of Six Sigma. Six Sigma is used in a somewhat monolithic or dogmatic way by many. Failure to appreciate the symbiotic relationship among elements of Six Sigma, or within other models and between Six Sigma and other quality models, would attest to the need to improve conceptual, managerial and technical understanding of the value of Six Sigma in the pursuit of continual improvement, however measured. Further to this, it is recommendable that organisations deliberately embed quality training in their Learning and Development curriculum focusing on skilling more than on fulfilling external, or top-level imperatives.</jats:p>"

Developed in partnership between the Department of Penal Management of the State of Paraná (DEPPEN) and the State University of Ponta Grossa (UEPG), the project integrates the fields of Law, Psychology, and Social Work.\r\n \r\nTheoretical Framework: The research is based on approaches from Critical Criminology and the Economic Theory of Crime, considering structural and social factors that impact the reintegration process.\r\n \r\nMethod: The analysis is based on data collected from 660 monitored individuals in the region of Ponta Grossa between July and September 2023. Socioeconomic and social vulnerability indicators, such as income, education, and labor market participation, were evaluated.\r\n \r\nResults and Discussion: Despite being in its initial phase, the project shows positive trends, including a reduction in incidents during the analyzed period. However, challenges persist related to social vulnerability and the stigma associated with the use of electronic monitoring devices.\r\n \r\nResearch Implications: This study contributes to the advancement of public policies for decarceration, proposing strategies to strengthen interdisciplinary practices and promote greater social inclusion for monitored individuals.\r\n \r\nOriginality/Value: The research highlights NUPEM/UEPG's innovative role in integrating academia and the penal system, providing evidence to improve social reintegration policies aligned with the 2030 Agenda.</jats:p>"

BAPPEDA as an agency that has the duties, principals and functions of planning regional development in the focus of RKPD planning includes situation analysis, formulation of vision, mission and objectives, identification of programs and activities, budgeting, public consultation and approval. This research aims to analyze the performance of BAPPEDA in the process of preparing the RKPK and the factors that influence the process of preparing it. The theory used is the Organizational Performance theory according to Agus Dwiyanto with indicators of productivity, responsiveness and accountability. The research method uses a qualitative approach. The research results show that the performance of BAPPEDA Gayo Lues in the RKPK preparation process is still not optimal, this is due to the implementation of the RKPK preparation from preparation to completion not being on time, as well as inconsistencies between the RKPK and the KUA/PPAS and the RAPBD. In the productivity aspect, it is known that BAPPEDA's performance greatly determines the success in preparing the District Development Work Plan. The problem that occurs is the RKPK not being completed on time according to the specified targets. Factors that influence BAPPEDA's responsiveness include human resources, sufficient budget and collaboration with stakeholders. by external factors such as political intervention which results in a lack of transparency and affects public accountability. The internal factor that influences the performance of BAPPEDA Gayo Lues Regency is that the number of human resources who are expert planners is still very minimal and the workload is not balanced with the number of human resources, while the external factor that influences the performance of BAPPEDA Gayo Lues Regency is the influence of political bureaucracy in preparing the RKPK which also influences the inconsistency of the RKPK</jats:p>"

To categorize interrelationships and generate feedback loops, survey data were analyzed using descriptive and correlation statistics and interpreted alongside interview data analyzed using content analysis.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The survey results (pre <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 53 and post <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 40) for each outcome showed a similar midpoint mean, wide ranges, and little change post implementation (Acceptability: pre <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 3.55, range 2–5 post <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 3.56, range 1.5–5; Appropriateness: pre <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 3.35, range 1–5, post <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 3.48, range 1–5; Feasibility: pre <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 3.30, post<jats:italic> M</jats:italic> = 3.32; range 1.25–5).

The identification of early predictors of cardiovascular pathology is crucial for effective management.\nThe objective: to develop a statistical model that significantly predicts the mGla protein level, a marker of vascular microcalcification, in children with FH by analyzing the relationships between dietary habits, health-related quality of life, physical activity energy expenditure, extended lipid profile, dp-uc MGP protein levels, and results from instrumental examinations.\nMaterials and methods. Food habits, quality of life, energy expenditure for physical activity, lipid profiles, and dp-uc MGP protein levels were assessed in children from the Ukrainian FH registry. A multivariate regression model was developed to identify significant predictors of cardiovascular pathology, namely the level of the vascular microcalcification biomarker.\nResults. The regression model demonstrated that the predictors explained 91.01% of the variance (R2 = 0.91; p &lt; 0.0001). Age and cholesterol intake were significant predictors (β = 19.16; p = 0.0039 and β = 0.70; p = 0.0013, respectively). These results highlight the impact of chronic cholesterol exposure on cardiovascular health in children with HF.\nConclusions. The study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to the treatment of HF, combining medical and psychosocial support, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in pediatric patients.</jats:p>"

Organizations are progressively recognizing the importance of their employees and their well-being in excelling in competitive environments, as employee well-being significantly influences employee performance (Kun &amp; Gadanecz, 2022) and organizational success. The theories of Social Identity and Self-Categorization offer a comprehensive framework for understanding how individuals form their self-concept based on group affiliations and how these identities shape their behavior and interactions within the workplace. Using an integrated theoretical framework grounded in the social identity approach, encompassing both Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorization Theory, this chapter will examine the detrimental effects of toxic followership on employee well-being by synthesizing existing literature with fresh insights.</jats:p>"

The application was built using the Flask framework and integrated with the Yahoo Finance API for real-time stock data retrieval. The TOPSIS method evaluated stock alternatives based on criteria such as closing price, P/E ratio, revenue growth, and dividend per share. Testing included functional evaluation, response time analysis, and simulations of three investor scenarios: High Risk-High Return, Low Risk-Low Return, and Balanced. Results indicate that the application effectively delivers stock recommendations aligned with investor preferences, achieving an average response time of 1–4 seconds per feature. Simulations highlight its adaptability in adjusting criteria weights to match different risk profiles. Despite limitations due to external API dependencies, the application demonstrates effectiveness as a decision support tool for stock investment, offering accessibility and flexibility to investors.</jats:p>"

The goal is to assist researchers, developers, and practitioners in comparing and extrapolating the best solutions for high-precision MXR tools in medical and wellness contexts.\n\nMethods: To develop the taxonomy, a review of medical and MXR publications was conducted, followed by three systematic mapping studies. Applications were categorized by end-users and purposes. The first mapping cross-referenced digital health technology classifications. The second validated the structure by incorporating over 350 evidence-based MXR apps, with input from twenty XR-HCI researchers. The third, ongoing mapping adds emerging apps, refining the taxonomy further.\n\nResults: The taxonomy is presented in a dynamic database and 3D interactive graph, allowing international researchers to visualize and discuss developed evidence-based medical and wellness XR applications. This formalizes prior efforts to distinguish validated MXR solutions from speculative ones.\n\nConclusion: The taxonomy focuses solely on evidence-based applications, highlighting areas where VR, AR, and MR have been successfully implemented. It serves as a tool for stakeholders to analyze and understand best practices in MXR design, promoting the development of safe, effective, and user-friendly medical and wellness applications.</jats:p>"

Consequently, primary care is being strengthened by developing new facilities. As the design of healthcare facilities inevitably entails a delicate balance between various needs and requirements (functional, spatial, environmental, etc.), alongside economic constraints, it is important to determine which elements should be prioritised in the design of new primary care facilities. For this reason, building performance evaluation (BPE) has become a critical aspect of the design, construction and operation of buildings. BPE tools may provide a rational basis to guide designers and local public authorities in decision-making and in prioritising design objectives to optimise primary care facility design as well as to verify design quality in post-occupancy phases. The aim of this chapter is to analyse validated evaluation tools for healthcare-built environments to provide a comprehensive understanding of their main characteristics (target audience, aspects investigated, application phases, data collection methods, expected outcomes and impacts), thereby developing a guideline framework to streamline the adaptation or development of tools specifically tailored to primary care facilities.</jats:p>"

The planning of railway lines, however, needs to take the complex terrain into account. For areas with land parcels separated by wide and deep water bodies, the railway connection is even more challenging. Submerged floating tunnels (SFTs), on the other hand, become an appealing option to connect the separated land parcels. They utilize the natural water buoyancy to support the weight and payloads of the structure and traffic. They have a much lower dependency on the seabed conditions as opposed to their bottom-founded counterparts. They are also submerged at a certain depth below the water surface, which reduces the wave loads acting on the structure and provides a navigation clearance for passing vessels. Owing to the numerous advantages of such structural systems, they have attracted interest among both researchers and engineers. However, the research on the use of such transport infrastructure for safe and comfortable train travel is limited. In this paper, the dynamic responses of a train traveling across an SFT subjected to wave loads are examined. The SFT is modeled as a slender beam according to the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. The hydrodynamic responses of the SFT subjected to various wave conditions are analyzed using SIMA/RIFLEX. Then, the responses are extracted as input to a train model idealized as a multi-body system for the calculation of the vehicle dynamics. This study aims to propose a computationally efficient method for the evaluation of the safety and comfort of train travel inside an SFT in an environmentally exposed location. Results show that travel rides inside SFTs are generally good under the normal design operational conditions. When the sea conditions are rough, limiting the operational train speeds may be necessary as the vertical acceleration is approaching 0.6 m/s<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Under extreme sea conditions, the SFTs should be closed to traffic.</jats:p>"

This is a field that has grown and evolved from the ground as schools face the need to include additional language learning and develop bilingual programmes as part of their curricula. This article reports on the research findings of an action research exploratory study in a Montessori school in Scotland, which was a follow-up to a three-year action research inquiry in Mexico into the development of a second language programme in a Montessori setting. It shows how another target language in a different national context influences how an implementation process is shaped and some of the factors that come into play. Results are presented considering four phases spread in four school years with the experimentation and strategies used and trialled during this time across school levels. It shows different ways to integrate additional languages into the Montessori learning environment that correspond to strong and weak bilingual programmes (Baker 2001) and some of the factors that influence an effective implementation such as continuity, consistency, and alignment with a school’s needs and priorities among others. Language Learning programmes in Montessori settings need to be considered from the perspective of the child, the teachers, the parents and the school as they all integrate to create tailor made bilingual programmes that respond to the context, characteristic and resources of the school.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes an innovative guided performance evaluation mechanism that incorporates two core algorithms: online information updating and secondary assessment feedback. The former ensures the timeliness and accuracy of the evaluation results through real-time monitoring and updating of students' learning status, while the latter realizes the expansion of the evaluation subject and the improvement of the feedback mechanism through the interaction between tutors and students. Then, this paper adopts the hierarchical analysis method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to conduct empirical research, and the results show that the proposed guided performance evaluation mechanism can effectively improve students' satisfaction with the performance evaluation system and promote the enhancement of their independent learning ability.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Shipyards are places where new ships are built, routine and mandatory maintenance and dismantling of ships are carried out and a wide range of work equipment and chemicals are used during these processes. The fact that most of the world is covered with water and that maritime transportation is advantageous compared to other types of transportation brings maritime transportation to the forefront. This situation also leads to an increase in work intensity in shipyards. Therefore, occupational health and safety (OHS) practices are also important in shipyards. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the OHS Management System (OHSMS) performances of shipyard enterprises and to rank the shipyard enterprises selected as alternatives according to their OHSMS performances in line with the determined criteria. In the first stage, five main and 16 sub-criteria as OHSMS performance criteria and five alternative shipyard enterprises were identified through literature research. In line with the expert opinions, the weights of the criteria were found with the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method, one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods, and the alternative priority order for the criteria was determined with the Fuzzy PROMETHEE (FPROMETHEE) method using the results obtained from the FAHP method. As a result of the analysis, the main criterion \"Management Review\" was determined as the criterion with the highest weight ratio. As a result of the operations carried out with the criterion weights determined by FAHP, Shipyard 3 alternative was ranked first in terms of OHSMS performance in the priority ranking made by using FPROMETHEE method. In this study, OHSMS performance evaluation in shipyard enterprises has been carried out by using FAHP and FPROMETHEE methods, which are multi-criteria decision-making methods, and the findings have contributed to the shipyard sector and the literature.</jats:p>"

Drawing on a mixed-methods design, the study involved twenty secondary school teachers who employed formative assessment strategies—such as peer review, open-ended questioning, and real-time feedback—over one academic semester. Both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that continuous, context-specific feedback significantly improves students’ critical thinking skills, motivation, and metacognitive awareness. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of classroom observations and focus group interviews reveals that systematic formative assessments encourage a shift from passive reception to active collaboration, leading to greater learner autonomy and self-efficacy. While some students initially demonstrated discomfort with these collaborative strategies, they gradually adapted and reported increased confidence in their learning process. The findings underscore the potential of modern assessment frameworks to reshape traditional teacher-centered paradigms, catalyzing deeper cognitive activity and sustained academic growth.</jats:p>"

However, these standards often overlook the human element. Studies have shown that adversary profiles (AP), which detail the maturity of attackers, significantly affect vulnerability assessments and risk calculations. Similarly, the maturity of the users interacting with the ICT system in adopting security practices impacts risk calculations. In this paper, we identify and estimate the maturity of user profiles (UP) and propose an enhanced risk assessment methodology, HRM (based on ISO 27001), that incorporates the human element in the risk evaluation. Social measures, such as awareness programs, training, and behavioral interventions, alongside technical controls, are included in the HRM risk treatment phase. These measures enhance user security hygiene and resilience, reducing risks and ensuring comprehensive security strategies in SMEs.</jats:p>"

Social determinants of health (SDOH) have exacerbated health disparities among high-risk and underprivileged populations. This study protocol presents Nevada’s COVID-19 public health disparity reduction initiatives and community-based participatory process evaluation methodologies. The participatory process evaluation based on the Reach, Quality Control, Fidelity, Satisfaction, Management (RQFSM) Model has been planned with 25 partner organizations that deliver public health services within Nevada. Methods: This program evaluation will be conducted by the University of Nevada, School of Public Health in collaboration with the Nevada Office of Minority Health and Equity (NOMHE) and the State of Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH), as primary agencies along with other partner organizations funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A mixed-methods approach will be implemented to collect data from 25 partner organizations. For assessing the reach, quantitative and qualitative quarterly data collection reporting forms and focus group discussion (FGD) protocols will be designed; for quality control, fidelity, and management, semi-structured interviews and FGDs of project personnel and community members and process observation tally sheets will be generated, and for consumer satisfaction assessment, quantitative satisfaction surveys will be created in a participatory manner with all stakeholders. Results: The results of the protocol explain that community-based initiatives offer comprehensive, culturally competent, and high-quality primary healthcare services, while community health centers and other private sector groups can be considered as essential connections. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the necessity to integrate services like mental health, drug addiction treatment, pharmacies, disability assistance, and health care for older individuals would be acknowledged. This integration will be particularly crucial in places where access to reasonably priced healthcare is hampered by cultural, geographic, or economic restrictions. Conclusion: In this study, we describe the protocols of this community-based participatory process evaluation based on the RQFSM Model in Nevada </jats:p>"

A quantitative, correlational and cross-sectional design was used with a census sample of 70 health professionals working in the Santa Rosa Hospital (MINSA). The data, collected by means of a validated questionnaire with high reliability (α = 0.906 and α = 0.929), were analyzed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Spearman's rho tests. A moderate positive correlation was found between the variables service quality management and professional performance (rho = 0.589; P &lt; 0.001); in addition, service quality management presented moderate correlations with service delivery, job satisfaction and effectiveness (rho = 0.495, 0.550 and 0.570; P &lt; 0.001) and a weak correlation with job satisfaction (rho = 0.348, P. 003). It is concluded that effective quality management can improve professional performance, although limitations such as cross-sectional design and the need to integrate new technologies were identified. It is recommended that training and modernization strategies be implemented to optimize hospital processes</jats:p>"

The objectives encompassed an analysis of LUHPC’s workability, heat of hydration, autogenous shrinkage, and carbon footprint through a multidisciplinary approach. Methodologically, an extensive review of existing literature was conducted, consolidating findings from experimental investigations. Key findings elucidate that the integration of lightweight aggregates (LWAs) positively impacts LUHPC’s workability by reducing water demand and enhancing particle movement. Moreover, LWAs facilitate internal curing, mitigating autogenous shrinkage, and improving hydration degree. The utilization of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and sustainable additives further reduces LUHPC’s carbon footprint, manifesting notable reductions in carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions and energy consumption. These findings underscore LUHPC’s potential for sustainable construction practices, offering structures that are both lighter and stronger with a diminished environmental impact. The findings of this study indicate emerging opportunities for improving the utilization of LUHPC mixtures in construction projects, focusing on promoting workability, durability, and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

Blood gas analysis plays an important role in the assessment of critical illness, determining the aetiology and severity of disease. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the test performance of blood gas instruments in our hospital with 6 sigma methodology.\r\nMethods : The study included pH, pO2, pCO2, glucose, lactate, ionised Ca, Na, K and Cl parameters analysed on Siemens RAPIDpoint 500e blood gas instruments in the emergency laboratory. In the sigma metric calculation TEa (total permissible error) rates, the values determined by RiliBAK (German Guidelines for Quality) were used. The causes of errors of poorly performing tests were evaluated with the quality goal index (QGI).\r\nResults : At the results, PCO2 (Level 2) in Instrument I, Lactate (Level 1-2) in Instrument II and pCO2 (Level 1-2) in Instrument III are the tests with sigma values below 4. When we look at the low performance problems, precision in Instrument I pCO2 (Level 2), accuracy in Instrument II lactate (Level 1-2) and accuracy in Instrument III pCO2 (Level 1-2) were detected. \r\nConclusion : This study has allowed us to monitor laboratory blood gas testing performance very closely. With the 6 sigma methodology we have captured underperforming tests and investigated the reasons behind them</jats:p>"

Through telehealth, patients are able to see their doctors despite problems of time and distance, congestion, and infection. However, with the increase of telemedicine services, other vices such as ransomware, phishing and data leak are on the rise and are a threat to patients’ lives.\nThe following recommended practices for telemedicine application security were covered in this paper; MFA, HIPAA, and safeguarding the patient information. Preventing cyber threats and gaining patient’s trust then require the following measures: encryption of data, safe storage of data, conducting regular risk assessments and compliance with data privacy and protection laws. The following are the recommendations that may help in enhancing telehealth systems: – Telehealth systems should be developed by healthcare delivery organisations, telehealth technology vendors and policymakers.\nHowever, research and improvement in security measures have to be done in order to address current and future risks that telemedicine is exposed to and to enhance the value of telemedicine in light of such advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and integration of electronic healthcare.</jats:p>"

Addressing gaps in traditional risk assessment methodologies, the proposed approach integrates advanced techniques for risk identification, analysis, and evaluation based on risk characteristics. A three-stage framework is proposed utilizing the Delphi method for risk identification and contextualization of risks, the risk analysis stage employs the Fuzzy Level-Based Weight Assessment (F-LBWA) method to achieve fuzzy weights for risk characteristics which the risks will be evaluated by. The final evaluation stage uses the Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (F-CoCoSo) method to rank risks, categorizing them as threats, opportunities, or hybrids. A case study of an EPC project demonstrates the framework’s practical application, highlighting construction-phase risks as the most critical threats (negative risks) while also emphasizing opportunities (positive risks) which can be exploited. By incorporating fuzzy logic and innovative Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, the framework provides a flexible and robust tool for modern PRM.</jats:p>"

While interventional approaches have been shown to have real clinical application, implementation of new diagnostics such as blood‐based biomarkers for beta‐amyloid confirmation has lagged in the community setting. This narrative explores Alzheimer’s biomarkers within the SiteRx Alzheimer’s Real‐World Data network, the challenges stakeholders (physicians, patients, and biomarker infrastructure) are facing, and best practices for adoption of continually emerging interventions and diagnostics.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>SiteRx analyzes data related to the uptake of biomarkers (e.g., CSF, PET Amyloid, blood‐based) within SiteRx’s Alzheimer’s Real‐World Data network, along with HCP and practice‐level qualitative insights to identify bottlenecks in initial and sustained adoption of biomarkers in the community‐setting. This mix of primary and secondary data highlights disparities across the community ranging from provider readiness (e.g., awareness or buy‐in) to implementation readiness (e.g., connectedness with diagnostics infrastructure).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Result</jats:title><jats:p>While uptake of biomarker use is fragmented in the community‐setting, there is increasing utilization of diagnostics and a growing cohort of biomarker‐positive patients within the SiteRx Alzheimer’s Real‐World Data network. The primary lagging indicator of adoption is Leqembi uptake, with physicians prescribing the mAb administering 5‐10x more diagnostics than. non‐prescribers. Anecdotally, the challenge for low‐to‐no adoption physicians is primarily driven by a lack of clear direction on how to navigate the diagnostics infrastructure. On the other end, high prescribers face mounting difficulty coordinating continued diagnostic requirements for patients on Leqembi due to required support staff, limited availability of PET amyloid appointments, and other factors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The uptake of Alzheimer’s diagnostics has been slow overall, but continues to increase, especially in certain geographies and practices. As more diagnostic methods emerge, providers are becoming more well‐equipped to understand the disease and develop enhanced care plans for those living with Alzheimer’s disease. In turn, SiteRx’s Alzheimer’s Real‐World Data network is enriched with biomarker‐positive patients, growing the potential pool of interested and suitable patients for breakthrough therapies, promising investigational therapies, and further utilization of disease‐characterizing diagnostics.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Descriptive statistics for 1606 grants awarded between 2021 and 2023 provide additional insights into the broader funding landscape. The results highlight key correlations between funding, evaluation scores, and journal publication percentiles, with a notable negative correlation observed between international and national expert evaluations in specific scientific fields. A productivity analysis at the organizational level was conducted using non-parametric methods to evaluate institutional efficiency in converting funding into research output. Data were manually collected from the National Center of Science and Technology Evaluation and supplemented with publication data from Scopus and Web of Science, using unique grant numbers and principal investigators’ profiles.

Using data envelopment analysis, the study covers the period between 2019 and 2022. In the study investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on the performance of portfolio management companies, the period of 2019 is considered as pre-COVID-19 pandemic, the years 2020 and 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic period, and the year 2022 as the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. Within the scope of data envelopment analysis, outout oriented BCC and CCR models based on constant and variable returns to scale were used in the study and efficient firms were identified. According to the results of the CCR model based on constant returns to scale, 31% of the firms in the pre-pandemic period, 24% in the pandemic period and 17% after the pandemic achieved full efficiency. According to the results of the BCC model based on variable returns to scale, 51% of the analyzed firms continued their activities effectively before and during the pandemic, while this rate decreased to 31% in the post-pandemic period. In this context, it has been concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic period had an impact on the relative performance of portfolio management companies.</jats:p>"

The escalation in greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollution, and resource depletion has underscored the urgency for such transformations. Consequently, studies have increasingly focused on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This review synthesizes existing literature on SSCM practices, drawing from research outputs from various industries and geographical regions. The synthesis relies on the Systematic Literature Review Methodology in gathering and analyzing relevant articles published between 2014 and 2024. A total of 29 articles were reviewed, and they met the inclusion criteria for detailed content examination. The review identifies three main dimensions of SSCM: environmental, economic, and social. Environmental considerations feature prominently in the literature, with studies addressing issues such as waste management, carbon footprint reduction, and resource conservation. Economic performance, including cost management and market competitiveness, is also a significant focus, particularly in studies conducted in emerging economies. Additionally, the review highlights the growing and critical position of social sustainability within supply chain management, although it remains relatively understudied compared to environmental and economic dimensions. Overall, the findings underscore the multifaceted nature of SSCM practices and their imperative attributes for organizations in adopting holistic approaches that integrate environmental, economic, and social considerations. The review contributes to a deeper understanding of current research trends and emphasizes the need for further investigation into social sustainability within SSCM, particularly in the context of emerging economies.</jats:p>"

The inclusion of supply chain management characteristics as parameters in the evaluation of PS is a novel aspect of this research. Previous studies largely focused on more traditional factors such as physical care, waiting times and hospital amenities. By considering supply chain management factors, this study provides insights into an under-explored area of PS research, which has important implications for healthcare providers looking to improve their operations and PS.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

They argued that a shared language of practice would help teacher educators and teachers work together on practice and develop nuanced, complex, and shared conceptualizations of instruction. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Purpose:</jats:title><jats:p> This article interrogates the claim that core practices promote shared language development by investigating a practice-based professional development (PD) program on project-based learning (PBL). Within the PD program, we study how teachers’ conceptualizations of high-quality teaching shifted and how this related to their use of core practices language. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Research Design:</jats:title><jats:p> This qualitative content analysis examines if and how teachers’ conceptualizations of high-quality teaching and their use of core practices language shifted across pre- and post-PD interviews. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> After the PD program, teachers’ conceptualizations of high-quality teaching had changed. However, despite this shift, teachers rarely used the language of core practices when describing their teaching. These findings raise questions about the relationships between core practices of teaching, professional language, and teachers’ conceptualizations of teaching. The authors discuss these questions and offer a framework differentiating core practices from best practices. The framework compares divergent purposes for developing a shared language to describe the practice of teaching. </jats:p></jats:sec>"

Novel bio-based materials like hempcrete are being developed to lessen the environmental impact of construction. Hempcrete, increasingly used in traditional and advanced construction like large-scale 3D printing, is considered carbon-negative due to the biogenic and sequestered carbon of its components. Given the high carbon footprint of Portland cement, hempcrete offers a sustainable alternative for emerging construction technologies. However, hempcrete’s carbon neutrality or negativity depends on the hemp and lime content in the mix. A thorough Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), therefore, becomes important to understand carbon negativity potential of this material. In this paper, we present the results of a cradle-to-gate LCA of hempcrete mixes that have been proposed and examined in empirical studies. The LCA also includes a process-based hybrid cradle-to-gate impact assessment of hemp produced in the United States. The results indicate that the total global warming potential of hemp is roughly −1.72 kgCO<jats:sub>2e</jats:sub>/kg, and carbon negativity can only be reached with at least 20% of hemp by weight in the hempcrete mix. Findings also show that consideration of carbon absorption of lime binder is essential to reach carbon negativity. Our results further indicate that a balance of carbon negativity and hempcrete’s compressive strength will be more desirable to address both climate change mitigation and adaptation.</jats:p>"

I explore an empirical case in which graffiti-writers of a specific bathroom, the “motivation bathroom,” have become informally organized around a shared cause without ever meeting or getting to know each other. Conceptualizing bathrooms as solitary liminal spaces, I examine how various forms of communitas are embedded in the “motivation bathroom” graffiti and how this experience of togetherness enables the graffiti-writers to sustain their shared message of care and kind motivating. The study advances the research on smaller scale organizational liminal spaces and proposes that future management and organizations studies would benefit from a wider use of the concept of communitas. The article also joins the emerging stream of micro-level material studies of work and organizing. </jats:p>"

In such classes, learning is assumed to occur as students complete the assigned readings and attend classes without demonstrating their understanding. Alternatively, courses designed based on an active learning approach require students to showcase their learning in various tasks in a collaborative environment. The literature provides a wealth of research studies with empirical evidence of the effectiveness of active learning strategies in enhancing student achievement shifting from didactic teaching to a student-centered environment. This chapter will introduce the Flipped Learning Model as an active learning pedagogy in an online classroom. The flipped learning model aligns with the social constructivist approach as a theoretical framework that underpins active learning. Two active learning strategies will be explored in the flipped classroom context: Jigsaw Groups and Active Reading.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the study focuses on evaluating the response of pearl millet to various cropping systems and different nutrient management techniques for enhancing crop productivity and sustaining soil fertility. Methods: The field trial took place at the instructional farm of Karunya Institute of Technology and Science in the Coimbatore district of western Tamil Nadu, India. The trial spanned over two growing seasons and followed a factorial randomized block design, with 2 factors: cropping systems and nutrient management, replicated three times. The design resulted in a total of 12 treatment combinations, comprising 3 levels of cropping system viz., sole cropping of pearl millet, pearl millet with black gram and cowpea intercropping systems; and 4 levels of nutrient management comprising different doses of fertilizer levels in combination with biofertilizers such as Azospirillum and PSB and foliar sprays of 2% Urea and 3% Panchagavya. Result: The experimental findings indicated that intercropping treatment, Pearl millet + Black gram at a 1:1 ratio, exhibited superior results in enhancing plant growth, improving the crop nutrient uptakeand enriching soil fertility. In the case of nutrient management treatments, application of 75% of recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) + Azospirillum and phosphate solubilizing bacteria + foliar application of 2% urea at 15 and 35 days after transplanting (DAT) resulted in producing higher plant height, enhanced dry matter production, efficient crop nutrient uptake, improved soil fertility status for sustainable agriculture. </jats:p>"

This study applies a full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental and economic implications of various e-waste disposal techniques, including landfilling, incineration, and recycling. By studying each stage of e-waste processing—from collection to final disposal—the research aims to develop sustainable approaches that minimize ecological harm while increasing economic advantages. The findings demonstrate that sophisticated recycling technology and the adoption of circular economy principles can greatly cut greenhouse gas emissions, conserve resources, and provide economic value through material recovery</jats:p>"

Organizational performance alongside employee productivity and business success entirely depend on how well a leader inspires and mentors their team members.  This research based on case studies studies organizational functions to assess the impacts of five leadership philosophies including transformational, transactional and laissez-faire as well as democratic and autocratic.  The study aims to assess the different leadership philosophies concerning their effects on important performance indicators which include financial results alongside operational effectiveness and employee engagement while studying decision-making procedures and creativity. Success and long-term business viability rely mainly on leadership in the current highly competitive and rapid business environment.  Leadership decisions heavily influence the levels of employee productivity and organizational success and business achievement due to a leader's motivational and mentoring abilities toward team members.  This study employs case studies to examine leadership theories including transformational, transactional, laissez-faire, democratic and autocratic regarding their effect on organizational operation.  The research aims to study the effects different leadership philosophies have on essential performance indicators that involve financial outcomes together with operational efficiency and employee involvement alongside decision processes and creative outcomes. The research strengthens existing knowledge by presenting real-world information regarding organizational success in relation to leadership style use.  The research results demonstrate that organizations need to adopt leadership approaches which match their future plans and workforce composition and industry type.  The study points out that leadership development through training creates essential initiatives which boost management effectiveness.  Research about the evolving nature of leadership at remote workplaces must analyze how these changes alter organizational resilience along with sustainability performance.</jats:p>"

This is because FAP was created as an institute that aims to protect the work environment in defense of workers' health and safety. Furthermore, the hypothesis is that transparency regarding FAP was created as an institute that aims to protect the work environment in defense of workers' health and safety. Furthermore, the hypothesis is that transparency regarding FAP exposure constitutes a benchmarking practice that promotes good practices in the workplace. Regarding the methodology used in this research, the deductive approach and monographic procedure methods were adopted, considering that extensive bibliography and documents on the subject were used. The results achieved indicate that it does not make sense for one of the main indicators of the FAP, which is the comparative analysis of a company with others that supposedly best-applied protection measures in managing the reduction of occupational accidents, not being able to have its index disclosed in the name of fiscal secrecy. As final considerations, the importance of this disclosure was discussed as a good practice of transparency and benchmarking.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) is a critical component of the project management phase, which if not properly handled, may lead to project failure. Currently, Kenya faces transitional challenges from a centralized state to devolved governance system. This has prefigured both challenges and opportunities. The decentralized form of governance has exerted pressure on especially the performance of government water departments in funded water projects in counties. Despite this need most county governments initiate water projects without putting into consideration the importance of having effective M&amp;E frameworks. One aspect that has not been given much consideration is effective implementation of M&amp;E systems as advised by M &amp; E experts. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of M &amp; E Planning process on performance of county government funded water projects in Kisii County\r\nMethodology: The study will adopt a descriptive survey design. The study target population includes 201 county water staff managing 90 water projects across the county. The census method was used to research the 201 staff involved in water projects. The primary data was collected by use of questionnaires and Key Informant interviews. Quantitative data was analyzed by employing descriptive statistics and inferential analysis, and the results were presented by tables and figures. Whereas, qualitative data was done through narrative analysis and presented in form of verbatim and narrations.\r\nFindings: M&amp;E planning enables the construction of a logical framework that acts as a roadmap guiding the project's progress and allowing the stakeholders to understand the relationships between different project elements. The positive effect of M&amp;E planning on project implementation affirms the pivotal role of this planning process in guiding and optimizing the execution of water-funded projects in Kisii County.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: This study was anchored in the program theory. Project managers and policymakers should emphasize the importance of these planning components, recognizing them as integral drivers of project success. Furthermore, capacity-building initiatives focusing on these planning aspects can further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of M&amp;E planning practices.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>Hospitality related jobs are prone to biasness and inequities especially in reward and compensation structures vis-à-vis job grades and responsibilities. One of the major contributory factors of such biasness and inequities is lack of a systematic basis of evaluating jobs. Such biasness and inequities if not checked, may generate dissatisfaction and grievances among employees which may eventually lead to low employee morale and poor performance. The purpose of the research was to ascertain how front-line employees' performance is impacted by job evaluation factors in 4 and 5 star rated lodges, resorts, hotels and camps located in Nakuru County. Specifically, the study tested the influence of interpersonal skills, job responsibility, decision making and job expertise on employee performance. Besides, the moderating role of gender was tested. The study was underpinned by the Equity Theory of Motivation. It utilized both descriptive and co-relational research designs. This study's population consisted of all 4 to 5 star rated hospitality establishments located in Nakuru County. The sample size comprised 403 front-line employees and 8 supervisors. Besides, 8 HRMs were included in the study, therefore, a total of 419 respondents were sampled. Questionnaires were administered to the frontline employees and interviews were conducted with the HRMs and supervisors. The study revealed that interpersonal skills (B=.227, p=.000); job responsibility (B=.234, p=.000); decision making (B= .290, P=.000); and job expertise (B= .238, P=.000) significantly influence the performance of employees. However, employees’ gender (ΔR2= .001, P=.382) does not influence the relationship between job evaluation factors and employee performance. The content analysis results supported these findings. This study concluded that job evaluation factors enhance employee’s performance, gender does not. The study recommends that the HR departments should observe fairness and equity in all HR processes especially recruitment and selection, training, promotion and compensation. All these functions should be driven by skills, job responsibility, and expertise of the employee and not subjective elements such as gender.\nKeywords: Job Evaluation, Employee Performance, Hospitality Industry, 4 and 5-Star Hotels, Nakuru County, Kenya\n</jats:p>"

To this end, data was gathered from 312 employees in Saudi medium-sized industrial firms and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) via Smart PLS 4 software. The study revealed that GSCPs and SCG have a positive, significant and direct effect on SCP, in addition to that SCF and TQM do not have a direct positive effect on SCP. The study also found that TQM modifies the relationship between GSCPs, SCF, SCG and SCP.</jats:p>"

Despite its advantages, traditional UHPC mixes with high cement content can negatively affect the environment through CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. This study aims to investigate using low-impact supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as ground granulated blast furnace (GGBF) slag, fly ash, and silica fume as replacements for cement in different ratios in UHPC compositions. A life cycle assessment (LCA) has been conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of these innovative UHPC compositions. The evaluation considers critical variables, including resource allocation, energy sources, raw material procurement distances, and manufacturing processes. Using SCMs in UHPC formulas helps lessen the impact of global warming and aids in mitigating climate change. These results highlight the importance of using new material combinations to promote sustainability in construction, showing ways to adopt more environment-friendly solutions and creating a path toward a more sustainable future in concrete production.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>This study focuses on the effectiveness of blockchain technology implementation. Blockchain technology is widely regarded as transformative due to its potential to enhance transparency, security, and operational efficiency. This has led to the widespread adoption of blockchain technology across various companies and industries. However, an increasing number of companies are facing challenges in developing qualitative and effective approaches to evaluating the efficiency of implementing this technology. Therefore, it is necessary to develop specialized approaches to assess the effectiveness of blockchain technology implementation. The research subject encompasses the approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of blockchain technology implementation, such as Return on Investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV), and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). By examining case studies and real-world implementations, the study evaluates the application of traditional economic metrics, such as ROI and TCO, and expands the evaluation framework to include intangible benefits like transparency and customer trust. The study also addresses challenges such as scalability, privacy, and legislative impacts, offering solutions based on MCDA and a multi-dimensional assessment approach. The integration of these methods allows for a holistic evaluation of blockchain’s effectiveness. The primary aim of this study is to identify robust evaluation tools that organizations can utilize to determine the feasibility and benefits of blockchain adoption. By bridging gaps in existing assessment models, the research provides a comprehensive framework to streamline decision-making processes. The key findings demonstrate that while ROI remains a critical metric, it must be complemented by broader economic and non-economic indicators to achieve a thorough evaluation. The strategic alignment of blockchain technology with organizational goals is essential for maximizing its benefits. The research concludes that adopting a flexible and standardized evaluation methodology is vital for accurately assessing blockchain technology’s impact. This includes integrating financial, organizational, and technological indicators into a unified framework. Future research is recommended to explore industry-specific metrics and the inclusion of qualitative impacts such as transparency, trust, and customer satisfaction. The study highlights that blockchain’s effectiveness depends on addressing technical, operational, and external challenges while leveraging its transformative potential to drive innovation and efficiency. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that a holistic evaluation framework with integrating quantitative financial metrics with qualitative factors such as transparency, trust, and regulatory considerations is essential for accurately assessing blockchain implementation effectiveness and guiding strategic decision-making.</jats:p>"

While the theoretical underpinnings (i.e., the “why”) are clear, the practical application (i.e., the “how”) of bringing undergraduate students and older adults together can be more messy. This session focuses on lessons learned, strategies for success, and setbacks to be aware of, with the goal of enhancing our fortitude as educators who value and strive to incorporate impactful intergenerational experiences into the student experience. The first presentation explores the perspectives of students and older adult participants engaged in an intergenerational team-based learning course for first-year undergraduate students, framed by Age-Friendly University principles. The second presentation shares lessons learned from a new service-learning model in which students assessed the transportation needs of older adults engaged with the university-affiliated Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. The third presentation examines the experience of undergraduate students engaged in hands-on gerontology research and highlights takeaways based on students’ intergenerational connections with older adult participants. The final presentation sheds light on sustainable program development through describing their creation of a checklist that aids in intergenerational technology program implementation within higher education. In addition to drawing on the perspectives of scholars across the academic career-span, this symposium session highlights the many contexts within higher education in which intergenerational connections can be facilitated. Aligning with the Annual Scientific Meeting 2024 theme, these presentations demonstrate fortitude in refining processes to ensure we are building optimal experiences that connect students and older adults.</jats:p>"

A good understanding of such a radiation environment during normal and accidental operating conditions is required by plant regulators to ensure proper shielding of equipment and working personnel. The complex design of a typical PWR is posing a deep penetration shielding problem for which an elaborate simulation model is needed, not only in geometrical aspects but also in efficient computational algorithms for solving particle transport. This paper presents such a hybrid shielding approach of FW-CADIS for characterization of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) irradiation using SCALE6.2.4 code package. A fairly detailed Monte Carlo model (MC) of typical reactor internals was developed to capture all important streaming paths of fast neutrons which will backscatter the biological shield and thus enhance RPV irradiation through the cavity region. Several spatial differencing and angular segmentation options of the discrete ordinates SN flux solution were compared in connection to a SN mesh size and were inspected by VisIt code. To optimize MC neutron transport toward the upper RPV head, which is a particularly problematic region for particle transport, a deterministic solution of discrete ordinates in forward/adjoint mode was convoluted in a so-called contributon flux, which proved to be useful for subsequent SN mesh refinement and variance reduction (VR) parameters preparation. The pseudo-particle flux of contributons comes from spatial channel theory which can locate spatial regions important for contributing to a shielding response.</jats:p>"

In many scenarios, it outperforms traditional two-stage detection frameworks, making it ideal for real-time applications. This study evaluates YOLOv11 model variants (n, s, m, i, x) on a custom dataset of 2,285 labelled images representing four delivery vehicle classes: FedEx, Other-Vehicles, UPS, and USPS-Truck. The dataset is meticulously curated to capture diverse delivery vehicle scenarios and split into training, validation, and test sets. Each variant was fine-tuned using uniform settings: 20 epochs, an input resolution of 640×640 pixels, and a batch size of 16.\r\nPerformance was assessed using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP, a standard metric measuring detection accuracy) across Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds from 50% to 95% (a range defining the overlap between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes), precision, recall, and inference speed on GPU and CPU. The results highlight trade-offs between model complexity and performance: smaller variants like YOLOv11-n achieved faster inference speeds (170.74 FPS on GPU and 5.86 ms on GPU), while larger models like YOLOv11-x excelled in detection accuracy and recall but at the cost of slower speeds (240.03 FPS on GPU and 4.17 ms on GPU). YOLOv11-s, for example, offered a balance with the highest FPS (1120.46 GPU FPS) but with moderate accuracy and recall. These findings demonstrate the adaptability of YOLOv11 variants to varying application requirements, from high-speed real-time systems to scenarios prioritizing detection accuracy.\r\nThis research advances object detection by providing a detailed performance benchmark for YOLOv11 variants. It offers practical insights for deploying YOLOv11 in diverse fields, including logistics, delivery tracking, and other domains requiring efficient and accurate object detection.</jats:p>"

The paper examines the issues of land relations and rational use of land resources reflected in the scientific literature. The authors consider the importance of a methodological approach to the development of land relations and rational land use. The study focuses on the laws of rational land use, formalization and justification of ways to implement them in practice. The article proves that solving the problems of rational land use is a prerequisite for the spatial development of Ukraine and, ultimately, the most important factor in ensuring its sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life and national security. According to the study, the systemic criterion of rational land use is its efficiency. It derives the essential nature of the processes of rational land use, which contains the fundamental points, and substantiates their content. The authors emphasize that the land policy in Ukraine is aimed at improving the economic, environmental and social efficiency of land use, but insufficient attention has been paid to the environmental component. The paper highlights the relevance of developing clear standards for the values of indicators reflecting the environmental efficiency of land use and regulating its environmental aspects in the context of active processes of land degradation in agricultural areas, soil destruction and land pollution. The article shows the importance of solving the complex problem of rational use of land through the development, substantiation and implementation of an organizational and managerial mechanism containing built-in structural elements: economic, environmental, social, production, and regulatory and legal. We conduct a comparative analysis of the market and planned methods and instruments used to regulate land relations. The authors focus on the role of the state and the legal framework in regulating land relations, a differentiated approach to their subjects, and the specifics of the economic model within which rational land use is ensured.</jats:p>"

We used a rapid qualitative analysis approach to analyze data. Three team members summarized transcripts based on domains aligned with the structured research questions, organized themes into a matrix, and identified and discussed key themes to arrive at consensus. We then reconvened community partners to discuss implementation strategies that could address identified barriers. Participants ranked barriers according to high/low feasibility and high/low importance and selected implementation strategies for the blueprint.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Qualitative results revealed several implementation barriers: teacher/parent/student buy-in; teacher motivation; scheduling time; limited funding; waning interest; daily hardships outside of school.

This mixed-methods evaluation examined the feasibility of a recently developed attachment-based family intervention, Behaviour Exchange Systems Therapy-Foundations (BEST-F), delivering 16 h of therapy over 8 weeks to treat internalising symptoms in children aged between 3 and 11 years. Methods: The quantitative outcomes of this uncontrolled study of 17 families were based on the parent-reported Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) measure, completed at four-timepoints (baseline, pre-, post-intervention, and follow-up), while qualitative data were collected from interviews with participants at follow-up. Results: Pre- and post-BEST-F intervention results demonstrated a significant change in internalising symptoms from the borderline and clinical range to the normal range, with a large effect size (d = 0.85). Notably, additional reductions in internalising symptoms were reported two months after cessation of treatment, with a very large effect size (d = 1.85). Furthermore, there were substantial reductions in child externalising symptoms and parental mental health symptoms, with large effect sizes ranging from d = 0.80 to 1.12. Qualitative reports were consistent with these quantitative findings. Conclusions: These pilot results suggest that children presenting with clinical-range internalising symptoms may benefit from family-based approaches where the parent–child relationship is a focus.</jats:p>"

This study assesses the supply chain risk management procedures of the Thulamela Municipality to guarantee service delivery. The main objectives were to evaluate the municipality's risk management structure and recommend enhancements in accordance with the MFMA and King IV requirements. The study question examined the implementation of a risk management system by Thulamela to guarantee service delivery. Utilising risk management and institutional theory, the study adopted a mixed-methods approach, applying deductive thematic analysis and SPSS software to examine data regarding the municipality's risk management procedures, team expertise, and framework suitability. The findings reveal that although Thulamela possesses a supply chain risk management framework, enhancements are necessary, specifically in (i) empowering the risk management team, (ii) incorporating technology and maintaining a record of suppliers with a history of non-compliance, and (iii) augmenting staff's risk management expertise. A favourable correlation was observed among effective risk management, institutional theory, supply chain procedures, and service delivery. This report provides essential information for policymakers to improve municipal supply chain risk management. Future research may investigate the impact of technology on mitigating risks such as non-compliance, corruption, and supplier failures, and also analyse the risk management frameworks among South African municipalities.</jats:p>"

The inherent resilience and longevity of brick structures make them suitable for repair and further strengthening. Several procedures are already in practice for the preservation and enhancement of seismic performance in existing masonry structures. One notable method, rooted in history and now under exploration, is the semiconfinement of existing masonry structures with horizontal and vertical reinforced concrete (RC) elements. This method exhibits all the characteristics of an effective retrofitting technique. Most importantly, it has been found to improve ductility and showcase enhanced seismic performance. In this context, two existing masonry constructions at the Structural Engineering Laboratory of IIT Kanpur are considered. These structures, having undergone cyclic testing, include one without any reinforcement (or control masonry) and the other retrofitted with semiconfining horizontal and vertical RC elements (strengthened masonry or retrofitted masonry). Both structures experienced crack formation during testing, with distinct characteristics reflecting their unique structural behaviors. These cracks were sealed using grouting, requiring minimal material and a “light” application. The primary objective of this study is to assess the behavior of these repaired buildings through condition assessment techniques and subsequent testing. For this purpose, accelerometers were installed at various locations, and Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) was considered by shaker tests. The assessment of dynamic behavior in these structures will facilitate further studies on retrofitting the control masonry and enhancing the scheme of retrofitting or strengthening for improved performance.</jats:p>"

Data were collected from the second-year to fourth-year college students, using an adapted questionnaire from Ibarrientos' (2015) study. Results indicated high satisfaction on SAIT's student services, particularly in information and orientation services and guidance and counseling services. Student development initiatives, led by information and orientation services, also received positive ratings. While institutional programs, especially safety and security services, were well-regarded, improvements in food services are needed. Common student issues like peer pressure and absences underscore the necessity for targeted interventions. Descriptive statistics provided numerical summaries, comparing perceived quality across study aspects, while percentages highlighted prevalent student challenges. Overall, SAIT demonstrated strength in student services and development, yet opportunities existed to enhance institutional programs and address student concerns for improved overall satisfaction and experience.</jats:p>"

The author systematized the main provisions of these theories, which were reflected in the reform programs, and were recommended by international intergovernmental organizations as approaches to the implementation of state transformations. Based on the analysis, the author draws attention to the fact that the concept of «modernization» has received a practical refraction mainly in the neoliberal political course, which absolutizes the ideas of classical modernization theories about economic growth and economic freedom as the foundations of progressive development.\nThe neoliberal interpretation of modernization has become fundamental to the political course that defines approaches to the implementation of «structural reforms» in «developing» countries. According to the author, the reasons for such dominance are related to both political factors, history, and the peculiarities of the conceptual provisions of modernization theories. The dominance of the neoliberal interpretation of modernization has provoked a number of negative trends: reducing the value of freedom exclusively to economic freedoms and freedom of choice, increasing economic inequality, strengthening the political status of economic elites, etc. Despite the emergence of non-classical modernization theories in response to these contradictions, they did not become the dominant conceptual basis for reforms due to political and discursive reasons. The author comes to the conclusion that the transformation of the conceptual provisions of classical modernization theories into a neoliberal political course, postulating its provisions at the level of world political discourse significantly limited the potential of applying this theory to develop and substantiate a political course. At the same time, many of the tasks facing the state as an institution at the present stage lie in the plane of understanding modern, non-classical theories of modernization.</jats:p>"
