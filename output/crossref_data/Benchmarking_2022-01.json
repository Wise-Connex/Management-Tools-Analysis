Six reasons were examined for their role in benchmarking success. These reasons are top management support, university internal assessment, employee participation, benchmarking benefits, benchmarking competitor, and benchmarking partner. Data were gathered by a questionnaire distributed to managers from all levels in public universities. The questionnaire was developed based on related works on benchmarking. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed to the sample members and 167 questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 83.5%. The results indicated university internal assessment is the most influential reason for benchmarking success, followed by benchmarking benefits, benchmarking partner, top management support, and finally, employee participation. It was found that benchmarking competitors had no effect on benchmarking success. Therefore, universities are called for considering such reasons when heading for benchmarking. Researchers also are requested to validate such findings and to explore more reasons for benchmarking success.</jats:p>"

Fault tree model was developed from the identified failure events. Probability of failure events was calculated using Poisson distribution based on the annual reports and interviews conducted from experts. Further, qualitative analysis – minimum cut sets (MCSs), structural importance coefficient (SIC) – and quantitative analysis – Birnbaum importance measure (BIM), criticality importance factor (CIF) and diagnosis importance factor (DIF) – were performed for ranking of failure events. In this study, fault tree development and analysis were conducted on apple supply chain to present the authenticity of this method for failure analysis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings indicate that the failure events, given as failure at production and procurement (A2), that is, involvement of middleman (BE3), handling and packaging failure (BE4) and transportation failure (A3), hold the highest-ranking scores in analysis of PPSC using fault tree approach.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research uses the modularization approach for evaluation of failure events of PPSC. This paper explores failures related to PPSC for efficient management initiatives in apple supply chain context.

Naturally, a set of benchmarks can shape an applied solution to compliance assessment. This paper proposes the KARB solution system, i.e. preventing compliance anomalies through rule-based benchmarking. In fact, rule-based benchmarking means evaluating an under-compliance system with its symbolic specification and using a set of symbolic rules (on the behalf of the semantic logic of evaluation). A case study was conducted to demonstrate and analyze the KARB solution. The IR-QUMA study (Iranian Survey on Quality in Messenger Apps) was then conducted to evaluate the quality of some messenger applications. According to the evaluation results, the hybrid DD-KARB method (with a combination of semantics-awareness and data-drivenness) is more effective than solo methods and can compute a somehow good estimation for the messenger application user quality scores. Therefore, DD-KARB can be considered a method for quality benchmarking in this technical context.</jats:p>"

They are organisations that can make a contribution through funding and by using their potential to mobilise actors involved. Although they are recognised as having a role in reaching the SDGs, there is little work on how these foundations can be stronger players in the attainment of these goals.  This benchmarking report extends existing knowledge of the practices that foundations engaged in connection with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, so that these practices can inspire and/or stimulate the reflection of third-party foundations that are seeking to improve their performance in relation to the SDGs.</jats:p>"

However, it is potentially limited by sequencing and classification errors. We use simulated and real-world data to benchmark rates of species misclassification using 100 reference genomes for each of ten common bloodstream pathogens and six frequent blood culture contaminants (n=1600). Simulating both with and without sequencing error for both the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms, we evaluated commonly used classification tools including Kraken2, Bracken, and Centrifuge, utilising mini (8GB) and standard (30-50GB) databases. Bracken with the standard database performed best, the median percentage of reads across both sequencing platforms identified correctly to the species level was 98.46% (IQR 93.0:99.3) [range 57.1:100]. For Kraken2 with a mini database, a commonly used combination, median species-level identification was 79.3% (IQR 39.1:88.8) [range 11.2:100]. Classification performance varied by species, with E. coli being more challenging to classify correctly (59.4% to 96.4% reads with correct species, varying by tool used). By filtering out shorter Nanopore reads (&lt;3500bp) we found performance similar or superior to Illumina sequencing, despite higher sequencing error rates. Misclassification was more common when the misclassified species had a higher average nucleotide identity to the true species. Our findings highlight taxonomic misclassification of sequencing data occurs and varies by sequencing and analysis workflow. This “bioinformatic contamination” should be accounted for in metagenomic pipelines to ensure accurate results that can support clinical decision making.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Importance</jats:title><jats:p>Metagenomics may transform clinical microbiology by enabling more rapid species detection in a potentially unbiased manner and reducing reliance on culture-based approaches. However, it is still limited by ongoing challenges such as sequencing and classification software errors. In this study, we use simulated and real-world data to define the intrinsic rates of species misclassification that occur using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms with commonly used taxonomic classification tools and databases. We quantify the extent of “bioinformatic contamination” arising from the classification process. This enables us to identify the best performing tools that maximize classification accuracy, and to suggest how taxonomic misclassification can be formally accounted for in clinical diagnostic workflows. Specifically, we specify thresholds for identifying or excluding polymicrobial infections in metagenomic samples, based on rates of misclassification of similar species, which might have clinical implications when treating infection.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

In the conditions of increasing degree of uncertainty in socio-economic systems, the implementation of the latest management tools and systems aimed at ensuring the efficiency, flexibility and adaptability of enterprises, in particular – benchmarking tools and systems, becomes especially important. In the existing macroeconomic conditions, the problem of introducing benchmarking into the management practice of oil refining enterprises is relevant and timely.\nPurpose. The study is aimed at the systematization of the conceptual foundations of the formation of benchmarking systems of domestic enterprises in the oil refining industry. In order to achieve the specified goal, an analysis of the substantive field of the \"benchmarking\" category was conducted; approaches to the formation of benchmarking systems existing in domestic practice are systematized; the conceptual principles of the formation of the benchmarking system for oil refining enterprises were developed.\nResults. As a result of the conducted categorical analysis of the definition of \"benchmarking\", it was determined that there are significant differences in domestic scientific opinion regarding its interpretation, and its content field in some cases is not defined clearly enough, because the authors mix the concept of benchmarking with the concepts of marketing and competitive analysis. It was determined that the vast majority of domestic authors interpret the category of benchmarking through the supercategories of process, tool (method), search, activity. It is proposed to consider benchmarking as a management subsystem. In the formulated author's definition, benchmarking is interpreted as a system that is a set of tools, methods and management tools aimed at the systematic search for exemplary (or standard) management practices, business processes, products or solutions both in the industry and beyond, and as well as their comparison with the company's existing practices, business processes, products or solutions in order to increase the efficiency of its economic activity, improve its competitive position and increase its social significance.\nBased on this and on the basis of the systematization of approaches to the formation of benchmarking systems existing in domestic practice, the conceptual principles of the formation of the benchmarking system, which can be used at domestic enterprises of the oil refining industry, have been developed.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<p>BACKGROUND As databases grow larger, it becomes harder to fully control their collection, and they frequently come with missing values: incomplete observations. These large databases are well suited to train machine-learning models, for instance for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical settings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative --rather than generative-- modeling, and thus open the door to new missing-values strategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing values have focused on inferential statistics.  RESULTS Here we conduct a systematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a focus on large health databases: four electronic health record datasets, a population brain imaging one, a health survey and two intensive care ones. Using gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with simple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate prediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we find that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is important, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate missing values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies but requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model missing values --with missing incorporated attribute-- leads to robust, fast, and well-performing predictive modeling.  CONCLUSIONS Native support for missing values in supervised machine learning predicts better than state-of-the-art imputation with much less computational cost. When using imputation, it is important to add indicator columns expressing which values have been imputed. </p>"

We have used normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) analysis as a parameter to compare the results with the reference methods - DLPNO-CCSD(T) and RI-SCS-MP2. We have also compared the performance on the thiolate interaction energy of the stable geometries using the results from our benchmark study. One of the promising functional is PBE that shows robust performance for geometry optimization. On the other hand, M06-2X stands out as the proper choice for the relative energies of the clusters. With the selected methods, we have analyzed the gold-sulfur interaction in Au3(SMe)3 and a comparison is made with AuSMe. The bonding analysis has revealed a partial covalency between gold and sulfur atoms in general. On going from AuSMe to Au3(SMe)3, a substantial flow of charge from gold atoms to thiolate ligands as a result of the increase in gold s-d hybridization. As the s-d mixing in Au increases, the main character of Au-S interaction shifts from covalent to ionic. Hence, a covalent-charge-transfer interaction dominates in gold-sulfur bonding and gives rise to a charge-shift bonding.</jats:p>"

To make things more organized, the Benchmarking Working Group of IETF has standardized a comprehensive benchmarking methodology for these technologies in its RFC 8219. The Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T) is one of the most important transition technologies that belong to the double translation category in RFC 8219. This paper aims at presenting our progress towards implementing the world’s first RFC 8219 compliant Tester for the MAP-T devices, more specifically, the MAP-T Customer Edge (CE) and the MAP-T Border Relay (BR). As part of the work of this paper, we presented a typical design for the Tester, followed by a discussion about the operational requirements, the scope of measurements, and some design considerations. Then, we installed a testbed for one of the MAP-T implementations, called Jool, and showed the results of the testbed. And finally, we ended up with a brief description of the MAP-T test program and its configuration parameters in case of testing the BR device.</jats:p>"

Das Management der SKD ist aufgrund seiner komplexen Struktur, knapper öffentlicher Mittel und Post-Corona-Unsicherheiten herausfordernd. Ein kontinuierlicher Weiterentwicklungsbedarf ist auch vor dem Hintergrund der Digitalisierung angezeigt. Im Rahmen eines Projekts zur Weiterentwicklung der Führungs- und Verwaltungsstrukturen wurden auf Basis von Benchmarks Verbesserungspotenziale abgeleitet, die in ihrer Konsequenz die Aufbau- und Ablauforganisation infrage stellten und wichtige Impulse für die weitere Digitalisierung der Organisation lieferten. Kultureinrichtungen können aus Benchmarks und Industriestandards lernen, was bisher aufgrund der institutionellen Besonderheiten infrage gestellt wird.1 Diese Erkenntnis ist für ein modernes und digitales Kulturmanagement entscheidend, weil bewährte Methoden, Instrumente und Lösungen auf den Kulturbetrieb übertragen werden können - was letztlich existenzsichernd wirkt. </p>"

CEA facilities have the potential to offer increased climate resiliency and efficient use of land. Recirculating water practices in CEA operations can substantially reduce water use in the face of resource scarcity. The greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production remain a major concern for both field agriculture and CEA facilities. Benchmarking tools and certification programs can encourage and promote circular systems.
