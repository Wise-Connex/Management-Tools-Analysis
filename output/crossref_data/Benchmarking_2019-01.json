It is possible to apply benchmarking in a wide variety of area. This paper uses benchmarking for assessing women entrepreneurship. Women entrepreneurship is a symbol of the balanced growth of the society. Financial inclusion schemes offered by the government are aimed to encourage a large number of women of the country to entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of financial inclusion and others factor like family circumstances, benchmarking, entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial intention of women on their decision to take up entrepreneurship as a career choice.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This research study is undertaken to understand the relation of financial inclusion schemes on women entrepreneurship and also to develop a cause–effect relationship.

The sample was selected on the basis of convenience. Out of the total sample, 125 women belonged to the self-help group and 125 women were registered under the RSETI program of lead banks of Haridwar and Dehradun districts of the Uttarakhand state of India.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The results of the present study indicate that there is a statistically significant impact of financial inclusion on women entrepreneurship.

La production constante d’inscriptions quantifiables conduit, dans ce cas, au développement d’une logique interne de mesure de l’efficacité selon des techniques de benchmarking, qui s’éloigne des objectifs principaux de la sécurité publique ou renforce quelques-uns de ses problèmes plus importants.</jats:p>"

This protocol is based on the Lorentz-Lorenz equation and involves the calculation of static polarizabilities and number densities of oligomer sequences, which are extrapolated to the polymer limit. We chose to compute the polarizabilities within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the PBE0/def2-TZVP-D3 model chemistry. While this <jats:italic>ad hoc</jats:italic> choice proved remarkably successful, it is also relatively expensive from a computational perspective. It represents the bottleneck step in the overall RI modeling protocol, thus limiting its utility for virtual high-throughput screening studies, in which efficiency is essential. For polymers that exhibit late-onset extensivity, the employed linear extrapolation scheme can require demanding calculations on long-oligomer sequences, thus becoming another bottleneck. In the work presented here, we benchmark DFT model chemistries to identify approaches that optimize the balance between accuracy and efficiency for this application domain. We compare results for conjugated and non-conjugated polymers, augment our original extrapolation approach with a non-linear option, analyze how the polarizability errors propagate into the RI predictions, and offer guidance for method selection.</jats:p>"

As the system becomes larger, more degrees of freedom are involved and the complexity increases exponentially. At the same time, the multifaceted nature of polyatomic systems also opens up the possibilities for observing many new chemistry and novel phenomena—a land of opportunities. For the past 15 years or so my laboratory has delved into the reaction dynamics of methane+X (X: F, Cl, O(3P), and OH). This effort shifts the paradigm in the field of reaction dynamics by making the title reaction a benchmark polyatomic system. In this account, I shall disclose my thinking behind some of the key concepts and methods we introduced and how the unexpectedly discovered phenomena led to other uncharted territories. Those findings not only enrich our understanding of the specific reactions we studied at the most fundamental level and inspire the theoretical developments, but also shape our thinking and lay the foundation for future explorations of different aspects of the multifaceted nature of polyatomic reactivity.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, the paper proposes an indicator variable expressing the time trends of financial ratios.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed measure uses the minimum and the maximum of financial ratios from the previous period as benchmarks in order to give a more complete picture about the present financial performance of firms. The most popular classification methods of bankruptcy prediction were employed: discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees. Sample specific results and conclusions were avoided by applying tenfold stratified cross-validation.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The empirical results suggest that the proposed measure can increase the predictive performance of bankruptcy prediction models compared to models based solely on static financial ratios. The results gave evidence for the fact that the firms’ past financial performance is a useful benchmark for evaluating the risk of future insolvency.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed concept is completely new to the literature and practice of bankruptcy prediction. Similar concept has not been published to date. The suggested dynamization approach has three important advantages. It is easy to compute from time series of financial ratios. It is applicable within any classifier irrespective of its mathematical background. The performance of models can be enhanced without the necessity of giving up the interpretability of bankruptcy models, so the proposed measure may play very important role in the practice of credit scoring modeling as well.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

The fields pertaining to robotic hands are human-centric in nature, making human hands a good standard for benchmark comparisons of robotic hands. To achieve this, we propose a new evaluation index, where we evaluate robotic hands on three fronts: their form, features and performance. An evaluation on how anthropomorphic robotic hands are in basic mobility, and appearance constitutes the “Form”, while features that can be read, changed and actuated for effective control of robotic hands constitutes the “Features”. We derived these key features from an extensive analysis of robotic hands in literature. Finally, the robotic hands carry out a series of tasks that evaluate their “Performance”. An individual score for each category is drawn and we carry out a three-pronged analysis. We also propose an additional feature in the form of price to provide context when analysing multiple hands.</jats:p>"

This tutorial aims to explain the concepts behind data balancing to readers who do not have a strong statistical background. Data balancing enables the analyst to compare the performance of clinicians with their peer groups on the same set of patients. The comparison is done in 3 steps. First, the patients are described in terms of their conditions/comorbidities. Each combination of comorbidities is treated as a separate type of patient. Second, the analyst measures the frequency of observing different types of patients. Third, expected outcomes are calculated for both the clinician and the peer group. The expected outcome for the clinician is calculated as the sum of product of 2 terms: probability of and the average outcome for different types of patients. The expected outcome for the peer group is calculated in the same way, with one difference: the distribution of peer group's patients is switched with the distribution of the clinician's patients. This allows us to simulate the performance of peer group on the clinician's patients. This switch in frequencies accomplishes the same goal as using propensity weights, or covariate balancing weights, but it avoids the cumbersome need to estimate the weights. In switching the distributions, a problem arises when the peer group does not see the same type of patients as the clinician. When the peer group's outcome for some patient types is missing, a synthetic case is organized. These synthetic cases are constructed from the peer group's experience with 2 complementary parts of the missing case. The reliance on synthetic cases allows one to have a match for every type of clinician's patients. Together, the synthetic case and the switch of distribution allow one to simulate the performance of the clinician and the peer group on same set of cases. The tutorial walks the reader through examples. The procedures described here can be applied to data in electronic health records. We present Standard Query Language for doing so.</jats:p>"

In a developing country, the power sector is ailing; the application of LSS can transform the power sector by driving out inefficiency, waste and variation. It will not only prove to be a boon to utilities, but it will also help the customer and society at large. Consequently, it will help in reducing the power tariff, which in turn will make power financially accessible to all categories of consumers. In addition, the private investment in this sector will also improve, if power sectors appeal, to financiers as an efficient organization, compared to loss-making one organization, at present.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

This requires the application of new methods of business management to ensure its sustainable development and to create competitive products. Management should pay particular attention to those management concepts that have demonstrated their effectiveness and potential. Among these methods, benchmarking should be singled out as one of the universal ways of increasing the level of competitiveness of enterprises of different spheres of management.\nThe purpose of the article is to summarize scientific approaches to the concept of benchmarking as an economic category and to determine the author's position on its essence.\nThe article presents the scientific concepts of defining the essence of benchmarking as an economic category, revealed that there are a considerable number of concepts for consideration of this definition, establishes the universal nature of this concept, since benchmarking is already used in the work of not only enterprises, but also in the organization of management of individual spheres. , territories, etc. The article proposes to use two approaches to considering the essence of benchmarking: static and dynamic, which makes it possible to define this category on the one hand, as a method of management, and, on the other, as determined by external and internal conditions, a constant and variable process. As a result of the research, it is proposed to consider benchmarking as a management method, the essence of which is to distinguish the best experience of economic agents, especially business entities, and to use it in the work of other enterprises, institutions and organizations.</jats:p>"

However, despite the significant role that smart cities can play to deal with recent urban challenges, the concept has been being criticized for not being able to realize its potential and for being a vendor hype. This paper reviews different conceptualization, benchmarks and evaluations of the smart city concept. Eight different classes of smart city conceptualization models have been discovered, which structure the unified conceptualization model and concern smart city facilities (i.e., energy, water, IoT etc.), services (i.e., health, education etc.), governance, planning and management, architecture, data and people. Benchmarking though is still ambiguous and different perspectives are followed by the researchers that measure -and recently monitor- various factors, which somehow exceed typical technological or urban characteristics. This can be attributed to the broadness of the smart city concept. This paper sheds light to parameters that can be measured and controlled in an attempt to improve smart city potential and leaves space for corresponding future research. More specifically, smart city progress, local capacity, vulnerabilities for resilience and policy impact are only some of the variants that scholars pay attention to measure and control. </jats:p>"

Viability analysis refers to the whole decision\nmaking process for the distinction of dead cells from live ones. Basically, cell culture samples are\ndyed with a special stain called trypan blue, so that the dead cells are selectively colored to\ndarkish. This distinction provides critical information that may be used to expose influences of the\nstudied drug on considering cell culture including cancer. Examiner’s experience and tiredness\nsubstantially affect the consistency throughout the manual observation of cell viability. The\nunsteady results of cell viability may end up with biased experimental results accordingly.\nTherefore, a machine learning based automated decision-making procedure is inevitably needed to\nimprove consistency of the cell viability analysis.\n</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Objective:</jats:title>\n<jats:p> In this study, we investigate various combinations of classifiers and feature extractors\n(i.e. classification models) to maximize the performance of computer vision-based viability\nanalysis.\n</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Method:</jats:title>\n<jats:p> The classification models are tested on novel hemocytometer image datasets which\ncontain two types of cancer cell images, namely, caucasian promyelocytic leukemia (HL60), and\nchronic myelogenous leukemia (K562).\n</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n<jats:p>From the experimental results, k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) by\ncombining Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) achieve the lowest misclassification rates that are\n0.031 and 0.082, respectively.\n</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title>\n<jats:p> The experimental results show that KNN and RF with LPQ can be powerful\nalternatives to the conventional manual cell viability analysis.

Cet article s’intéresse à la genèse et au processus d’élaboration de cet instrument inédit dans l’histoire de l’action publique pour l’égalité entre les sexes. Dans un contexte d’extension du benchmarking à un nombre croissant de sphères sociales et de thématiques, il analyse comment des protagonistes opérant dans des champs variés (économique, journalistique et politico-administratif) ont pu se rencontrer et faire converger leurs logiques d’action et leurs intérêts propres pour coproduire cet instrument. Si cette étude de cas éclaire certaines évolutions contemporaines de l’action publique pour l’égalité, elle montre aussi que, en contexte de New Public Management , la diffusion d’instruments incitatifs d’inspiration gestionnaire n’est pas forcément contradictoire avec le maintien d’instruments juridiques contraignants.</jats:p>"

Since the fashion\nindustry is not easily predictable, it is not straightforward to make an\naccurate prediction of sales.  In this\nstudy, we applied not only regression methods in machine learning, but also\ntime series analysis techniques to forecast the sales amount based on several\nfeatures. We applied our models on Walmart sales data in Microsoft Azure\nMachine Learning Studio platform. The following regression techniques were\napplied: Linear Regression, Bayesian Regression, Neural Network Regression,\nDecision Forest Regression and Boosted Decision Tree Regression. In addition to\nthese regression techniques, the following time series analysis methods were implemented:\nSeasonal ARIMA, Non-Seasonal ARIMA, Seasonal ETS, Non -Seasonal ETS, Naive\nMethod, Average Method and Drift Method. It was shown that Boosted Decision Tree\nRegression provides the best performance on this sales data.

The proposed model uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to determine the indexes due to cost leadership and differentiation. The model can be useful to identify the true cost leaders and those who are stuck in the middle.

The current study is used to explore whether any private primary school has the same goal or not. They also pointed out the possible future consequences while stating that the cost of educating children from the poorer section might be outweighed by the cost of not educating them and adults lacking basic skills had greater difficulty in finding well-paying jobs to escape poverty. So it is important to understand the role of a private primary school to offer seats to underprivileged students for educating them. The intention of six private primary schools toward educating the population of the small area within Durgapur is analyzed in this study, The study revealed that few schools spend more to serve the students belonging to upper classes to remain successful, whereas few schools as a differentiator make conscious attempts for providing services to poorer sections in an economical manner like a cost leader.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The extant research aims to formulate the determining methods of identifying strategic groups (proposed by Hunt, 1983) to make a parity between business definition view and strategic type concepts. The model can assess the rivals within an industry to explore the true cost leaders and those who are stuck in the middle using DEA. There are not enough kinds of literature which could effectively measure them.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

The paper aims to compare selected indicators of implementation of start-ups and creative potential in the regions of Slovakia at NUTS 3 level and to quantify their mutual relationship. Benchmarking of 8 Slovak NUTS 3 level regions is based on 2 comparisons, namely: 6 indicators of start-ups implementation (frequency of start-ups, creation of radical innovations, employment in fast-growing companies, venture capital awareness, crowdfunding awareness and possibilities of counselling in the implementation of start-ups) and 6 indicators of creative potential (openness and diversity, human capital, cultural environment, technologies, institutional environment and creative outputs). Numerical values of these indicators are obtained from secondary research studies – e. g. modified Slovak Creative Index, Regional Innovation Scoreboard, Slovak Start-up Report and websites of innovation incubators and crowdfunding platforms. To obtain the true values of these criteria, the analysis of secondary data – desk research and the method of pairwise comparison with 91 respondents (students of Slovak universities of economic orientation with Slovak or Ukrainian nationality) was used to determine the real significance (weights) of the criteria. According to pairwise comparison, the most important indicator of start-up implementation is possibilities of counselling and the most important indicator of creative potential is creative outputs. Consequently, the relationship between the two comparisons is quantified. The global benchmark based on the implementation of start-ups is the Bratislava region, as well as in the case with creative potential. There is a strong correlation (85.5 %) between the scores of the compared regions. The final ranking of the 5 regions out of 8 in both comparisons is also the same. The theoretical contribution is extending of the issue of benchmarking from traditional understanding (products, services, processes) to spatial understanding (region). The main practical contribution of the paper is to identify the weaknesses of each of the compared regions through benchmarking. Its implementation can be the basis for the development of regional strategies and the introduction of new study programs at universities.\nKeywords: benchmarking, creative potential, region, Slovak Republic, Start-UP.</jats:p>"

To make use of this information effectively requires DNA extraction facilities and marker production facilities that can efficiently deploy the desired set of markers across samples with a rapid turnaround time that allows for selection before crosses needed to be made. In reality, breeders often have a short window of time to make decisions by the time they are able collect all their phenotyping data and receive corresponding genotyping data. This presents a challenge to organize information and utilize them in downstream analyses to support decisions made by breeders. In order to implement genomic selection routinely as part of breeding programs one would need an efficient genotype data storage system.

The TSCC consists of three cost elements, namely, ordering cost, holding cost and shortage cost. These three cost elements, in turn, depend on inventory policy parameters, such as review periods and base stock levels, at various echelons.

Secondary data were collected from relevant websites of various government organizations of India, company’s websites, annual reports, official statements from the companies, tea market reports, annual reports of the Indian Tea Association, the Tea Board of India, Tea Research Institute and published reports, etc.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The “point of origin” of TLSC is a tea garden, “point of consumption” is considered as a tea factory and green tea leaves (GTLs) forms the basic raw material. This SC includes mainly three players: Tea leaves growers, manufacturers of made tea and tea leaves agents. This study identifies the three types of TLSCs existing in Assam: TLSC1, TLSC2 and TLSC3. Among them, only TLSC1 is both responsive as well as an efficient chain, while the rest are only responsive chains.

The study should have involved more tea estates and small tea gardens for better classification and taxonomy.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed model suggests that small tea growers may create a co-operative whereby smaller tea gardens (STGs) (members of the co-operative) unite to act as a single large garden, set up their own co-operative factory and recruit permanent tea plucking laborers. This up-gradation of TLSC2 and TLSC3 to TLSC4 may enable a group of STGs to work in a manner similar to a Tea Estate.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>To the best of authors’ knowledge this is one of the first studies to classify the TLSC in Assam.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

Growing economy leads to more job opportunities and movement of people from rural to urban areas. Public road transport hence plays a significant role as a support system in carrying passengers. This paper discusses the efficiency of State Transport Undertakings of India, in particular, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) using the technique of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and regression analysis. A data set of 46 State Transport Undertakings of India have been considered for the study. DEA was applied to compute the efficiencies of units under study. Potential improvements in the input and output variables were computed for the inefficient units. Regression analysis was then performed to identify the explanatory variables that significantly affect the input and output variables. It was observed that DTC is one amongst the worst performers. It showed a technical inefficiency of 50.94% and was operating on decreasing returns to scale. Further, DTC needs to increase its output substantially in order to attain the level of efficiency. Also it is not utilizing its resources optimally as it needs to reduce all its inputs. In other words, DTC is not utilizing its resources as optimally as its efficient peers. This paper is an attempt to apply regression technique along with the non parametric technique of Data Envelopment Analysis so that the decision makers of DTC can identify the areas where improvement is required and plan a strategy to improve their performance. This would enable DTC to move from a loss incurring to a profit making unit.</jats:p>"

Focusing on concrete- filled steel tubes, such members exhibit primarily an increased ultimate strength as well as a higher ductility in comparison to similar members with a homogeneous cross section made from either steel or concrete. Research issues on the structural behavior of such composite members include the interaction of the materials as well as the mechanical behavior and stochastic characteristics of the individual materials. As the materials are subjected typically to a multiaxial stress state, modelling of the material behavior is still a challenging issue in those applications. In particular for concrete, different material models were proposed in previous research for simulation of the actual behavior. This paper reports on characteristics of the structural behavior of concrete-filled steel tubes as well as on a plasticity material model for numerical simulations of this behavior. Some common approaches in application of this material model are collected and discussed, followed by an exemplary numerical application on concrete-filled steel tube specimens for the purpose of benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

So the comparison between them produces an obvious result indicating better service quality in private hospitals. Present study minimizes this gap by comparing the service quality of public and private medical college hospitals. Medical colleges ensure access to health services for a larger group of people. Thus, similarity in the segment of population receiving medical services in public and private medical colleges is higher, making the comparison of perceived service quality fairer.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

In order to break monopolistic control of Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), Indian Railways entered competition in the container segment in January 2006 through private-public participation for customer-centric competitiveness. The purpose of this chapter is to benchmark the performance indicators in CONCOR. A case study has been conducted employing super-efficiency models of data envelopment analysis (DEA) on secondary data of CONCOR container terminals from 1994-95 to 2015-16 for performance evaluation within CONCOR. The exercise identified efficiency trends fluctuating between 75.83% to 109.51% (CCR model) and 93.52% to 100% (BCC model) within CONCOR, owing to lack of operational planning and lack of efficient staff. </jats:p>"

The authors got them verified by various relevant stakeholders through a series of formal and informal discussions. Some of them were dropped due to observed variations or their inability to offer insights to arrive at the final set of KPIs. In this paper, the authors use actual process-level data. Government of India’s National Informatics Center has implemented e-Procurement portals in various states and public enterprises (PEs) in India which provide tender-wise detailed e-tendering process data. The authors designed a web crawler that collects these data in a tabular format, which allows an easy analysis and comparison to measure and compare government tendering process performance for the last five years for the two large PEs. The authors also engaged in discussions with the procurement executives of the two PSEs to derive meaningful managerial insights from the results obtained.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Using the public procurement data visualization tool, the authors compare the procurement process of two of the largest Indian PEs, Coal India Limited and Indian Oil Corporation on the developed KPIs and draw insights. The results show significant difference in their procurement process performance due to different practices followed by them. Through interaction with the procurement managers of these two organizations, the authors identify few good procurement practices that can be applied to improve public procurement process.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper uses actual process-level data which can be used not just to identify improvement opportunities but also to gauge the impact of any process-level change.

There are three significant contributions to the theory of competitiveness. It provides a theoretical framework of competitiveness to address the current market conditions of volatility. Second, it incorporates the dimensions like supply chain management, presence of global value chains and employee empowerment. Third, it clearly identifies the dimensions of competitiveness relevant in current context, like ethical behavior of firms, protection of intellectual property and innovation.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed approach provides a good basis for assessing the competitive performance of the companies. This can help researchers and practitioners in deciding how to improve the competitiveness of a company.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The research proposes a theoretical framework for measuring the competitiveness of firms from a specific industry.

Removing the bonds of cabling and wires will provide the ability of free movement and the possibility of deployment in previously unreachable locations. To build confidence in the reliability of wireless transmission systems, a method for measuring said reliability is required. This article describes such a method which forms the basis of two interlinked testbeds being developed within the scope of the Celtic Plus project ReICOvAir.</jats:p>"

          "abstract": "<jats:p>This study assessed the current status of solid waste management (SWM) in the City of Kigali (CoK), the capital city of Rwanda. This assessment was done using systems analysis methodology of “wasteaware” benchmark indicators for integrated sustainable waste management in cities. This method of assessing helps to assess the Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) in a city according to its physical components and governance features. Data were collected during a 6-month period from May to October 2017, but verification took other four months (Up to February 2018). Data were obtained from official reports, legal documents, and interviews with key personnel and operators and also from official and unofficial dumpsites visits. In CoK, approximately 232,870 tons of MSW is generated per year, MSW collection and transportation is done by private companies but the only dumpsite present in Kigali is fully controlled by the City of Kigali. Residents pay waste collectors according to their social classes and their locations. There is no official recycling system; recycling activities are informally performed by private companies and some wastes, like plastic bottles, are taken to Uganda and Tanzania to be recycled. This study found that the recycling rate was 10% contrarily to the 2% which is recorded by official sources. This study has contributed by filling the gap in literature on waste management for the city of Kigali and it recommends that the Government represented by the CoK should do more in terms of investing in SWM and creating a relationship between private waste collectors and local communities, and the private sector should be mobilized to invest in SWM activities.</jats:p>"

This shows that there is an urgent need for behavior change and considerable educational strategies for proper management and rehabilitation (Reddy, 2000). This research has identified and ranked the significant factors which affect the QOL in diabetic patients in India. The paper aims to discuss these issues.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In this paper, nine factors which affect the QOL in diabetic patients in India have been identified through review of the literature and evaluated by total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) approach, i.e. an extended version of ISM. In this approach, interpretations of the interrelationship among factors have been discussed. Therefore, TISM approach has been used to develop the model and the mutual interactions among these factors.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The results of the model and MICMAC analysis indicate that diet restriction, body pain and satisfaction with treatment are the top-level factors.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Identification of the factors that have a remarkable effect on the QOL in diabetic patients is very important so that the doctors and other healthcare professionals may handle these factors efficiently and proper rehabilitation can be provided to such patients.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper has used an application of the TISM approach to interpret the mutual relationship by using the tool of interpretive matrix and has developed a framework to calculate the drive and the dependence power of factors using MICMAC analysis. The issues related to QOL are extremely important, as they can strongly anticipate a person’s capability to govern his lifestyle with disease like diabetes mellitus and maintain good health in the long run. This shows the urgent requirement of an optimized model which can predict and interpret the relationships among these factors. In this research, the interrelationships among these factors have been developed and interpretations of these interactions have been given to develop a comprehensive model so that QOL of diabetic patients may be improved.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

An application of MCDM method, the hybrid DANP–VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) model, is used for e-tailers’ distribution strategy evaluation. The choice of distribution strategies under various dimensions is evaluated.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The authors used a hybrid MCDM model to solve the decision-making framework, which combines Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), DEMATEL-based analytic network process and VIKOR method. Data were collected from the experts (e-tail manager, logistics manager, operations manager and distribution center (DC) manager) using two questionnaires, first for the influential relationship among the criteria and dimensions and second for a performance rating of each alternative (distribution strategies) against each criterion.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>DANP with VIKOR method prioritizes the distribution strategies in the following order: DC shipment, drop shipment, click and collect, store shipment and click and reserve. Performance gap was calculated based on the VIKOR method to provide distribution strategies to an e-tailer under different situations. The authors infer that in developing country, product characteristics and transportation have a major influence on deciding the distribution strategy.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Decision-making framework will provide e-tail mangers a knowledge-based understanding to select the distribution strategy under the different situations related to the performance, product, e-tailer and external characteristics for smooth order fulfillment process. The insights developed by this research provide a framework for rational decision making in distribution strategy selection in e-business.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This is the first kind of a study which offers a decision framework for e-tail managers on how to choose distribution strategies under different situations which are related to the performance, product, e-tailer and external characteristics.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

At first, the general definition of learning analytics is examined. Additionally, the authors shed light on case studies of universities that have already implemented learning analytics. Moreover, the Chinese educational environment is examined through a thorough analysis of the learning analytics necessity. Based on the literature review, a learning analytics tool is proposed. In a technical basis, the tool is a combination of ELLI or Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory, a dispositional learning analytics tool and a recommender system. The ultimate function of the tool is that it links students with a specific educational profile with successful students with similar profiles. Finally, the author identified the key limitations of the prototype and performed a general analysis on the tools goals and expectations in the Chinese Higher Education Institutions.</jats:p>"

The adoption level of these five key factors of TQM varies across service organisations in different countries. The results also confirmed that some of the TQM elements are antecedents of customer- and employee-focused performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Multinational service organisations may use such an instrument to evaluate TQM implementation among worldwide operations and then benchmark their performance.

In today’s competitive scenario, if industry wants to perpetuate its name in the market, then it has to supervene proper thinking and smart approach. Therefore, the combination of lean, green and agile manufacturing systems can provide better and beneficial results. The purpose of this paper is to discern the barriers to the combined lean green agile manufacturing system (LGAMS), understand their interdependence and develop a framework to enhance LGAMS by using total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) and MICMAC (Matriced’ Impacts Croise’s Multiplication Appliquée a UN Classement) Analysis.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper uses TISM methodology and MICMAC analysis to deduce the interrelationships between the barriers and rank them accordingly. A total of 13 barriers have been identified through extensive literature review and discussion with experts.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>An integrated LGAMS has been presented that balances the lean, green and agile paradigms and can help supply chains become more efficient, streamlined and sustainable. Barriers are identified while referring to all three strategies to showcase the clear relevance. TISM models the barriers in different levels showcasing direct and important transitive relations. Further, MICMAC analysis distributes the barriers in four clusters in accordance with their driving and dependence power.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The inferences have been drawn from a model developed on the basis of inputs from a small fraction of the industry and academia and may show variations when considering the whole industry.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The outcome of this research can contribute to bringing the change to the manufacturing systems used in most developing nations.

To make use of this information effectively requires DNA extraction facilities and marker production facilities that can efficiently deploy the desired set of markers across samples with a rapid turnaround time that allows for selection before crosses needed to be made. In reality, breeders often have a short window of time to make decisions by the time they are able to collect all their phenotyping data and receive corresponding genotyping data. This presents a challenge to organize information and utilize it in downstream analyses to support decisions made by breeders. In order to implement genomic selection routinely as part of breeding programs, one would need an efficient genotyping data storage system. We selected and benchmarked six popular open-source data storage systems, including relational database management and columnar storage systems.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>We found that data extract times are greatly influenced by the orientation in which genotype data is stored in a system. HDF5 consistently performed best, in part because it can more efficiently work with both orientations of the allele matrix.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability</jats:title><jats:p>http://gobiin1.bti.cornell.edu:6083/projects/GBM/repos/benchmarking/browse</jats:p></jats:sec>"

To achieve this goal, this paper is based on the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) framework that incorporates the three dimensions of sustainability with cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) tools. The study has shown that in the production of porcelain stoneware one of the major environmental problems, in addition to production in the strict sense, is the distribution system of the product to end users and, to a lesser extent but always significant, the process of supplying raw materials. Finally, it was highlighted that the joint use of the three impact assessment tools (LCA, LCC, S-LCA) requires further methodological work to avoid the risk of double counting of sustainability performance. This research has adopted a detailed methodological approach, both in the collection and in the processing of data, keeping the main phases of the production process separate. In this way, it has been possible to highlight that the major environmental criticalities are just beyond the “gate” of the ceramic factories, along the logistics chain. The study also proposes for the Italian ceramic sector not only indicators of environmental sustainability but also economic and social.</jats:p>"

Public policy implementation (in this case, the policy of forest fire management) is influenced by the role played by government and by the participation of the public and stakeholders (in this case, companies), as well as the effects of good governance. Thus, from the empirical problems associated with theoretical problems and normative problems, this study raises the influence of the role of central and local government on the implementation of forest fire prevention policy in Indonesia, which is moderated by the good governance variable.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study used a quantitative approach by adopting survey methodology. The study has aimed to assess both large and small population groups, by selecting and reviewing carefully chosen samples of the population to find the incidence, distribution and relative interrelation of the variables considered (Kerlinger and Lee, 2000). The survey was undertaken in areas of Indonesia that have a high level of vulnerability to forest fires. There are currently six provinces – Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan and South Kalimantan – that have the highest intensity of forest fires. The study population was taken from 105 villages in those six major provinces experiencing forest fires. Sample size precision was determined by using Slovin’s formula with a precision of 10 percent and, thus, a sample size of 52 was obtained.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The central government’s activities have no significant effect on regional forest fire prevention. However, the results found that there is a significant effect caused by the interaction between the central and local governments and their governance of forest fire prevention. Even though the direct effect is not significant, the interaction effect significantly influences the forest fire prevention governance variable, which is a pure moderator. This study found that the role of central government has no effect on forest fire prevention. If the role of the central government is high, it will not impact the effectiveness of forest fire prevention, which is reflected in the aspects of prevention and early warning, reward and punishment, the improvement and management of ecosystems by reviewing courts, law enforcement and national and regional synergy.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This is one of the few public administration science studies to have investigated the relationship between good governance and forest fire policy in Indonesia, particularly the combined roles played by central and local governments.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

It is based on videotaped oral presentation assignments of Cuban PhD students for peer and teacher assessment. In order to avoid bias and provide validity to the results, the PhD students’ videotaped oral presentation assignments have been rated by language testing experts from three different Flemish universities, which are included in the Interuniversity Testing Consortium (IUTC). A selection of these assignments will be transferred to the university Moodle platform, and this compilation may be used to enable the start of a Cuban corpus of internationally rated presentations of academic English. Therefore, the results obtained will provide language teachers with a growing database of video recordings to facilitate benchmarking activities and promote standardized assessment in the Cuban academic context.</jats:p>"

The companies are considered in the organizational field, representing iterative aggregate system of a big order with a nonlinear feedback where the order is defined by the number of differential equations. The system is described by coupled Van Der Pol differential equations with random right parts and a time lag. The model is built on the example of the market interaction of the two largest retailer networks. The developed model shows the mechanism of competition of the companies' pairs which are suggested to be investigated within the framework of the bench-marking concept. </jats:p>"

The [Mo<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>13</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>2−</jats:sup> polymer‐based structure confers a high density of exposed sulfur moieties, widely regarded as the HER active sites. However, their intrinsic complexity conceals full understanding of their exact role in HER catalysis, hampering their full potential for water splitting applications. In this report, a unifying approach is adopted accounting for modifications in the inherent electrochemistry (EC), HER mechanism, and surface species to maximize the AE‐MoS<jats:italic><jats:sub>x</jats:sub></jats:italic> electroactivity over a broad pH region (0–10). Dramatic enhancements in HER performance by selective electrochemical cycling within reductive (overpotential shift, η<jats:sub>HER</jats:sub> ≈ −350 mV) and electro‐oxidative windows (η<jats:sub>HER</jats:sub> ≈ −290 mV) are accompanied by highly stable performance in mildly acidic electrolytes. Joint analysis of X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman, and EC experiments corroborate the key role of bridging and terminal S ligands as active site generators at low pH, and reveal molybdenum oxysulfides (Mo<jats:sup>5+</jats:sup>O<jats:italic><jats:sub>x</jats:sub></jats:italic>S<jats:italic><jats:sub>y</jats:sub></jats:italic>) to be the most active HER moiety in AE‐MoS<jats:italic><jats:sub>x</jats:sub></jats:italic> in mildly acidic‐to‐neutral environments. These findings will be extremely beneficial for future tailoring of MoS<jats:italic><jats:sub>x</jats:sub></jats:italic> materials and their implementation in commercial electrolyzer technologies.</jats:p>"

The Wasteaware indicators are used to present a detailed systems analysis for Kigali in Rwanda, including a mass flow diagram; comparative data are taken from the Wasteaware database for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Kampala, Uganda, Nairobi, Kenya, and also for neighboring Maputo, Mozambique. The stand-out result is the relatively high collection coverage achieved, in Maputo with extensive international technical assistance, and in Kigali using its own local resources. In both cases, governance factors are key. Kigali uses a public–private partnership, with exclusive franchises in 35 sectors being tendered every three years; households pay an affordable fee depending on their ability to pay (the service is free to the poorest category); and 95% fee collection rates are achieved, partly through co-collection with charges for local security patrols, which is a service people value highly given the recent history of the country. Another key priority to improve SWM across East Africa is to eliminate open dumping – only Kampala currently has an engineered disposal site. Recycling rates also need to be increased – only Nairobi currently has a good baseline to build on (30%). Common weaknesses include a lack of segregation at source, of institutional capacity, and of available and reliable waste data. </jats:p>"

Its basic principle consists of identifying the best (the benchmark), then comparing with the best, and learning from the best. In healthcare, the concept of benchmarking or establishing benchmarks has been less specific, where comparisons often do not target the best, but the average results. The goal, however, remains improvement in patient outcome. This article outlines the application of benchmarking and proposes a standard approach of benchmark determination in surgery, including the establishment of best achievable real-world postoperative outcomes. Parameters used for this purpose must be reproducible, objective and universal. A systematic approach for determining benchmarks enables self-assessment of surgical outcome and facilitates the detection of areas for improvement. The intention of benchmarking is to stimulate surgeons' genuine endeavour for perfection, rather than to judge centre or surgeon performance.</jats:p>"

Given uncertainties in the observational data we use to drive and evaluate hydrological models, and uncertainties in the structure and parameterisation of models we use to produce hydrological simulations and predictions, it is essential that model evaluation is undertaken within an uncertainty analysis framework. Here, we benchmark the capability of multiple, lumped hydrological models across Great Britain, by focusing on daily flow and peak flow simulation. Four hydrological model structures from the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) were applied to over 1100 catchments. Model performance was then evaluated using a standard performance metric for daily flows, and more novel performance metrics for peak flows considering parameter uncertainty. Our results show that simple, lumped hydrological models were able to produce adequate simulations across most of Great Britain, with median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency scores of 0.72–0.78 across all catchments. All four models showed a similar spatial pattern of performance, producing better simulations in the wetter catchments to the west, and poor model performance in Scotland and southeast England. Poor model performance was often linked to the catchment water balance, with models unable to capture the catchment hydrology where the water balance did not close. Overall, performance was similar between model structures, but different models performed better for different catchment characteristics and for assessing daily or peak flows, demonstrating the value of using an ensemble of model structures. This research demonstrates what conceptual lumped models can achieve as a performance benchmark, as well as providing interesting insights into where and why these simple models may fail. The large number of river catchments included in this study makes it an appropriate benchmark for any future developments of a national model of Great Britain.\n                        </jats:p>"

However, still lacking are better statistical models for ordinal phenotypes to improve the accuracy of the selection of candidate genotypes. For this reason, in this paper we explore the genomic based prediction performance of two popular machine learning methods: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) methods vs. the Bayesian threshold genomic best linear unbiased prediction (TGBLUP) model. We used the percentage of cases correctly classified (PCCC) as a metric to measure the prediction performance, and seven real data sets to evaluate the prediction accuracy, and found that the best predictions (in four out of the seven data sets) in terms of PCCC occurred under the TGLBUP model, while the worst occurred under the SVM method. Also, in general we found no statistical differences between using 1, 2 and 3 layers under the MLP models, which means that many times the conventional neuronal network model with only one layer is enough. However, although even that the TGBLUP model was better, we found that the predictions of MLP and SVM were very competitive with the advantage that the SVM was the most efficient in terms of the computational time required.</jats:p>"

Each one of these parameters contains a variety of factors that trigger liquefaction and have varying degrees of importance. However, estimating accurate and reliable liquefaction-induced hazards requires identification and benchmarking of the most influential factors that control soil liquefaction. Seismic soil liquefaction factors were identified by Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach and analyzed through Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and the Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) methodologies. The ISM model presented the relationships between fifteen seismic soil liquefaction factors and their benchmarking position from higher to lower-level significant factors in hierarchy. MICMAC is used to examine the strength of the relationship between seismic soil liquefaction significant factors based on their driving and dependence power. This research characterizes the identification and benchmarking of the seismic soil liquefaction factors and their relationships. The results show that the factors—duration of earthquake, peak ground acceleration, drainage condition, and standard penetration test (SPT) blow counts—influence seismic soil liquefaction directly and soil type is the governing factor that forms the base of the ISM hierarchy and consequently triggers seismic soil liquefaction. The results provide a more accurate way of selecting significant factors for establishment of seismic soil liquefaction potential and liquefaction-induced hazards risk assessment models.</jats:p>"

Recently, the CME Arrival and Impact working team has made significant progress toward defining community‐agreed metrics and validation methods to assess the current state of CME modeling capabilities. This will allow the community to quantify our current capabilities and track progress in models over time. First, it is crucial that the community focuses on the collection of the necessary metadata for transparency and reproducibility of results. Concerning CME arrival and impact we have identified six different metadata types: 3‐D CME measurement, model description, model input, CME (non)arrival observation, model output data, and metrics and validation methods. Second, the working team has also identified a validation time period, where all events within the following two periods will be considered: 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012 and January 2015 to 31 December 2015. Those two periods amount to a total of about 100 hit events at Earth and a large amount of misses. Considering a time period will remove any bias in selecting events and the event set will represent a sample set that will not be biased by user selection. Lastly, we have defined the basic metrics and skill scores that the CME Arrival and Impact working team will focus on.</jats:p>"

Little is known about their soil phosphorus (P) requirements, but controlled environment experiments indicate that at least some may differ in their P fertiliser requirements. In this study, pasture legume varieties, including T. subterraneum as the reference species, were grown at up to four sites in any one year over a 3-year period (in total, seven site × year experiments) to measure herbage growth responses in spring to increased soil P availability. A critical soil test P concentration (corresponding to 95% maximum yield) was estimated for 15 legumes and two pasture grasses. The critical soil P requirements of most of the legumes did not differ consistently from that of T. subterraneum, indicating their soil fertility management should follow the current soil test P guidelines for temperate Australian pastures. However, the critical P requirement of Medicago sativa was higher than that of T. subterraneum, but remains ill-defined because extractable soil P concentrations in these experiments were often not high enough to permit a critical P estimate. Three forage crop legumes (Trifolium incarnatum, Trifolium purpureum, Trifolium vesiculosum) and two pasture legumes (Ornithopus compressus, Ornithopus sativus) had lower critical soil test P concentrations. It may be feasible to manage pastures based on these species to a lower soil test P benchmark without compromising yield.</jats:p>"

A number of benchmark studies have been undertaken; however, these can present conflicting results. In order to address this issue we have applied a robust<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>-score ranking procedure and a network meta-analysis method to identify software tools that are consistently accurate for mapping DNA sequences to taxonomic hierarchies.

This paper compares popular grid\n   synchronization algorithms on grid voltage anomalies. The compared\n   algorithms are divided in three groups: without filtering, with filtering in\n   synchronous reference frame and with filtering in stationary reference\n   frame. The behaviour of the algorithms is tested in a laboratory, using\n   dSpace 1103 as a platform on which the algorithms are compiled and OMICRON\n   CMC 356 as a programmable grid voltage generator. The benchmarks conducted\n   in this paper include voltage sags, grid voltages harmonics, DC offset and\n   frequency step change. The obtained results show that there are significant\n   differences in tested PLL responses for some networks disturbances.</jats:p>"

Many reverse-engineering methods require discrete quantitative data as input, while many experimental data are continuous. Some studies have started to reveal the impact that the choice of data discretization has on the performance of reverse-engineering methods. However, more comprehensive studies are still greatly needed to systematically and quantitatively understand the impact that discretization methods have on inference methods. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for systematic comparative methods that can help select between discretization methods. In this work, we consider four published intracellular networks inferred with their respective time-series datasets. We discretized the data using different discretization methods. Across all datasets, changing the data discretization to a more appropriate one improved the reverse-engineering methods’ performance. We observed no universal best discretization method across different time-series datasets. Thus, we propose DiscreeTest, a two-step evaluation metric for ranking discretization methods for time-series data. The underlying assumption of DiscreeTest is that an optimal discretization method should preserve the dynamic patterns observed in the original data across all variables. We used the same datasets and networks to show that DiscreeTest is able to identify an appropriate discretization among several candidate methods. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a method for benchmarking and selecting an appropriate discretization method for time-series data has been proposed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title><jats:p>All the datasets, reverse-engineering methods and source code used in this paper are available in Vera-Licona’s lab Github repository: https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Benchmarking_TSDiscretizations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title><jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

The MC model of the 18 MV photon beam was then validated against the measurements for different field sizes (5×5, 30×30 and 40×40 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) by gamma index analysis. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS:</jats:title><jats:p> The optimum values for electron energy, spatial FWHM and mean angular spread were 14.2 MeV, 0.08 cm and 0.8 degree, respectively. The MC simulations yielded the comparable measurement results of these optimum parameters. The gamma passing rates (with acceptance criteria of 1% /1 mm) for percentage depth doses were found to be 100% for all field sizes. For cross-line profiles, the gamma passing rates were 100%, 97%, 95%, 96% and 95% for 5×5, 10×10, 20×20, 30×30 and 40×40 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> field sizes, respectively. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title><jats:p> By validation of the MC model of Siemens Oncor<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> linac using various field sizes, it was found that both dose profiles of small and large field sizes were very sensitive to the changes in spatial FWHM and mean angular spread of the primary electron beam from the bending magnet. Hence, it is recommended that both small and large field sizes of the 18 MV photon beams should be considered in the Monte Carlo linac modeling. </jats:p></jats:sec>"

Some 1192 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (46.1%) and 763 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (29.5%). Surgical approach involved open procedures in 52.1% and minimally invasive operations in 47.9%. Chest anastomoses were done most commonly (60.7%) and R0 resections were accomplished in 93.4% of patients. The overall incidence of complications was 59% with the most common individual complications being pneumonia (14.6%) and atrial dysrhythmia (14.5%). Anastomotic leak, conduit necrosis, chyle leaks, recurrent nerve injury occurred in 11.4%, 1.3%, 4.7%, and 4.2% of cases, respectively.

This is largely due to the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research fields or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the development of new powerful techniques for title and title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical research.</jats:p>"
