The study synthesizes longitudinal data from five distinct sources: Google Trends (public interest), Google Books Ngram (literary discourse), Crossref.org (academic publications), and Bain & Company surveys (executive usability and satisfaction). The analysis reveals a dual life cycle for Process Reengineering. Initially, it followed the classic pattern of a management fad, characterized by an explosive adoption boom in the mid-1990s, strongly correlated with public interest, followed by a drastic decline. This phase was marked by a significant negative correlation between high adoption rates and low user satisfaction. However, the analysis also uncovers a second, more persistent life cycle. Academic and literary discourse continued long after practical adoption collapsed, and user satisfaction paradoxically rose to its peak decades later, suggesting a ""survival effect.""
