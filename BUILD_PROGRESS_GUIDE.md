# Docker Build Progress Guide

## What's Happening During Build

Your build is **working correctly**! Here's what each stage does and how long it takes:

---

## Build Timeline (First Build)

### Stage 1: Builder (2-4 minutes)

```
[builder 1/5] FROM python:3.11-slim
├─ Downloads base image (30 seconds)
└─ ✅ CACHED after first time

[builder 2/5] WORKDIR /build
├─ Creates working directory (instant)
└─ ✅ CACHED

[builder 3/5] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install build-essential...
├─ Installs gcc, g++, gfortran, etc. (1 minute)
└─ ✅ CACHED after first time

[builder 4/5] COPY dashboard_app/requirements.txt .
├─ Copies requirements file (instant)
└─ ✅ CACHED if requirements.txt unchanged

[builder 5/5] RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir /wheels -r requirements.txt
├─ 🔄 THIS IS THE SLOW STEP (2-3 minutes)
├─ Compiling numpy (30-45 seconds) ⏳
├─ Compiling scipy (45-60 seconds) ⏳
├─ Compiling pandas (30 seconds) ⏳
├─ Compiling scikit-learn (30 seconds) ⏳
├─ Compiling statsmodels (20 seconds) ⏳
├─ Other packages (20 seconds)
└─ ✅ CACHED after first time (only 5 seconds on rebuild!)
```

**Why it's slow:**

- numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn are **large C/Fortran libraries**
- They need to be **compiled from source**
- This happens in the builder stage so it's **cached for future builds**

**Progress indicators you'll see:**

```
Building wheels for collected packages: numpy, scipy, pandas...
  Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): started
  Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): still running...
  Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): still running...
  Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): finished ✓
```

### Stage 2: Runtime (30-60 seconds)

```
[stage-1 1/16] FROM python:3.11-slim
└─ ✅ CACHED (already downloaded)

[stage-1 2/16] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install curl...
├─ Installs runtime dependencies only (20 seconds)
└─ ✅ CACHED after first time

[stage-1 3/16] RUN useradd -m -u 1000 dashuser
└─ Creates non-root user (instant)

[stage-1 4/16] WORKDIR /app
└─ Sets working directory (instant)

[stage-1 5/16] COPY --from=builder /wheels /wheels
└─ Copies pre-built wheels (5 seconds)

[stage-1 6/16] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir /wheels/*
├─ Installs from wheels (FAST - 10 seconds)
└─ No compilation needed!

[stage-1 7/16] RUN pip install gunicorn gevent
└─ Installs production server (5 seconds)

[stage-1 8-15] COPY application files
└─ Copies dashboard_app/, assets/, etc. (5 seconds)

[stage-1 16/16] USER dashuser
└─ Switches to non-root user (instant)
```

## Current Build Status

Based on your output:

```
[builder 5/5] RUN pip wheel ... (39.9s and counting)
  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml): started
```

**Status:** ✅ **NORMAL - Building numpy/scipy wheels**

**What's happening right now:**

- Compiling numpy from source (C/Fortran code)
- This is the slowest part of the build
- Expected total time: 2-3 minutes for this step
- After this, remaining steps are fast (<1 minute)

**Progress you'll see:**

```
Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): started
Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): still running...
Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): still running...
Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): finished with status 'done'
Building wheel for scipy (pyproject.toml): started
Building wheel for scipy (pyproject.toml): still running...
...
```

---

## Expected Total Build Time

### First Build (No Cache)

- **Stage 1 (Builder):** 2-4 minutes

  - numpy: 30-45 seconds
  - scipy: 45-60 seconds
  - pandas: 30 seconds
  - scikit-learn: 30 seconds
  - statsmodels: 20 seconds
  - Other packages: 20 seconds

- **Stage 2 (Runtime):** 30-60 seconds
  - Install from wheels: 10 seconds
  - Copy files: 20 seconds
  - Setup: 10 seconds

**Total:** 3-5 minutes ⏱️

### Subsequent Builds (With Cache)

- **If requirements.txt unchanged:** 30-60 seconds
- **If only app code changed:** 10-20 seconds
- **If requirements.txt changed:** 2-4 minutes (rebuild wheels)

---

## How to Speed Up Future Builds

### 1. Layer Caching (Automatic)

Docker caches each layer. If nothing changes, it reuses the cache:

```dockerfile
# This layer is cached if requirements.txt doesn't change
COPY dashboard_app/requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir /wheels -r requirements.txt

# This layer is cached if app code doesn't change
COPY dashboard_app/ ./dashboard_app/
```

### 2. Use BuildKit (Enabled by Default)

```bash
# BuildKit is faster and shows better progress
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker build -t dash-dashboard .
```

### 3. Pre-pull Base Image

```bash
# Download base image before building
docker pull python:3.11-slim

# Then build
docker build -t dash-dashboard .
```

## Is My Build Stuck?

### Normal Behavior

If you see this, **it's working fine**:

```
[builder 5/5] RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir /wheels -r requirements.txt
=> => # Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): started
=> => # Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): still running...
```

**Wait time:** 2-3 minutes for this step

### Actually Stuck

If you see **no output for 10+ minutes**, it might be stuck:

```bash
# Cancel build
Ctrl+C

# Try with more verbose output
docker build --progress=plain -t dash-dashboard .

# Or try without cache
docker build --no-cache -t dash-dashboard .
```

---

## Monitoring Build Progress

### Real-Time Progress

```bash
# Build with plain progress (more detailed)
docker build --progress=plain -t dash-dashboard . 2>&1 | tee build.log

# In another terminal, watch the log
tail -f build.log
```

### Check Docker Resources

```bash
# Check if Docker has enough resources
docker info | grep -A 5 "CPUs\|Total Memory"

# Recommended:
# CPUs: 4+
# Memory: 4GB+
```

---

## What's Being Compiled

These packages require compilation (slow):

1. **numpy** (30-45 sec) - Numerical computing with C/Fortran
2. **scipy** (45-60 sec) - Scientific computing with Fortran
3. **pandas** (30 sec) - Data analysis with Cython
4. **scikit-learn** (30 sec) - Machine learning with C
5. **statsmodels** (20 sec) - Statistical models

These install quickly (pre-built wheels):

- dash, plotly, flask - Pure Python
- dash-bootstrap-components - Pure Python
- Most other dependencies

---

## Current Status: ✅ NORMAL

Your build showing:

```
[builder 5/5] RUN pip wheel ... (39.9s and counting)
  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml): started
```

**This is NORMAL and EXPECTED.**

**What's happening:**

- Building numpy wheel from source
- Compiling C and Fortran code
- This takes 2-3 minutes total
- Be patient, it will complete

**Next steps you'll see:**

```
Building wheel for numpy: finished ✓
Building wheel for scipy: started
Building wheel for scipy: still running...
Building wheel for scipy: finished ✓
Building wheel for pandas: started
...
Successfully built all wheels
```

**Then:**

- Stage 2 will be fast (30-60 seconds)
- Total build time: 3-5 minutes
- Future builds: 30 seconds (cached!)

---

## Quick Reference

### Is it working?

✅ YES if you see: "Building wheel for X: still running..."
❌ NO if: No output for 10+ minutes

### How long should I wait?

⏱️ First build: 3-5 minutes total
⏱️ Cached build: 30-60 seconds

### What if it fails?

📋 Check error message
🔍 Read DOCKER_LOCAL_TESTING.md

---

**Status:** ✅ Your build is progressing normally  
**Action:** Wait for completion (2-3 more minutes)  
**Next:** Container will start automatically
