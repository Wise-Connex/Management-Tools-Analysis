# Critical Fixes Applied - Ready to Rebuild

## ðŸ”§ Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing libgomp (OpenMP Library)

**Error:**

```
ImportError: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

**Cause:** scikit-learn requires OpenMP library at runtime

**Fix Applied:** Added `libgomp1` to runtime dependencies in Dockerfile (line 47)

```dockerfile
# Before
RUN apt-get install -y curl libopenblas0 liblapack3

# After
RUN apt-get install -y curl libopenblas0 liblapack3 libgomp1
```

### Issue 2: Too Many Workers (33 workers!)

**Problem:** Gunicorn calculated 33 workers (CPU count \* 2 + 1)

**Cause:** Docker reports container CPU limits, not actual CPUs

**Fix Applied:** Capped workers at 8 maximum in gunicorn.conf.py (line 22-27)

```python
# Before
workers = int(os.getenv('MAX_WORKERS', multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2 + 1))

# After
cpu_count = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
default_workers = min(cpu_count * 2 + 1, 8)  # Cap at 8
workers = int(os.getenv('MAX_WORKERS', default_workers))
```

## ðŸš€ Rebuild Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Up

```bash
# Stop and remove old container
docker stop dash-test 2>/dev/null || true
docker rm dash-test 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove old image
docker rmi dash-dashboard 2>/dev/null || true

# Clean Docker cache (optional but recommended)
docker system prune -f
```

### Step 2: Rebuild

```bash
# Rebuild with fixes
docker build -t dash-dashboard .

# Expected: Build completes successfully in 4-6 minutes
```

### Step 3: Run Container

```bash
# Run with explicit worker count (recommended)
docker run -d \
  --name dash-test \
  -p 8050:8050 \
  -e FLASK_ENV=production \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  -e MAX_WORKERS=4 \
  dash-dashboard

# Wait for startup
sleep 20
```

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
# Check logs (should see no errors)
docker logs dash-test

# Should see:
# [INFO] Number of workers changed from None to 4
# [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8050
# [INFO] Booting worker with pid: ...

# Test health
curl http://localhost:8050/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy",...}

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:8050
```

## Quick Test Command

```bash
# One-liner to rebuild and test
docker stop dash-test 2>/dev/null; docker rm dash-test 2>/dev/null; \
docker build -t dash-dashboard . && \
docker run -d --name dash-test -p 8050:8050 -e MAX_WORKERS=4 dash-dashboard && \
sleep 25 && \
curl http://localhost:8050/health && \
echo "" && \
echo "âœ… Dashboard ready at http://localhost:8050"
```

## What Changed

### Dockerfile

- âœ… Added `cmake` to builder stage (for scipy)
- âœ… Added `libgomp1` to runtime stage (for scikit-learn)

### gunicorn.conf.py

- âœ… Capped workers at 8 maximum
- âœ… Prevents resource exhaustion in containers

## Verification Checklist

After rebuild, verify:

- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Container starts and stays running
- [ ] Logs show 4-8 workers (not 33!)
- [ ] No ImportError for libgomp
- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Dashboard loads in browser
- [ ] Can select tools and sources
- [ ] Graphs render correctly

---

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild now:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t dash-dashboard .
   ```

2. **Run container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name dash-test -p 8050:8050 -e MAX_WORKERS=4 dash-dashboard
   ```

3. **Test:**

   ```bash
   sleep 20
   curl http://localhost:8050/health
   open http://localhost:8050
   ```

4. **If successful, deploy to Dokploy!**
