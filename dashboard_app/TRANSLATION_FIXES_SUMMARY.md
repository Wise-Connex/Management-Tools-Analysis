# Translation Fixes Summary

## Overview

Additional translation fixes were implemented to improve the bilingual user experience in the Management Tools Analysis Dashboard. These fixes address two specific issues raised during testing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bain Source Names Translation

**Problem**: When displaying in English, Bain source names were not properly translated from Spanish to English.

**Solution**: Updated the `translate_source_name` function in `translations.py` to include comprehensive mappings for Bain source names:

#### Updated Mappings:

- `Bain - Usabilidad` â†’ `Bain - Usability`
- `Bain Usabilidad` â†’ `Bain Usability`
- `Bain - SatisfacciÃ³n` â†’ `Bain - Satisfaction`
- `Bain SatisfacciÃ³n` â†’ `Bain Satisfaction`
- `BAIN_Ind_Usabilidad` â†’ `Bain - Usability`
- `BAIN_Ind_SatisfacciÃ³n` â†’ `Bain - Satisfaction`

#### Code Changes:

```python
# Translation mapping for source names
source_translations = {
    'Bain - Usabilidad': 'Bain - Usability',
    'Bain Usabilidad': 'Bain Usability',
    'Bain - SatisfacciÃ³n': 'Bain - Satisfaction',
    'Bain SatisfacciÃ³n': 'Bain Satisfaction',
    'BAIN_Ind_Usabilidad': 'Bain - Usability',
    'BAIN_Ind_SatisfacciÃ³n': 'Bain - Satisfaction'
}
```

### 2. Regression Equation Types Translation

**Problem**: The regression analysis graph displayed equation types (Linear, Quadratic, etc.) in Spanish regardless of the selected language.

**Solution**: Updated the regression analysis callback in `app.py` to use translated equation types based on the selected language.

#### Code Changes:

```python
# Before (hardcoded Spanish):
degree_names = ['Lineal', 'CuadrÃ¡tica', 'CÃºbica', 'CuÃ¡rtica']

# After (translated based on language):
degree_names = [get_text('linear', language), get_text('quadratic', language),
              get_text('cubic', language), get_text('quartic', language)]

# Also translated the data points label:
name=get_text('data_points', language)  # Instead of hardcoded 'Datos'
```

## Testing

Created `test_translation_fixes.py` to verify both fixes:

1. **Bain Source Names Test**:

   - Verifies Spanish names remain unchanged in Spanish mode
   - Verifies proper English translation in English mode
   - Verifies other sources remain unchanged

2. **Regression Equation Types Test**:
   - Verifies correct Spanish translations
   - Verifies correct English translations

Test Results:

```
âœ… Bain source name translations verified successfully!
âœ… Regression equation type translations verified successfully!
ðŸŽ‰ All translation fixes verified successfully!
```

## Impact

These fixes improve the bilingual user experience by:

1. Ensuring consistent English translations for Bain source names across all displays
2. Providing properly translated regression equation types in the regression analysis graph
3. Using accurate academic terminology ("Doctoral Candidate" instead of "Principal Investigator")
4. Maintaining full functionality in both Spanish and English modes

## Files Modified

1. `dashboard_app/translations.py`:

   - Updated `translate_source_name` function with comprehensive Bain source name mappings

2. `dashboard_app/app.py`:

   - Updated regression analysis callback to use translated equation types
   - Updated data points label to use translation

3. `dashboard_app/test_translation_fixes.py`:
   - New test file to verify the translation fixes

## Documentation

- This summary document provides a comprehensive overview of the fixes
- Test file demonstrates the expected behavior
- No changes needed to the production branch (changes are in the bilingual branch)

## Deployment Notes

1. The fixes have been tested and verified
2. All translations work correctly in both Spanish and English modes
3. The bilingual dashboard is ready for deployment
4. No changes needed to the production branch
