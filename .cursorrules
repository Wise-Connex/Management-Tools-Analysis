**Key Directories:**

- **prompts/**: Contains all system and analysis prompts
- **data/**: Handles data storage and processing
- **analysis/**: Core analysis functionality
- **utils/**: Helper functions and utilities
- **output/**: Generated reports and translations
- **tests/**: Test files and test data

**Note:** Each directory should maintain a clear separation of concerns and include appropriate documentation.

### 3. Naming Conventions

- **Rationale:** Consistent naming improves code readability and maintainability. Follow these conventions:

  - **Directories:** `lowercase_with_underscores` (e.g., `components`, `user_management`) - _Python standard (PEP 8)_
  - **Modules/Files (Python):** `lowercase_with_underscores.py` (e.g., `user_form.py`, `database_utils.py`) - _Python standard (PEP 8)_
  - **Utility Files:** `lowercase_with_underscores.py` (e.g., `form_validator.py`) - _Python standard (PEP 8)_
  - **Specific Imports:** Favor explicit imports over wildcard imports.
    - _Example:_ `from models.order import Order, OrderStatus` (Import specific classes/functions)
    - _Avoid:_ `import models.order` (accessing via `models.order.Order` is less clear)

### 4. Python Coding Style & Best Practices

- **Protocols for Structural Typing:** Utilize `typing.Protocol` for defining structural contracts.
- **Constants as Objects:** Prefer constant objects (uppercase variables, classes) over enums for simple constants. Use `typing.Literal` for type hinting.
- **Type Hints in Functions:** Use comprehensive type hints for function parameters and return values.
- **Strict Types for Data:** Employ rigorous type hints, `TypedDict`, and consider data validation libraries (Pydantic, Marshmallow) for data integrity.
- **Absolute Imports:** Use absolute imports exclusively for project files.
- **Minimal `try/except`:** Use `try/except` blocks only when necessary for specific error handling. Let exceptions propagate otherwise. Catch specific exception types.
- **Explicit Return Type Hints:** Always include return type hints (e.g., `-> str`, `-> None`).
- **Pure Functions (`def` keyword):** Use `def` for defining pure functions to enhance clarity.
- **Pythonic Conditionals:** Write concise conditionals, avoid unnecessary parentheses.

### 5. Code Comments - Importance and Usage

- **Mandatory Code Commenting (Emphasis on Clarity):** **Always add comments to your Python code.** Code comments are **essential** for code readability, maintainability, and understanding the logic, especially in complex Flask applications. Comments serve as documentation within the code itself and are crucial for collaboration, debugging, and future modifications.

- **Rationale for Comments:**

  - **Improved Readability:** Comments explain the _intent_ and _purpose_ of code, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand.
  - **Enhanced Maintainability:** Well-commented code is significantly easier to maintain, modify, and debug over time. Comments reduce the cognitive load required to understand the code's functionality.
  - **Documentation within Code:** Comments act as a form of inline documentation, providing context and explanations directly where they are needed.
  - **Collaboration Facilitation:** Comments are vital for team collaboration, enabling developers to understand each other's code more efficiently.

- **When to Add Comments (Prioritize Clarity in Complex Areas):** Add comments liberally, especially in the following situations:

  - **Complex Logic:** For any code section that implements complex algorithms, intricate business logic, or non-trivial control flow. Explain the steps, reasoning, and approach.
  - **Non-Obvious Code:** When code might not be immediately clear in its purpose or functionality to someone reading it for the first time. Clarify the intent and behavior.
  - **API Interactions:** When interacting with external APIs, databases, or libraries. Comment on the purpose of the interaction, data formats, expected responses, and error handling strategies.
  - **Design Decisions and Rationale:** For significant design choices or architectural patterns implemented in the code. Explain _why_ a particular approach was chosen.
  - **Tricky or Edge Cases:** When handling edge cases, unusual input scenarios, or potential pitfalls. Document the specific cases being addressed and the handling logic.
  - **Configuration and Setup:** In configuration files or setup code, comment on the purpose of different settings and parameters.
  - **Regular Functions and Methods:** Include docstrings for all functions and methods to explain their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions they might raise.

- **What to Comment (Focus on Intent and Context):** Focus on providing comments that explain:

  - **Purpose:** What is the goal of this code section or function? What problem does it solve?
  - **Logic:** Briefly describe the algorithm or approach used. Explain the steps involved.
  - **Assumptions:** Document any assumptions made by the code (e.g., expected input types, data formats, preconditions).
  - **Limitations:** Note any known limitations, edge cases not handled, or potential areas for improvement.
  - **Usage:** For functions and methods, explain how to use them, what parameters to provide, and what to expect as a result.

- **Discouraging Comment Removal (Preserve Documentation):** **Do not delete comments unless it is absolutely and demonstrably necessary.** Comments should be considered a valuable part of the codebase and should be preserved. Before removing a comment, carefully consider:

  - **Is the comment truly redundant and adding no value?** Often, comments provide context that might not be immediately obvious from the code itself.
  - **Will removing the comment reduce code readability or maintainability in any way?** Err on the side of caution and keep comments unless there is a compelling reason to remove them.
  - **If you believe a comment is outdated or incorrect, update it rather than deleting it.**

- **Types of Comments in Python:** Utilize both types of Python comments effectively:
  - **Docstrings (`"""Docstring goes here"""`):** Use docstrings for documenting modules, classes, functions, and methods. Docstrings are used for generating documentation and are accessible at runtime using `help()` and `__doc__` attributes. Follow PEP 257 for docstring conventions.
  - **Inline Comments (`# This is an inline comment`):** Use inline comments for explaining specific lines of code, complex expressions, or short notes within functions or methods. Keep inline comments concise and focused.

### 6. State Management

- **Flask Session/Server-Side State:** For global application state, use Flask's session or server-side state management (database, in-memory storage).
- **Cleanup Mechanisms:** Implement proper resource cleanup (database connections, file handles, timers) in Python functions and Flask route handlers using `try...finally` or context managers.

### 7. Syntax & Formatting

- **Jinja Templating:** Use Jinja templates for declarative UI in Flask.
- **Data Classes/`typing.Union` for Messages:** Define message structures using Python data classes or `typing.Union` for type safety.

### 8. UI & Styling

- **Bootstrap CSS:** Primary CSS framework for styling.
- **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI:** Utilize for modern UI components and utility classes where appropriate.
- **Bootstrap Integration:** Integrate Bootstrap CSS in Flask templates (CDN or static files).
- **Material Design Guidelines:** Consider Material Design principles for UI consistency and user-friendliness.
- **Document Bootstrap Usage:** Document how Bootstrap components are used and customized in templates.

### 9. Error Handling (UI/UX focused)

- **Error Boundaries:** Implement error boundaries to prevent application crashes.
- **Error Logging:** Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring.
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Provide clear and informative error messages to users.
- **Graceful Network Failure Handling:** Implement robust handling of network errors.

### 10. Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for utilities, models, and components.
- **E2E Tests:** Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test across different browsers and browser versions.
- **Performance & Memory Testing:** Conduct tests for memory usage and performance optimization.

### 11. Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS attacks. Configure headers in Flask to control resources the browser is allowed to load.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Use Flask middleware or decorators to set CSP headers.
- **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate **all** user inputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, etc.).
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Utilize libraries like WTForms for form validation. Employ parameterized queries in SQLAlchemy to prevent SQL Injection. Escape HTML output in Jinja templates to prevent XSS.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Beyond CSP, implement robust output encoding in Jinja templates.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Jinja2 auto-escaping is enabled by default, ensure it remains active and is used correctly. Be cautious with `Markup` and `safe` filters.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** Enable CSRF protection to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Flask-WTF provides CSRF protection. Enable it and handle CSRF tokens in forms and AJAX requests.
- **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Use Flask-Login for authentication. Define clear roles and permissions and enforce them in Flask routes using decorators or custom logic.
- **Session Security:** Configure Flask sessions for security.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Use `session` object in Flask. Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` flags. Consider using a secure session store (e.g., Redis, database-backed sessions) for production.
- **Password Handling:** Handle passwords securely.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ **Never store passwords in plain text.** Use Bcrypt (as listed in your tech stack) via Werkzeug or Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing. Implement secure password reset mechanisms.
- **Secure File Uploads:** Implement secure handling of file uploads to prevent vulnerabilities like path traversal and malicious file execution.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Validate file types, sizes, and extensions. Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root. Sanitize filenames. Consider using libraries for secure file handling.
- **Dependency Management & Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly audit and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Use `pip` and `requirements.txt` for dependency management. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `pip-audit`, `safety`) to identify and update vulnerable packages.
- **Error Handling and Information Leakage:** Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Implement custom error handlers in Flask to log detailed errors securely but return generic, user-friendly error messages to the client. Disable debug mode in production.
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS):** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Configure your Flask application to run over HTTPS. Obtain and configure SSL/TLS certificates.
- **CORS Handling:** Implement correct Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies if your Flask application needs to interact with frontend applications on different domains.
  - _Flask Implementation:_ Use Flask-CORS extension to configure CORS headers properly. Be restrictive in CORS policies, allowing only necessary origins and methods.
- **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

- **DO NOT STOP WORKING** until task is done, feature is implemented completely and problem is solved
- **Reasoning paragraphs** start by writing 3 reasoning paragraphs analyzing the problem and the solution. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. You should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty, and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.
- **DO NOT DELETE COMMENTS**
- **Summary of current state** start by writing a summary of the current state of the project, what is done, what is not done, what is in progress, what is not in progress. Do not include any asumptions or theories, just the facts
- **Before you answer** Write two detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of this solutions - do not jump to conclusions, seriously consider both approaches. Them after you finish, tell me wheter one of these solutions is obviously better than the other, and why.
- **Proper search query format** When peroform a web search, your task is to write a one-paragraph search query, as if you were telling a human researcher what to find, including all tghe relevant context. Format the paragraph as clear instructions, commanding a researcher to find the answer. Ask for code snippets or technicals details when relevant
- **Avoid huge refactors**
- **Update requirements.txt** If you need to install a new package, or deprecated a package installed, or any other update, please update also the requirements.txt file to reflect the changes.
